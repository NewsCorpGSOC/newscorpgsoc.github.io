Israel’s Wars Repeat The 1980s On Steroids – Analysis	Appalled by Israel’s carpet bombing of Beirut during the 1982 Lebanon war, United States President Ronald Reagan didn’t mince words with then-Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin. 'I was angry. I told him it had to stop, or our entire future relationship was endangered. I used the word holocaust deliberately & said the symbol of his war was becoming a picture of a 7-month-old baby with its arms blown off,' Reagan noted in his diary. The August 1982 phone call between Reagan and Begin provides a template for the US’s ability to twist Israel’s arm and the limits of the Western giant’s influence. Begin wasted no time in halting his saturation bombing of the Lebanese capital in response to Reagan’s threat. Yet, he rejected the president’s demand that he allow an international force to enter Beirut to protect the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in the Israeli-besieged city. His refusal had dire consequences. A month later, at least 800 Palestinians, many of them women and children, were massacred in their homes in Sabra and Shatila in West Beirut by Lebanese Christian gunmen under the watchful eyes of the Israeli military. Public outrage in Israel forced Begin to resign, ending his career. Biden failed where Reagan succeeded More than four decades later, US President Joe Biden understood the stakes when Israel went to war in response to Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. He also knew the levers of power at his disposal after test-driving Reagan’s approach in 2021. At the time, Biden, like his predecessor, picked up the phone to read Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the riot act. As a new book on Biden, The Last Politician, describes, it was his fourth phone call to the Israeli leader in ten days in which behind-the-scenes diplomacy and cajoling failed to end fighting between Israel and Hamas. The president advised him that he 'expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire.' When Netanyahu sought to buy time, Biden replied: 'Hey man, we’re out of runway here. It’s over.' Netanyahu and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire a day later. Even so, he knew then and now that he had less to worry about than Begin did with the Reagan presidency. In contrast to Reagan’s administration, which allowed the United Nations Security Council to pass 21 resolutions criticizing, if not condemning, Israel’s policies, Biden gave Israel blanket diplomatic cover and provided it with arms. With these, it could prosecute wars that make 1982 pale in comparison. Biden’s test-driving of Reagan’s template, familiarity with the Israeli interventions in Lebanon and annexationist policies in the 1980s and beyond, coupled with his predecessor’s willingness to confront Begin in the 1982 war leave the president with little excuse for refusing to rein Israel in over the past year. Biden’s failure has tangibly devastating consequences for the Palestinians and yet to materialize fallouts for Israelis and the rest of the Middle East. These will haunt the region for a generation, if not more. Like Begin, Biden will likely see his legacy sullied by Israeli conduct on the Middle East’s battlefields. Historic destruction may only increase A heated encounter with Begin during the 1982 war, which involved finger jabbing and fists pounding on a table, spotlights Biden’s lack of an excuse. Echoing Reagan, Biden warned Begin that Israeli settlement policy could cost it US support. In response, Begin snapped, 'I am not a Jew with trembling knees.' Forty-two years later, Biden studiously ignores the fact that Israel’s latest Gaza and Lebanon wars are a repeat of the early 1980s on steroids. Begin created the template for Israel’s systematic targeting of militants irrespective of the risk to civilians with the 1981 bombing of Fakhani. This densely populated Beirut neighborhood was home to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and its affiliates. The bombing destroyed a seven-story building and damaged four nearby structures, killing some 90 people and wounding hundreds of others. In a letter to Reagan, written during Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Begin compared the carpet bombing of Beirut to the Allied destruction of Berlin during World War II. 'I feel as a prime minister empowered to instruct a valiant army facing ‘Berlin’ where, amongst innocent civilians, Hitler and his henchmen hide in a bunker deep beneath the surface,' Begin said. Begin’s equation of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and his organization with Adolf Hitler and his associates, like Netanyahu equating Hamas with the Nazis, served to justify civilian casualties in operations that were as much about targeting fighters as they were designed to incite the local population against the militants. 'In certain cases, the Israeli shelling and bombing were carefully targeted, sometimes on the basis of good intelligence. All too often, however, that was not the case. Scores of eight-to twelve-story apartment buildings were destroyed… Many of the buildings that were levelled…had no plausible military utility,' recalled historian Rashid Khalidi, who lived in Beirut at the time of the 1982 bombings. The strategy produced mixed results but, on balance, hardened rather than weakened popular resistance to Israeli policies. There is little reason to believe that the impact of Israel’s current wars will be any different. Israel has already prepared the ground by turning Gaza into what onetime Australian human rights commissioner and United Nations rapporteur Chris Sidoti calls a 'terrorism creation factory.'

Ishiba’s Shaky Ground Further Upset By Tremors Of A Trump Preside...	By Yukari Easton Donald Trump is now president-elect, and his ‘America First’ nationalist vision has returned. Japan, which counts the United States as its sole security ally, must prepare for a second Trump term. Judging from his first term, during which the United States withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the Open Skies Treaty and the Iranian nuclear agreement, Trump will likely further advance this isolationism. With his penchant for dictatorial power and his aversion to international institutions, the United States’ commitment to its allies now looks uncertain. Similarly tenuous are the United States’ bilateral agreements, such as the longstanding US–Japan Security Treaty. Europeans are already looking elsewhere. French President Emanuel Macron asked rhetorically, ‘Donald Trump was elected by Americans to defend the interests of Americans. Are we ready to defend the interests of Europeans?’. Seeing the United States deviate from its long-established security orthodoxy, some allies no longer wish to leave their security in the hands of US swing-state voters. But the alternative that Macron suggests for Europe is not an option for Japan, which is not a part of a strong and self-reliant multilateral defense alliance. Trump’s criticisms of Japan were not, in the past, followed by action. But his complaints were unnerving enough to motivate the late prime minister Shinzo Abe to become the first foreign leader to visit the then president-elect in 2016. Trump had been attacking the US–Japan Security Treaty as unfair and suggested Japan and South Korea should have their own nuclear capabilities. Managing Trump became critical. One of Abe’s tactics was to court an uninformed and impressionable Trump by staging ‘closeness’ through assiduously manufactured golf-buddy antics. But at the time Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba criticised Abe, declaring, ‘There’s no need to play golf with President Trump or go to Trump Tower. It’s important to present Japan as a formidable threat and to have a bargaining chip at the ready’. It remains to be seen whether Ishiba will deal with the Trump administration more effectively as prime minister. So far, he has not been able to procure more than a five-minute congratulatory telephone call. The Ishiba administration has been in a precarious position since taking power in October 2024. Shortly thereafter, Ishiba dissolved the lower house in an epic miscalculation, which led to the Liberal Democratic Party coalition falling short of a majority for the first time in 15 years. Some of Ishiba’s problems can be traced back to playing politics without clear goals coupled with some bewildering choices, such as controversial appointments, revisiting the fringe and destabilising concept of an Asian NATO and delaying the critical active cyber defence bill, an act of political vandalism without any obvious payoff. All of this exhibits a detachment from issues of importance. Meanwhile, Trump’s cabinet nominations are progressing. Senator Marco Rubio for Secretary of State is curious but, so far, one of the more normal appointments. Serving as a ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the East Asian and Pacific Affairs subcommittee for many years, Rubio has an understanding of what foreign relations entail. He has been a strong supporter of US alliances, describing the US–Japan and US–South Koreaalliances as ‘pillars’ of US policy. His support of NATO has been steadfast, and his work led to a provision in the Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act limiting a US president’s power to leave NATO without Senate approval or an act of Congress. This pre-emptive safeguard was viewed as necessary after Trump encouraged Russia to ‘do whatever the hell they want’ to supposedly ‘delinquent’ NATO members. That said, even if confirmed, Rubio’s pro-alliance stance might vanish without Trump’s acquiescence, as did his prior support for Ukraine. With his stranglehold over the Republican Party, the constraints seen in Trump’s first term will be absent. Trump’s strong isolationist tendencies, coupled with a cavalier attitude that does not distinguish allies from foes or dictatorships from democracies, make the United States an unreliable partner. Notably, the president-elect is openly opposed to the security concerns raised by his former vice president Mike Pence, secretaries of defense Jim Mattis and Mark Esper, and national security advisors HR McMaster and John Bolton. Trump’s soon-to-be-dropped federal indictments include the misappropriation of top-secret documents, including those relating to the United States’ nuclear programs. Japan must now take more responsibility for its national security. Wishful thinking will not remove the dark cloud hanging over the US–Japan alliance. But Ishiba may not be capable of becoming a leader who executes a new foreign policy and national security approach. A worst case scenario for Japan would be that, with conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine and increasing tensions over Taiwan, Trump’s transactional disposition pushes him towards Faustian bargains with the United States’ adversaries. The extent to which Trump will change Asian foreign policy is unknown. What is known is that Ishiba has a daunting task ahead of him in preparing for an atypical, volatile and unpredictable US presidency while simultaneously managing a fragile and unpopular coalition government. Ishiba’s foreign policy weaknesses will only become more apparent as Japan prepares to work with the new president-elect. There are distressing times ahead.

How China Hopes To Kickstart Its Flagging Economy – Analysis	By Kitty Wang China has announced it will loosen its monetary policy to boost the economy, in a move that echoes steps taken in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis. The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, will use a slew of different policy tools to boost the money supply — a move often criticized as 'printing money' — including government debt and changes to interest rates and the amount of reserves it requires banks to hold. The ruling Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo announced the move on Tuesday following a top-level economic meeting on Monday, state news agency Xinhua reported. 'After more than 10 years, the monetary policy orientation has been changed to ‘moderately loose’ again ... sending a positive signal that will effectively boost the confidence of all parties and help China’s economy recover and improve,' it quoted the meeting as saying. It said 'moderately loose' means a 'reasonable money supply, low interest rates, and a relatively loose monetary and credit environment' to boost investment and consumption. What is the point of the policy change? According to the Politburo, the aim is to 'maintain a reasonable abundance of liquidity, reduce the comprehensive financing costs of enterprises and residents, and provide financial support for the continued recovery of the economy.' In other words, the central bank will make it easier for institutions and individuals to borrow money, increasing the amount of money in the system and, if successful, business confidence along with it. Lack of confidence in China’s economic future, particularly after the three-year zero-COVID policy emptied local government coffers and burst the property bubble, has been frequently cited as the main reason behind a mass exodus of people and companies. Experts say the move is also a bid to forestall the impact of 60% tariffs on Chinese goods that president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose on taking office. Party leader Xi Jinping has also signaled that he wants to shift China’s economy away from its dependence on exports by boosting domestic consumption. But economists have warned that the government’s growth figures don’t represent the true scale of damage done to the economy, and to confidence generally. How will it work in practice? The government has also said it will combine a looser monetary policy with a 'more active' fiscal stance. That means boosting government spending, particularly on infrastructure projects, a path that has been taken by Xi’s predecessors in response to external shocks. 'More active fiscal policy usually means more active fiscal expenditure, with the government vigorously building bridges and roads to support economic construction and improve people’s lives,' state-run China Radio International’s Voice of China said in a commentary published on Wednesday. 'Under the premise that the government’s fiscal revenue is basically stable, the essence of a more active fiscal policy is actually to increase the fiscal deficit rate, issue more treasury bonds, and expand fiscal spending,' it said. Wasn’t everyone expecting this to happen in September? Chinese stock markets have surged and fallen on hopes of a massive fiscal stimulus package that was initially expected in September, and then again after subsequent high-level economic meetings in recent months. The central bank did cut some interest rates and the government started selling ultra-long bonds as part of a massive 1 trillion yuan (US$138 billion) package. But the measures were nowhere near the levels that markets had been hoping for, with many commentators speculating about a possible fiscal stimulus package along the lines of the one launched by former President Hu Jintao and his Premier Wen Jiabao that kickstarted the Chinese economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. U.S.-based economic commentator Zheng Xuguang said the latest policy change could be much closer to that package. 'This approach means that the central government will rescue the markets and local governments, and stimulate investment and consumption using this active fiscal and looser monetary policy,' Zheng told RFA Mandarin in a recent interview. How did this turn out in the past? Wen is credited with pumping new life into the economy with a massive stimulus program worth 4 trillion yuan (US$586 billion). But critics say the Hu administration’s approach is at least partly responsible for the massive increase in government debt, rampant inflation and the now-collapsed property bubble that China faces today. According to Zheng Xuguang, this is akin to 'quenching one’s thirst with poison.' 'All the central government can do is take action to rescue real estate prices and ease local debts, which could be very damaging in the form of inflation,' he said. Xie Tian, ​​a professor at the Aiken School of Business at the University of South Carolina, said the move means Beijing has abandoned its formerly conservative approach to printing money. 'The only option they have left is to continue printing money at great risk, including the risk of losing power. There is really no other way forward,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI6ywLSsKTxKC	2024-12-11T16:56:21-08:00	
Who’s Afraid Of George Soros? – OpEd	The raging controversy over the Bharatiya Janata Party’s allegation that the Congress Party leadership is hand in glove with the famous US financier George Soros with an infamous track record of funding the colour revolutions and regime change projects is snowballing. Congress Party may use the floor of the parliament to fuel its public tirades against the government, borne out of the proverbial folklore of Kerala, 'Whether the leaf falls on a thorn or a thorn on a leaf, the leaf is always harmed.' Congress calculates that the Modi government and the BJP would be the losers if this controversy remains in focus. These are early days and how all this pans out is hard to tell, as there are many variables in play. Look at the reticence of the SP and TMC, for instance, to wade into the Adani file. Besides, BJP is a peerless champion for diversionary tactics in Indian politics. From foreign policy angle, the outcome of the slugfest between India’s two mainstream parties, is going to depend on an 'X' factor, namely, George Soros’ clout with the incoming US administration and the attitude of President Donald Trump toward the Deep State’s advancement of a regime change agenda in Delhi as happened in Bangladesh. The BJP has quietly backtracked from its spokesman’s accusation at the press conference in New Delhi on December 6 that 'It has always been the US State Department behind this agenda'. The BJP National Spokesperson and MP Dr. Sambit Patra directly accused the US State Department of trying to 'destabilise India' and claimed that the US 'deep state' is working to 'target Prime Minister Narendra Modi'. 'The Deep State had a clear objective to destabilise India by targeting Prime Minister Modi,' the BJP spokesman reportedly said. In fact, he anchored on the Deep State and the US State Department the BJP’s entire case of Rahul Gandhi being a 'traitor of the highest order' and of Congress 'conspiring with foreign forces' to derail the government because of their 'hatred' for Modi. The BJP demanded on the floor of the parliament that Rahul Gandhi ought to be thoroughly investigated for meeting with the controversial business tycoon George Soros and some other American officials during his periodic visits to the US who have 'a history of peddling anti-India agenda'. Of course, this is an explosive charge that could only have been made with clearance (or instructions) from the highest echelons of the BJP and possibly the government. Surprisingly, however, the BJP subsequently censored the above remarks from its lengthy press release on Dr. Patra’s remarks. The bulk of the corporate media also followed suit with self-censorship, a few exceptions apart. Such backtracking doesn’t behoove India’s ruling party or our media honchos. It smacks of faint-heartedness and lack of resolve. This is happening despite the well-known fact that Soros indeed has a long history of acting as the frontman of the US State Department in its regime change projects abroad. Organisations such as Soros’ Open Society Foundations (founded in 1984) or National Endowment for Democracy (founded in 1983) are to be seen as the US government’s 'white gloves' for instigating colour revolutions to subvert state power in other countries; cultivating pro-US forces in target countries; misrepresenting the human rights situation in other countries; manipulating and interfering in other countries’ elections; inciting division and confrontation to undermine the stability of other countries; and, fabricating false information to mislead public opinion, using 'academic activities' as a cloak for interference and infiltration. This is a complex story on which Professor Sreeram Chaulia, at the O.P. Jindal Global University, had written a well-researched essay titled Democratisation, NGOs and 'colour revolutions' way back in 2006. By the way, Soros is also a globalist by conviction who genuinely subscribes the neocon ideology. He has given to the Foundations over $32 billion of a personal fortune made in the financial markets. The Foundations are estimated to have $25 billion in assets last year, and amongst worldwide activities, they prioritise 'the current challenges … of the rise of new forms of authoritarianism' in foreign countries. Will Trump put Soros out of business? This seems to be the assumption in Delhi, which is predicated on the antipathy between Trump and Soros who had close links with the Democratic Party — and, conversely, on Trump’s jovial attitude toward Modi. Soros is a formidable adversary who has reportedly earmarked one billion dollars for a regime change in India. He views regime changes not simply as a neocon pastime but also as a business proposition. In Ukraine, where he funded the Maidan protests and regime change in 2014, he is investing to generate lucrative business (here and here) No doubt, what remains to be seen is how Trump sees Soros going forward. It is a complicated story, as Soros has his line open to Trump’s inner circle. There are some straws in the wind. Basically, Trump is a dealmaker who has no permanent friends or allies — or enemies, for that matter. The salience of Trump’s one hour twenty-six minutes long interviewwith NBC News on Sunday, his first after the election victory, is that while he may harshly deal with those officials who misused their authority under President Biden’s watch to harass him, humiliate him and hunt him down, he hopes to work with the Democratic Party lawmakers in the Congress to carry forward his agenda. Trump acknowledged the criticality of bipartisan support to make the required constitutional amendments in regard of immigration laws. He even paid tribute to the left wing constituency who voted for him. Significantly, Alex Soros, son of George Soros, had generously contributed to Kamala Harris’ chest, but has since paid a fulsome compliment to Trump. He wrote on X: 'Too many Democrats are fighting each other over campaign tactics, because it is easier than accepting that Trump was underestimated as a candidate. He was a 'super candidate' with increasing appeal to a broader electorate — likely beyond the reach of both Democrats and Republicans.' Interestingly, Elon Musk also responded by calling himself the 'George Soros of the middle. I don’t want the pendulum to swing too far right, but right now it’s just too far left.' The bottom line is that Trump has made a thoughtful decision to tap Scott Bessent for the crucial cabinet position of Treasury Secretary. Bessent’s credentials include his stint on a small team at Soros’ investment firm through the 1980s that in 1992 helped 'break' the Bank of England with crushing trades against the British pound, having amassed a $10 billion bet that the pound was overvalued. The New York Times reported, 'Though the British government tried to support the currency, it wasn’t able to withstand the pressure, and the pound plunged in value. Mr. Soros’s fund earned more than $1 billion, along with credit (and infamy) for orchestrating one of Wall Street’s most audacious trades.' Now, there’s nothing Trump loves more than Wall Street’s seductive success stories. Times wrote, 'it was Mr. Bessent’s experience at Mr. Soros’s fund — including another high-profile bet, against the Japanese yen — that helped define his career, and that his former colleagues and other associates see as a crucial credential' for the cabinet job as Treasury Secretary. And now comes the news that Trump has picked a California lawyer Harmeet Kaur Dhillon to head the US justice Department’s civil rights division and nominated her as assistant attorney-general, who, apparently, empathises with pro-Khalistan activists in the US and Canada. Do not underestimate the ingenuity of the Deep State in America to have its way. Keeping the guard down will be a catastrophic mistake on the part of Delhi establishment. We could get hit when least expected. That’s what happened in Syria and Bangladesh. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, as they say. Make no mistake, at the end of the day, Trump is a great patriot and nationalist who stands by 'America First' as his chosen dictum. An equal relationship based on mutual respect is impossible to forge with the US.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI9iqvhxE--L4	2024-12-11T16:54:49-08:00	
Romania’s Electoral Crisis: A Blueprint For Defending Democracy –...	By Antonia Colibasanu What Happened in Romania? (FPRI) -- The Romanian presidential election of 2024 faced significant controversy, culminating in its annulment due to confirmed foreign interference. The first round, held on November 24, 2024, saw independent candidate Călin Georgescu leading with 23 percent of the vote, followed closely by Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union (USR) with 19 percent. However, shortly after the election, irregularities surfaced, prompting President Klaus Iohannis to convene the Supreme Council of National Defense (CSAT) on November 27 to address potential election cyber interference. Intelligence reports—declassified after the Supreme Council of National Defense (CSAT) was held—indicated unusual activity on social media platforms, particularly TikTok, raising concerns about external manipulation. At the same time, considering that Georgescu was virtually unknown before the elections on November 24 with no opinion poll suggesting that he would take a top position and claims that the vote may have been fraud, the Constitutional Court ordered a recount of ballots. However, the recount confirmed the initial results, validating Georgescu and Lasconi’s advancement to the runoff scheduled for December 8. However, by December 4, the situation took a dramatic turn when President Iohannis declassified intelligence reports that suggested aggressive hybrid attacks conducted by a 'foreign state' targeting the elections. These attacks included coordinated misinformation campaigns on social media and cyberattacks aimed at influencing public opinion in Georgescu’s favor. Soon after the reports were released, the foreign actor was confirmed to be Russia. In light of these findings, the Constitutional Court annulled the first-round results on December 6, citing Article 50, paragraph 3, of Romania’s electoral law, which allows for annulment if significant fraud or interference likely impacts the election’s outcome. The court ruled that the documented Russian interference met this threshold, rendering the results invalid and mandating a rerun of the electoral process. The annulment decision was met with criticism from both Georgescu and Lasconi who viewed it as undermining democratic processes. Despite these objections, the court’s ruling is final, and preparations are underway to reschedule the presidential election. In the interim, President Iohannis remains in office until a new election is conducted. The Questions Brought Forward The recent events in the Romanian electoral process highlight two unprecedented actions taken by institutions in a democratic country. First, it is the first time that an intelligence agency report on a foreign actor’s interference in the election process was issued before the electoral process was finished and declassified for the public during the electoral process. This led to the second unprecedented action: the annulment of the elections and the restart of the electoral process for the presidential elections. All of this leads to a series of immediate questions. The first question to address, from a geopolitical standpoint, refers to whether Russia could indeed have reasons to interfere in the Romanian electoral process at this moment. What does Russia have to gain? Russia’s strategic goal of undermining the West is intricately tied to its objective of fragmenting the European Union (EU) and NATO, two pillars of Western cohesion and security. To achieve this, Russia employs hybrid warfare tailored to exploit the specific vulnerabilities of individual member states. In countries heavily dependent on Russian energy, Moscow leverages economic blackmail, using gas and oil supplies as tools of coercion to influence political decisions and foster divisions within the EU. Conversely, in nations with less reliance on Russian energy, the Kremlin focuses on disinformation and propaganda campaigns. These campaigns often employ messages that resonate deeply with the public, even when they are unrelated to Ukraine or Russia’s actions. Instead, the messages exacerbate dissatisfaction with domestic governments, weaken trust in institutions, and undermine support for common NATO and EU policies. By amplifying sensitive issues such as economic hardships, social inequalities, or controversial policy decisions, Russia seeks to erode public support for pro-Ukraine stances and disrupt the unity required for coordinated Western actions. This multifaceted approach highlights Russia’s adaptability and determination to exploit divisions and vulnerabilities to achieve its broader geopolitical objectives. Romania holds a critical position on NATO’s Eastern Flank, serving as a strategic buffer against potential threats from Russia and acting as a key ally in securing the Black Sea region. As a frontline state, Romania hosts important NATO military infrastructure, including missile defense systems, and contributes significantly to regional security through its robust support for NATO initiatives and Ukraine’s defense efforts. This geostrategic importance makes Romania a natural target for Russia’s hybrid campaigns. By undermining Romanian public confidence in the government and eroding support for NATO and EU policies, Russia aims to weaken the cohesion of the Eastern Flank and disrupt the alliance’s ability to respond effectively to security challenges. Moreover, Romania’s commitment to diversifying energy and reducing dependence on Russian supplies further threatens Russia’s leverage in the region. A pivotal component of this strategy is the Neptun Deep project, the largest natural gas initiative in Romania’s Black Sea sector. Jointly developed by OMV Petrom and Romgaz, Neptun Deep is expected to commence production in 2027, with an estimated annual output of approximately eight billion cubic meters of natural gas, positioning Romania as a significant energy producer and potential exporter within the EU. This development enhances Romania’s energy security and diminishes Russia’s influence over regional energy markets, challenging its traditional role as the primary supplier. Consequently, Russia perceives Romania’s energy ambitions as a direct threat to its strategic interests, intensifying its efforts to destabilize the country through hybrid warfare tactics. These factors explain why Russia has consistently maintained its influence operations targeting the Romanian public over the past two decades, employing themes that resonate deeply with the local population. One of the most prominent narratives has been centered around keeping Romanian natural resources in the hands of Romanians, a message strategically used to undermine American investments in the country’s oil and gas sector, including projects like Neptun Deep. By supporting the framing of foreign investments as a threat to national sovereignty, Russia has sought to foster public resistance to Western economic involvement. Additionally, Moscow has supported campaigns that appeal to Romania’s Christian nationalist sentiment—a characteristic that many Romanians feel distinguishes them within the EU. This narrative often ties Romania to its Orthodox Christian heritage; although, the Romanian Orthodox Church is officially aligned with Constantinople and frequently at odds with the Russian Church. By tapping into these cultural and religious undercurrents, Russia aims to amplify divisions between Romania and its Western allies, erode trust in foreign partnerships, and solidify its influence in the region. Russia began visibly supporting disinformation campaigns in the early 2000s and significantly escalated its propaganda efforts in Romania after 2016. Since then, articles and social media posts promoting official Russian positions started appearing in Romanian. Most of these messages, though published in Romanian, originated from Moldova (where both Romanian and Russian are spoken), rather than from Romania itself. This reflects Moscow’s caution in directly promoting its narratives within Romania, given the country’s deeply entrenched anti-Russian sentiment. Instead, the disinformation focused on socioeconomic and cultural identity issues that resonate with Romanians, employing subtle tactics to shape public opinion without triggering outright rejection. A clear example of the subtlety in Russian disinformation campaigns has been the effort to undermine support for Ukraine in recent years. One of the key messages promoted by Russian-backed platforms focuses on the false claim that Ukrainian refugee children receive higher financial allocations from the state than Romanian children. This narrative is crafted to fuel resentment and sow division, portraying the government as prioritizing foreign nationals over its own citizens. However, these campaigns deliberately omit the fact that the financial support for Ukrainian refugee children is funded by the EU, not the Romanian government. Romania, as a net beneficiary of EU funds, receives significantly more financial support from the EU than it contributes. (This narrative was further amplified during the presidential campaign of populist candidate Călin Georgescu who used it to tap into economic frustrations and nationalist sentiments. Georgescu also incorporated Christian nationalist symbols into his rhetoric, appealing to voters disillusioned with mainstream politics and those seeking to assert Romania’s cultural and religious identity against perceived external threats.) Given this context, the current events raise an important question: If Russia has been actively supporting disinformation campaigns in Romania for years, why has it chosen to escalate its efforts now? What specific gains does Russia hope to achieve by interfering in Romania’s presidential electoral process at this moment? To address this question, it is essential to consider Russia’s posture in Ukraine, focusing on both its strategic and tactical objectives in the ongoing war. Strategically, Russia aims to bring southern Ukraine, including the vital port city of Odesa, under its occupation, ideally before any negotiation discussions commence. This would ensure that Ukraine is deprived of its most efficient means of trading with the world—access to the Black Sea via Odesa. However, achieving this through military means has proven challenging—it is rather difficult, if not impossible, to do that in a few weeks. Tactically, Russia appears to be pursuing an alternative approach: ensuring that, even if Ukraine retains control of Odesa, it becomes increasingly difficult or impossible for the country to export goods through the Black Sea. This broader strategy highlights Russia’s current focus on Romania, a key Black Sea state and NATO ally. Romania has played a crucial role in supporting Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict by serving as a steadfast ally and a vital logistics hub. Since the war began, Romania has facilitated the transit of military aid and serves as a training hub, including initiatives like F-16 pilot training for Ukrainian forces. Additionally, Romania has donated a Patriot missile system to support Ukraine in the ongoing conflict. In maritime security, Romania has been instrumental in ensuring the safe passage of commercial ships through the Black Sea since the war in Ukraine began. After the Grain Deal was ended, Romania facilitated Ukrainian trade by extending both the Danube and the Black Sea ports facilities and helping secure a new corridor going through its coastal waters and those of Bulgaria. This involves operating a comprehensive network of coastal radars and sensors to monitor maritime activities, deploying advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for patrol and reconnaissance, and securing major ports such as Constanța—a critical hub for NATO logistics and global trade. These efforts underscore Romania’s strategic significance not only in aiding Ukraine but also in bolstering regional stability and supporting NATO’s Eastern Flank during a time of heightened geopolitical tension. All of this supports the theory that Russia has a vested interest in fostering political instability in Romania at this moment, in particular. Such a scenario would disrupt the country’s ability to serve as a reliable logistics hub and ally for Ukraine. Political instability in Romania would weaken its capacity to maintain critical supply chains, aid shipments, and alternative trade routes for Ukraine’s exports, undermining Ukraine’s resilience in the ongoing war. Furthermore, supporting a political candidate in Romania who campaigns on a platform advocating reduced or no involvement in aiding Ukraine, questioning Romania’s commitment to NATO and the EU, and promoting isolationist policies aligns directly with Russian strategic goals. Such a candidate would erode Romania’s role as a cornerstone of NATO’s Eastern Flank, fracture EU and NATO cohesion, and advance Russia’s broader objective of undermining Western alliances and diminishing coordinated resistance to its aggression in Ukraine. The third, and perhaps most important, question is whether Russia’s strategy can succeed within the context of Romania’s national dynamics. This includes Romania’s response to what seems to be an electoral process influenced by Russian interference. After all, it is Romania’s political landscape and the vulnerabilities within its society that have created fertile ground for extremism and Russian propaganda. The answer to this question is complex and requires a multifaceted analysis that considers both immediate and long-term factors. In the short term, the outcomes of recent events, such as the annulment of the election and the steps taken to address Russian interference, will be critical in determining Romania’s ability to maintain political stability and safeguard its democratic processes. These immediate responses will influence public confidence in institutions and the effectiveness of measures to counter disinformation and hybrid threats. However, the long-term implications for Romania’s posture within NATO and the EU must also be considered. Ensuring that Romania remains a resilient and reliable partner in the face of persistent Russian efforts will require sustained investments in institutional capacity and societal resilience. The broader question involves not only how Romania navigates the current crisis but also how it fortifies itself against similar challenges in the future to uphold its strategic role on NATO’s Eastern Flank and as a key ally for Ukraine. But first, there are short-term implications of recent events. The vote for Georgescu and Lasconi reflects a strong antiestablishment sentiment, signaling widespread public distrust in mainstream politics and the institutions perceived to be under their control. While Romanians harbor deep anti-Russian feelings and view Russian aggression as their greatest threat, they also demand clear and credible evidence that the electoral process was influenced or manipulated by Russian interference. Declassified reports from intelligence services, while significant, are insufficient to convince the public, particularly in a country like Romania where trust in the intelligence community remains limited and perceived as part of the establishment. This skepticism stems from historical experiences; during Romania’s communist regime—a system unparalleled in its severity in Eastern Europe and often compared to North Korea—the infamous Securitate, the communist-era intelligence service, was instrumental in maintaining autocratic control. These historical scars make it imperative for Romanian authorities to provide transparent and independently verified proof of electoral interference to restore public confidence in the integrity of the democratic process. Meanwhile, there is significant uncertainty and many unanswered questions about the future of Romanian politics. According to recent statements by President Iohannis, the next government will determine the date for the rescheduled presidential elections. However, the formation of the next government is still in progress, with political negotiations underway. It remains unclear when the presidential vote will be held and whether the recent parliamentary elections were similarly compromised by Russian interference—an issue worth considering, given that an extremist party leveraged Georgescu’s campaign platform to secure parliamentary seats. While the major parties focus on forming a government and selecting candidates for the upcoming presidential elections, extremist groups and Georgescu—who is under investigation yet continues to hold public political rallies—persist in their campaign, openly challenging the authorities’ conclusions about electoral interference. The longer it takes for Romanian institutions involved in the current electoral process to provide clear explanations and actively work to regain public trust, the greater the likelihood that antiestablishment sentiments and the populist, Christian nationalist rhetoric will expand Georgescu’s electoral base and bolster support for a like-minded candidate in the next elections. Delays in addressing these issues create a vacuum where mistrust and frustration can flourish, fueling the appeal of platforms that challenge the establishment. Simultaneously, prolonged political instability and uncertainty take a toll on the economy. Large logistic and infrastructure projects—critical for Romania’s role as a regional hub—are at risk of stalling, especially as populist narratives calling for nationalization gain traction. In the medium to long term, building social resilience while reinforcing democracy will be key. As a young democracy, Romania has had to grapple with the legacies of its communist past, particularly widespread corruption, which has entrenched a clientelistic approach to politics and economics. Despite significant economic growth in recent years, progress has been uneven, deepening polarization and social disparities between urban and nonurban areas. This divide is common throughout Europe and has been exacerbated by multiple global crises since 2008. In Romania, the divide has led to growing criticism of the market-based economy and a resurgence of nostalgia for communism. Many Romanians recall its perceived benefits, such as job security and stability, while attributing the system’s flaws to the shortcomings of the current democratic framework and distrusting the state’s institutions. The real danger of Russia’s strategy lies in its ability to exploit these vulnerabilities by promoting narratives that resonate with the population’s daily struggles and divisions. These narratives focus on tangible challenges, such as poor economic conditions, inadequate public services, and a still-weak institutional framework, making them more likely to gain traction among a disillusioned public. This is further compounded by mistrust in mainstream political parties, their politicians that are perceived as mostly opportunistic with limited training for tackling governance, and the relative weakness of media and civil society, which are frequently criticized for their ties to state institutions. In such an environment, where politicians fail to demonstrate leadership and governance is perceived as vulnerable, a charismatic candidate who appeals to values and beliefs tied to unique national characteristics can easily win hearts and minds, particularly when aggressive disinformation campaigns erode critical thinking among the masses. Strengthening democratic institutions, addressing socioeconomic inequalities, and countering these divisive narratives are critical to building a resilient society capable of resisting external influence. That is only doable long-term. Lessons for the Future The way Romania handles the case of Russian interference in its electoral process has the potential to set a precedent and serve as a model for addressing similar situations in other countries. This case is unique in that it marks the first time credible evidence of Russian meddling has led to the annulment of an election—a significant step in safeguarding democratic integrity. How Romania navigates this challenge, particularly in terms of transparency and public accountability, will be closely observed by other nations facing similar threats. Perhaps Romania can effectively demonstrate that interference was identified, addressed, and neutralized in a manner that reinforces institutional credibility. Then, it will provide a blueprint for responding to hybrid warfare tactics aimed at undermining democratic systems. However, for Romania to truly establish this model, it must ensure that the evidence of interference is presented in a way that gains the trust of its population. Public skepticism, particularly in countries with histories of authoritarianism or weak institutional frameworks, is a significant barrier to such trust. In Romania’s case, the declassified intelligence reports must be supplemented with clear, independent investigations that leave no room for doubt. Additionally, addressing concerns about whether these findings are being used for political maneuvering is crucial. Any perception that the government or establishment parties are leveraging this interference narrative for their own benefit could erode public confidence and detract from the broader significance of addressing external influence. Romania could seize this opportunity to strengthen its institutions and reinforce the importance of transparency and democratic resilience. This includes, in the long term, creating robust safeguards to prevent future interference, fostering independent media, and ensuring civil society has the tools to hold power accountable. By taking these steps, Romania can transform a moment of vulnerability into a powerful example of how democracies can confront and neutralize hybrid threats. If successful, it will protect its own democratic processes and contribute valuable lessons to the international community in countering external interference. Finally, this case also raises fundamental questions about how the values of liberal democracy and the principles of open, transparent systems should be defended in the face of external threats. The way Romania addresses Russian interference in its electoral process is likely to ignite debates about balancing security measures with democratic freedoms, particularly in a system that values free speech and pluralism. As the situation unfolds, it will test the capacity of democratic institutions to act decisively without undermining the liberties that define them. If Romania succeeds in defending its democratic process while respecting the rule of law and individual rights, it could provide a model for how liberal democracies can protect themselves against hybrid threats without compromising their core values. This will be especially relevant for other nations grappling with the same challenge of external influence in a polarized and digitally interconnected world.

Assad Gone, Trump Coming: What’s Ukraine’s Future? – OpEd	Wars can end practically overnight. Just look at Syria, which was locked in a civil war for a dozen years. Having survived a succession of uprisings, Bashar al-Assad seemed on track to become a tyrant for life. Then, in the space of a couple weeks, his allies effectively deserted him, his army melted away, and he and his family had to decamp to the Kremlin. Vladimir Putin is already in the Kremlin, so that’s one place he can’t escape to if things in Russia go south. Unlike Assad, he doesn’t face rebel armies (not yet, at least). But he should still be worried, given Russian losses on the battlefield, in geopolitics, and throughout the economy. How long will it be before Putin and Assad both have to leave town to take up residence in that last refuge of scoundrels, not patriotism as Samuel Johnson insisted, but Pyongyang? That’s certainly not what Donald Trump meant when he said he would end the war in Ukraine on day one of his administration. He was not talking about helping Ukraine retake its occupied territory, precipitating a regime change in Russia and sending Putin into exile. That was the old Republican Party, which was anti-Russian to its core. The new MAGA party, with an illiberal agenda that overlaps with Putin’s, doesn’t have a foreign policy so much as an arsenal of threats. No surprise, then, that Trump’s 'concept of a plan' for ending the Ukraine war seems to consist only of simultaneous threats designed to push the two sides to come to the table and negotiate a ceasefire. The problem is that Putin is in no hurry to compromise. Oblivious to the implications of Assad’s defeat, Russia continues to press its advantage in Ukraine. In November, it seized nearly 11 square miles of Ukrainian territory every day. But these gains have come at a huge cost—over 45,000 total casualties over that same period. The need to bring in 10,000 North Korean soldiers on the Russian side suggests that these casualties are taking their toll. Other signs of Russian desperation include the astronomically high signing bonuses, prisons empty because of dragooned conscripts, and all the Indians and Yemenis tricked into fighting in Ukraine. The Russian economy, meanwhile, is starting to buckle, with inflation running over 9 percent, the interest rate above 21 percent, and rampant labor shortages resulting from all the young men in the army, in exile, or toiling in military industries. Putin soldiers on, regardless. At the top of his wish list, he wants to kick Ukrainian troops out of the Russian territory it seized around Kursk. Next, he wants all of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces (Russia controls almost all of the former but only around two-thirds of the latter). Putin’s maximalist goal is to 'denazify' the Ukrainian government by installing its own Kremlin-friendly regime and disarming the country so that it doesn’t pose any future threat to Russia. The Ukrainians have dug in their heels in the hopes that Putin will eventually scale back to save his own regime. But even holding the line, much less regaining occupied territory, has become increasingly difficult. Ukraine is struggling so much with its own shortage of soldiers that Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking about trading land for peace (plus NATO membership). Such a ceasefire would cede territory (the Donbas, Crimea) to the Russians, but Ukraine would reserve the right to regain the land 'in a diplomatic way' (whatever that means). Despite his willingness to compromise on territory, Zelensky is not giving up. He’s getting another billion dollars in military assistance from the Biden administration as its going-away present. A $50 billion loan collateralized on the interest on Russian assets frozen in the West is on the horizon, with the United States already allocating its share of $20 billion. To bring in enough troops to stop Russian advances, the Ukrainian government may consider further lowering the conscription age. Trump and his minions think they can force both sides to compromise on the disputed territory. That’s a perennial misunderstanding of the U.S. government. After all, this war is not primarily about territory. It’s about ideology. Putin has an illiberal vision that puts Russia at the center of a new anti-Western axis that contests everything from international law to LGBT rights. Zelensky has been thrust into the somewhat uncomfortable position of representing Western values of democracy and human rights. Ukrainians have a more fundamental fear: that an occupying force will throw them in jail, destroy their culture, or execute them in cold blood as in Buchaand elsewhere. Throwing Donald Trump into this mix is like setting off a bomb in the middle of a life-and-death struggle. Maybe, in the chaos and confusion after the explosion, everyone will throw down their weapons. Or maybe they’ll just ignore the bomb thrower, pick themselves up, and fight on with renewed vigor. Neither side has reached the stalemate that the two Koreas experienced in the final two years of that war. So, don’t bet on an armistice taking place on January 21, 2025. Trump’s Concept of a Plan In the world according to Trump, Russia invaded Ukraine because America was weak. Thus, to resolve the crisis, America must be strong again. That’s the essence of the plan from Trump’s envoy, Keith Kellogg. The United States will threaten to stop all aid to Ukraine to push it to the negotiating table. Then, to Russia, it will threaten to increase aid to Ukraine to get the Kremlin to negotiate. NATO membership for Ukraine would be off the table. But Putin knows that plenty of Republicans, and the constituents who put them in office, just want the United States to stop sending money to Ukraine under any circumstance. So, Putin can safely resist the pressure and then sit back to watch the Republican Party tear itself to shreds over the issue. Putin also knows how Kellogg really feels. 'A war born in American weakness can only be ended by American strength,' Trump’s future envoy wrote in testimony to a Senate hearing last year. 'That’s why the path to bringing these negotiations about is to enable Ukraine to defeat the Russian army in Ukraine … and provide Ukraine with the military armament it needs to [do so].' That explains the Russian response to the plan so far. 'Kellogg comes to Moscow with his plan, we take it and then tell him to screw himself, because we don’t like any of it,' Putin ally Konstantin Malofeyev told the Financial Times. 'That’d be the whole negotiation.' The Russians also know how Trump handled negotiations with the Taliban. In his eagerness to withdraw U.S. troops, President Transactional basically sold out the Afghan government and, in the words of his own national security advisor H.R. McMaster, signed 'a surrender agreement with the Taliban.' With a deadline for U.S. withdrawal and no implementation mechanism to hold the Taliban to its promises, Trump set the conditions that led to the disaster the Biden administration had to deal with several months into its first year. Having promised to end the war and stop sending money plus arms to Ukraine, Trump may well find himself in a similar diplomatic quandary vis a vis Ukraine in 2025. He might make promises to Kyiv that resemble what he promised the Afghan government and offer concessions to the Russians that are similar to what he gave the Taliban. Ukrainians, at least, know how that will end. Actually, it’s hard to imagine anyone getting enthusiastic about an Afghan-like peace in Ukraine. A terrible peace has settled over Afghanistan: the peace of the morgue and the jail cell. And that’s precisely the kind of peace that occupied Russian territories in Ukraine currently 'enjoy.' What Can Ukraine Do? The United States offered Ukraine the most armaments, but it wasn’t the only supplier in town. European allies have pledged to pick up the slack, with Germany leading the way. European leaders are reportedly trying to persuade the incoming Trump administration to keep supplying Ukraine for at least one more year. One more year: that’s probably what Russia has the resources for. It’s increasing its military spending tremendously for 2025, but then the budget starts to fall over the next two years. If the Russian economy really goes off the rails as a result of the war, many Russian will abandon their love affair with Putin. Zelensky’s land-for-peace deal is an interim option. Ukraine may have to settle for some vague promises of NATO accession and some current 'security guarantees' in the form of weaponry (but not nuclear weapons) to deter another Russian invasion. If Russia can be arm-twisted to negotiate—or persuaded by the promise of sanctions relief—Ukraine will probably have to swallow some kind of land-for-peace deal, as noxious as that will be. After Russia seized Crimea and parts of the Donbas back in 2014, I compared Ukraine’s situation to that of Aron Ralston, a hiker who found himself trapped in a remote location with his arm pinned by a boulder. Ultimately, he decided to amputate his arm in order to survive. 'If Ukraine wants to move on with its aspirations to move closer to the West, it will probably have to submit to the knife as well,' I wrote. 'Who knows: after many years of international isolation, lukewarm Russian support, and economic stagnation, the ghost limbs might themselves appeal for reattachment. This is not fair, of course. Russia has been playing a dirty game. But no one ever said that geopolitics is fair. The situation that befell Aron Ralston wasn’t fair either. But sometimes you have to do what’s necessary to survive, even if it means cutting away what you hold dear.' Now, a decade later, the situation is more desperate and even more unfair. But Putin could very well be living on borrowed time, just like Assad for the last dozen years. Russia is not all-powerful (exhibit A: the implosion of its close ally Syria), and neither is Putin. The quagmire of Afghanistan set in motion the collapse of the Soviet Union; the quagmire of Ukraine may well spell the end of Putin’s 'Russian world.' Then the residents of the Donbas and Crimea will beg Ukraine, safely settled in the European Union, to welcome them back.

Implications Of UN Resolutions On ‘International Cooperation On P...	By Kolja Brockmann, Dr Mark Bromley and Giovanna Maletta On 2 December the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution submitted by China, and co-sponsored by 27 other states, on ‘Promoting international cooperation on peaceful uses in the context of international security’. The new resolution, like its two predecessors adopted in 2021 and 2022, ‘reaffirms’ that the right to benefit from international cooperation in science and technology for ‘peaceful uses’ should not be hampered by states’ implementation of non-proliferation obligations—a principle reflected in different treaties. All three resolutions also ‘note with concern’ that multilateral and national export control measures are infringing on this right by creating ‘undue’ restrictions on transfers of goods and technology for peaceful purposes. The three resolutions have been viewed by many states as a critique of the multilateral export control regimes—the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Wassenaar Arrangement—and a threat to their long-term viability. This criticism comes at a time when the regimes are facing multiple challenges to their relevance and functioning. This backgrounder assesses the motivations behind the support for the resolutions, the concerns they have raised, and their potential impact on the regimes and global non-proliferation efforts. The 2024 resolution The 2024 resolution on ‘Promoting international cooperation on peaceful uses in the context of international security’ repeats many of the points that were made in 2021 and 2022. However, it adds more critical language about the controls that supplier states are imposing. While the 2022 resolution noted with concern that ‘undue restrictions . . . persist’, the 2024 text states they are ‘increasing’ and include ‘unilateral coercive measures that violate international law’. The 2024 resolution also adds that the ‘non-proliferation control arrangements’ are being used as vehicles for these efforts. The list of steps that states are encouraged to take to implement the resolution now includes ‘formulating guiding principles as appropriate’. However, the language also indicates support for a less radical overhaul of how the regimes should operate than was outlined in 2021 and 2022. For example, while the 2022 resolution emphasized that the regimes ‘should be transparent and open to participation by all states’, the 2024 version says that the regimes should be ‘transparent and inclusive, in line with their respective mandates’. Debates around the ‘peaceful uses’ resolutions China submitted all three resolutions and has put significant effort into building support for them. The number of states voting in favour has increased with each resolution, going from 78 in 2021 to 94 in 2022 and 105 in 2024. Among the states that voted in favour in 2024 were 15 that had either voted against the 2022 resolution (Liberia and Nauru), abstained (Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, Madagascar, Maldives, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Seychelles) or registered no vote (Azerbaijan, Cabo Verde, Comoros, Guinea, Somalia and Zambia). However, four states that had voted in favour in 2022 abstained in 2024 (Côte d’Ivoire) or registered no vote (Central African Republic, El Salvador and Papua New Guinea). China’s efforts have been viewed by many states and commentators as an attempt to highlight and delegitimize the widening set of export control measures that the United States, either alone or in partnership with its allies, has imposed on China in recent years. These include controls on transfers of advanced semiconductors and related manufacturing equipment and quantum computers. When adopting these controls, the USA has argued that they are aimed at limiting transfers of technologythat might advance China’s military capabilities. The USA has also asserted that they are motivated by China’s military–civil fusion strategy, which has the goal of helping the Chinese military to benefit from developments in China’s civilian sectors and necessitates treating all exports to China as potential transfers to its defence industry. However, at the same time, US officials have spoken about using export controls, domestic subsidies and other policy tools to stay ahead of other states in key technology areas. China has argued that the USA is using export controls as tools of geopolitical competition and has requested dispute-resolution consultations with the USA through the World Trade Organization. The level of support for the resolutions suggests that China and the other co-sponsors tapped into a wider set of grievances, particularly among developing states, concerning the imposition of supply-side controls on transfers of goods and technologies. These grievances include concerns not only about the multilateral export control regimes, including their admission processes and practices, but perhaps more so about national export control measures and the use of sanctions measures by the USA, the European Union (EU) and other Western states. They also reflect disappointment at the perceived failure of some states to honour commitments made in non-proliferation and disarmament treaties to ensure that restrictions are not placed on transfers of technology for peaceful purposes or peaceful uses. Mechanisms for enabling technology transfers for peaceful uses The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention(BWC) and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) all recognize the right of states parties to participate in the ‘fullest possible exchange of’ equipment, material, and scientific and technical information for ‘peaceful purposes’ or ‘peaceful uses’. However, none of these treaties oblige states parties to transfer technologies and all place requirements that need to be fulfilled by the importing states before such transfers can occur. For example, under the NPT, states should transfer sensitive nuclear technology only if the recipients have effective safeguards measures in place. Mechanisms are available to facilitate international cooperation and access to technologies for peaceful uses. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) implements various international cooperation activities designed to help states parties to the CWC develop capabilities in areas related to peaceful uses of chemistry, particularly in those with developing economies. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays an important role in achieving the NPT objective to foster international cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. For instance, the IAEA has established the Technical Cooperation Programme to support ‘transferring nuclear technology to [IAEA] member states’ in support of their ‘key development priorities’. The BWC Implementation Support Unit acts as a ‘clearinghouse for assistance with national implementation’ and manages a database to coordinate assistance requests and offers among BWC states parties, which can include scientific cooperation and joint research. However, these mechanisms, and the ways states have interpreted and implemented relevant treaty provisions, have long been a focus of criticism for developing states. The members of the Non-Aligned Movement have complained for many years that their right to access technology for peaceful uses under the non-proliferation and disarmament treaties is being hampered by trade restrictions on developing states. Countries in the Group of 77 have also highlighted the uneven allocation of resources between programmes facilitating access to peaceful uses and security-oriented activities that organizations like the IAEA are tasked with implementing. In response to this criticism, several initiatives have been launched in recent years to expand on existing efforts to facilitate transfers of technology for peaceful purposes. In 2022 a group of states launched the Sustained Dialogue on Peaceful Uses (SDPU) at the NPT Review Conference. During its first year of activity, the SDPU focused on promoting peaceful uses of nuclear science in the fields of water security, health, and climate change response. Also in 2022, the BWC Review Conference mandated states to develop a mechanism to support the full implementation of Article X of the BWC (‘International Cooperation’), something the Working Group on Strengthening the BWC is currently addressing. In September 2024, UN member states adopted the Pact for the Future, which recognizes the importance of digital cooperation and sharing science, technology and innovation for sustainable development, and outlines a series of actions to advance progress in these areas. The 2024 resolution welcomes the various initiatives for promoting international cooperation for peaceful uses but implies that more needs to be done, urging states ‘to take concrete measures to promote international cooperation on materials, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes’. It also reiterates concerns that developing states have voiced in other forums that both the way the multilateral export control regimes operate and the manner in which export controls are being applied clash with states’ obligations under other instruments. Efforts to clarify the aims of the export control regimes In response to the resolutions, Western states, both at the UN General Assembly and other relevant forums, have noted that the multilateral export control regimes provide many public goods to the benefit of all states, including guidelines, control lists, outreach and engagement opportunities. They have also sought to highlight the role that the export control standards formulated by the regimes play in building trust and confidence and enabling transfers of technology for peaceful uses. Moreover, some states have argued that there is no evidence that the implementation of export controls has a measurable impact on states’ economic development and access to advanced technologies. In support of these arguments, they have referenced studies that indicate that there is a positive correlation between the adoption of export controls and participation in the trade in high-technology and dual-use items. In some cases, these arguments became more pointed during UN General Assembly discussions in 2024. For example, some states made more or less explicit statements that China’s grievances about the imposition of Western trade restrictions were the motivation for the resolution and that China’s military–civil fusion strategy was one of the main challenges to effective multilateral export controls. EU-led side events on the margins of the NPT and UN General Assembly meetings, in which SIPRI took part, sought to facilitate discussions about the regimes’ role in promoting or hampering technology transfers and scientific exchanges. Participating states, in particular the USA, and the EU are also active in the implementation of export control outreach and capacity-building activities that have resulted in many beneficiaries adopting the regimes’ standards and control lists. In public messaging, representatives of the regimes have also sought to show more sensitivity in responding to concerns about the possible impacts of export controls on economic development. For instance, representatives of the regimes have taken steps to raise awareness about the regimes’ functioning, to demonstrate the regimes’ commitment to not impeding legitimate trade and to show the regimes’ willingness to engage with non-participating states. The previous Swiss chair of the MTCR has stressed some of these points during outreach visits and other public events. Argentina and Brazil, in their recent roles as chairs of the NSG, have highlighted ‘the need to balance non-proliferation and international security objectives with the potential impact on states’ technological and industrial development’. The current South African chair of the NSG has announcedhis commitment to working with both participating and non-participating states to facilitate the responsible transfer of technology ‘with special consideration for the needs of developing states’. Despite these efforts, several states that participate in at least one of the regimes have either supported the three resolutions or abstained. In addition to China, Kazakhstan, Russia and South Africa have consistently voted in favour, while India and Mexico have abstained. Brazil, a participating state and outgoing chair of both the NSG and the MTCR, switched from abstaining in 2022 to voting in favour of the 2024 resolution. Conversely, Argentina, which participates in all the regimes, switched from abstaining in 2022 to voting against in 2024. However, there have been few if any indications that the resolutions have adversely affected the substantive work of the regimes. China continues to participate in the NSG and the resolutions do not appear to have had any impact on its and any other participating state’s willingness to join in the group’s work. In contrast, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has had a profound impact on the regimes’ work. Russia participates in the NSG, the MTCR and the Wassenaar Arrangement, and all three require consensus on significant decisions, something that has proved highly challenging to achieve on many occasions since 2022. Risks ahead While the immediate impact of the peaceful uses resolutions on the substantive work of the regimes appears limited, the growing support for the resolutions makes it important to consider the potential broader impact on the global adoption and implementation of export control measures. At the same time, growing support for the resolutions makes it difficult for states participating in the regimes not to engage on the substance of some of the criticism that has emerged at the UN General Assembly and other forums. A deeper analysis of the claims raised by states supporting the resolutions—and whether these point to effects created by the regimes or focus on issues that are outside their purview—could help to identify areas that the regimes could look to strengthen. Many of the states that voted in favour of the resolutions or abstained have engaged with export control-related capacity-building programmes and have put in place national export control systems that apply the control lists and other standards established by the regimes. If emerging economies and non-aligned states move away from working with these programmes and become less willing to adopt the regimes’ standards—something that both the heated discourse and further unilateral actions by regime participants risks provoking—this could leave the regimes significantly weaker and have a negative impact on non-proliferation efforts. Conclusions and ways forward The 2024 resolution on ‘Promoting international cooperation on peaceful uses’ achieved an even stronger result in the UN General Assembly vote than its predecessors in 2021 and 2022. This occurred despite efforts by the regimes and participating states to clarify the roles of multilateral and national export controls and highlight their positive impact on enabling trade in dual-use items. The new resolution comes at a time when the multilateral export control regimes face a growing list of challenges. For example, Russia has reportedly vetoed recent efforts to add new control list entries to the Wassenaar Arrangement, and this is driving calls for the establishment of new mechanisms for adopting multilateral export controls. The adoption of the 2024 resolution, and uncertainties about how exactly the process of ‘formulating guiding principles’ will work, potentially adds to the challenges. One step to move the discussion forward would be to assess how well the current mechanisms for enabling the sharing of equipment and technology for peaceful purposes and peaceful uses are working and what obstacles they have faced. Discussions in the UN General Assembly during 2024 did little to increase knowledge of this issue, as they focused mostly on the proportion of trade that is captured by export controls and how many licences are issued and denied. Recent analyses of efforts to enable transfers of technology show the issue is more complex, with supply-side restrictions being one factor among many, and sanctions measures often being more significant than multilateral and national export controls. The momentum generated by the Pact for the Future potentially creates space to bring diplomats working on non-proliferation, disarmament and development issues into a more comprehensive discussion about how to address challenges related to transfers of technology for peaceful uses. If the multilateral export control regimes are to maintain their role as key providers of global standards in the field of non-proliferation then both the regimes and their participants need to find ways to demonstrate their ability to continue doing their substantive work and overcome fundamental internal divisions. They should also explore how to become more transparent in sharing outputs and creating opportunities for substantive input from non-participants, as appropriate and feasible. The regimes should also participate more actively in meetings and events connected to the non-proliferation and disarmament treaties. In addition, they should play a bigger part in outreach and capacity-building activities conducted by participating states, or like-minded partners such as the EU, to further clarify their roles and create opportunities for dialogue. Finally, states participating in the regimes could also seek to articulate more clearly their regional and international security objectives, and the role export control measures have in supporting the implementation of the non-proliferation and disarmament treaties and international law more broadly. This backgrounder forms part of a wider project on the future of the multilateral export control regimes which SIPRI is conducting with support from the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.

Radicalization In The Northern Caucasus – Analysis	By Jason Wahlang and Saman Ayesha Kidwai The growing re-emergence of radicalisation in Russia’s North Caucasus region (Dagestan and Chechnya) must be understood within the broader framework of domestic security challenges and radicalisation trends (white supremacist or Islamist). The Russian state or the regional leaders have not come up with strategies for countering narratives on radicalisation and violent extremism spawned by radicals, which has helped non-state actors to recruit and radicalise recruits. The Islamic State has perpetrated terror attacks in Moscow in March 2024 and Dagestan in June 2024. The attack on Moscow was unprecedented in terms of scale that was not witnessed since the Beslan school tragedy 20 years ago. Radicalisation in the North Caucasus The Northern Caucasus region has been a hotbed of instability and conflict since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Socio-economic disparities have made it a fertile landscape for the rise of extremist ideologies, including Islamist radicalism. The evolution of the idea of global jihad and the emergence of various groups like Al-Qaeda (AQ) and Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has further added to the rise of different groups which had pledged allegiance to the two terrorist outfits by exploiting multiple discrepancies and dissatisfaction due to the socio-economic disparities among the population. The populace’s shift in ideological worldview from Sufism to Salafism in the region, with the rising presence of Salafist mosques has further fuelled radicalisation. The radicalisation has not remained confined to the region, with many North Caucasians joining Al-Qaeda and then ISIS’ ranks beyond Russian borders.1 As per reports in 2020, approximately 5,000 men, women and children travelled to Syria to join ISIS from Chechnya and Dagestan.2 The voluntary removal of radicalised and violent extremist individuals from North Caucasus allowed a sense of calm and limited stability to set in over a period of time. However, the region witnessed a resurgence in violence and instability due to the June 2024 attacks in Dagestan. Chechnya Chechen radicalisation occurred towards the end of the First Chechen War, with the local Chechen separatism co-opted by the radicalised elements. During the nascent stages of the Second Chechen War, the influence of Al-Qaeda transformed the once-Chechen identity based nationalist movement into a radicalised and violent extremist Salafist movement. It was during this time that the rise of jihadist tendencies took root in the republic, initiating a period of radicalisation. The Russian counter-response during the Second Chechen War led to a reduction of radicalisation for a limited period. Russia initiated large scale counter-terror operations against violent extremists and separatist groups and individuals. It promoted alternative versions of Islam to undermine extremists’ ideologies and empowered local leaders such as Ramzan Kadyrov. Moscow also promoted welfare programmes to address socio-economic marginalisation. Despite the collapse of the secessionist movements in the republic, radicalisation still found a conducive ecosystem to proliferate. Soon, groups emerged, such as the Caucasus Emirate (an AQ affiliate) and the Vilayet Kavkaz (an ISIS affiliate). The Caucasus Emirate was established in 2007 under the leadership of separatist radical Doku Umarov, who had vowed support to Al-Qaeda. Additionally, two Chechens—Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev—inspired by AQ, carried out the infamous Boston Marathon Bombings,3 thus showing the connect between AQ and rising radicalisation during that period. The Caucasus Emirate activities within Russia lasted only until 2014, with significant defections from the group towards ISIS.4 Resultantly, the turf war saw ISIS gain an upper hand, and the group, along with its regional affiliates, began dominating the terrorism ecosystem in the region. ISIS, similar to Al-Qaeda, tapped into secessionist tendencies within the region to foment radicalisation and advance its brand of Salafi-Jihadism. This shift in the ideological and theological understanding of the separatist movement in Chechnya, which saw the rise of the Salafist elements, had a spillover effect on other republics, including neighbouring Dagestan. Dagestan Dagestanis, like Chechens, sought independence from the Russian state and its local movements were also co-opted by radical elements and extremists. These developments provided extremist Chechens a critical opportunity to establish a haven in Dagestan, for example, through Kavkaz Vilayet. Similar to the past, where a civil war-like climate was evident in the republic from 2010 till 2014 due to the presence of the jihadi groups,5 Dagestan has remained rife for exploitation by radicalised elements. It recently saw a significant terror attack and a rise in antisemitic events, including an intended attack at the airport in the capital, Makhachkala, which targeted travellers flying in from Israel. This has shown that while Chechnya remains of interest for the jihadi groups, Dagestan has gained increasing prominence among violent non-state actors. Use of Propaganda and External Conflicts In April 2024, ISIS-affiliated Ingush militants, under the guise of mujahadeen of the ‘Ingush Jamaat of the Wilayat Kavkaz’, appealed to the North Caucasus population to join ISIS.6 Similar propaganda has gained traction since Russia’s war push with Ukraine. This can be seen as an attempt of the group to revive ISIS’ Caucasus branch, which had been inactive for years due to the heightened alertness and counter-terror measures applied by Russian forces. Moreover, as part of its turf war with ISIS, AQ has chosen to use the events in Aleppo to disseminate propaganda hailing HTS and other rebel forces’ advance in the war-torn city and its re-emergence as a potent actor in North Caucasus. Despite HTS publicly severing ties with AQ in 2016, doubts remained about the nature of their ties. The recent pronouncements made by AQ celebrating the rebel success in Aleppo reinforced that scepticism. For example, in one of its recent posts, AQ in the Arabian Peninsula proclaimed7 its ‘support and congratulations’ for the HTS campaign and emphasised the need to fight unitedly against the regime forces and its allies (including Russians) by underlining ‘Tawhid’ (belief in oneness and unity of God). Considering that it has failed to garner much traction through propaganda and attacks since ISIS’ rise, AQ could be looking to make inroads again into a region which has remained volatile. However, it is to be seen whether AQ can push back against the notoriety gained by ISIS, more so after the March 2024 attacks in Moscow and the June 2024 attacks in Dagestan, by tapping into events in West Asia to its advantage. At the same time, it is necessary to exercise caution about the implications of factions such as the Turkistan Brigade8 (comprised of violent extremists from Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan), which has joined hands in the offensive against Assad’s forces. Its members could adapt the lessons learned and tactics to fit the Russian landscape once this conflict recedes as the situation in North Caucasus grows more volatile. Central Asian migrants have been subject to animosity in Russia due to their brethren’s participation in ISIS-related activities9 over the years. The ‘Migrant Expulsion Regime’10 adopted by Russia’s Duma in July 2024, which eased the deportation of Central Asian migrants, especially those suspected of extremist activities, is expected to fuel terrorist propaganda due to reports of rising xenophobia, particularly by ISIS. This terrorist organisation has long expressed disdain for Russia and amplified its propaganda and recruitment efforts directed at vulnerable Central Asians. Conclusion Despite past attempts to curb radicalisation, the current geopolitical and geostrategic disruptions caused by events in Ukraine and Syria could equip violent non-state actors to further destabilise the North Caucasus and the wider Russian state. Rising propaganda could attract more radicalised populations to join the Islamic State or other terror groups, even giving space to AQ to re-emerge as a strong contender. Disgruntled citizens in Grozny, for instance, protested against partial mobilisation announced by the Russian government to bolster its war efforts in Ukraine. This dissatisfaction against the state’s policies stemmed from festering resentment and concern about the war’s impact on the Chechen population. The Chechen population and the Russian state finds themselves at loggerheads on security issues. Despite the Russian leadership accommodating the demands and concerns of the protestors, it is likely that the disillusionment among the locals might fester over time contributing to further radicalisation.

Can Trump Save The Dollar? – OpEd	By J.R. MacLeod During his 2024 presidential campaign Donald Trump repeatedly and in grave terms highlighted the possibility of the US dollar losing its world reserve currency status. This occurred at summits with business leaders at the New York and Chicago Economic Clubs. Trump occupies a rather unique position in this debate since he recognizes the real possibility of the dollar losing its world currency status, he opposes this change and wishes to prevent it, and yet he is not a paradigmatic member of the ruling class. However mainstream he is—today or in the past—he doesn’t possess the establishment credentials of a Ben Bernanke, for instance. Since Trump doesn’t want the dollar to lose reserve currency status, his acknowledgment that this is a real possibility should at least serve as ammunition against those who are oblivious to this change, or who claim that it isn’t happening. Typically, when dollar defenders argue that the loss of reserve currency status is an impossibility, they are arguing against those who wish for this change to happen. When Trump says that the dollar could lose its reserve status—even though he opposes this change—it at least undercuts the factual basis of those dollar defenders who claim its status is secure. Admittedly, the possible loss of reserve currency status is not a short-term trend. Anyone claiming the demise of the dollar is imminent—and particularly anyone trying to sell you a financial package on this basis—should be treated with skepticism. But there is a bizarre school of thought which downplays all blows to the dollar’s position, and claims that these events are insignificant. There are, in fact, many significant events occurring, and they are stacking up to present a real threat to the dollar’s position. Events such as Saudi Arabia trading oil in other currencies, BRICs countries developing a new payment system, and China rapidly decreasing its holdings of US treasuries. How can these events not mean anything? Source If the dollar is in jeopardy, and Trump wants to save it, the question then becomes: can he save it? One approach to achieving this goal would be to manage the dollar more competently. This would involve less creation of new money (inflation), since many national economies were severely destabilized by the massive inflation of recent years. It would also involve a judicious, non-ideological use of dollar-based power, as opposed to weaponizing the dollar over conflicts where a nation perceives its fundamental interests are at stake, and the US interest is peripheral at best, and unjustified at worst. The other approach would be to get tough; to threaten countries who move away from holding the dollar for forex purposes with either economic or military power. Trump has made noise about both approaches, though he seems to lean most heavily towards the use of tariffs to prevent nations from breaking away. In my view, the aggressive approach would only accelerate current trends, since this was the path taken from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 up until now, and it created the situation in the first place. A Trump administration managing the dollar the way it used to be managed could placate other nations and slow down current trends, but I think that is all it could do, rather than permanently halt and reverse these developments. A fundamental rupture has occurred and too many important nations perceive it as a fundamental interest to break the power of the dollar as the world reserve currency in the long term. They may be happier if this process is managed slowly and without disruption, but they are committed to it. In my view, it is impossible for Trump to stop the process of de-dollarization. Regardless of how much success he is able to achieve, we should also ask whether this is the right goal in the first place. Undoubtedly the dollar losing global reserve currency status would cause significant short-term economic pain for the American people. Trump seems to have the noble intention of avoiding this pain, but we also know that markets can respond to these events and get the economy working again rather quickly when left alone. Beyond markets, there is also the calculation, by which the government could adjust the ratio of its gold holdings to the dollar (assuming implementation of a hard gold standard). This is explained by Murray Rothbard in the final chapter of The Case Against the Fed. In the event that the dollar loses its reserve status, this plan could very quickly restore the currency to a sound position. It may seem noble to attempt to reinforce the reserve status of the dollar, but defending the Fed, the fiat dollar, and global reserve currency status are the economic equivalent of defending death by strangulation just because it’s slow. This currency system supports the bloated welfare-warfare functions of the government. It has hollowed out American industry by financialization and the fact that dollars can be created out of thin air to pay for goods and services domestically and abroad. This tremendously undercuts genuine production and wealth generation. Because this system creates such an unnatural and unproductive economy, and though this economy has such pernicious effects on society, collapse is inherent in the system sooner or later. The longer the system lasts, the more rot sets in, and the worse the eventual collapse will be. This discussion brings us to the subject of institutionalism. There is a powerful tendency in politics to regard an institution as one’s own, long after one’s own faction has lost it, or even where the institution never belonged to one’s own faction in the first place. Accompanying this is the tendency to want to reform institutions recognized as not aligned with one’s own faction, rather than destroy them. Being unable to recognize when an institution is opposed to one’s political goals, and being unable to recognize when an opposing institution is irredeemably opposed to these goals and, therefore, not subject to reform, can prevent a faction from achieving its desired political goals. In these cases, all energy—by the fact of being directed into these institutions—is then redirected against the goals the political faction wishes to achieve. According to Trump’s stated goals of wishing to revitalize the American economy on behalf of the American people—and not government or corporate special interests—the Federal Reserve and the fiat dollar it supports are irredeemable institutions. Trying to reform and reinforce the status of the dollar as global reserve currency will never achieve these goals. People may be able to point to this or that improvement in economic conditions over the next few years, but I am talking about systemic change and a lasting victory. It is hard to argue that these aren’t necessary over and above small improvements. Between the Biden administration inadvertently and obliviously endangering the global reserve currency status of the dollar through its own incompetence, and Trump’s intention to undo this damage, there is a better path. Any future American administration should create a plan to manage the transition away from the fiat dollar as global reserve currency towards a national gold dollar, that is, a national policy of a 100 percent gold-backed dollar, where other countries are free to set their own monetary policy. This would vastly improve the American economy as well as international relations. About the author: J.R.

War Propaganda And The Fall Of Syria – OpEd	A succession of U.S. presidents have been committed to regime change in Syria. That long-held goal has been achieved in part through a sustained campaign of war propaganda. 'AQ [Al Qaeda] is on our side in Syria.' -- Senior Policy Adviser Jake Sullivan's 2012 email to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton The rapid fall of the Syrian Arab Republic government was both a shock and a catastrophe for that region and for the world. It was incomprehensible that the state which withstood a sustained attack since 2011 from the United States, Israel, Turkey and other NATO members, and gulf monarch states such as Saudi Arabia, would collapse so swiftly. The defeat was political, not military. There was surprisingly little actual fighting on the battlefield. Russia, Syria’s most powerful ally, is engaged in Ukraine, while Turkey, Syria’s nemesis, played a two-sided game of working with its NATO allies while claiming to be negotiating in good faith with Russia. Surely more details are still to come, but treachery and a U.S. commitment to pursuing hegemony won the day and the Axis of Resistance now represented only by Iran, has been dealt a huge blow. The project for a Greater Israel is a reality and the Israeli Defense Forces have destroyed Syria’s air force and navy as Syrian Arab Army soldiers have fled rather than risk capture by the jihadists who have now overrun that country. Syria was the victim of a U.S. regime change plot that began in 2011 and it was carried out by successive administrations with the help of collusion with the media. The U.S. had buy-in for whatever acts it wanted to carry out against Syria because of a sustained war propaganda effort. That effort continued until the last moment before the government fell. After the Barack Obama administration succeeded in destroying the state of Libya and killing its president with the help of jihadist proxies, it turned its attention to Syria in an attempt to replicate that plot. The corporate media assisted with a drumbeat of condemnation against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. The country, with a long history of supporting dictators and tyrants, declared that Assad was a murderer, a dictator, and a butcher. Their propaganda output included newly created terms such as 'barrel bombs' and a new epithet against anyone who spoke against their regime change project, who were labeled as 'Assadists.' Every tool of war propaganda was put to use, including claims that Assad was using chemical weapons against his people. In a futile effort to end such charges, in 2013, the Russian government assisted the Syrians in destroying their chemical weapons stockpiles , but to no avail. The charges continued without any evidence. Syria was even accused of using chemical weapons on the very day that United Nations inspectors arrived in 2013. The chemical weapons charge was used over and over again and each time the version of events strained credulity. In 2018 the U.S., France, and the U.K. declared they would take military action against Syria if there were any chemical weapons attacks. Like clockwork, on April 7 of that year, 40 civilians were killed in the city of Douma and it was reported that the Syrian government had dropped chemical weapons on the building where the killings took place. But one inspector from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) cast doubt on that version of events. A leaked document stated, '…there is a higher probability that both cylinders were manually placed at both locations rather than being delivered by aircraft.' The whistleblower disappeared from corporate media accounts, while the likelier explanation that civilians were kidnapped and killed by U.S. proxies, was sent down the memory hole.Consider the odd timeline of events that year. On March 4, a former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned by a chemical agent in Britain. The British government blames Russia, which has no reason to harm a former spy they swapped eight years prior. Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, arrived in London for an official visit on March 7. On March 12, French president Emmanuel Macron stated that France would attack Syria if any chemical weapons are used there. The next day the Russian military claims to have evidence that a chemical attack will be carried out against Syrian civilians as a pretext for war. On March 16 France warned French journalists to leave Syria. Mohammed bin Salman traveled to Washington on March 19. On April 8 the prince known as MBS went to Paris for yet another official visit. On that day Saudi funded jihadist groups and the White Helmets, who were created by a British intelligence officer, reported that a chemical weapons attack occurred in the city of Douma. On April 14, the United States, France and Britain joined in a missile strike against Syria. Just as they had done since 2011, the U.S. media played an important part in supporting U.S. foreign policy as the final blows were being planned. CNN disingenuously reported, 'How Syria’s rebel leader went from radical jihadist to a blazer-wearing ‘revolutionary.’ ' Abu Mohammed al-Jolani is no longer called a 'radical jihadist' leader of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS) because CNN and the rest of western media orchestrated the transformation. They didn’t interview al-Jolani in years past, but he and his handlers have now been coached in how the game is played. 'I believe that everyone in life goes through phases and experiences…As you grow, you learn, and you continue to learn until the very last day of your life.' It is easy to grow and learn with the help of media image makers. CNN was not alone in offering a helping hand while behaving as an innocent bystander. The British Broadcasting Corporation was also part of the charade with what was essentially the same headline used by CNN. 'From Syrian jihadist leader to rebel politician: How Abu Mohammed al-Jolani reinvented himself.' Reinvention is easy when corporate media offer a helping hand. Al-Jolani was once wanted by the U.S. In 2017, the State Department announced a reward of up to $10 million for his capture. 'We remain committed to bringing leading AQS figures in HTS to justice.' That announcement from the first Donald Trump administration was also phony. Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her successor John Kerry knew quite well that their proxies were members of ISIS and Al Qaeda offshoots. The use of jihadists as proxies has a long and ignoble history. In 1993, the British newspaper The Independentinterviewed Osama bin Laden, hailing him as an 'Anti-Soviet warrior' who used his armies for peaceful purposes. The man who less than ten years later would mastermind the attacks of September 11, 2001, and become a hated villain, had, in fact, been a western ally fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan beginning in the days of the Jimmy Carter administration. After many fits and starts, the coup de grace has been delivered. The Syrian people who either lived through war or who were forced to become refugees around the world are now ruled by numerous groups of warring jihadists. The U.S. has won a decisive victory and Israel immediately enlarged its occupation of Syria. Before the details of this change of events are known, it is important to point out what is already known. The west and their agents in the Western Asia region have schemed to take over Syria for many years, and they utilized war propaganda as one of their weapons. They will continue to do so as they work to consolidate their malicious but successful handiwork.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI49NN1UtASiM	2024-12-11T16:28:03-08:00	
The Faircloth Amendment Blocks The Construction Of Affordable Hou...	Randall Irvin has been waiting for public housing in Chicago for six years, and his situation is not that unusual. For example, there are over 100,000 families on San Antonio’s waitlist for public housing. In Chicago, there were more than 200,000 families on the waitlist in 2023. Public housing waiting lists are extremely long because there is an inadequate supply – and a 1998 amendment to federal housing law is a significant barrier to building new housing. Table 1 lists the average number of months households waited before they were able to receive public housing in selected metropolitan areas according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. It ranges from a low of 11 months in San Antonio to a high of 84 months (7 years) in Miami. These numbers hide the wide range of variation around the average. In the city of Chicago, families can wait for as few as six months or as long as 25 years depending on the specifics of their situation and their family size. Households that are still waiting for housing or that never receive housing are not included in the calculation of the averages, so these average wait times do not fully capture the difficulty of obtaining public housing. The families remaining on public housing waitlists for housing for years are in desperate situations. They are people who are homeless, who are living in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, and who are struggling to afford their housing. In Washington, D.C., Rosalynn Talley, who waited 14 years for public housing, described her overcrowded housing situation as being 'smashed up like sardines.' Her neighborhood was also unsafe, and there was mold in the house. Congress is to blame for the low supply of public housing. In 1998, Congress passed theFaircloth Amendment which put a cap on the number of public housing units. The cap and the consistent underfunding of public housing has caused the number of public housing units to decline 40 percent from 1.4 million in 1994 to 835,000 in 2022 while the need for affordable housing has steadily increased. Public housing is one of the most affordable forms of housing, but affordable housing policy has shifted to relying on the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). LIHTC goes to private developers and investors and creates 'affordable' housing that is often more expensive to renters than public housing. The Joint Center for Housing Studies reports that 'LIHTC [housing] does not necessarily protect a renter from [housing] cost burdens.' While the Faircloth Amendment has been a benefit to the for-profit real estate industry, it has hurt low-income renters. Thankfully, there are some in Congress working to undo this bad law. The Homes Actintroduced by Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), if passed, would repeal the Faircloth Amendment and provide the funding needed to address the maintenance and repair backlog in public housing. Currently, the bill has 40 supporters in the House of Representatives and two supporters in the Senate. Repealing the Faircloth Amendment would open another channel to address the affordable housing crisis.

Gaza’s ‘Lost Generation’ Faces Bleak Future – OpEd	By Osama Al-Sharif UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini this week made a fresh appeal to the world community to save Gaza’s children from becoming 'a lost generation.' He was referring to the fact that more than 600,000 children in the Strip have had no access to formal primary education since October 2023. Since Israel launched its retaliatory attack on Gaza more than a year ago, it has brushed aside criticisms and denunciations over its deliberate bombing of schools and hospitals. The destruction of Gaza’s infrastructure, such as sanitation and water treatment facilities, is seen as having no military value for Israel. Doctors Without Borders has described what is happening in Gaza as a 'war without rules.' It added that, as of Nov. 5, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a mere 17 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remained functional, and only partially so. Eleven field hospitals (five fully functioning and six partially functioning) were operating at that time. But in northern Gaza, where Israel is forcing tens of thousands of Palestinians to abandon their homes, all vital public facilities, including schools and hospitals, are now on the brink of collapse. Last week, four doctors were killed at Kamal Adwan Hospital in besieged northern Gaza after Israeli forces stormed the compound, killing and injuring dozens of people in the surrounding areas. Israeli troops also forced healthcare workers and patients to leave the facility. According to a statement by Dr. Hussam Abu Saifya, the hospital director, they destroyed critical medical supplies. The Israeli army has besieged all three remaining hospitals in northern Gaza and they are being targeted daily. With no access to health or education, more than a million children in Gaza are facing horrific living conditions. Those who are in designated safe areas are facing malnutrition, diseases and a lack of sanitary services. The education system has all but collapsed. According to Save the Children, about 30 percent of the 11,300 identified child victims in Gaza between last October and Aug. 31 were younger than five, according to a newly published breakdown of the ages of about 34,000 people whose deaths have been verified by Gaza’s Ministry of Health. Of those, more than 700 were aged under 12 months. Another 2,800 dead children have yet to be identified. In March, Save the Children issued a report that warned of 'complete psychological destruction,' adding that 'children in Gaza have suffered 'relentless mental harm.' According to the Health Ministry in Gaza, more than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023 and at least 17,000 of them are children. The lost generation that Lazzarini is talking about is now a reality. No one has an idea how this war will end or when. But what is certain is that, even when it ends, more than a million Palestinian children in Gaza will continue to suffer from psychological and physical trauma. It is almost impossible to imagine how the education system can ever be restored. Israel has destroyed nearly all universities and 90 percent of schools have been either severely damaged or destroyed. The same applies to the health system, which also lies in ruins. UN experts in April expressed grave concern over the pattern of attacks on schools, universities, teachers and students in the Gaza Strip, raising serious alarm over the systematic destruction of the Palestinian education system. 'With more than 80 percent of schools in Gaza damaged or destroyed, it may be reasonable to ask if there is an intentional effort to comprehensively destroy the Palestinian education system, an action known as ‘scholasticide,’' the experts said. This term refers to the systematic obliteration of education through the arrest, detention or killing of teachers, students and staff and the destruction of educational infrastructure. Experts, including Israelis, agree that Israel has run out of military targets in Gaza. The systematic bombing of schools and hospitals is instead aligned with political goals: making Gaza unlivable, the displacement of hundreds of thousands, and ethnic cleansing. The targeting of so-called safe areas, like Mawasi near Khan Younis, has only one goal: terrorizing the civilians, who are primarily women and children. While the International Court of Justice deliberates on whether Israel is carrying out genocide in Gaza, it is disturbing that the court has remained silent over Israel’s destruction of hospitals and schools and the use of starvation as a weapon, in violation of its provisional order issued in January. In January, the court found it plausible that Israel’s acts could amount to genocide and issued six provisional measures, ordering Tel Aviv to take all measures within its power to prevent genocidal acts, including avoiding and punishing incitement to genocide, ensuring aid and services reach Palestinians under siege in Gaza and preserving evidence of crimes committed in Gaza. Israel has targeted UNRWA staff and buildings in Gaza from the onset, knowing full well that the agency provides essential services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the Strip. Despite living under Israeli blockade for decades, Gaza had among the most developed education and health systems in the region. It is horrifying that the deliberate destruction of both is meant to deny those who survive the war any hope of having access to a decent education or an acceptable health system. The current Israeli government has taken steps to partition the narrow Gaza Strip and create buffer zones that no Palestinians will be allowed to enter. What was already the most crowded strip of land in the world will become even smaller. How the surviving people of Gaza will manage their lives under such conditions is difficult to imagine. The lost generation of Palestinians in Gaza will be at the mercy of radicals and opportunists. Israeli atrocities have left indelible scars in the hearts of hundreds of thousands of young Palestinians. How that generation views Israel today and in the future puts the whole narrative of peace-building and coexistence in the region in doubt.

How To Secure Syria’s Weapons Of Mass Destruction – Analysis	By Can Kasapoğlu The Ongoing Threat from Assad’s Weapons of Mass Destruction This weekend, a joint offensive of various armed opposition groups toppled the dictatorship of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad, ending his clan’s 53-year rule. But while the Assad regime is gone, its WMD program remains an urgent problem for the international community. Assad, who is believed to have fled to Russia, leaves a legacy marked by the pursuit and use of WMDs. In 2013, when Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and agreed to disarm its chemical weapons program, the Assad regime reportedly declared 1,300 tons of chemical warfare agents and precursors and 1,230 unfilled WMD-delivery munitions across 41 facilities at 23 different locations. But declassified Cold War–era data and recent military intelligence assessments suggest that Syria’s chemical warfare efforts run even deeper than those figures suggest. Just last week, Izumi Nakamitsu, the United Nations under secretary general and high representative for disarmament affairs, warned the UN Security Council that unresolved issues surrounding Syria’s elimination of its chemical weapons program are 'extremely worrying.' In its 2023 special report, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) also noted that the Assad regime may possess undeclared stockpiles of chemical weapons. This would be no surprise given that Assad’s Syrian Arab Army used lethal agents against its own people long after its 2013 commitment to disarm—including a sarin nerve gas attack on April 4, 2017, in the town of Khan Shaykhun and a deadly chemical salvo on April 7, 2018, in the town of Douma. In response to these violations, Washington (and later a coalition of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom) struck Syria’s chemical weapons production centers and related military targets. The need for similar international cooperation to address the threat posed by Syria’s weapons of mass destruction is no less urgent now that Assad is gone. Three items are of particular concern to the West: VX nerve agent stockpiles, unknown biological weapons capacity, and recent snake venom derivative production. VX Nerve Agent Of the Assad regime’s chemical warfare agents, VX is perhaps the most dangerous. VX rapidly disrupts the signals the brain sends to vital organs, and even limited exposure to the agent can kill a person in minutes. It can be disseminated through aerosols or dispersed into food and water supplies. According to experts, Syria possesses a substantial quantity of VX. Weapons inspectors have also found undeclared traces of the nerve agent in the country. The West needs to secure the regime’s stockpile of this deadly chemical weapon lest it falls into the hands of terrorist groups or rogue states. Biological Weapons Know-How and Research Syria signed but never ratified the Biological Weapons Convention. In July 2012 Syrian Foreign Office spokesman Jihad Makdissi stated that Damascus would never use its chemical or biological weapons, implicitly acknowledging their existence for the first time. In 2014, James Clapper, then the US director of national intelligence, assessed that Syria’s biological weapons program may have progressed beyond research and development and achieved a limited capability to produce biological agents. Clapper also affirmed what many had suspected: that Assad’s Syria had cooperated with North Korea on weapons of mass destruction. Experts have testified before Congress that Pyongyang has managed to weaponize various bioagents, including the contagious and deadly smallpox. Several publications suggest that Damascus and Pyongyang might have acquired smallpox strains from the 1972 Yugoslavian outbreak and modified them. The potential that Syria and North Korea exchanged bioweapons underscores why the international community needs to heighten its vigilance and cooperation to address future WMD threats. Snake Venom Derivatives Open-source intelligence also suggests that Syria’s Scientific Studies and Research Center (CERS) has been researching bioweapons derived from the venom of snakes, including the Indian cobra. That snake’s venom contains powerful post-synaptic neurotoxins and a dangerous cardiotoxin that can beweaponized. Moreover, a pharmaceutical research center run by the Razi Institute in the Iranian city of Karaj might be attempting to weaponize the venom of another lethal snake, the Caspian cobra. Tehran’s military-grade biological research has previously been linked to the Razi Institute, particularly the institute’s vaccine and serum programs. In recent years, Tehran and Damascus have boosted cooperation between Syria’s CERS and Iran’s Razi, raising eyebrows over the rogue states’ research into bioweapons derived from naturally occurring toxins. Previously, the Islamic Republic sought to employ scientists from the Soviet Union’s massive germ warfare program. Though unconventional, these weapons would be deadly in the wrong hands. Securing Syria’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Containing an established and well-dispersed WMD program is no easy task. Yet concerned nations have already begun efforts to ensure that the threat from Syria’s weapons of mass destruction dies with the regime that built the weapons. This weekend, the Israeli Air Force launched a series of attacksagainst Syrian military airbases suspected of harboring chemical weapons. The international community should be ready to intervene further at the first sign that Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles are at risk of being seized by nefarious actors. The OPCW should be granted full access to any undeclared chemical weapons sites. Safeguarding the regime’s documentation of its chemical weapons program—and military uses of it—will likely be a high priority for those seeking to levy war crimes charges against Assad and his generals. In this respect the armed opposition’s rhetoric has been somewhat promising, but still needs to be proven reliable. Furthermore, the West should encourage the new Syrian regime to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention and ratify the Biological Weapons Convention. The United States and its allies should also work to prevent Syria’s weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of hostile actors such as Hezbollah and its backers in Tehran, as well as al-Qaeda and the terrorist networks of the Islamic State (ISIS). The personnel involved in the research and production of chemical and biological weapons are as important as the agents they produce. Terrorist networks and rogue states will stalk these experts to all corners of the world to acquire their knowledge. Keeping intelligence channels open with the incoming Syrian governance structure will be essential in tracking and securing these critical personnel. Though Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship has fallen, his regime’s weapons still threaten the world. The West should remain vigilant to contain the chaos that is consuming Syria as best it can.

From South Africa To Syria, Rising Perils For Palestine Solidarit...	The sudden regime overthrow in Syria and the long-delayed opportunity to confront the legacy of Bashar al-Assad’s tyranny are either being celebrated or condemned, as explored below, but they come at a time that poses profound problems for solidarity with Palestine. In Johannesburg, these problems are particularly acute given contradictions exposed last week. There was first, the South African government’s two-faced approach to Israel – condemnatory at The Hague, yet with President Cyril Ramaphosa apparently now backing away from anti-genocide ‘megaphone diplomacy,’ and allowing increased profiteering from local exports into Israel (coal especially, but also diamonds, grapes and even bullets) – just at the moment, second, that Ramaphosa took up formal leadership of the G20 group of wealthy and middle-income states, as the baton was passed from Brazilian President Lula Ignacio da Silva. To signal the dangers associated with G20 fusion of imperial and sub-imperial economies, Ramaphosa began preparing to host the November 2025 Summit here in his primary hometown by obsequiously offering a state visit and round of golf to Donald Trump. Also underway this week are meetings between G20 finance ministry and central bank officials planning their 2025 reform agenda. Moreover, there is increasing clarity on G20 climate change policy, thanks to a refusal at the recent Baku UN climate summit by South Africa’s new white, rightwing environment minister, Dion George, to respect the African delegates’ critiques of Western climate finance offerings. But before exploring such African fissures and G20 fusions on another occasion, two urgent challenges arise due first to Ramaphosa’s retreat from Palestine solidarity, and second to the fall of the half-century old rule of the Assad family on December 8 followed by Moscow exile. Pretoria enters the West Asian drama, this time stage right A common concern in Johannesburg is that the reinsertion of Trumpism in coming weeks will hasten the genocide of Palestinians and erasure of their homelands, and further destabilize not only West Asia, but also amplify a long-lasting Washington-Pretoria-Tel Aviv relay in which mutual economic interests dominate. Beyond the historical function of the three states collaborating in 1970s-80s nuclear weapons technology, the relay dates most conspicuously, a decade ago, to Ramaphosa predecessor Jacob Zuma’s capitulation to Barack Obama and local South African Zionists during an earlier Gaza War. A repeat performance is most worrying to progressives here, in large part because South Africa’s Richards Bay bulk minerals port has become – since August – the world’s main terminal for exporting coal to Israel, which depends on the Orot Rabin and Rutenberg power stations for nearly 20% of its energy grid. It is to be expected that Trump will go on the offensive against the South African filing of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) genocide case against Israel. Trump is a proponent of Israel’s mass murder and illegal settlements, callingpredecessor Joe Biden a 'very bad Palestinian' during a debate last June, for not sufficiently helping Netanyahu to ‘finish the job’ in Gaza. But instead of helping to build the global movement against Israel by highlighting Trump’s threats, Ramaphosa’s new Ambassador to Washington Ebrahim Rasool – formerly part of the ruling party’s leftwing currents – let slip in an interview this week: 'We need to put away the [Palestine-solidarity] megaphone now. And the president’s words were, it is now sub judice… I understand the need to completely recalibrate…that’s the art of the deal. It is about framing the messages in particular ways that make South Africa an ally [of Trump].' Some might be surprised at this betrayal, including Ramaphosa’s nonsensical sub judice posture. Yet beyond its important ideological advocacy megaphone used at the Hague international courts, the Pretoria government has barely lifted a finger for Palestine. Backlash against Pretoria begins The Boycott Divestment Sanctions ‘BDS’ strategy called for by the broadest-ever range of Palestinian civil society in 2005 peacefully addresses one of Israel’s major vulnerabilities: fossil-energy supply. Yet Ramaphosa’s brother-in-law Patrice Motsepe runs a major mining house that partners with Glencore – as did Ramaphosa himself until he became deputy president in 2014 – and thus serves as the main co-supplier of coal to fuel Israel’s genocide of Palestine. Activists insist on BDS, on ending diplomatic recognition of Israel, and on prosecution of South African mercenaries who illegally serve the Israel Defense Force, but they are making virtually no progress. Roshan Dadoo, the coordinator of the local Boycott Divestment Sanctions BDS Coalition, wrote in Amandla! magazine last week, 'South Africa is increasingly being seen as hypocritical, as it does not follow through with implementing the findings of the ICJ… Government has certainly not taken all measures within its power. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation says that coal sales to Israel are a trade-related matter. The BDS Coalition Energy Embargo campaign has been trying to meet the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, but with little success. A meeting was set up and then cancelled at the last minute, leaving activists frustrated.' Reflecting that frustration, leading personalities associated with South Africa’s three main (often fractious) local progressive political traditions – which might be termed ‘multipolar’, ‘independent-internationalist’ and ‘liberal-constitutionalist’ – penned a strong Open Letter last week: respectively, former Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils, trade union leader Zwelinzima Vavi and anti-apartheid veteran Rev. Frank Chikane. They warned, 'It looks increasingly like the South African government is reluctant to follow its own logic and uphold its legal obligations to isolate and sanction apartheid Israel.' According to Kasrils, Vavi and Chikane, those obligations include following the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Advisory Opinion ruling offered in July, to halt 'aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel’s illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.' The vast majority of countries voting at the UN General Assembly in September (including South Africa) agreed with the ICJ, that the world must 'prevent trade or investment relations that assist in the maintenance of the illegal situation created by Israel.' Coal fuels genocide But as Kasrils, Vavi and Chikane observe, coal mined especially by Swiss-based Glencore and its longest-standing Johannesburg partner since 2006, African Rainbow Minerals (ARM), is still being 'supplied to Israel to generate electricity used to fuel genocide, the Israeli Occupation Forces, including production of military equipment, and maintaining the system of apartheid and illegal settlements.' In spite of ICJ and UN mandates, trade minister Parks Tau claimed in parliament when asked about coal a few weeks ago, 'Sanctions applied by one member against another in the absence of multilateral sanctions by the United Nations would violate the World Trade Organisation principle of non-discrimination and would open the country to legal challenge.' Tau’s specious argument results in his refusal to regulate a dangerous export, a commonly-used state tool. Tau is not the only minister to ignore appeals to abide by the ICJ/UN mandate to disempower the Israeli genocidaires. Pretoria’s Transport Minister Barbara Creecy also refuses to answer BDS correspondence, though she is responsible for Transnet, whose 'rail shipments and Richards Bay port facilitation subsidize the export of coal, which is a state-owned natural resource,' complain Kasrils, Vavi and Chikane. Another guilty of dereliction is Environment Minister George, who last month co-chaired the climate mitigation committee of the UN climate summit in Azerbaijan (which is also the main supplier of oil to Israel). As Kasrils, Vavi and Chikane point out, over the past year, with a coal price 'average of $110/ton, Glencore earns net profits of $40 for each ton of coal sold, what with production costs of $70/ton. Each ton burned creates 2.6 tons of CO2 emissions. The resulting ‘social cost of carbon’ is $1056/ton burned, resulting in a net negative impact of nearly $2-billion climate damage due to South African coal sold [to Israel] since October 2023. So, these coal shipments fuel both Israel’s genocide and the climate crisis.' South Africa’s supply is increasingly vital to Israel, which currently relies on coalto power 17.5% of the electricity in its national grid. The last time fully-disaggregated UN Comtrade coal data were available, in 2021 (before Russia disguised its trade due to sanctions), Israel imported 6.5 million tons, of which 50% was Colombian, 36% Russian, 13% South African and 1% Turkish. In 2023 Israel consumed 5.2 million tons. According to a June 2024 SPGlobal report, between January-May 2024, of 1.4 million tons, Colombia accounted for 60% and 'other key suppliers included Russia with 247,500, South Africa at 169,200, the U.S. at 86,100 and China supplying 53,000.' In May 2024, Turkey imposed full trade sanctions on Israel, although dishonest shippers rerouteexports. The maritime-data company Kpler issued South African BDS activists with new data in November for ships bringing coal to Israel’s Hadera and Ashdod coal ports, revealing that a Chinese firm has apparently resumed shipments, along with one from Australia. Another data source, Vessel Tracker, revealed last week that Colombia didn’t conclusively halt coal shipments as anticipated in August, because on November 27 the Navios Felix took a load of coal – most likely from Glencore – to Hadera. The same ship was in Richards Bay on August 11 to load South African coal to Hadera, arriving on September 27, as its owner Navios Partners acknowledgedhow its fleet ships 'for a broad range of high-quality counterparties, such as… Glencore.' Glencore as coal-BDS target As the world’s largest commodity trader, Switzerland-based Glencore offers no apologies or rationale. In May, at Glencore’s Annual General Meeting, one shareholder asked 'if you’re conducting human rights assessments on the use of the coal you’re exporting to Israel to ensure that you’re not held liable'? Board Chairman Kalidas Madhavpeddi replied, 'The company supplies to many countries around the world and it’s almost impossible to tell you the answer to your question.' The shareholder followed up, 'So you don’t check how the coal is being used?' Madhavpeddi replied: 'Coal is used in power generation, that’s simple.' The two Johannesburg-born South African Glencore directors at the AGM – CEO Gary Nagle and Senior Independent Director Gill Marcus – were notably silent during the questioning. In 2006, ARM Coal had been set up thanks to a $135 million loan to Motsepe from Glencore’s predecessor Xstrata, along with nearly half the black firm’s investment capital. The deal was a major reason Motsepe vaulted to becoming South Africa’s richest black businessman. That year, Xstrata bragged of 13 million tons of coal exports from Richards Bay: 'Outside of Europe, Israel was the largest purchaser of the South African operations’ coal production.' Glencore acquired Xstrata in 2013 and inherited the relationship with Motsepe’s ARM Coal. Meanwhile in 2014, Ramaphosa sold his own Glencore-allied firm, Shanduka Coal – including a stake in the enormous Glencore-owned Optimum Mine whose board Ramaphosa chaired – to become SA’s deputy president. As head of the Eskom ‘war room’ in 2014-15, Ramaphosa allegedly instructed the power utility to pay a price 3.5 times the former cost of Optimum coal, with profits to Glencore. Since its 1994 renaming from ‘Marc Rich & Co,’ Glencore has had a terrible reputation in Africa. Initial earnings had included apartheid-era sanctions busting for white South Africa. Its Congolese dealings with Israeli tycoon Dan Gertler continued until the latter’s 2018 blacklisting by the U.S. government. From 2018-22, Glencore was successfully prosecuted under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for widespread bribery and corruption across Africa and Latin America, and paid $1.5 billion in fines. (Suspiciously, it has not been subject to prosecution in South Africa.) Colombia’s Israel coal sales were typically 5% of recent exports, but in South Africa’s case the equivalent was usually lower than 1%, although that may rise to 2% in 2024. Earnings from these exports fluctuate with price and quantity: $101 million in 2021; $184 million in 2022; and $78 million in 2023. But the full costs of coal exports – in terms of local pollution, greenhouse gas damage and depleted hydrocarbons, as well as labor, operating costs and environmental remediation – are far higher than gross income. Still, any worker or community adversely affected by BDS against Glencore and other coal mines prevented from selling to Israel, should in 2025 be first in line for compensation from $14 billion in SA’s Just Energy Transition funding. Another demand was made to Glencore at an August 22 Johannesburg protest: pay reparations, just as did Detroit-based General Motors for profiteering in pre-1994 apartheid South Africa. All firms supporting Israeli genocide should now appreciate this risk. More SA-Israel trade, perhaps including arms Stopping coal sales to Israel is crucial but Pretoria also turns a blind eye to the lucrative diamonds and grape trade. And there are new concerns that a 50% upsurge of artillery ammunition being produced by SA parastatal arms firm Denel in a joint venture with German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall finds its way to Israel. Moreover, both in Pretoria last month and in the U.S. state of Delaware’s bankruptcy courts in August, another weapons link was unveiled when Johannesburg native Ivor Ichikowitz declared that several divisions of his Paramount Group – Africa’s largest privately-held arms dealership – were unable to pay creditors. One of Ichikowitz’s bankruptcy protection requests was for Paramount Industrial Holdings, whose Johannesburg factory was subject to an anti-genocide protest in November 2023. Meanwhile, Paramount South Africa – set up in 2018 to allegedly support ‘black economic empowerment,’ but mainly so as to gain access to SA military procurement contracts – is being accused by United Arab Emirates officials of merely asset-stripping Intellectual Property that is technically owed to Abu Dhabi Autonomous Systems Investments, following a London arbitration ruling against Ichikowitz. In the process of Ichikowitz trying to escape a massive debt to the Emiratis’ drone-manufacturing parastatal, he disclosed not only a previously-reported ongoing joint venture with Elbit, but that the main Israeli arms company retains an address at Ichikowitz’s Johannesburg factory. And Ichikowitz also revealed Paramount’s $725,000 debt to the Israel office of Cognyte Technologies, a spyware firm known previously as a component of Verint, which was prosecuted for corruption in the U.S. and criticized by Amnesty International for contributing to South Sudanese surveillance abuses. Cognyte is also under investigation by even the Israeli courts for providing technology to the Myanmar junta as it carried out a coup and massive civilian killings in early 2021. Earlier this year, South Africa’s leading investigative journalists’ non-profit, Amabhungane, objected to the secretive nature of another of Ichikowitz’s divisions that went bankrupt: 'by operating in low scrutiny jurisdictions, the Paramount group might have placed itself outside of the oversight structures in South Africa that restrict military trade. In addition, questions have been raised about the alleged funding of political interests ranging from South Africa’s ruling party to politicians abroad, and whether political connections have enabled the expansion of the company outside South Africa.' For much of 2023, the Ichikowitz Family Foundation was indeed the single largest funder of Ramaphosa’s ruling party, the African National Congress. And later in the year, as the genocide got underway, the same foundation was a brazen, public supplier of tefillin (spiritual leather garb) to the Israel Defense Forces. As South Africa’s anti-genocide ICJ case began, Ichikowitz published articles in the Chicago Tribune andFortune condemning the proceedings. The Delaware court documents suggest the need for a relook by the Pretoria regulator supposedly monitoring such deals, the South African National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC). Several months ago, the notoriously lax NCACC lost a human rights case in local courts for approving an illegal Myanmar arms deal. The same committee had offered late-2023 denials that Ichikowitz and other local firms worked with the Israel Defense Forces, in spite of Ichikowitz’s mysterious Tel Aviv office and his tefillin supply to the genocidaires. BDS must intensify Could BDS help end the genocide and other IDF attacks? Kasrils, Vavi and Chikane conclude, 'As South Africans, we know that sanctions in support of our liberation struggle played a vital role in bringing down the apartheid regime.' Indeed 1985 when financial sanctions caused such a squeeze that President PW Botha declared a debt default, imposed exchange controls and shut the stock market. The response by business leaders was to visit Zambia to meet exiled black leaders, beginning the democratization process, as whites fearful of further meltdown finally accepted ‘one person, one vote’ democracy. But one reason activists suspect sanctions won’t be imposed unless pressure rises, is the role of Motsepe, a generous financial contributor to a range of local political parties. With a net worth estimate of nearly $3 billion, he is Johannesburg’s richest resident. Motsepe is also the president of the Confederation of African Football and therefore, along with other Federation Internationale de Football Association executives, continues to delay suspension of Israel players from international fixtures, a demand made due to their extensive collusion in genocide and apartheid. Will activists overcome Pretoria’s failures to impose sanctions, to cut diplomatic relations as was mandated by parliament in November 2023, and to prosecute young mercenaries who take their gap year after Herzlia and King David High School degrees to serve as paid IDF genocidaires? A growing activist coalition will be needed. Dadoo notes that 'South Africa’s largest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Unions, and its affiliate, the National Union of Mineworkers, support a ban on coal exports to Israel. So do environmental groups and social justice movements in the country.' Long gone are the days Ramaphosa organized a national strike as the National Union of Mineworkers leader, 37 years ago. But links between the various movements are promising, e.g. on August 22 at Glencore’s Johannesburg headquarters and Cape Town oil company branch, and again on October 8 when climate activists included a protest at the Ichikowitz Family Foundation office during an anti-fossils march – in part because of his role providing military ship and air support to protect Big Oil operating offshore Nigeria and Mozambique – and a leader of SA Jews for Palestine addressed the crowd. Syrian chaos Another new factor that makes BDS work more important everywhere, is Syria’s new government. After pounding his citizenry with bombs and bullets since the Arab Spring arrived in Syria in March 2011, leaving more than 600,000 dead and six million exiled refugees, Bashar al-Assad had witnessed the carving of his country into a balkanized set of territories characterized by U.S., Russian, Turkish and Israel land and resource grabs. The stunning 12-day military campaign coordinated by Türkiye-backed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, began the day after Lebanon’s remaining Hezbollah leadership signed a dubious cease-fire with Benjamin Netanyahu’s regime, on November 27. On December 6, the Israel Defense Forces demolished the crossing from Lebanon to Syria to prevent Hezbollah from importing arms from Iran, but also to halt any Lebanese fighters’ defense of Assad against the rapid HTS advance into the capital city of Damascus. This has provoked a series of reactions, including at least three dueling leftwing narratives, as usual distinguishing between an emphasis on top-down geopolitricks and bottom-up, social-struggle: 1) a critique of the role of imperialist+sub-imperialist powers – especially Washington-Tel Aviv-Ankara – in a behind-the-curtain, ‘dirty war’ manipulation of HTS jihadis: e.g., in Mohammad Marandi’s account of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s and Joe Biden’s current de facto support for al-Qaeda extremists, or in Vijay Prashad’s summation that 'Israeli bombardment of Syrian military facilities had weakened the Syrian armed forces’ logistical and ordinance capabilities… [and] attacks on Iranian supply depots and military facilities in Syria as well as the attacks by Israel on Iran had prevented any build up of Iranian forces to defend the Syrian government… conflict in Ukraine had certainly denied Syria the ability to call upon further Russian assistance… HTS has received aid and support from Turkey, but also covertly from Israel.' 2) in contrast to manipulation, a recognition that for U.S. and Israeli military interests, as Gilbert Achar puts it, 'the Assad regime and HTS are almost equally bad' – so instead, the explanatory emphasis is on sectarian religious infighting (which weakened the government army’s commitment to defend Assad’s terrain) plus degraded Iranian, Hezbollah and Russian support for Damascus, that together, provided a gap for HTS – but leaving profound concerns that the extreme-Islamist values of HTS and allies, and oppression of secular democratic forces, mean very tough times ahead, including for the Rojava movement of progressive Kurds in northern Syria; and 3) a celebration of the role of popular will in overthrowing the brutal Assad, leaving us with a generally-progressive, bottom-up success story containing democratic and anti-patriarchal potentials, notwithstanding some dubious elements and threats of restored sectarian extremism: e.g. in Moazzem Begg’s approving description of ecstatic Syrians who long suffered Assad’s totalitarianism and torture chambers, or in in Michal Karadjis’ interpretationthat 'The Syrian revolution returns with a bang,' and also in the liberal and feminist elements of the Free Syria Certainly each of the three perspectives contain a degree of truth, but just to disclose, my own far-away interpretation lies somewhere between the second (realist) and third (hopeful) arguments, while still recognizing the fundamental truths of the first line of argument: U.S. imperial malevolence, Israeli regional sub-imperialism, and Turkish brutality to its southern neighbor’s citizenry. The overarching point, though, is that waging a thirteen-year long set of diverse struggles by movements with so many fractured elements, means many dirty deals were (and are) done – e.g. the Kurds of Rojava getting on-and-off protection from Washington while still managing to run a quasi-liberated zone deservedly famous for progressive advances in social ecology, feminism and municipal-socialist collaboration in the style of Murray Bookchin’s bottom-up confederalism. At least, for the sake of clarity, Washington’s interests in having a 1000-strong troop presence in Syria were not to support Rojava, no matter the Kurds’ in holding at bay extreme Islam’s armies. Instead, Trump made clear his reason for betraying Rojava by moving hundreds of U.S. army forces around the northeastern region in late 2019, when during a White House meeting he intonedto Erdoğan, 'We want to worry about our things [sic]. We’re keeping the oil. We have the oil. The oil is secure. We left troops behind only for the oil.' Although he is forever committed to resource grabs, Trump has more recently expressed nervousness about the 500 remaining U.S. troops being ‘caught in the middle,’ declaring to Robert F. Kennedy Jr that he wanted to pull them out. Meanwhile this week, not only do the four remaining U.S. army bases in the northeast appear to be fully operational, so are the Russian military’s Tartus Mediterranean naval port and Khmeimim air base in western Syria. Early indications are that the Kurdish liberation movement will defend Rojava, in spite of 100 000 refugees now fleeing violence. The Kurds are fighting the Syrian National Army – which violently captured the city of Manbij just after Damascus fell on Sunday – and also repelling Erdoğan’s ongoing opportunistic attacks. Erdoğan would be furious if an independent Kurdish state emerges from the Rojava Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, because it would empower progressive Kurdish activists across West Asia, especially in Türkiye. One Rojava statement celebrated Assad’s fall. Yet no one doubts the danger that a full-fledged collapse of Syrian central state power – and ultimately a far worse balkanization and extremist Islamic state – may result from the turmoil. And for Syria’s masses, including Kurds and hundreds of thousands who do not yet dare return from exile, the need for solidarity could again become acute. Balance needed, as Sam Husseini explains, is that 'It’s possible that the US and other outside forces will decapitate Syria. And it’s possible that they will keep it technically whole but subservient. Or it’s possible that genuine freedom and dignity will assert themselves there and a new Syria will be a meaningful force for good.' The approach from Hamas was to congratulate 'the brotherly Syrian people on their success in achieving their aspirations for freedom and justice. We call on all components of the Syrian people to unite, enhance national cohesion, and rise above the pains of the past… Hamas strongly condemns the repeated brutal aggression by the Zionist occupation against Syrian territories and firmly rejects any Zionist ambitions or schemes targeting brotherly Syria, its land and its people.' The clarity which brave Palestinians provide the world remind of the interrelationships between geopolitics, political economy and bottom-up solidarity – especially critical at a time when even the South African and Colombian governments are failing to meet reasonable expectations to help end genocide.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI99yvk1jmlyp	2024-12-11T16:11:29-08:00	
Scholz Submits Request To Hold Confidence Vote, Paves Way For Feb...	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz submitted a request to hold a vote of confidence on Wednesday (11 December), setting in motion the process for Germany to hold snap elections in February 2025, as planned. Scholz had announced last month that Germany would hold early elections after his government coalition collapsed over a dispute on economic policy. He told journalists in Berlin on Wednesday that he had asked the President of the German Bundestag, Bärbel Bas, to schedule the necessary vote of confidence for next Monday (16 December). If a majority of lawmakers votes against the chancellor – as expected – Scholz can ask the German President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to dissolve parliament, possibly on 27 December, paving the way for early elections. Scholz had initially stated he would want to hold elections in March, but with mounting pressure to facilitate an earlier date, he settled on 23 February 2025. The elections would allow voters to decide 'how we answer the big questions that lie ahead of us,' Scholz said in Berlin. He named the primary challenges as facilitating more investment, protecting jobs, modernising Germany’s industry, maintaining pensions, health, and care systems, and approaching a just peace in Ukraine 'without dragging Germany into the war.' Scholz also reiterated his intention to pass a number of legislative measures before the parliamentary Christmas recess. But the list has shrunk significantly compared to Scholz’s announcement immediately after the breakdown of his government on 6 November. While he then wanted to implement a pension reform and support packages for businesses, Scholz merely listed his intention to pass tweaks to tax, transport and benefits systems and cap energy costs on Wednesday. His coalition government of Social Democrats (SPD/S&D) and Greens (Greens/EFA) has been short of a majority since the departure of the Free Democrats (FDP/Renew), however. The FDP and the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU/EPP), the largest opposition party, have already made it clear that they will not support anything but the most rudimentary necessities, accusing the chancellor of masking election gifts as necessary measures. Scholz’s SPD is currently poised to lose power, as it is polling in third place, far behind the CDU/CSU and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD/ESN) in second place.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI6PeL2qpKFR1	2024-12-11T16:09:01-08:00	
Ukraine Caught In The Middle As US-China Trade Hostilities Target...	By Reid Standish (RFE/RL) -- Escalating trade hostilities between China and the United States are putting drone supplies critical to Ukraine’s war effort in the crosshairs. U.S. media reports suggest Chinese manufacturers are limiting the sale of vital drone components to companies in the United States and the European Union that supply the parts to Ukraine. The Chinese restrictions could hinder Ukraine on the battlefield, where drones have played a pivotal role. Kyiv’s arsenal of cheap but effective drones is used for reconnaissance, dropping explosives on targets, and defending against Russian attacks. Beijing’s move is seen as a response to Washington’s decision in December to restrict the sale of high-bandwidth memory chips and additional semiconductor equipment to China. In reaction, Beijing has already banned the sale of dual-use items to the American military and several materials with high-tech and military applications to U.S. companies. But cutting supplies to drone components that form a key part of Ukraine’s war effort against Russia marks a new element of the escalating trade tensions. The Chinese move, experts say, also sends a message to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration of China’s ability to counter sanctions imposed by Washington. 'This is partly a response to U.S. tariffs and a form of punishment for American export control measures,' said Joseph Webster, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. 'But restricting this drone tech will have battlefield consequences for Ukraine and could be important ahead of potential cease-fire negotiations.' Affordable and commercially available drones have become a staple of the nearly three-year war in Ukraine for both Kyiv and Moscow. The United States maintains an edge in larger military drones. But China dominates the market for cheaper and smaller drones and their components, which have dual-use civilian and military applications. Several independent surveys estimate that China controls 90 percent of the drone market in the United States and 80 percent globally. Given this foothold, experts have warned about a growing dependence on China’s control over the global supply chain for drones. Washington has expressed a need to create new supply chains as tit-for-tat trade moves between Beijing and Washington are poised to escalate under the second Trump administration. 'These new controls only underscore the importance of strengthening our efforts with other countries to de-risk and diversify critical supply chains away from [China],' a State Department spokesperson told RFE/RL. China’s Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to RFE/RL’s request for comment. The Trade War Meets The Drone War Since 2019, China has created what it called an 'unreliable entity list' to penalize companies that undermine Chinese national interests and introduced rules to punish firms that comply with U.S. restrictions on Chinese entities. The broader reach of these laws enables Beijing to potentially choke global access to critical components, including materials like rare earths and lithium that form essential components in everything from smartphones to electric vehicles. In terms of the latest limits on shipments of drone components to the United States and Europe, Chinese producers of motors, batteries, and flight controllers have cut the quantities they deliver or in some cases stopped shipments altogether. One notable example occurred in October when the U.S. drone maker Skydio, which supplies Ukraine’s military, was hit by Chinese sanctions in response to winning a contract from the Taiwanese government. Skydio has been heralded as a homegrown U.S. alternative to Chinese manufacturers and dependence on Chinese supply chains. While the U.S. firm had spent years building a supply chain outside China for its products, it still relied on the country for one vital component: batteries. The Chinese restriction on the supply of batteries to Skydio left the company scrambling to source the items and set back shipments to its clients, which includes the U.S. military, which in turn supplies Kyiv. In Search Of New Supply Chains For Kyiv, lessening its dependence on the Chinese supply chain to source drones for the battlefield has proved elusive, with many Ukrainian drone producers still relying on Chinese parts to make the cheap and effective weapons. China in July announced a ban on exports of drones for military use, and Beijing has claimed that it does not provide weapons to Russia or Ukraine. But the continued flow of dual-use equipment from China to Russia has aided the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Now, the new restrictions by the Chinese government have made it more difficult for Ukraine to acquire drones and their parts. In the case of Skydio, Beijing imposed sanctions before the company had secured alternative suppliers, but the firm is reportedly in talks with several companies in Asia, including those in Japan and Taiwan. Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, is looking to shore up its own drone supply chain given their growing importance in modern warfare and the specter of a potential conflict with Beijing that could see Taiwan cut off. The self-governing island has stepped up its efforts and has also formed ties with European countries around drone technologies. Its foreign minister led a delegation to discuss the topic in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland in November and signed memorandums of understanding to advance drone development with all three countries. 'These Chinese trade restrictions could lead to new supply drone chains popping up,' said Webster of the Atlantic Council. 'But expect China to also want to restrict their development.'

US: Russia Could Target Ukraine Again With New Missile	A U.S. intelligence assessment has concluded that Russia could launch another of its experimental hypersonic ballistic missiles against Ukraine in the coming days, although Washington does not consider it to be decisive in the nearly three-year war, a U.S. official said Wednesday. Russia first fired the Oreshnik missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Nov. 21, in what President Vladimir Putin characterized as a response to Ukraine's first use of long-range U.S. and British missiles to strike deeper into Russian territory with Western permission. 'We assess that the Oreshnik is not a game-changer on the battlefield, but rather just another attempt by Russia to terrorize Ukraine, which will fail,' the U.S. official told reporters. There was no immediate response from Russia. Putin has previously said Russia may fire the Oreshnik missile again, possibly to target 'decision-making centers' in Kyiv, if Ukraine keeps attacking Russia with long-range Western weapons. Russia's defense ministry said that Ukraine had attacked a military airfield in the southern Russian city of Taganrog on Wednesday morning with six of the U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles and promised retaliation. It said all six had been intercepted, but that falling missile debris had caused some injuries. The Russian leader has claimed that the Oreshnik is impossible to intercept and that it has destructive power comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead. Some Western experts have said the novel feature of the Oreshnik is that it carries multiple warheads capable of simultaneously striking different targets — something usually associated with longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles. A surveillance camera video of the strike three weeks ago showed huge fireballs piercing the darkness and slamming into the ground at astonishing speed. Within hours of Ukraine’s attack on the Russian military facility, Putin took the rare step of speaking on national TV to boast about the new, hypersonic missile. He warned the West that its next use could be against Ukraine's NATO allies, which allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Nonetheless, the U.S. official downplayed the usefulness of the missiles, calling them 'experimental' in nature and said that 'Russia likely possesses only a handful' of them. The official also said the weapon has a smaller warhead than other missiles Russia has deployed in Ukraine. The United States says it is sending more air defense systems to Ukraine even as Russia gains territory in eastern Ukraine six weeks ahead of Donald Trump becoming the U.S. president again. Trump has been a skeptic of continuing U.S. support for Ukraine. Trump has said he will end the war before he takes office but has not said how. He has pointedly refused to say he wants Ukraine to win the war, leaving Washington's long-term military support for Ukraine in question. Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris over the weekend. Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Tuesday that a rescue operation was 'currently under way' in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, following a Russian missile strike that killed three people and injured 18 others. Zelenskyy added that Ukraine does not have enough air defense systems to protect it from Russian missiles. 'But our partners do have these systems. We repeat, again and again, that air defense systems should save lives, not collect dust in storage bases,' he said. Separately, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday that Ukraine-Russia peace talks could begin 'in the winter,' a timeline that coincides with Poland taking over the rotating presidency of the European Union on January 1. Tusk offered few details about where, when or even who would be involved in the negotiations, but he told his Cabinet he hoped the 'end effect' of the EU's negotiations would result in peace for Ukraine. Tusk, however, indicated that Poland, which has been a staunch supporter of neighboring Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country in February 2022, will be a major participant in the talks. 'I really want Poland to be the country that will not only be present but will set the tone for these decisions that are to bring us security and secure Polish interests,' the prime minister said. Separately, France’s Macron is expected to meet with Tusk Thursday in Warsaw to discuss Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI7VeiPtDcMc_	2024-12-11T16:04:42-08:00	
Regime Change Inc.: The Deep State’s Playbook For Disobedient Nat...	In the clandestine arenas of global power dynamics, the ideals of democracy, liberty, and human rights are often wielded as instruments of strategic manipulation, serving as pretexts for orchestrating regime changes across the world. While these interventions are publicly cloaked in the language of altruism—aiming to liberate oppressed societies—the ground realities reveal a starkly different narrative: one of destabilization, unending turmoil, and nations plunged into chaos. Over the decades, the United States and its allies have played a central role in reconfiguring the political trajectories of states that dare to diverge from their strategic interests. A forewarning of this grim pattern emerged in 2008, during an Arab League summit in Damascus. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, holding up a chilling visual of Saddam Hussein’s execution, declared ominously: 'Your turn will come; they will come for you. What happened to Saddam will happen to you too.' His prophecy, met with laughter from the likes of Hosni Mubarak and Bashar al-Assad, unfolded with unsettling precision in the years that followed: Egypt (2011): The fervor of Arab Spring protests unseated Hosni Mubarak after three decades of autocratic rule. Though Mubarak relinquished power to the military in an effort to avoid violent reprisal, he spent six subsequent years under various forms of detention. Libya (2011): Muammar Gaddafi himself met a brutal end, captured and executed following a NATO-led intervention. Libya, once among Africa’s most prosperous nations, descended into a maelstrom of civil war, lawlessness, and humanitarian crisis. Syria (2011): Bashar al-Assad endured a protracted civil war, fueled by US-backed opposition forces aiming to unseat him. Although Assad clings to power, Syria remains devastated, with millions displaced and its infrastructure in ruins. This modus operandi is far from a modern phenomenon. In 1953, the CIA-engineered Operation Ajax overthrew Iran’s democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh. In 2003, Iraq became a theater for US-led invasion under the pretense of eliminating non-existent weapons of mass destruction, culminating in the ousting of Saddam Hussein. In both instances, nations that were stable—albeit under authoritarian regimes—were thrust into prolonged chaos. Recent examples continue to illustrate this calculated strategy. In Bangladesh (2024), US-backed student uprisings led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who had helmed the nation’s economic ascent. The aftermath has seen the country mired in economic decline and social unrest. Similarly, Pakistan (2022) experienced political upheaval with the removal of Prime Minister Imran Khan amid allegations of foreign interference, plunging the nation into a quagmire of political and economic instability. The agenda behind these interventions is unmistakable: regimes that challenge US hegemony or fail to align with its geopolitical imperatives are systematically targeted. Beneath the veneer of championing democracy and human rights lies a more pragmatic pursuit—control over resources, regional dominance, and ideological conformity. History unequivocally demonstrates that the repercussions of such interventions are calamitous. The aftermath typically manifests as persistent instability, economic regression, and humanitarian catastrophes. Despite these devastating consequences, the cycle continues, highlighting the extent to which powerful nations exploit moral pretexts to safeguard their interests. As an old adage goes, 'He who laughs last laughs best.' While Gaddafi’s grim prediction was initially dismissed with derision, its haunting accuracy reverberates in the fates of leaders and nations that dared to defy the prevailing global order. This article seeks to unravel the intricate mechanics of regime change politics, dissecting the underlying motives and the far-reaching implications of these interventions. A Resurgence of Regime Change: The Deep State’s Unyielding Agenda In recent years, a troubling trend has resurfaced—a renewed wave of regime changes, masked under the pretense of promoting democracy and safeguarding human rights. While such tactics have long been integral to Western geopolitical strategies, the recent upheavals in Bangladesh and Syria signify a calculated escalation by the deep state in its relentless quest for dominance. These coups are far from isolated events; they form part of a broader strategy to assert control over strategically vital regions and coerce nations into serving specific geopolitical, economic, and ideological interests. Bangladesh: An Economic Success Story Undermined Under Sheikh Hasina's leadership, Bangladesh achieved remarkable progress, emerging as one of South Asia's fastest-growing economies. Despite inherent challenges such as a dense population and limited natural resources, her government maintained political stability, achieved robust GDP growth, and implemented transformative social reforms. Yet, her increasing alignment with China and her resistance to Western influence made her a prime target for regime change. The 2024 coup was preceded by ostensibly organic student protests, ostensibly demanding expanded reservations in government jobs and educational opportunities. While these grievances were legitimate, the protests’ scale and coordination bore unmistakable signs of external orchestration. Bolstered by substantial financial backing from international actors and amplified by a complicit media, these protests rapidly escalated into nationwide unrest. Western narratives painted Hasina’s government as authoritarian, undermining her domestic and international standing. The ensuing regime change replaced her administration with a more malleable government aligned with Western strategic imperatives. However, the consequences for Bangladesh have been catastrophic. A nation on a stable growth trajectory now grapples with economic decline, political fragility, and widespread social unrest—a grim reminder of how national progress is often the collateral damage of the deep state’s ambitions. Syria: Rekindling the Flames of Proxy War Syria’s civil war, which erupted in 2011, remains one of the most devastating conflicts in modern history. The attempt to unseat Bashar al-Assad was part of a broader effort to dismantle the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis and reshape the Middle East in favor of US and Israeli interests. While Assad weathered years of devastating warfare, recent developments suggest a renewed push by the deep state to destabilize his regime. The latest chapter in Syria's turmoil is characterized by reinvigorated support for opposition forces and intensified economic warfare. Crippling sanctions have further devastated the Syrian economy, stoking internal dissent and fueling fresh protests. International NGOs and media outlets have amplified allegations of human rights violations, crafting a narrative to justify further intervention. This meticulously coordinated campaign seeks to erode Assad’s legitimacy and hinder Syria’s recovery from the ravages of war. Also it can be seen through the prism of broader geopolitical maneuvers like Russia’s entanglement in Ukraine, highlights the persistent drive of external actors to reshape Syria’s future while undermining Moscow’s strategic influence in the region. The Deep State’s Multifaceted Objectives The underlying motives of the deep state in orchestrating these regime changes are strategic and multifaceted: Geopolitical Realignment: The removal of Sheikh Hasina disrupts China's growing influence in South Asia, reaffirming US dominance in the region. Similarly, undermining Assad weakens Iran and challenges the strategic Russia-China-Iran axis. Resource Exploitation: Syria’s strategic location and its valuable oil and gas reserves remain highly coveted. In Bangladesh, control over key infrastructure projects and critical trade routes is a significant motivator. Suppressing Independent Leadership: Both Hasina and Assad exhibited a defiance against Western interference, making them inevitable targets for destabilization. Preventing Regional Stability: A stable and prosperous Bangladesh challenges Western narratives about South Asia’s dependence on external intervention. Conversely, a revitalized Syria disrupts Western hegemony in the Middle East. The Mechanics of Modern Coups The deep state employs a sophisticated array of tactics to orchestrate regime changes: Economic Coercion: Sanctions and trade embargoes are strategically deployed to debilitate economies and incite public dissatisfaction against governing authorities. Social Manipulation: Protests and uprisings are engineered under the guise of addressing legitimate local grievances, often bolstered by substantial external financial and logistical support. Media Propaganda: Orchestrated media campaigns craft narratives that amplify dissent, portraying leaders as autocrats and governments as illegitimate to erode both domestic and international credibility. Utilization of Proxy Agents: In Syria, militant groups act as destabilizing forces, while in Bangladesh, opposition parties and student organizations serve as instruments of disruption. Far-Reaching Consequences The regime changes in Bangladesh and Syria underscore the deep state’s rejuvenated drive to reshape global political landscapes. These interventions erode national sovereignty, destabilize regions, and prioritize hegemonic interests over the welfare of affected populations. The aftermath is invariably devastating. Nations once on the cusp of progress are left in turmoil, grappling with economic decline, political fragmentation, and societal discord—all in the name of democracy and human rights. As history continues to repeat itself, it becomes evident that these actions are not driven by a genuine commitment to liberty but rather by an insatiable quest for power. This relentless wave of regime changes leaves a trail of destruction, despair, and compromised national identities. Iran Under Siege: A Target of the Deep State Iran remains a focal point in the deep state’s geopolitical strategy, given its pivotal influence in the Middle East, ideological defiance of Western hegemony, and alignment with adversarial powers like Russia and China. As tensions rise over Iran’s role in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and its support for groups like Hamas, efforts to destabilize its regime have intensified. Key Narratives Undermining Iran Mismanagement of Resources: Western-backed media perpetuate claims that the Iranian government prioritizes regional ambitions—such as funding Hamas—over addressing domestic challenges like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. These narratives target younger Iranians, fueling disillusionment with the regime. Women’s Rights as a Flashpoint: Iran’s enforcement of strict moral codes, including hijab mandates, has become a focal point for criticism. Events like Mahsa Amini’s 2022 death in custody spurred protests, organically driven but heavily amplified by external actors and social media campaigns. Women’s rights are strategically used as a rallying cry to galvanize both domestic and international opposition. Allegations of Extremism and Oppression: The regime is frequently depicted as authoritarian and a sponsor of extremism, further isolating it diplomatically while painting an image of internal disconnect and incompetence. Economic Warfare: Long-standing sanctions have devastated Iran’s economy, fueling public frustration. Framed as tools to counter regional threats, these sanctions primarily aim to weaken internal cohesion and stoke unrest. Tactics of Deep State Interference Media Domination: Global media networks amplify dissent within Iran, portraying protests and unrest while downplaying external provocations. Social media platforms serve as echo chambers for anti-government sentiment and mobilization. Backing Opposition Groups: Exiled entities like the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) receive substantial support, despite their limited domestic legitimacy, and are presented as viable alternatives to the current regime. Cultural Subversion: The promotion of Western ideals of individual freedom and gender equality undermines traditional Iranian values, creating a cultural schism. NGOs and cultural organizations serve as conduits for disseminating these ideals. Economic Subjugation: Targeted sanctions exacerbate civilian hardships, directing public ire toward the regime and framing economic struggles as internal failings rather than consequences of external aggression. The overarching agenda regarding Iran appears to focus on systematically undermining its sovereignty, diminishing its cultural identity, and establishing a government that aligns with Western interests. This proposed regime would disrupt Iran’s strategic connections with significant regional partners such as Hezbollah and Hamas, leading to a fundamental shift in the balance of power within the Middle East. It would also reject Iran’s nuclear ambitions, thereby mitigating a key element of its strategic deterrence. Additionally, a shift in foreign policy towards the West would markedly diminish the regional influence of competing powers like China and Russia, thereby altering geopolitical alignments to strengthen Western supremacy. This complex approach highlights a wider initiative to adjust regional interactions to support a Western-oriented global framework. However, historical precedents—such as in Iraq, Libya, and Syria—demonstrate that such regime changes often usher in protracted instability, civil conflict, and humanitarian crises. For Iran, the deep state’s maneuvers represent a profound threat to its sovereignty and the stability of the broader Middle East. Despite efforts to consolidate power and counteract these narratives, the convergence of sanctions, internal dissent, and external interference renders Iran a focal point for the next chapter of regime change. India Under Siege: The Deep State’s Covert Strategy India's ascent on the global stage, bolstered by its independent foreign policy and nationalist government, has made it a prime target for deep state forces. These forces—often embodied by influential financial elites and geopolitical power brokers—focus on destabilizing regimes that challenge their overarching objectives. In recent years, evidence suggests that international actors, in concert with segments of the domestic opposition, are working to undermine the Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. George Soros and the Open Declaration of Hostility A notable expression of this agenda came from billionaire investor George Soros, who publicly criticized Modi’s administration, citing concerns over democracy and human rights. Soros’s call for regime change, while framed in the rhetoric of activism, underscores a broader agenda to destabilize India by leveraging domestic dissent and amplifying socio-political tensions. Key Movements Exploited to Challenge the Indian Government Shaheen Bagh Protests (2019-2020): Initially framed as grassroots opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Shaheen Bagh protests evolved into a global campaign portraying India’s policies as discriminatory. External funding, logistical support, and widespread international media coverage suggest an orchestrated attempt to frame the Indian government as oppressive. NGOs and organizations with international affiliations were instrumental in perpetuating this narrative under the guise of human rights advocacy. Farmers’ Agitation (2020-2021): The protests against agricultural reforms gained significant international traction, with endorsements from foreign celebrities like Greta Thunberg and Rihanna. The infamous 'toolkit' revealed strategies to tarnish India’s image on global platforms, raising concerns about foreign interference in domestic policy debates. Evidence of financial and logistical backing from external sources pointed to a coordinated effort to destabilize the government and undermine its economic reforms. Khalistani Separatism and Diasporic Influence: Reviving the Khalistan movement has been another strategy employed by anti-India forces, particularly in Canada. Diplomatic strains between India and Canada underscore the deep state’s exploitation of diasporic communities to propagate separatist narratives. These efforts aim to disrupt India’s internal stability by fomenting unrest in regions like Punjab and undermining national unity. Political Alignments with External Interests: Allegations of collusion between certain opposition leaders and international actors have surfaced, suggesting coordinated efforts to weaken the Modi government. Reports of financial and strategic support, alongside international lobbying campaigns, often coincide with domestic protests, amplifying narratives that paint the administration as authoritarian and divisive. Broader Objectives of the Deep State in India Eroding India’s Global Influence: India’s rise as a geopolitical heavyweight, coupled with its assertive stance on issues like BRICS, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and trade relations with China, poses a challenge to Western hegemony. The deep state seeks to curb India’s independent foreign policy by discrediting its leadership and creating political instability. Economic Sabotage: India’s burgeoning economy and growing influence in global markets threaten established financial systems dominated by Western powers. Movements such as the farmers' protests and environmental campaigns are leveraged to disrupt key economic reforms and industrial projects, hampering India’s economic trajectory. Exacerbating Societal Divisions: India’s rich socio-religious diversity provides fertile ground for divisive narratives. Misinformation campaigns targeting caste, religion, and regional autonomy are strategically deployed to fracture societal cohesion and create a perception of widespread unrest. Compromising Strategic Autonomy: India’s refusal to align with Western interests on various global issues has drawn the ire of power brokers. Destabilizing the current administration serves the deep state’s aim of installing a more pliant leadership that aligns with Western geopolitical objectives. A Systematic Undermining of Sovereignty The deep state’s focus on India is part of a larger strategy to neutralize emerging powers that prioritize sovereignty and independent policymaking. By exploiting genuine grievances, fueling dissent, and leveraging separatist movements, these forces seek to destabilize India’s political and social fabric. The Modi government has thus far demonstrated resilience in countering these challenges. However, the persistence of these subversive efforts highlights the importance of vigilance. Ensuring national stability will require: Strengthening internal unity across societal and political spectrums. Countering misinformation through transparent and effective communication. Addressing legitimate concerns via democratic mechanisms to neutralize vulnerabilities. In the face of these relentless attempts to undermine its sovereignty, India must remain steadfast, united, and proactive in safeguarding its global standing and internal stability. In summary, the recurring phenomenon of regime changes, presented as efforts to advance democracy and human rights, uncovers a more profound agenda influenced by the strategic objectives of dominant global actors. The interventions in regions such as the Middle East and South Asia systematically undermine the stability of sovereign nations, hindering their political and economic development for the purpose of geopolitical advantage. The situations in Libya, Syria, Bangladesh, and India emphasis the consistent strategies employed by the deep state, including economic coercion, media manipulation, and the exploitation of internal dissent, aimed at destabilizing regimes that oppose Western interests. Although presented as initiatives to promote democratic principles, the actual outcomes of these interventions frequently result in extended instability for nations, eroding their sovereignty and causing enduring humanitarian challenges. As history unfolds, it becomes evident that these actions are driven not by a sincere dedication to liberty, but by an unyielding quest for global supremacy and authority.

Beijing Rapidly Expanding Its Influence Across Russian Far East, ...	Beijing has been rapidly expanding its influence in the economy and government offices of the Russian Far East, often with Vladimir Putin’s help because the defeats he has suffered elsewhere mean that he has no choice but to give in to what the Chinese want, according to Aleksandr Nemets. The US-based Russian analyst says that this trend began more than a decade ago but is accelerating because of Putin’s problems in Ukraine, Syria and with the Russian economy (m.kasparov.org/material.php?id=674D9776C7941&section_id=444F8A447242B&subject_id=230 and kasparov.ru/material.php?id=675449E4EA866). Not only are there more than three million ethnic Chinese in the Russian Far East, far more than the 40,000 registered residents the Russian authorities admit to, Nemets begins; but China now makes no secret of its aspirations for control of the region and has already achieved great success in dominating the economy and even regional governments. And this has happened with Putin’s help because he needs China given his weakened position and therefore is deferring to Beijing on issues large and small in the Far East, including but not limited to accepting border changes in China’s favor, expanding the ability of Chinese firms to rent land, and extending extraterritorial rights to Chinese operating in that region. Officials in Russian regions, whatever they may feel personally, take their lead from the Kremlin, and as a result, China is finding it easier and easier to rent more land for longer and longer terms and to act as a neo-colonial power, confident that no one locally or in Moscow will show any resistance. Nemets sees Moscow’s willingness to extend virtual extraterritorial status to the Chinese working and living in the region as the most serious development because it gives both the Chinese and the local Russians the sense that the Chinese are already the more important of the two, despite everything Putin says about Russians and Ukrainians elsewhere	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI7na3sLS5IiZ	2024-12-11T15:59:14-08:00	
Robert Reich: How Are You Doing? – OpEd	We are in a queasy interregnum. Four weeks ago, we learned that Donald Trump won the 2024 election. In six weeks, he’ll be taking over the United States government. To run that government, he’s nominated a Star Wars cantina of fanatics, extremists, conspiracy theorists, billionaires, sexual harassers, and disreputable no-goods. Republican senators — the only firewall against this bunch — seem reluctant to take Trump on, other than drawing a line at the reprehensible Matt Gaetz. The person Trump wants to run the FBI is pledging a campaign of vengeance against his political enemies. The people he wants to put in charge of the military and the border are promising a mass roundup and deportation of undocumented immigrants. The billionaires he’s put in charge of eliminating 'waste' are gunning for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The person he wants to run the nation’s health is a nutcase who doesn’t believe in vaccinations. And so on. This time there will be few if any grownups around him to constrain Trump’s worst instincts. Some of you are frightened. Me too. You’d have to be living on another planet not to fear what will happen starting in six weeks. Meanwhile, most of the criminal charges against Trump, as well as his sentencing for the felonies he was found guilty of having committed, have been dropped or vacated. Many of you are furious that Trump won’t be held accountable. I am too. Yet I’m surprised at how many of the people I speak with are in denial. They tell me 'Trump is just bluffing,' or 'He’s not so stupid as to try these things.' Or they say 'the Constitution is strong enough to withstand Trump.' I fear they’re wrong. He’s nuts, he and his minions will try these things, and the Constitution is already near the breaking point. I’ve also been surprised at the silence of the Democrats. Where’s the Democratic leadership? Who’s speaking up for the rule of law right now, other than Liz Cheney? Why have Joe Biden and Kamala Harris seemingly disappeared? Democratic leaders apparently believe it’s better for them to say nothing now and let Republicans take the heat. But there’s little or no heat. Trump seems to be taking over Washington without a whimper of opposition. I just heard from an old friend who’s also a U.S. senator, who writes: 'The new administration isn’t as bad as we thought. It’s worse.' I wish him well. We need people of integrity on the front lines to try to constrain Trump and his sicko sycophants. Yet even those of us who aren’t on the front lines must be activists. If you don’t want to watch the news, I understand. If you’re feeling frightened or furious or worried, you’re in good company. But I hope you feel more determined than ever to fight the fanatics who will take charge in just six weeks. Stand up to them. Call them out. Do not tolerate intolerance. We cannot compromise with cruelty. There is no middle ground between democracy and fascism. I use these daily posts to you as ways of finding some hope in the dark. As small tokens of resistance. As means of fortifying you in these difficult times. Thank you for reading. Thank you for sharing. Thank you for your comments and your words of encouragement. Mostly, thank you for your commitment to a fair and decent society. As we head into the darkness, we need each other to help light the way forward.

South Korea’s Constitutional Crisis: Presidential Authority And D...	South Korea, often hailed as a model of democracy in Asia, is facing a political crisis as President Yoon Suk Yeol encounters increasing criticism for actions deemed unconstitutional. This controversy has arisen following Yoon's proposal for an 'orderly resignation,' which coincides with his declaration of martial law. Legal experts contend that these measures violate the nation's Constitution. Additionally, the ruling People Power Party (PPP)'s intervention in state affairs has sparked concerns about political overreach, democratic accountability, and stability. These developments challenge South Korea's constitutional framework and draw international scrutiny, placing the integrity of the nation's democracy in the global spotlight. The controversies surrounding President Yoon's use of authority and the PPP's actions highlight significant challenges to South Korea's constitutional order and raise alarms about the health of its democratic system, Challenges to Presidential Authority At the core of this issue are the constitutional limitations placed on presidential authority. South Korea's Constitution specifies that the suspension of presidential powers can occur only through impeachment or voluntary resignation, both of which require formal legal processes. Legal experts, including Han Sang-hee, a law professor at Konkuk University, argue that the concept of 'orderly resignation' is legally flawed and incompatible with the nation’s legal framework. This proposal implies that the president can step back from responsibilities without following a formal process, undermining the rule of law. The Constitution is structured to prevent arbitrary shifts in power and mandates clear procedures for transitions of authority, ensuring that executive power remains legitimate and accountable. Further complicating the situation is the role of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, whom critics claim has effectively assumed presidential responsibilities. This unprecedented action raises serious constitutional concerns regarding the separation of powers and suggests that such a transfer of authority could violate the Constitution, contributing to political instability. As commander-in-chief, Yoon retains control over the military, complicating any efforts to restrict his authority without legal processes. This governance confusion signals a potential constitutional crisis that threatens to disrupt the checks and balances designed to protect the democratic system. Without adherence to the established mechanisms of impeachment or resignation, South Korea risks eroding public confidence in its political institutions. The Role of the Ruling People Power Party (PPP) The involvement of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) in this controversy has sparked significant criticism from legal scholars and political analysts. While political parties typically act as intermediaries between public sentiment and state institutions, their interference in state affairs undermines the principles of democratic governance. Attorney Noh Hee-bum has highlighted that the PPP, as a political entity, lacks constitutional authority to exercise administrative powers or directly influence government operations. The PPP's announcement of collaboration with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to stabilise the government amid Yoon's controversial actions has been described as overreach. Critics contend that such actions blur the lines between political accountability and state administration, threatening the integrity of the democratic process. Instead of focusing on its legislative responsibilities, the PPP has taken on a role that some perceive as an attempt to consolidate power rather than address fundamental constitutional issues. This direct involvement in daily governance poses a risk of establishing a dangerous precedent, allowing political organisations to routinely interfere with executive actions. Such interference jeopardises the balance of power enshrined in the Constitution and threatens to blur the distinct roles of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. This overstep not only intensifies domestic tensions but also raises serious questions about the party's commitment to democratic principles and constitutional order. The Global Perspective: 'The World is Watching ' South Korea's political turmoil has garnered international attention. As a significant player in both regional and global politics, the integrity of South Korea's democracy is closely monitored by allies and adversaries alike. The United States and other Western democracies have historically regarded South Korea as a strategic partner and a model of democratic governance in Asia. However, recent developments raise concerns about the nation’s capacity to uphold these ideals. If the erosion of democratic norms continues unchecked, it could damage South Korea's international reputation, impacting its diplomatic standing and economic relations.The global implications of this crisis are profound. South Korea’s role in regional security, particularly in addressing threats from North Korea, relies on stable and effective governance. Any perception of political instability could undermine the nation’s position in military alliances and diplomatic negotiations, thereby diminishing its influence in key international affairs. Additionally, media coverage of the crisis has raised alarms about the potential impact of weakened democratic norms on foreign investment and economic partnerships. The risk of democratic backsliding may also deter global support for significant issues such as climate change, trade, and technological innovation. In our interconnected world, South Korea’s domestic challenges resonate beyond its borders. As a member of international organisations like the United Nations, G20, and World Trade Organisation, South Korea's political stability has essential implications for global governance. Restoring constitutional order and reaffirming a commitment to democratic principles is crucial not only for domestic stability but also for preserving the nation’s global reputation and its role in regional affairs. The Way Forward: Preserving Constitutional Integrity Resolving this crisis necessitates a return to constitutional principles and a clear demarcation of roles between state institutions and political organisations. First, it is essential to prioritise adherence to legal mechanisms, such as impeachment or voluntary resignation, to address concerns regarding presidential authority. Any alternative methods pose a risk of further destabilising the political system and eroding public trust. The legal and political processes outlined in the Constitution must be followed to ensure that executive power remains accountable and legitimate. This adherence will help restore confidence in the political system and prevent a broader governance crisis. Second, the ruling People Power Party (PPP) must acknowledge its constitutional limitations and avoid exceeding its political mandate. Rather than intervening in state affairs, the PPP should concentrate on legislative measures that promote transparency and accountability. By respecting the principle of separation of powers, the PPP can foster a healthier democratic environment and ensure that state resources are used effectively to meet the needs of the populace. This approach will not only restore public confidence but also reinforce the importance of institutional checks and balances that are vital for a functioning democracy. Finally, the government must actively work to rebuild public trust and demonstrate its commitment to democratic governance. This involves clear communication with citizens, adherence to constitutional procedures, and initiatives to strengthen the rule of law. The government should initiate a transparent and inclusive process for resolving the crisis, ensuring that all political parties and branches of government act in good faith and within the constitutional framework. By addressing these challenges directly, South Korea can reaffirm its democratic values and restore stability, reinforcing its position as a model democracy in Asia. Conclusion and Recommendations The controversy surrounding President Yoon Suk Yeol’s authority and the interventions by the ruling People Power Party present a critical test for South Korea's democratic institutions. The Constitution must remain the cornerstone of governance, ensuring that power is exercised within legal bounds. To safeguard its democratic system, South Korea’s leadership should prioritise legal mechanisms that uphold the separation of powers and restore public trust. Additionally, resolving this crisis swiftly and transparently on the global stage will reassure allies and maintain South Korea’s standing as a model democracy.

Central Asia: The Blind Spot Trump Can’t Afford To Ignore – Analy...	When President-elect Donald Trump starts his second term January 20, he will face a full foreign policy agenda, with wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, Taiwan tensions, and looming trade disputes with China, Mexico, and Canada. At some point, he will hit the road on his 'I’m back!' tour. Hopefully, he will consider stops in Central Asia in the not-too-distant future. The 'United States Strategy for Central Asia 2019-2025: Advancing Sovereignty and Economic Prosperity,' says all the right things like supporting regional sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity; promoting the rule of law; and encouraging U.S. investment. But it was released when U.S. forces still occupied neighboring Afghanistan. Eighteen months later, those forces were gone. So, what should President Trump do about Central Asia? First, show up! No sitting U.S. president has ever visited Central Asia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made 73 visits to the five republics, while China’s XiJinping has made 13 visits to four of the republics since he ascended to the presidency in 2012. President Joe Biden met the presidents of the five former Soviet republics – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan -- during last year’s 'C5+1' meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. The unprecedented summit, while described by the president as 'historic,' actually lasted less than one hour, making the gathering more of a photo-op. By the time everyone gave their remarks, it was on to the next event. No matter how good your diplomats, nothing greases the wheels like a face-to-face meeting of the bosses. Second, understand that the republics think multipolarity is a good thing. The republics are finally free of the Russian Empire (1721-1917), Soviet empire (1917-1991), and the American empire (2001-2021) and are not interested in any arrangement that limits their ability to balance between the major powers, or play them off one against the other. And getting directions from faraway Washington and Brussels will remind them of the Soviet era. The republics have language and business ties with Russia, have received significant investment from China, see Iran as a beckoning market and the host of needed transport routes, and are investing in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The republics soberly understand they are all 'neighbors forever' and have no interest in serving as launchpads for attacks on Iran or Afghanistan. Third, hands off the culture. The republics are old cultures, but young nations. They are still engaged in state formation and are open to technical support on various issues such as World Trade Organization accession, but they are not interested in changing their culture to accommodate foreigners. And if the West can’t restrain its tendency for social engineering, they can always deal with China, which is run by a Communist Party but isn’t exporting Communism. Their concern with defending cultural sovereignty isn’t a reaction to Western culture and pushy NGOs. During the Soviet era, Moscow took a keen interest in Islam in Central Asia and made a concerted effort to control Islamic education and appoint imams in the interest of revolutionary Socialism in recognition of the religion’s continuing influence in the officially atheistic Soviet Union. Fourth, Afghanistan is part of Central Asia. The Central Asian countries are interested in reducing tensions and instability in the region, and that requires developing common approaches to maintaining peace in neighboring Afghanistan. For example, the Trans-Afghan Railway, a 357-mile connection from Central Asia to the Pakistani seaports of Karachi, Gwadar, and Qasim, is a long-term contribution to stabilizing Afghanistan. In addition to contributing to the development of a sustainable Afghan economy, the project will hopefully create thousands of jobs and reduce the social base of support for extremist groups in the region. The construction and operation of the corridor will provide opportunities for American contractors, equipment manufacturers, engineers, and logistics companies. Direct or indirect U.S. participation in the project will support job creation and income for American business, which should find favor with Trump. And, as an alternative to China’s 'One Belt, One Road' projects, the Trans-Afghan Railway will also serve to diversify Central Asian trade in world markets and reduce the region's dependence on Beijing, which also serves long-term U.S. interests. Andrew Korybko, an American political analyst at the Peoples’ Friendship University in Moscow, notes that even partial completion (due to security challenges in Pakistan) of the railway may still benefit the republics if they can backhaul Afghanistan’s minerals for processing in Russia or China. (The republics themselves aren’t able to process the minerals due to water shortages.) Completion of the railway could also bring Afghan minerals to the Western markets via Pakistani ports, but that would require a relaxation of banking and financial sanctions against the Taliban. In addition to Afghanistan’s mineral wealth, valued at over $1 trillion, the five Central Asian republics hold a significant share of the world’s critical minerals, including manganese, chromium, lead, zinc, and titanium. Some of the republics 'sit among the world's top 20 producers for critical minerals which are most essential to the development of green technology,' according to British solicitors Herbert Smith Freehills. Mostly-landlocked Central Asia has been 'out of sight, out of mind' in assessments of supply chain opportunities and vulnerabilities as the world plans for the energy transition. China has recently banned the export to the U.S. of the critical minerals antimony, gallium and germanium, which are used in semiconductors, infrared technologies, and electric vehicle batteries, so Washington may need to use the C5+1 Critical Minerals Dialogue as a way to return to the region in order to secure long-term access to its mineral wealth. Last, think about economics. The U.S. does little trade with Central Asia, but the region is key to East-West trade between Europe and China, as it has been since before Marco Polo’s famous adventures. The Middle Corridor, also known as the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, is a trade route that links China and East Asia with Europe via Central Asia. This route has seen a substantial volume. It aims to reduce transit time between East Asia and Europe to as little as 12 days. The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan (CKU) railway finally started constructionin October and will help isolated Kyrgyzstan 'go out into the world.' China is also working with Kazakhstan to upgrade existing rail infrastructure and, in 2022, 'the railway freight volume between China and Kazakhstan reached 23 million tons, marking a 20 percent year-on-year increase.' Should the Trump administration be so inclined, there are also two major opportunities to link Washington’s crusading impulse to significant environmental efforts in Central Asia: the drying up of the Aral Sea and methane emissions in Turkmenistan. The desertification of the Aral Sea, now known as the Aralkum Desert, has had profound economic effects on the region: fishing industry collapse and resulting widespread unemployment, and agricultural decline and increased salinization of the soil, not to mention adverse health effects, including increased infant mortality, growth retardation and anemia in children, respiratory disease, and elevated occurrences of cancers. The environmental and economic hardships have forced people to migrate in search of better living conditions, leading to depopulation of the region, further economic decline, and pressure for jobs and housing in urban centers. Turkmenistan is a significant emitter of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane leaks from Turkmenistan's gas fields are substantial: over 2.9 million tons of methane, equivalent to more than 403 million tons of carbon dioxide, more than the annual carbon emissions of the United Kingdom. Given Washington’s own experience with reducing methane emissions, the U.S. could offer meaningful technical assistance. While Trump has regularly bashed the United Nations, he might now consider partnership with the Central Asian governments through the UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region, the Global Methane Pledge, and UN Water to flow the money, technology, and political support needed to help the region repair the adverse effects of these environmental catastrophes.

Do Not Allow Execution of Freedom Fighters In Iran’s ‘Saydnaya’ T...	The fall of the Syrian dictator and the subsequent opening of Syria’s prisons by the country’s freedom fighters revealed the horrific crimes committed by the Syrian regime—crimes that occurred in the silence and inaction of the international community. Let us not allow silence to once again grant the Iranian dictator the opportunity to continue massacring Iran’s freedom fighters. With 850 executions since the beginning of the year, Khamenei’s Iran has tragically broken the global record for executions per capita. This horrifying statistic is not just a number; it represents lost lives, erased stories, and the names of heroes who fell for freedom and who will forever remain in our memory. Among the most recent condemned are the names of six courageous men: Mohammad Taghavi, 58 years old, who was previously imprisoned in the 1980s and 1990s (sentenced on November 25, 2024); Ali Akbar Daneshvarkar, 57 years old, a civil engineer; Babak Alipour, 33 years old, a law graduate; Vahid Bani-Amerian, 32 years old, with a master’s degree in management; Pouya Ghobadi, 32 years old, an electrical engineer; Abolhassan Montazer, 65 years old, an architect who was also imprisoned in the 1980s and suffers from chronic illnesses. Their crime? Advocating for the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK). Beyond fabricated and baseless accusations, their primary 'offense' is belonging to an organization that fights for democracy and freedom against an oppressive dictatorship. The Case of Mohammad Taghavi Mohammad Taghavi, who had previously been arrested in 2020 and imprisoned for three years on charges of connections to the PMOI, has been separated from the other five individuals and transferred to solitary confinement in Ward 209 of the infamous Evin Prison. Such a transfer to solitary confinement often indicates that his execution is imminent. The notorious Ward 209, under the control of the Ministry of Intelligence, is infamous for its brutal torture and inhumane treatment of political prisoners. Among these six prisoners, Mohammad Taghavi is one of the few remaining witnesses to the 1988 Massacre. This may be an additional reason why the Iranian dictatorship seeks to eliminate him. The 1988 Massacre and Genocide Recognition In his latest shocking report, Professor Javaid Rehman, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran (serving from July 2018 to July 2024), described two major waves of killings in Iran—the 1982 executions and the 1988 massacre—as genocide. He explained that the Iranian religious dictatorship executed its opponents solely because of their beliefs and religion, aiming to systematically destroy them. In 1988, 30,000 political prisoners, of whom 90% were PMOI members, were massacred while serving their prison sentences. The report, titled 'Atrocious Crimes,' highlights not only the 1982 and 1988 massacres but also other crimes, including persecution of religious minorities—particularly Baha’is—sexual violence and abuse against women, execution of children, arbitrary and extrajudicial executions, and the ongoing crime of enforced disappearance of thousands of political dissidents. Targeting Mohammad Taghavi’s Family Two of Mohammad Taghavi’s brothers, Mojtaba and Ali Taghavi, have also been sentenced to imprisonment and exile by the same judge and court, simply because they are his brothers. Do not let silence shield these crimes. Just as the world became aware of the atrocities committed in Syria’s Saydnaya Prison after the fall of Assad, we must act to prevent similar horrors from happening in Iranian prisons. History will judge us on our ability to defend the defenders of freedom and to put an end to this barbarity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35RWSpE5FfLrj	2024-12-11T09:31:09-08:00	
What Realities Can Be Seen In The Mirror Of The Syrian Revolution...	On the morning of Sunday, December 8, 2024, Syria and the Middle East witnessed one of the most significant transformations in their history: the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime. This historic event not only marks the end of a brutal dictatorship in Syria but also carries profound and far-reaching implications for the political and social dynamics of the region, particularly for the Iranian regime. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had repeatedly justified his regime’s costly interventions in the region by emphasizing their strategic importance, stating, 'If we don’t fight and spend resources in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, we will have to fight in the streets of Kermanshah, Hamedan, and other provinces.' Similarly, cleric Hossein Taeb declared, 'If the enemy attacks us and seeks to take Syria or Khuzestan, our priority must be to preserve Syria. If we hold onto Syria, we can also reclaim Khuzestan. But if we lose Syria, we won’t be able to hold onto Tehran either.' Reality 1: The Collapse of the Iranian Regime’s Strategic Depth The Iranian regime had always considered the fall of Syria as a strategic defeat for itself. From the onset of the Syrian crisis, the mullahs prioritized the survival of Assad’s regime through extensive military, financial, and ideological interventions. However, several key factors demonstrate the failure of this strategy: 1. Weakening of the IRGC and Hezbollah: The Iranian regime relied on Syria as a logistical and operational hub to supply arms and manpower to Hezbollah. Assad’s fall dismantled this critical support base, significantly undermining Hezbollah’s power in Lebanon and the region. 2. Iran’s Domestic Crises: Popular uprisings, economic collapse, and international pressures have eroded the regime’s capacity to sustain its proxy forces. This, coupled with Hezbollah’s military setbacks and the mullahs’ diminishing influence in Syria and Iraq, paved the way for Assad’s downfall. Reality 2: The Role of the Syrian People in Toppling Dictatorship Assad’s fall was primarily the result of the persistent struggle and resistance of the Syrian people against over four decades of dictatorship by the Assad family. What began as civil protests transformed into a widespread armed uprising due to relentless crackdowns. This resistance underscored the fragility of the regime’s grip in the face of collective public determination. Reality 3: Armed Struggle as the Only Path to Overcoming Dictatorship Syria’s experience once again highlights that armed struggle can play a decisive role in confronting regimes like those of Assad, Shah, or Khamenei. Civil disobedience and non-violent resistance often prove inadequate or even prolong the lifespan of oppressive regimes. For the Iranian people, this is a valuable lesson. The fall of Assad demonstrates that regimes built on internal repression and regional interventions are highly vulnerable to organized and revolutionary uprisings. Reality 4: The Parallels between the Syrian Revolution and Iran’s 1979 Revolution The Syrian revolution evokes striking similarities to Iran’s 1979 revolution. Just as the Iranian people, during their anti-monarchical uprising, tore down the symbols of monarchy—statues of Reza Shah and Mohammad Reza Shah—they also flung open the doors of prisons, liberating detainees from the Shah's torture chambers. Similarly, in Syria, the people expressed their rage against decades of corruption and oppression by dismantling the symbols of the Assad dynasty and toppling its brutal dictatorship. They also opened the gates of Assad’s prisons and torture facilities, freeing countless victims of his oppressive regime. Bashar al-Assad’s flight to Russia mirrors Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s escape, highlighting a remarkable resemblance between the two dictators. Both sought to deny their atrocities, but history has judged—and will continue to judge—them differently. The horrifying and shocking images of atrocities committed by Assad’s regime and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in prisons like Saydnaya reveal the extent of the brutality of such dictatorships. They also expose Assad as a puppet of the Iranian regime. These atrocities forcefully illuminate the reality of despotic governments like the mullahs' regime in Iran. Moreover, these brutalities expose the disgraceful policies of appeasement pursued by global powers. These policies not only undermine human rights but also embolden tyrants, allowing atrocities akin to the horrific crimes of Hitler to resurface. Impacts and Consequences of Assad’s Fall 1. Severe Weakening of the Iranian Regime: For years, Khamenei argued that his regime’s survival depended on its presence in Syria. Assad’s fall marks the loss of a crucial strategic pillar for Tehran, dramatically increasing both internal and external pressures on the regime. 2. Weakening of Hezbollah: Hezbollah, which had long benefited from logistical and military support via Syria, has now lost this strategic base, leaving it more vulnerable to internal and external challenges. 3. Reduced Iranian Influence in the Region: Assad’s collapse restricts the mullahs’ ability to exert influence in Iraq and other parts of the region, further isolating the regime internationally. Conclusion: A Mirror for Iran The Syrian revolution reflects a potential future for Iran. Just as Bashar al-Assad was brought to his knees by the will of his people, the mullahs’ regime is similarly vulnerable to growing popular uprisings and the erosion of its domestic and regional power base. Assad’s fall illustrates that organized and revolutionary struggle is an inevitable path for oppressed nations striving for freedom and democracy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35Z69GrtU_Ua2	2024-12-11T09:30:18-08:00	
India: Anniversary Of Memory, Anniversary Of Pain – OpEd	Games of terrorism, games of power There is a quite famous saying that says he who is a terrorist on one side is a freedom fighter on the other. On November 26 2024 an anniversary of painful memory took place for India. Sixteen years have passed since the terrorist attack that took place in Mumbai in 2008. This terrorist attack changed the course of the counter-terrorism history in India, much like the attack that occurred on the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001 in New York. The events that took place even provided material for the film 'Hotel Mumbai' in 2018, directed by Anthony Maras. Let’s take a brief look at the incident itself. On November 26 ten armed militants from the Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) infiltrated the city by sea and carried out a series of coordinated attacks at multiple high-profile locations, including the Taj Mahal Hotel the Oberoi Trident Hotel the CST railway station, and the Nariman House. The terrorists took hostages, engaged in gunfights with security forces, and carried out brutal attacks on civilians, resulting in the deaths of 166 people, including 18 security personnel, and injuring over 300 individuals. The attacks lasted nearly four days, with Indian police working tirelessly to free the hostages and neutralize the terrorists. However, when the bloodshed ended, the responsibility was not immediately attributed to the real culprit, but followed a path of attempted misdirection. Initially, within a context of speculation regarding the identity of the terrorists, an unknown group under the pseudonym Mujahideen Hyderabad Deccan claimed responsibility for the attacks via an email. However, an email was later traced to a computer in Pakistan, and it became clear that no such group existed. Investigators began to look for the culprit through the profile of the people who had been targeted. The way the terrorists allegedly targeted western foreigners at both luxury hotels and Nariman House led some to believe that the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda might have been involved, but this appeared not to be the case after the lone captured terrorist, Ajmal Amir Kasab, provided substantial information about the planning and execution of the attacks. Kasab, a resident of Punjab province in Pakistan, told investigators that the 10 attackers underwent extensive guerrilla warfare training at Lashkar-e-Taiba camps. Additionally, he revealed that the group of terrorists had spent time at the headquarters of a second and related organization, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, in the city of Muridke before traveling from Punjab to the coastal city of Karachi and departing for Mumbai by sea. Ultimately, it appeared that Lashkar e Taiba was behind the attacks in Mumbai, which aimed to make the global community perceive the landmark city of Indian progress in the Indo-Pacific region as vulnerable and weak. The terrorists had a good, if not diabolical, plan. After first traveling on a cargo ship under a Pakistani flag, the armed men seized an Indian fishing vessel and killed its crew; then, as they approached the coast of Mumbai, they used inflatable boats to reach Badhwar Park and the Sassoon Docks, near the city's Gateway of India monument. At that point, the terrorists split into small groups and headed towards their respective targets. All these cruel actions were the actios of the notorious Lashkar-e-Taiba. Let's take a moment to consider the organization and operation of Lashkar-e-Taiba, this extremist Islamic organization that operates in Pakistan, India, Kashmir, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh under the nickname 'The Order of God.' The leaders of the organization knew what they were doing and how they planned their missions. As for the terrorist attack in Mumbai ,young fanatical men were sent on the battlefield, whose lack of education and the context of deprivation had made them exactly what the organization needed: capable of anything, desperate, and expendable. It is not coincidental that even in the film, the young men who had taken over the hotel were seen receiving instructions for their steps from a voice on the phone whose face was never revealed. Fortunately, the terrorists were neutralized. One of the terrorists from the hotel attack was arrested. Kasab who was charged with various crimes, including murder and waging war later retracted his confession. In April 2009, his trial began, but there were several delays, including a postponement as officials confirmed that Kasab was indeed over 18 years old and therefore could not be tried in a juvenile court. Although he admitted his guilt in July, the trial continued, and in December he recanted, declaring his innocence. In May 2010, Kasab was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was executed two years later. In June 2012, the Delhi police arrested Syed Zabiuddin Ansari (or Syed Zabiuddin), who was alleged to be one of those who trained the terrorists and guided them during the attacks. Here we enter the next chapter, where we examine the profiles of the trainers and guides of the terrorists, with the most significant case being that of David Coleman Headley. a Pakistani-American, who pled guilty in 2011 to assisting the terrorists in planning the attacks, and in January 2013 was sentenced to 35 years in prison by a U.S. federal court. Admitting his guilt and later testifying for the government in the trial of a co-defendant, Headley admitted that he attended training camps in Pakistan run by Lashkar-e-Taiba. By late 2005, Headley was instructed by three Lashkar members to travel to India to conduct surveillance, which he did five times before the Mumbai attacks in 2008. According to Headley's confession and testimony, he attended the following training camps operated by Lashkar: a three-week course that began in February 2002 and provided ideological training on the benefits of jihad, then a three-week course that began in August 2002 and provided training in the use of weapons and grenades; a three-month course that began in April 2003 and taught close combat tactics, the use of weapons and grenades, and survival skills; a three-week course that began in August 2003 and taught counter-surveillance skills; and a three-month course that began in December 2003 and provided training in combat and tactics. He had all the training he needed. After receiving instructions in late 2005 to conduct surveillance in India, Headley changed his name from Daood Gilani in February 2006 in Philadelphia to facilitate his activities on behalf of Lashkar, presenting himself in India as an American who was neither Muslim nor Pakistani. In the summer of 2006, Headley and two members of Lashkar discussed opening an immigration office in Mumbai as a cover for his surveillance activities. They were preparing for the attack. Headley eventually made five extended trips to Mumbai — in September 2006, February and September 2007, and April and July 2008 — each time filming various potential targets, including those attacked in November 2008. Before each trip, Lashkar members and associates would guide Headley on specific locations where he needed to conduct surveillance. After each trip, Headley traveled to Pakistan to meet with Lashkar members and associates, report on the results of his surveillance, and provide the surveillance videos. Headley was therefore a higher-ranking official in the organization's hierarchy who, due to his knowledge and connections, was part of the organization's core. This man was eventually located and given the punishment he deserved for his actions. But we need to see who is behind this organization, and most importantly, who funds it, we need to get to the core in order to create ways of preventing such terrorist actions from happening again. Through the provision of social, educational, and medical services in Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Taiba, (LeT) has expanded its support base in the country. LeT funds such activities through donation boxes placed in shops across the country. Additionally, LeT collects ushr, an Islamic land tax that requires farmers to donate 10 percent of their crops or income to charitable purposes. LeT generates revenue through the group's 'legitimate' businesses, which include fish farms, agricultural lands, and mobile clinics. LeT also raises funds by imposing tuition fees in its schools and by selling jihadist material and other goods. A former member of LeT revealed in an interview that sometimes traders associated with LeT ask buyers to pay an additional 5 to 10 Pakistani rupees 'for jihad.' LeT has also used its international connections to seek funding, and this is the most interesting point we should focus on. The group is reported to have received donations from members of the Pakistani diaspora in Europe and the Persian Gulf, as well as from clerics and other Saudis who support the global jihadist movement. Through JuD (Jamaat-ud-Dawa), IKK, and other front organizations of LeT, the group has also collected donations abroad for disaster relief and other humanitarian purposes within Pakistan. The group is known to divert money donated for charitable purposes to fund its military activities. Especially until 2002, the year Let was banned in Pakistan, almost every shop in the central market of every Pakistani city, big or small, had a Lashkar collection box for raising funds for the fight in Kashmir. After analyzing these events, it is difficult to be optimistic even if we want to. The organization may have been declared illegal for years and significant figures operating within it, such as Headley, may have been arrested and received the punishment they deserved from the authorities, but unfortunately, extremist organizations originating from Pakistan continue to strike India and Kashmir. Unfortunately, evil must be struck at its root, and here it is deeper than the religious differences between Hinduism and Islam. It is a condition that weaponizes the religious fanaticism of its followers, sending them like sheep to the slaughter by turning them into terrorists on the front lines who do not hesitate to take their own lives along with the lives of others in the name of Allah. All these disposable, misguided people are the pawns who move according to the desires of the economically powerful who indirectly or directly fund these organizations. If we want to find the root of the problem, we must broaden our thinking and include countries like China, as well as certain forces in America and in Saudi Arabia that indirectly control such extremist groups by financially supporting them.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35XHzjBmuI2jm	2024-12-11T09:29:17-08:00	
US ‘Deep State’ Seen Meddling In India’s Affairs – OpEd	Corruption charges against Indian tycoon Gautam Adani and BJP's charge against the Gandhi about teaming up with George Soros to destabilize India threaten Indo-US relations Washington's discomfort with India is growing as it is being dragged into two major controversies rocking the South Asian country today. The first is the Bharatiya Janata Party - Congress slugfest over a US court's indictment of Indian tycoon Gautam Adani. The second is the BJP's narrative linking Congress leader Sonia Gandhi to US billionaire-philanthropist George Soros in an alleged plot to destabilize India. Last month's indictment of Adani, who is close to the ruling Narendra Modi-led BJP government, has exacerbated the already heightened cynicism that a majority of Indians feel towards the US government's intentions. US prosecutors had charged Gautam Adani, 62, his nephew Sagar and other defendants for paying over US$ 250 million in bribes between 2020 and 2024 to Indian government officials to win solar energy contracts on terms that could potentially bring in more than US$ 2 billion in profit. Following that, the Congress demanded a thorough investigation into the charges and accused the government of shielding Adani. The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as 'baseless'. The US indictment of Adani has severely affected his businesses–which are a critical part of India's economic landscape. Any legal action against him is seen not just as targeting an individual, but as having broader economic and geopolitical consequences for India. This has led to suspicions about the true motives behind such actions even outside the BJP's narrative that actions against Adani are tantamount to actions against the Indian national interest itself. No matter who is US President—Joe Biden or President-elect Donald Trump—the US will never be a true friend of India, say Indian geopolitical analysts. A majority of Indians believe that the US' strategic interests are at play behind the scene in these too instances of interference. The BJP's narrative linking to Hungarian-born George Soros taps into a broader conspiracy theory that sees Soros as meddling in global politics to serve Western interests. By associating Sonia Gandhi with Soros, the BJP aims to portray the opposition as being influenced by foreign powers, further fuelling nationalist sentiments and distrust towards the West. These events are part of a larger pattern where the US is often viewed with suspicion in India. The relationship between the US and India is complex and multifaceted, influenced by a range of political, economic, and strategic factors. While the US and India have developed a strong partnership over the years, there are several reasons why some believe that the US may never be a 'true friend' of India, regardless of who is in the White House. The perception that US geopolitical considerations, particularly in keeping China at an arms-length in the South Asian region, outweigh its friendship with India is shared by most Indians. Many feel that the US engagement with India is primarily driven by this strategic need to contain China rather than a genuine desire for a balanced and mutual partnership. Historical Context US-India relationship has evolved significantly since the end of the Cold War. During the Cold War, India had a policy of non-alignment, which often put it at odds with both the US. However, the end of the Cold War and India's economic liberalization in the early 1990s opened new avenues for cooperation between India and the US. US and India have since developed strong ties in areas such as defence, trade, and technology. Despite these advancements, there are underlying geopolitical considerations that complicate the relationship. The US has historically viewed India through the lens of its broader strategic interests in Asia, particularly in relation to China and Pakistan. While it sees India as a key partner in countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region, it also keeps a relationship with Pakistan, which has been a longstanding ally in the fight against communism and terrorism. This dual approach has created tensions in the US-India relationship. The leadership styles and policies of US Presidents have significantly impacted the relationship with India. Under President Donald Trump, the US-India relationship saw notable developments, especially in defence and trade. Trump's administration emphasized the importance of the Indo-Pacific region and looked to strengthen ties with India as part of its strategy to counter China's rise. The personal rapport between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also played a role in fostering closer ties. However, Trump's approach to foreign policy was often transactional, and his administration's focus on 'America First' sometimes led to tensions with India on trade issues. For instance, the US imposed tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium, and India responded with retaliatory tariffs on US goods. These trade disputes highlighted the challenges of balancing strategic cooperation with economic interests. Under President Biden, the US-India relationship has continued to evolve, with a focus on shared democratic values and cooperation on global challenges such as climate change and public health. Biden has emphasized the importance of multilateralism and alliances, and his administration has sought to strengthen the Quad, a strategic partnership between the US, India, Japan, and Australia. However, Biden's approach to China is more nuanced than Trump's. The latter's approach could affect the US-India relationship. While Biden looks to counter China's influence, he also aims to engage with China on issues like climate change and global health. The formal indictment of Indian tycoon Gautam Adani by US authorities has added another layer of complexity to the US-India relationship. This controversy has significant implications for the US-India relationship. On the one hand, it underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in business dealings, which are key principles for both countries. On the other hand, it highlights the potential for political and economic tensions when prominent figures close to the Indian government are implicated in legal issues in the US. The Adani case has also fuelled criticism from opposition parties in India, who argue that the Modi government is too closely aligned with controversial business figures. The BJP claims that Sonia Gandhi, as co-president of the Forum of Democratic Leaders in Asia Pacific (FDL-AP), is connected to an organization funded by the George Soros Foundation, which has supported the idea of Kashmir being an independent country. These allegations have sparked a political firestorm in India, with the BJP accusing the Congress party of colluding with foreign entities to undermine India's sovereignty, and the Congress party dismissing these claims as baseless and politically motivated. The controversy has also drawn attention to the broader issue of foreign influence in Indian politics and the role of international organizations in shaping domestic affairs. Many Indians perceive US policies as being self-serving, designed to advance American geopolitical interests rather than genuinely fostering mutual benefits. The double standard often seen in US foreign policy, where strategic interests override democratic and human rights principals, further contributes to this mistrust. A majority of Indians blame the US 'deep state'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35RtKQwad08GZ	2024-12-11T09:28:31-08:00	
Institutionalised Repression On Pakistan Occupied Jammu & Kashmir...	Named ‘Azad’ [liberated] Jammu & Kashmir by Islamabad, this area of J&K under Pakistan’s illegal occupation [PoJK] since 1947 unfortunately doesn’t quite live up to its name as its people are anything but free. To begin with, Para 7 [3] of PoJK constitution criminalises freedom of expression by mandating that 'No person or political party in Azad Jammu and Kashmir [PoJK] shall be permitted to propagate against, or take part in activities prejudicial or detrimental to, the ideology of the State’s accession to Pakistan.' One doesn’t have to be a Sherlock Holmes to deduce that this draconian stipulation aimed at muzzling public opposition by the residents of PoJK against its illegal occupation by Pakistan has been incorporated into the constitution since Islamabad knows very well that locals are unhappy about annexation of their land by Pakistan. The irony is that while it tries to portray PoJK as an independent entity, in reality Islamabad treats it as its colony and rules this region with an iron fist, brazenly exploiting its natural resources. This is evident from the frequent protests and repeated demands for azadi [freedom] made by agitating PoJK residents. The Pakistan army’s un-soldierly conduct in PoJK has further alienated locals and one illustrative example that comes to mind is its abject apathy towards civilians that came to the fore during the devastating 2005 earthquake. Human Rights Watch [HRW] in its 2006 report states, 'In the first seventy-two hours after the earthquake, thousands of Pakistani troops stationed in Azad Kashmir [PoJK] prioritized the evacuation of their own personnel over providing relief to desperate civilians.' It further mentions that the international media even 'filmed Pakistani troops standing by and refusing to help because they had 'no orders' to do so as locals attempted to dig out those still alive, sending a chilling message of indifference from Islamabad.' [Emphasis added]. But this is not all. In 2006, Asia Director at Human Rights Watch [HRW] Brad Adams had noted that 'The military shows no tolerance for dissent and practically runs the region [PoJK] as a fiefdom.' Furthermore, the 2006 HRW report, mentions that it 'knows of no cases in which members of military and paramilitary security and intelligence agencies have been prosecuted or even disciplined for acts of torture or mistreatment [of PoJK residents].' Due to such step-motherly treatment and excess by the Pakistan army, PoJK residents rightly consider themselves to be second and class citizens leading to widespread dissatisfaction. And pushed against the wall, from all walks of life in PoJK have rallied under the banner of Joint Awami Action Committee [JAAC] of PoJK, a civil society alliance, to unitedly press their demands. In May 2023, JAAC launched a massive public campaign to protest against withdrawal of subsidies on food grain and the inordinately high prices of wheat flour and electricity. Strong-arm measures to sabotage the JAAC protest such as indiscriminate preventive detention of its leaders, intimidation, imposition of curfew, and use of brute force that led to casualties failed to deter the residents of PoJK from taking to the streets. Ultimately, while the administration was forced to accede to their genuine demands, Islamabad viewed this public unrest as a threat to its illegal occupation of PoJK and decided to put curbs on public gatherings As doing this ran the risk of antagonising the already incensed people, Islamabad’s proxy PoK government kept quiet for six months. Thinking that public tempers had cooled, the PoJK government promulgated the ‘Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Ordinance 2024’ last month which debars unregistered organisations from holding gatherings or protests. Even registered organisations have to submit a written application seeking permission for any public gathering seven days in advance and the administration reserves the right to unilaterally reject any such request. Known for its complete subservience to Islamabad, PoJK’s judiciary summarily dismissed two writ petitions against this ordinance that outrightly violates the fundamental right to freedom of expression. This led to massive public protests organised on Saturday by JAAC demanding repeal of the oppressive ordinance and release of 14 of its detained activists by 11AM. Widespread protests that paralysed the entire PoJK and showed Islamabad the mirror. According to media reports, the contentious ‘Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Ordinance 2024’ has now been revoked. However, given the deep sense of insecurity regarding PoJK that haunts Islamabad and more so Rawalpindi, it’s extremely unlikely that the people of PoJK would be allowed to exercise their democratic right to peacefully protest. Hence, it’s quite likely that the army will use every trick in the book and further intensify its campaign to smear JAAC using its pet strategy of portraying it as an anti-national organisation fomenting sedition in PoJK at the behest of New Delhi. How far Rawalpindi succeeds in demonising this civil society alliance and eroding its mass appeal will be evident next year when JAAC undertakes its long march to draw attention of the authorities towards the pathetic condition of PoJK residents. Tailpiece: Those who feel the Government of Pakistan is solely responsible for the sorry state of affairs in PoJK and that Rawalpindi is being unnecessarily dragged into the PoJK imbroglio may like reflect on the observation made in 2006 by HRW’s Asia Director that 'There is a façade of an elected local government, but the federal government in Islamabad, the army and the intelligence agencies control all aspects of political life in Azad Kashmir[PoJK].'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35TxQzcghq1AP	2024-12-11T09:27:38-08:00	
Minorities Ill-Served By Their Leaders – OpEd	The populist surge needs to go further: the elites who claim to represent minorities are too often working against their needs. Take the issues of school choice and affirmative action. African Americans, Asians and Hispanics favor the former but oppose application of the latter; in general, their leaders oppose the former and favor the latter. The National Urban League, the NAACP and the National Action Network are all opposed to school choice and charter schools. Marc Morial, president of the Urban League, says school vouchers 'would be devastating to black kids.' The NAACP called for a moratorium on new charter schools in 2016. And the Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, claims charter schools have a racist history. The black elite badly misrepresent their people. No demographic group is more gung-ho for school choice than African Americans. Fully 73 percent want the right to send their child to the school of their choice. They are also demanding that their public officials provide more money for charter schools. These same three black civil rights organizations are also pro-affirmative action. When asked a generic question about affirmative action—'Is it a good thing?'—61 percent of blacks agree that it is, but when it is applied to a specific subject, the results are different. For example, 71 percent of blacks say colleges should not consider race or ethnicity when deciding which students to accept. The National Council of Asian Pacific Americans (NCAPA) is a coalition of 38 national organizations. It has plenty to say about education, but it is noticeably silent on school choice and charter schools, owing, no doubt, to the fact that Asians favor both. Indeed, 70 percent of Asians want school choice, and in big metropolitan areas, they are in the forefront of the pro-charter school movement. NCAPA strongly supports affirmative action, and while 53 percent of Asians say that it is a good thing in general, 76 percent say it should not be a deciding factor in school admissions criteria. There are two Hispanic civil rights organizations that claim to speak for their people, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and UnidosUS (formerly National Center of La Raza). Not too long ago they wanted to drop the terms Latino and Latina in referring to Hispanic men and women, respectively, favoring instead the sex-neutral term, Latinx. But due to the backlash from their own people, LULAC dropped the term from its communications in 2021 and UnidosUS only sparingly invokes its, such as when referring to LGBTQ Latinx. There is a reason for this: only 2 percent of Hispanics like Latinx—they are quite comfortable being identified as a man or a woman. LULAC is opposed to school choice but favors charter schools. UnidosUS is agnostic on school choice but is also supportive of charter schools. By contrast, 71 percent of Hispanics want school choice (they also favor charter schools). LULAC and UnidosUS support affirmative action, but only 36 percent of Hispanics say it is a good thing in general; 81 percent are opposed to it being a factor in deciding which students to admit. It is striking how much influence the big donor class has on these civil rights groups. Black, Asian and Hispanic organizations had better bow to their left-wing demands or they will be cut off lickety split. So even if it means selling out their own people, the leading spokesmen are prepared to do so. It is not white supremacists who are working against the educational interests of minorities—it is the leaders in their own community. They are a national disgrace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35S6vLuj96nsM	2024-12-11T09:26:17-08:00	
From River To Sea Both Should Be Free From Hatred And Suffering –...	Gaza peace activist Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib has embarked on a one-man social media campaign to draw attention to the human plight of the majority of Gazans who are not involved with terror, and call for mutual recognition between Palestinians and Israelis in the hope that the two peoples will someday be able to share the same land in peace. He has published editorials in Haaretz, the Wall Street Journal, and The Forward, among others, and has laid out his vision for peace in his blog with The Times of Israel. His dovish advocacy efforts, has gained him a following of over 33,000 on X. 'There's a reason why the Palestinians have no state 75 years after the establishment of Israel,' he said. 'It's their awful leadership that goes back to the pan-Arabism of the Nasser days, and that has adopted different ideologies – the secular PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization], the Marxist PFLP [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine], or Islamist Hamas – to sell different versions of the same narrative: We're going to liberate all of Palestine.' But more than 43,000 people in the Gaza Strip have been killed in the first 14 months of fighting, a figure that includes some 20-22,000 Hamas terrorists Israel says it has killed in battle. In Arabic, the word Jihad is a noun meaning the activity of 'striving and/or persevering.' According to Prophet Muhammad there are two types of Jihad: minor and major. Once when Muslims were returning from a military expedition, which for Prophet Muhammad was a minor jihad. He said to the fighters that now they had to go through the major jihad. When Prophet Muhammad was asked what he meant by major jihad, he said it was the spiritual jihad. On another occasion, he said the real mujahid is the one who declares jihad against his/her carnal soul. (Tirmidhi). Exercising self-control and using willpower and reason to overcome one's anger is described by Prophet Muhammad as 'the major jihad.' Overcoming our own feelings of hatred, revenge and anger is much more difficult than overcoming our enemies. In today's world of fanaticism and extremism the words of Al-Ghazali, a 12th century Persian Muslim theologian, need to be repeated by all the world's religious and political leaders: 'Declare your jihad on thirteen enemies you cannot see – Egoism, Arrogance, Conceit, Selfishness, Greed, Lust, Intolerance, Anger, Lying, Cheating, Gossiping and Slandering. If you can master and destroy them, then you will be ready to fight the enemy you can see.' Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib says, 'From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.' I say we can make it truly aspirational by making it focus on both people first and the land second. 'From the river to the sea Palestinians and Israelis should be freed of hatred and suffering by 'a two state for two peoples sharing of the land peacefully solution.'' But the Hamas' 2017 charter states that in principle, it 'rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.' Hamas opposes a two state solution, wants all the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan, and violently opposed the Oslo peace accords negotiated by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in the mid-1990s. If the war ends with Hamas weakened, and with a new Israeli government elected; there is the hope that the miracle of the Yom Kippur War may be repeated. On October 27, 1978, only five years after Egypt started the Yom Kippur War with a surprise attack on Israel, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin were named winners of the Nobel Peace Prize for their progress toward achieving a Middle East accord. The Yom Kippur War was followed six years later by a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel. Could the same process follow the defeat of Hamas, and its opposition to a two state solution? The only possible chance for avoiding more wars is the two state solution. To establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That will not be possible with the current leaders on either side. Extremists, both Israeli and Palestinian, will do all they can to sink the idea, as they have done since the 1990s. If 14 months of war does not deliver enough shock to break deeply-held prejudices and to make the idea of two states viable, nothing will. And without a mutually-acceptable way of ending the conflict, more generations of Palestinians and Israelis will be sentenced to more wars. Although it might seem impossible now, I do believe that within a decade or two Muslims will visit Jerusalem and pray together with Jews as Prophet Zechariah predicts: 'Then everyone who survives from all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.' (Zechariah 14:16) For more than eight decades political nationalist leaders in Israel and Palestine have failed to find a way to end the conflict between their two peoples. Perhaps it is time for religious leaders who understand the religious importance of repentance, humility, forgiveness, compromise and hope for peace in overcoming more than seven decades of pain and anger. As the Qur'an states: 'Perhaps Allah will put, between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them, affection. And Allah is competent, and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.' (60:7) Then the words of the Qur'an will be full-filled 'From the depths of Darkness into the Light; for Allah is very kind and merciful to you.' (Qur'an 57:9) There is much about the Gaza war that we still don't know: how long it will last, what the death toll will be, how many hostages will be returned, and how successful Israel will be in its objective of weakening Hamas. Dr. Mohamed Chtatou, a Professor at a university in Rabat, Morocco writes: 'After the current (Hamas-Israel) war, Israel's ultra-nationalist coalition will undoubtedly be undermined by public opinion, and probably by a commission of inquiry. If the Palestinian Authority were to agree to take over Gaza – backed by the international reconstruction aid that would inevitably arrive – and if a centrist coalition government were to emerge in Israel, everything would once again be possible. Two difficult 'ifs'? Perhaps, but there is no serious alternative.' The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation-community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah; then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. Even the surprise attack by Egypt and Syria of the Yom Kippur War was followed six years later by a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel. Could the same process follow the weakening of Hamas? Prophet Muhammad said: 'Should I not tell you what is better in degree than prayer, fasting, and charity.' They (the companions) said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Reconciling people, because grudges and disputes are a razor (that shaves off faith).' (Ahmad, Abu Dawood, and At-Tirmithi) This is an excellent guide to dealing with the three-generation old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Rather than focusing mostly on what the other side did to us, we all should focus on how the conflict has hurt all of us, and how much better our future would be if we could live next to each other in peace. If the descendants of Prophet Isaac and Prophet Ishmael negotiate a settlement that reflects the religious policy that '...there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them – and settlement [reconciliation and peace] is best.' (Quran 4:128) The Nakba (catastrophe), the displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 establishment of the State of Israel and the War of Independence, could have been totally avoided if the Palestinian leadership had accepted the UN two state solution. Indeed, if the Palestinian leadership had accepted the British 1937 two state solution; millions of Jews would have been able to avoid the Holocaust (catastrophe). Hopefully, the Palestinians will not make an all or nothing mistake again. If we all can live up to the ideal of following the will of God we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35dRB809r9qnu	2024-12-11T09:24:49-08:00	
The Future Of Syria: Assad’s Asylum In Moscow And Possible Scenar...	It has been announced that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad fled the country and sought asylum in Moscow, where he has obtained a residence permit. Reports suggest that Assad owns 18 luxury apartments in Moscow, purchased beforehand. While Western sources estimate his wealth to be between $1–2 billion, a Syrian intelligence source claims it is as high as $135 billion. However, it seems unlikely that such a large sum could have been transferred in cash. It was likely moved abroad earlier via electronic banking and later converted to rubles in Moscow. The Future of Assad's Wealth and the Global Banking System.... If such transactions are detected in the international banking system, the wealth could be immediately frozen and rendered unusable. In the past, there were rumors of leaders from other countries transporting suitcases full of foreign currency to offshore banks using private planes. Nowadays, such vast amounts are typically transferred electronically. It is expected that Assad and his family will live in Moscow under special protection. Chaos and Prospects for Governance in Post-Assad Syria.... The future of Syria remains uncertain in the aftermath of Assad's departure. There is speculation about the possible establishment of a Taliban-like regime. Reports indicate that some regions have already seen calls for mandatory veiling for women. However, Syria's diverse religious and linguistic composition suggests that such a regime may struggle to maintain long-term stability. The country is currently under heavy Israeli airstrikes, with Israel occupying the strategically significant Mount Hermon. For Syria to recover from this situation, rapid reconstruction and stabilization are needed. However, the country is in dire straits, with almost no access to electricity, water, food, or basic infrastructure. One possible scenario involves Russia strengthening its influence in Syria by expanding its naval and air bases, potentially bringing the country under its full protection. Social Conditions and Refugees.... Reports indicate an increase in executions targeting Assad loyalists and growing pressure on members of the Alawite sect. The duration of this chaos remains uncertain. Syrian refugees abroad are hesitant to return until conditions improve. However, some young men are reportedly entering the country to check on family properties or visit relatives. Syria's future will depend on a combination of international intervention and internal dynamics. Under current conditions, achieving stability and recovery is likely to take a long time. During this period, the roles of the international community and regional powers will be crucial in shaping the nation's trajectory.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35ZudE0KpbDHJ	2024-12-11T09:23:23-08:00	
Human Rights Situation In Afghanistan: Insight From UNAMA Report ...	The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) recently released a comprehensive report detailing the human rights situation in Afghanistan since the Taliban's takeover. The report highlights significant concerns regarding Afghanistan's human rights commitments, the erosion of democratic principles, and the undermining of accountability mechanisms. The UN report underscores the oppressive environment in Afghanistan, with 256 instances of arbitrary arrest and detention and 130 cases of torture, demonstrating the government's brutal crackdown on journalists for their perceived criticism. The UNAMA report documents numerous human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and detentions. Despite the Taliban's initial promises to respect human rights, the reality on the ground has been starkly different. The report reveals that women and girls have been particularly affected, facing severe restrictions on their rights to education, work, and participation in public life. One of the most alarming findings of the report is the systematic erosion of women's rights. The Taliban's policies have progressively restricted women's access to education and employment, effectively relegating them to the confines of their homes. The decision to bar girls from returning to secondary school has deprived a generation of their right to education, with long-term implications for the country's development. The report paints a grim picture of the shrinking space for freedom of expression in Afghanistan. Journalists and media outlets operate under constant threat, with many forced to self-censor or shut down entirely. UNAMA highlights numerous cases of intimidation, harassment, arbitrary detention, and even physical violence against journalists. Despite Afghanistan's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the de facto authorities have continuously violated these commitments by stifling freedom of expression and silencing independent media voices. The report also underscores the lack of accountability within the Taliban's administration. Despite some steps aimed at protecting human rights, such as amnesty for former government officials, the Taliban has been responsible for a broad range of violations. The absence of effective justice mechanisms and the dissolution of dedicated reporting pathways for gender-based violence have further exacerbated the situation. The civilian population has borne the brunt of the ongoing violence and instability. UNAMA recorded over 2,100 civilian casualties between mid-August 2021 and mid-June 2022, with many incidents attributed to targeted attacks by extremist groups. These attacks have disproportionately affected ethnic and religious minorities, compounding the challenges faced by vulnerable communities. According to UNAMA, over 28 million Afghans—more than two-thirds of the population—now require humanitarian assistance. Food insecurity is rampant, with families resorting to extreme measures such as selling children into marriage or labor to survive. The humanitarian crisis is further exacerbated by the Taliban’s restrictions on aid delivery, particularly where it involves women workers. The international community has expressed deep concern over the findings of the UNAMA report. There have been calls for increased humanitarian assistance and stronger diplomatic efforts to hold the Taliban accountable for their actions. The report also emphasizes the need for continued monitoring and reporting to ensure that human rights violations are documented and addressed. The international community's response is crucial in addressing these issues. Increased humanitarian assistance, diplomatic pressure, and continued monitoring are essential to ensure that human rights violations are documented and addressed. Supporting Afghan journalists and media workers is also vital, as they play a key role in exposing injustices and holding power to account. While the path forward is fraught with challenges, it is not without hope. With sustained international attention and targeted action, it is possible to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people and support their aspirations for a more equitable and just society. The time to act is now, before the human rights crisis deepens further into a humanitarian catastrophe.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35fhwhj6GpDnW	2024-12-11T09:21:36-08:00	
Oman: TotalEnergies And OQAE Sign Agreements To Develop 300 MW Of...	In line with its multi-energy strategy in the Sultanate of Oman, TotalEnergies announced Wednesday, together with its partner OQ Alternative Energy (OQAE), the National Renewable Energy Champion, the signing of landmark agreements to develop 300 MW of renewable energy projects in the country.

A New Syria By Union Of Clashing Interests – OpEd	Like many people around the world, I rejoiced with the liberated Syrian people when the tyrannical dynasty of a father and son that oppressed them for more than half a century finally came to an end. There is no doubt that the revolutionary lightning that struck Syria and brought down the regime with speed of light would have enormous geopolitical implications and perhaps regional rippling effect. No one can deny the historic significance of December 8. Future generations will be discussing and debating how ill or how well it changed the Middle East. As in all victories, heroes emerged and some even gained instant notoriety for being part of those who toppled Bashar al-Assad. Abu-Mohammed al-Jolani who is the leader of Ha'yat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is one of them. Already Qatar opened diplomatic communication with Mohamed al-Bashir as soon as he was appointed to lead Syria's transitional administration. Other regional states such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan are expected to follow suit. Too Good To Be True? It is important to note that HTS is the leading militia of the coalition of revolutionary rebels of all shades that liberated Syria. This coalition of Syrian and different foreign elements whose compatibility is untested—a coalition that I would call the Union of Clashing Interests (UCI), seem to be united only on one objective: deposing Bashar Al-Assad. This reminds me of the coalition of militias led by General Mohamed Farah Aidid that marched into Mogadishu, Somalia in 1991. The only thing they all agreed on was to get rid of President Mohamed Siyad Barre. They got their wish, but shortly after it became obvious that their unity had more holes than Swiss cheese and warlordism was their preferred power-sharing mechanism. In geopolitics, if something looks too convenient or too good to be true, follow your gut feeling. In this case, the timing—immediately after the Israel and Lebanon ceasefire was secured—and how al-Assad's grip on power was easily unclenched raise questions. Likewise, how the meticulously synchronized implementation process was successfully executed by UCI and its foreign partners in one of the most complex, oppressed, religiously and ethnically diverse countries in the Middle East without any resistance. The Doha Deal Though the master strategy, training, funding and mobilization was in the works for more than a decade, the implementation did not take place until the Foreign Ministers of Turkiye, Russia, and Iran met in Doha under the Qatari diplomatic facilitation. Russia and Iran realized the checkmate status they were facing ones they were told that Assad accepted a deal once he realized that resistance was futile. Qatar presumably delivered the U.S. commitment to honor the tripartite agreement or whatever privileges Russia and Iran were to get once they came on board. The meeting was by no means a smooth one, but in the end Russia and Iran had no choice but to accept the deal presented to them. Distribution of Spoils History will tell what deals and arrangements were finalized in Doha. We only know that some of Syria's friendly countries such as Russia and Iran have abruptly lost their strategic advantage while others more hostile stakeholders such as Israel, U.S. and Turkiye have gained. If the force driving this whole thing was a cooperative grand strategy, and it must've been, we now have the advantage of hindsight to reconstruct what it may've included. The UCI gets its main objective- ending the Assad tyrannic dynasty. UCI also accepts to only claim specifically designated geographical territories within Syria that is not already under foreign control, regardless of how existentially critical those territories might be for state-building. Assad gets an offer he could not refuse since his regime was already broken beyond repair and his economy was devastated to the point of being unable to pay his soldiers and civil servants' salaries, or even keep the lights on in Damascus. He and his immediate family would get safe exit to Russia via UAE. He would command his generals and cabinet ministers to avoid sabotaging the takeover process and to ensure smooth transitioning of power. Turkiye gets to keep the areas it already controls in Syria and gets to replace Russia as the most influential political actor. To be more specific, Turkiye will be the one running the new Syria. This, due to it's a decade-long investment and strategic allegiance with the HTS and other Syrian and Turkic rebel militias that are part of UCI. The U.S. gets to keep Syria's oil and gas fields and the agricultural territories that they have been exploiting for more than a decade. And Turkiye that is in a strategic partnership with U.S. (and Israel) will ignore this as it has been doing for a decade. This awkward but pragmatic position has labeled President Erdogan with hypocrisy in some circles. You can see in this 2019 clip, then President Trump reasserting U.S.' determination to keep Syria's oil and gas fields while President Erdogan was seated next to him in the White House. U.S. has the Syrian Kurds as a strategic leverage. Though losing its last loyal client in the Middle East is a major setback, Russia gets to host her most loyal friend in the Middle East indefinitely. But, despite losing Syria and some of its military bases, Russia gets reassurances to keep its sizeable airbase in north-west Syria and a naval facility at the Mediterranean port of Tartus. Iran gets to withdraw its special forces, military experts, intelligence, and diplomats safely. Iran gets reassurances that the Shia community will not be targeted for revenge. With previously telegraphed opportunity to get de-sanctioned which is also a green light to pursue its nuclear program, it was not a hard sell. Some policy and military experts advocate a Middle East version MAD (mutually assured destruction) strategy to deter Israel's four decade long threat. In exchange, Iran would cancel her planned retaliation attack against Israel. Exploitation By The Usual Suspect So, does this latest revolution in Syria lend a free hand to Israel to continue the genocide in Gaza and the annexation of the West Bank? The short but painful answer is, yes. However, this could also expedite the Zionist genocidal regime's demise. Despite Netanyahu's rhetoric of reengineering the Middle East to his preferred balance of power and making Israel the grand hegemon that totally dominates the region militarily, economically, and politically, such claim is nothing more than a pipedream. Of course, some may strongly disagree with this conclusion after seeing the military power that Israel has been projecting in its massive bombings of several countries at the same time and its total destruction of all of Syria's air and navy bases with all its fighter jets, navy ships as well as weapons factories and storage facilities since Assad's departure. Within 48 hours, Israel executed 350 major air strikes in Syria- an average of 7 strikes per hour. That is quite a shock and awe. But if military might alone could help Israel achieve its Zionist 'greater Israel' ambition, it would have happened 76 years ago. In the past 14 months of sadistic genocide against Palestinians of Gaza, people are still courageously insisting 'give me freedom or give me death.' During that period, Israel has become diplomatically more radioactive than ever before. Things have never been worse for Israel in terms of security, unity, economy and demography as a large number of its citizens have been fleeing the country to Europe and U.S. Like Ukraine, Israel is suffering shortage of soldiers. Yet it continues to start a new war across the region. Netanyahu and his extremist regime is yet to learn that hubris is evil, and evil boomerangs. Can the Second Revolution Last? The litmus test on the authenticity of this latest revolutionary movement is buried in the names of HTS and its leader, al-Golani.. If the movement's objective, as indicated in its Arabic name, is to liberate Sham. The historical Sham included modern day countries such as Syria, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, and parts of southern Türkiye. Al-Golani is a nickname to indicate HTS leader's ancestral roots- the Golan Heights which is illegally annexed by Israel. And since Al-Golani and the militias he leads took over Syria, Israel grabbed more Syrian land to keep as a 'buffer zone.' Though al-Golani and his militia group remain in the U.S. terrorist lists, they are being afforded platforms in Western media such as CNN and are being presented as reformed moderate rebels. This questionable relationship is explained by Jake Sullivan, the current National Security Advisor, in a declassified email he sent in 2012 to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton: 'AQ is on our side in Syria.' Al-Qaida/ISIS is a pawn. Though his reconciliatory statements and promises to institute democratic process for legitimacy and guarantees of protection to all minority communities are greatly appreciated, whether al-Golani has the vision, strategic patience, leadership skills, and the competent team necessary to lead broken Syria to become a functional and a unified state again is to be seen. Once the euphoria subsides, there must be objective reassessment and accountability. Meanwhile, a Divine intervention aside, the reconstitution of a single Syrian state within the current geopolitical dynamics in the region is simply too idealistic. This would require a unified Syrian-owned master strategy to disentangle the geopolitical live wires encircling this traumatized nation. There is a lot to learn from the Somalia experience. It is an open lesson.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35VNW_kmnPV4P	2024-12-11T09:18:15-08:00	
Ding Dong, Australia’s Misinformation-Disinformation Bill Is Dead...	Regulating speech at law is much like regulating breath. At what point is an intake of air deemed inappropriate to the body and worthy of rationing? When will exhalation be allowed? The very idea that speech requires ordering and control is the first step to preventing its exercise. Death, in this case to freedom of thought and political expression, is bound to follow. Unfortunately, the rationing of speech and its exercise is a favourite of governments the world over, even in liberal democratic countries. As it’s the only genuine way one can address the gross inequality between the power of the citizenry and the governing authorities exercising such a right is bound to strike terror in the hearts of those who shun accountability and criticism. Importantly, it also points to the possibility of losing control, be it over official narratives or myths deemed palatable to those in power. Much of this was evident in the recently ditched Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2024 proposed by Australia’s Albanese government. It was a bill that had already made its debut in a previous iteration but had been revised and redressed for parliamentary consumption. The revision, and redressing, failed to impress. In Australian Senate hearings on the bill, the edifice began to crumble. Nationals Senator Ross Cadell, in a question to the Communications Department, wondered why there wasn’t a single witness not a member of the government agency who 'says this bill should pass as it is'. On November 22, the Greens demanded that the government pull the draft, arguing that it exempted such media titans as Rupert Murdoch while shifting the responsibility 'to tech companies and billionaires like Elon Musk to determine what is true or false under ambiguous definitions.' Facing certain defeat, the Albanese government revealed its position a few days later. 'Based on public statements and engagements with senators, it is clear that there is no pathway to legislate this proposal through the Senate,' conceded Communications Minister Michelle Rowland. On its demise, former deputy prime minister and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce was characteristically colourful: 'This shabby, decrepit, blanket over democracy is not even going to make it to the Vinnies bin, […] it’s going straight to the tip where it will be burnt.' Why, then, was this bill so problematic? For one, it proposed adding schedule 9 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), imposing core obligations on digital platforms to make their own risk assessments regarding misinformation and disinformation on their platforms, and publishing their findings on the matter; publish their policy or policy approach regarding how misinformation and disinformation is managed; and publish what an oddly named 'a media literacy plan' that would outline the measures that the platform will take to enable users to identify misinformation and disinformation. In first placing the onus on digital tech giants to effectively police content supposedly deemed by Australian government regulators to fall foul of the 'mis-disinformation' bar, the warning shot to information exchange was being made with a clamour. But just to add another layer of stifling, rough and ready regulation, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) would have been empowered to do a number of things. Its powers would have included obtaining documents and information regarding such misinformation and disinformation from the platforms, make rules regarding their recording and retaining of records on the same, even if disallowable by Parliament; approve and register misinformation codes, even if disallowable by Parliament; and determine misinformation standards in cases where the misinformation codes supposedly did not protect the Australian community. When it comes to the relevant meanings, misinformation, for instance, is described in subclause 13(1) as content containing information 'reasonably verifiable as false, misleading or deceptive.' Expansively, and chillingly, this intended to include opinions, claims, commentary and invective. Indeed, the Explanatory Memorandum is damning in noting, with approval, such a provision, warning that 'experience from around the world suggests that misinformation and disinformation of this nature can influence public opinion and sway voter behaviour to such an extent that the outcome of an electoral process can no longer be said to represent the free will of the electorate.' Disinformation, subclause 13(2), shifts the focus to intention, namely, the 'grounds to suspect that the person disseminating, or causing the dissemination of, the content intends to deceive another person'. The concept of serious harm in the bill was critical. Not only would it cover such instances as information on public health, but also 'harm to the operation or integrity of a Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government electoral or referendum process'. Doing so would effectively vest ACMA with powers to comb through information shared during an electoral or referendum process, even if it was a mere opinion, true or false. Political speech becomes the object. The Bill was also not intended to cover the dissemination of 'professional news' – which more than suggests a threat to independent media outlets not officially approved as appropriate outlets for journalism. In the US, we can at least rely on constitutional protections that saw the sinking of the absurd Disinformation Government Board, established in 2022 to guide the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in targeting the deliberate dissemination of false information. The advisory body, while lacking, according to the DHS, 'operational authority or capability', was advertised as a council of wise creatures, working 'in a way that protects Americans’ freedom of speech, civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy.' The Board was swiftly, to cite a word common in press coverage at the time, 'paused' after a mere three weeks on suspicions that it would be unworkable and unconstitutional. 'Legally, it is rarely permissible for the US government to be the arbiter of truth,' wrote Jill Goldenziel for Forbes in May 2022. 'The name suggested that it would do just that – despite DHS officials’ protests that it was designed to protect free speech.' Despite these failings, the Board’s former chair, Nina Jankowicz, has been busy promoting its ideas abroad, notably on the issue of electoral interference. Jankowicz, who markets herself as a disinformation expert, did her best in a visit to Australia to warn about malicious agents attempting to meddle in the Australian electoral system. On Radio National’s Saturday Extra, she was unequivocal that the triumph of the 'No' vote in the 2023 referendum held to decide whether an indigenous voice should be constitutionally enshrined, had been driven by some 9,000 digital accounts based in China. Never mind that the voters convincingly rejected the proposition. Despite admitting that one should still look 'at the data' to verify her case, breezy speculation abounded. An indigenous voice to parliament could have threatened Chinese mining rights. Joyce is only partly correct in assuming that this hideous bill perished in a fiery tip reserved for bad legislation. Its remains will be revived and reincarnated in due course, along with the justifications of danger, instability and chaos that arise when citizens traverse the World Wide Web unsupervised. And it is impossible to imagine a Coalition government, certainly one run by the paranoid Peter Dutton, resisting the temptations of restricting thought, content and communications expressed online.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpHiqiiu3Ckk3	2024-12-10T17:32:30-08:00	
Lithuania’s Political Shift: Domestic And Foreign Policy – OpEd	By Linas Kojala (FPRI) -- In October 2024, Lithuania’s opposition Social Democratic Party (LSDP) emerged victorious in the parliamentary elections, defeating the center-right Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (HU-LCD), which had been in power since 2020. The Social Democrats secured 52 seats, while the HU-LCD won 28. Other parties included the nationalist-populist Dawn of Nemunas, with 20 seats, and the Democratic Union 'For Lithuania' (DVSL) with 14. The Social Democrats formed a coalition with DVSL and Dawn of Nemunas, achieving a commanding majority with 86 out of 141 seats. This outcome aligned with Lithuania’s political tradition of not reelecting the same government since independence in 1990. During the campaign, the Social Democrats emphasized their opposition to forming a grand coalition with the center-right, despite HU-LCD leaders expressing openness to such an arrangement. On November 21, Gintautas Paluckas was appointed Prime Minister after Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, the leader of the Social Democrats, chose to remain in her European Parliament role instead of pursuing the position of Prime Minister, despite previously pledging to assume full responsibility for the government if elected. Paluckas, who has served as a member of Parliament since 2020 and as Deputy Mayor of Vilnius, led the Social Democratic Party from 2017 to 2021. The Social Democrats’ campaign largely focused on domestic issues, including combating the rising cost of living, fighting poverty, improving healthcare access, and ensuring a dignified life for citizens. They also highlighted the importance of preparing for potential crises, strengthening national defenses, and reinforcing Lithuania’s European and transatlantic partnerships. Education, which has faced challenges in recent years, was also a major theme. The newly formed ruling coalition immediately faced criticism due to accusations of anti-Semitic statements against Remigijus Žemaitaitis, leader of the Dawn of the Nemunas party. Although Žemaitaitis denied the charges, the Lithuanian Constitutional Court ruled earlier this year that his comments about Jewish people incited hatred and violated the constitution, as well as breached his oath of office. In response, Paluckas assured the public that the government would not tolerate any anti-Semitic rhetoric or actions. Meanwhile, President Nausėda announced that members of Žemaitaitis’ party would not be appointed to the government, leaving the possibility for technocratic appointments only. Future of Foreign and Security Policy While national security and foreign affairs were not central issues during the election campaign, as major parties broadly agreed on supporting Lithuania’s NATO and EU membership, there is little expectation of change in Lithuania’s foreign and security policy. Public opinion strongly supports these alliances, and the government is expected to continue its robust stance in defense matters and international relations. The new government plans to allocate at least 3% of GDP to defense in 2025, with an aim of reaching 3.5% in the near future. Additional spending is needed to prepare the necessary infrastructure to host a full German brigade by 2027 and form a national division by 2030. Dovilė Šakalienė, the Social Democratic choice for defense minister, is strongly committed to these goals. Kęstutis Budrys, the designated foreign minister and current national security advisor to President Nausėda, will likely strengthen coordination between the presidency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One area of divergence between President Nausėda and outgoing foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis was their approach to China. In 2021, Lithuania’s decision to open a Taiwanese representative office resulted in a severe response from China, including recalling its ambassador and imposing trade sanctions. While President Nausėda has advocated for restoring diplomatic relations with China, he insists this must occur without yielding to Beijing’s demands. Prime Minister Paluckas shares this stance; although, a significant breakthrough in relations is unlikely without major concessions from Lithuania, especially given China’s firm position. According to Budrys, the ball is in China’s court to improve the bilateral relationship. Lithuanians have closely followed the US presidential election, with polls showing a strong preference for Kamala Harris over Donald Trump, likely due to Trump’s stance on Ukraine and NATO. While concerns remain about continued military support for Ukraine and NATO obligations under a potential second Trump administration, past experiences indicate that Lithuania’s strategic alignment with NATO and Ukraine will remain intact. To maintain good relations with Trump, Lithuania is emphasizing that it is surpassing NATO defense spending requirements, taking a strong stance on China, and continuing to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US through its national LNG terminal. Lithuania is also in consideration to increase these imports. In a pre-election interview, Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security advisor, underscored Lithuania’s energy policy just before the presidential election, emphasizing the importance of closer energy ties. In conclusion, while domestic politics in Lithuania have shifted with the center-left forces now in power, foreign policy is expected to remain largely unchanged. Lithuania will continue to align with NATO and the EU, support Ukraine, and take a firm stance on China. However, challenges may emerge from a potential second Trump administration, particularly regarding military support for Ukraine and NATO obligations. A recent poll in the US offers some reassurance, as 54% of Americans say they support defending Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia if Russia were to attack—a figure that has remained steady over the years. One major event on the horizon to address these challenges is the tenth Vilnius Foreign and Security Policy Conference on December 10, 2024, organized by the Geopolitics and Security Studies Center (previously known as Eastern Europe Studies Center) in Vilnius. The conference will focus on critical security and foreign policy issues, bringing together international leaders, newly appointed government officials, and experts to discuss the future of NATO, regional security, and the evolving geopolitical landscape. The Foreign Policy Research Institute will partner with the event, broadcasting the discussions via social media platforms. Register to attend virtually.

Indonesian Armed Forces May Resist Anti-Graft Agency Probing Mili...	By Nazarudin Latif and Pizaro Gozali Idrus The Indonesian armed forces may resist a landmark court ruling last month that gave the national anti-graft agency a greenlight to investigate corruption in the military, analysts are warning. The military has long enjoyed autonomy in handling criminal cases involving its members, but that has contributed to a perception that it protects the armed forces from accountability, according to political observers. Potential pushback from the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) to the newly expanded powers of the Corruption Eradication Commission(KPK) could manifest in a non-formal way, said Khairul Fahmi, a military analyst. 'The military may delay access to documents or witnesses, citing national security concerns,' Fahmi, with the Institute for Security and Strategic Studies (ISESS) in Jakarta, told BenarNews. 'Additionally, internal regulations within the TNI might not align with the KPK’s procedures, which could slow down investigations.' On Nov. 29, the Constitutional Court ruled that the commission could pursue cases involving military personnel if the investigation began under the KPK’s jurisdiction. The ruling took immediate effect. Cases initiated by other law enforcement agencies or within the military justice system would remain outside the KPK’s purview, the ruling said. Previously, military courts mostly maintained jurisdiction over cases related to the armed forces. Indonesia’s military has maintained a judicial system that operates separately from civilian courts, with proceedings often shielded from public scrutiny, Fahmi noted. 'The military’s strong hierarchical culture often creates reluctance to involve external parties in internal matters, including corruption cases, as such involvement is perceived as a threat to its autonomy,' Fahmi said. TNI spokesperson Maj. Gen. Haryanto said the military was studying the ruling. 'We will ensure that the enforcement of this decision adheres to principles of justice and transparency, without compromising our core duties of safeguarding the nation’s sovereignty,' he said. The ruling also highlights the military’s entrenched power within Indonesian society and its dominance in the country’s political landscape, especially during the 32-year rule of President Suharto, the late dictator, analysts have said. Any potential resistance to a shift in this power could also be shaped by the military’s internal culture, which prizes loyalty and hierarchy, they said. These attributes may discourage whistleblowing or external oversight, as subordinates are unlikely to challenge superiors. This can, in turn, foster a culture of impunity, where corrupt practices are tolerated to maintain internal solidarity. Such a situation has often led to the protection of officers involved in corruption, which creates a culture of impunity that is difficult to break, said Jaleswari Pramodhawardani, the head of Lab45, a political and security policy think-tank. 'Defense and security sectors are prone to corruption, but tackling these issues requires navigating intricate political dynamics and national security concerns,' Jaleswari told BenarNews. She pointed out that the Ministry of Defense’s budget has often been criticized for its lack of transparency, further complicating efforts to monitor military spending effectively by adding another layer of difficulty in effective monitoring. Alexander Marwata, a KPK deputy chairman, said the court’s ruling would lead to fair probes, the state news agency Antara reported. 'This decision reaffirms the KPK’s authority to investigate corruption cases, ensuring that those who were previously above the law, can be investigated fairly,' Marwata said. KPK often has to halt inquiry The Constitutional Court’s ruling marks an opportunity to address longstanding cases of military corruption that have been sidelined because of the secrecy of military courts, according to Julius Ibrani, director of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (PBHI). 'Many corruption cases have faced difficulties due to national security concerns and the exclusive military court system,' Julius told BenarNews. He cited past cases, such as an investigation into then-Vice Marshal Henri Alfiandi, the former head of the National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas), where the KPK was forced to halt its inquiry after military police took over the case. Henri was accused of accepting bribes totaling 8.65 billion rupiah (U.S. $546,474) related to procurement projects at Basarnas between 2021 and 2023. He went on trial in March, but the verdict has not been made public. Diky Anandya, a researcher at Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW), said the KPK needed to map potential corruption hotspots within the military and the Ministry of Defense. 'Any investigations involving active-duty personnel should fall under the KPK’s jurisdiction to ensure impartiality,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpAGw1tYKtDyr	2024-12-10T16:49:18-08:00	
Georgia On The Brink: What The US Should Do Next – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Current Situation For the past week, hundreds of thousands of Georgians have taken to the streets to protest the Georgian Dream government. While the protests have been centered in Tbilisi, large-scale demonstrations are taking place across the country, including in Batumi, Kutaisi, Zugdidi, and Gori. Large rallies (by local standards) have also been taking place in smaller towns that have no track record of such activity, like Khashuri, Kareli, and Zestaphoni. These protests are driven by several grievances: (1) the Georgian Dream government’s recent announcement that it will suspend European Union membership talks until 2028, (2) the questionable administration of the October parliamentary elections, (3) mounting controversy surrounding the government’s current nominee for the presidency, and (4) the government’s heavy-handed treatment of protesters, which has included beating, detaining, and arresting protesters and the reckless use of tear gas and water cannons in freezing temperatures. Why the US Should Care about Georgia Georgia’s struggle is part of the wider geopolitical struggle between Russia and the West. In recent years, Georgian Dream has adopted a decidedly pro-Kremlin worldview, denounced Western sanctions against Moscow, increased Georgia’s economic relations with Russia, and blamed the war in Ukraine on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The party has remained in control thanks to power consolidation efforts that seek to undermine legitimate political opposition, civil society, and the media. Georgians are standing up to Russia, a noble cause that aligns with the United States’ national interest. Georgia’s strategic location makes it important for US objectives in Eurasia. Georgia sits at a crucial geographical and cultural crossroads in the South Caucasus and has remained militarily and economically vital for centuries. Oil and gas pipelines that pass through the country are particularly important to Europe’s energy security and therefore to US interests as well. Georgia demonstrates the importance of national sovereignty.Georgia represents the idea that sovereign nations should determine their own paths. Georgians should decide who their country’s allies are, who their leaders are, and how they are governed. No outside actor (in this case, Russia) can veto another country’s participation in organizations like the EU or NATO. The US needs to restore its respect in Georgia. Georgian Dream officials have publicly attacked or mocked multiple US ambassadors, members of Congress, and other senior US officials who support the Georgian people. The Georgian people have stood with the US in the past. Before Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia, it had the second most troops in Iraq after the US. And on a per capita basis, Georgia lost more soldiers in Afghanistan than any other nation. At the height of Georgia’s participation in that war, the country had more than 2,000 troops deployed to some of the deadliest places in the country, if not the world, in the Helmand and Kandahar Provinces. Time for Action In coordination with the European Union and the United Kingdom, the US should: Encourage snap elections in spring 2025 under international supervision. The US should not recognize the legitimacy of the Georgian parliament and should support President Salome Zourabichvili’s efforts to hold new elections and create a new central election commission. Target Georgian Dream leaders and pro-regime security forces with sanctions and travel bans. At a minimum, the US should implement the same sanctions that Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia recently levied against Georgian officials. All sanctioned officials should be named publicly. The US should also consider the use of the Magnitsky Act. To go further, Congress could bring the MEGOBARI Act and the Georgian People’s Act to a vote before the legislative session adjourns. Downgrade the US diplomatic presence in Georgia until there is a legitimate government in Tbilisi. The US should replace its ambassador to Tbilisi with a chargé d’affaires. And Washington should not accept the credentials for a new Georgian ambassador after the previous one courageously resigned in protest against Georgian Dream’s actions. Suspend all US-Georgia military cooperation until there is a legitimate government in place. This should include joint training exercises, military education programs, and the National Guard State Partnership Program between Tbilisi and the US state of Georgia. Block NATO-Georgia engagement until there is a legitimate government in place. This should include (1) meetings of the NATO-Georgia Commission, (2) the Substantial NATO-Georgia Package, (3) the Defence Institution Building School, and (4) Georgia’s participation in the NATO Response Force. Collect and collate information about Georgian security service personnel involved in the unlawful crackdown on peaceful protesters. The US State Department and the Department of Homeland Security should allow social media users to submit evidence anonymously through a secure website to identify security personnel involved in the repression. The US, UK, and EU should use this information to vet future applications for entry. Ensure that US Agency for International Development (USAID) funds allocated for Georgia support America’s national interest. The US has already paused $95 million in foreign aid programs that directly support the Georgian Dream government. In addition, the US should use USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives to rapidly increase aid to pro-democracy civil society groups and independent media organizations.

China Balances Cautiously Between Russia And North Korea – Analys...	By Yao Bowen The recent strengthening of the alliance between Russia and North Korea marks an unusual convergence of military and political interests. With reports of North Korean soldiers supporting Russia in the Ukraine war, the alliance has significant implications for regional and global geopolitical dynamics. For China, the Russia–North Korea alignment has some advantages but also presents has risks, reminiscent of its experience in the Cold War. China remains cautious about alliances, a stance it has maintained throughout the post-Cold War era. North Korea is China’s only treaty ally, though senior Chinese officials have declared the relationship between Beijing and Moscow as one that has ‘no limits’ in the lead up to the Russia-Ukraine war. Historical parallels, particularly with the Korean War, reveal much about China’s current strategy. In the 1950s, the Soviet Union and North Korea initiated the Korean War without consulting China, drawing Beijing into a costly conflict to defend its borders and strategic interests. Two key differences define the present situation. First, the Korean War unfolded on China’s doorstep and necessitated its direct intervention, while the geographical distance of the Ukraine war reduces the urgency of Chinese involvement. Second, China no longer relies economically or militarily on Russia. Instead, Moscow seeks Beijing’s support, giving China greater manoeuvring room to prioritise its national interests without being ensnared in conflicts that could jeopardise its global interests. China’s relationship with North Korea remains a complex and often fraught issue. While state media typically steers clear of criticising Pyongyang, academic circles in China openly discuss the country’s policy towards its unpredictable neighbour. Some scholars have advocated for a reassessment of Beijing’s stance on Pyongyang, warning against the risks of close alignmentwith North Korea. These debates highlight the ongoing tension between China’s historical and ideological connections to Pyongyang and its pragmatic focus on national interests. This delicate balancing act is evident in China’s restrained response to the deepening Russia–North Korea alliance, with Beijing carefully avoiding moves that might provoke Western retaliation or disrupt vital economic ties. The Russia–North Korea partnership presents both opportunities and challenges for China. On the one hand, it could divert US attention and resources from regions like the South China Sea and Taiwan. On the other hand, deeper entanglement in the Russia–North Korea alliance risks destabilising regional stability and damaging China’s international image, especially if the West intensifies scrutiny or escalates military its posture towards Russia. Lessons from the Korean War continue to shape China’s diplomatic strategy. Stalin’s unilateral decision to support North Korea in the 1950s showcased the dangers of asymmetrical alliances, where China bore disproportionate costs. Today’s alliance dynamics underscore the importance Beijing places on maintaining agency in decision-making. Transparent and reciprocal partnerships are essential to avoid being dragged into conflicts that do not serve China’s strategic goals. China’s historical experience with Taiwan also informs Beijing’s restrained stance. The outbreak of the Korean War prompted the United States to include Taiwan under its defence umbrella, thwarting China’s ambitions to reunify the island. This historical episode heightens Beijing’s aversion to direct confrontation with the United States and its preference for maintaining stability to focus on long-term economic growth. Despite its wariness, China’s tacit support for North Korea and Russia stems from shared opposition to Western hegemony although Beijing’s involvement remains carefully calibrated to align with its economic and political priorities. This pragmatic approach helps China navigate the complexities of its relationships without succumbing to ideological pressure. Growing Russia–North Korea ties could, however, destabilise Northeast Asia, a region where China has a most significant stake. An emboldened North Korea, backed by Russia, could provoke regional tensions, undermining China’s efforts to maintain a stable environment for economic development. And aligning too closely with international pariahs risks alienating China’s partners in Europe and Southeast Asia, complicating its bid to position itself as a global leader. Recent diplomatic engagements illustrate China’s nuanced stance. During the November 2024 G20 sideline meeting with US President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that China will not tolerate conflict on the Korean Peninsula and will not remain idle if its strategic security and core interests are under threat. This assertion underscores China’s view of the Korean Peninsula as a core interest, and explains its cautious approach to the Russia–North Korea alliance. China’s delicate balancing act highlights the challenges of managing historical alliances in a modern context. By drawing on lessons learnt from the Korean War, China seeks to avoid the pitfalls of asymmetric dependence while prioritising its long-term ambitions. Its careful diplomacy aims to harness the strategic advantages of its partnerships without being drawn into a costly confrontation. Historical experience during the Cold War reminds China of the risks inherent in ideological alliances and the need for a pragmatic approach to secure its future on the global stage.

America’s Disastrous And Endless Meddling In Asia – OpEd	The 'loss of China' to communism in 1949 was a pivotal moment in American foreign policy, for the fall of the Nationalist government (Kuomintang, KMT) led by Chiang Kai-shek to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Mao Zedong marked a significant shift in the geopolitical landscape of Asia. It was quickly followed by the outbreak of war in Korea, and indeed Washington’s calculations regarding the peninsula became closely entangled with their calculations regarding the new regime in Beijing. This article examines the Truman administration’s policies regarding China and Taiwan before the outbreak of the Korean War, the strategic calculations involved, the impact of domestic political pressures, particularly McCarthyism, on U.S. foreign policy, and their relevance to today. Following World War II, the civil war in China between the Nationalists and the Communists, interrupted by the Second Sino-Japanese War, reignited. Despite substantial American support, the Nationalists were unable to maintain control. Dean Acheson, Secretary of State under President Harry S. Truman, detailed the reasons for this failure in his statement on August 5, 1949. In it, Acheson pointed out that the Nationalist government’s collapse was due to internal decay, lack of popular support, and military ineptitude, not the inadequacy of American aid, writing: 'The reasons for the failures of the Chinese National Government […] do not stem from any inadequacy of American aid […] The fact was that the decay which our observers had detected […] had fatally sapped the powers of resistance of the Kuomintang.' Indeed. The United States had provided nearly $2 billion in grants and credits to the Nationalist government post-V-J Day, and this his aid was aimed at stabilizing China and curbing the spread of communism; however, the Nationalist forces were plagued by corruption and a lack of will to fight, resulting in large quantities of U.S.-supplied military equipment falling into Communist hands. In the face of this early failure of what would become standard operating procedure, propping up an unpopular, corrupt, inefficient government that ultimately collapses, Acheson argued against American military intervention, which would have required commanding Nationalist armies and possibly deploying U.S. troops, stating: 'A realistic appraisal of conditions in China [...] leads to the conclusion that the only alternative open to the United States was full-scale intervention […] Such intervention […] would have been condemned by the American people.' Here it is important to note that Acheson’s objection was not based on a geopolitical calculus but a domestic one: more on this familiar theme in a moment. However, given the constraints in play Acheson saw another possibility: Mao Zedong as an Asian Tito. That is, similar to Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, who had shunned Stalin and so already fractured the supposedly monolithic communist bloc, Acheson believed that Mao might pursue a path of relative independence from the Soviet Union. Hence, Dean’s memo from December 30, 1949: 'The United States should exploit, through appropriate political, psychological, and economic means, any rifts between the Chinese Communists and the USSR and between the Stalinists and other elements in China.' This idea, too, was stymied by domestic political considerations: the rise of the New Right in the United States, fueled in part by Senator Joseph McCarthy’s domestic anti-communist campaign, reshaped the political climate and transformed the American right. As Murray Rothbard observed, McCarthyism served as a pivotal catalyst for shifting the right-wing mass base from its earlier isolationist and quasi-libertarian stance to one centered on anti-communism and international intervention. While McCarthy initially targeted government officials and bureaucrats, this movement’s broader impact laid the groundwork for an increasingly hawkish foreign policy agenda. The New Right forces behind McCarthy soon turned their focus from domestic anti-communism to promoting military interventions abroad, particularly in Asia. This shift stymied any potential diplomatic openings with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and entrenched a confrontational approach. It also set the stage for U.S. commitments in Korea, Vietnam, and continued support for the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War, as domestic red-baiting transformed into international red-baiting. The political environment made even pragmatic approaches, such as Acheson’s notion of exploiting rifts between Mao and Stalin, politically untenable. The New Right’s influence thus locked U.S. foreign policy into a rigidly anti-communist framework, with disastrous consequences both domestically and abroad. Indeed, fearing further recriminations for additional communist gains in east Asia, Truman plunged the country into Korea, just as, fearing the prospect of further gains, Truman and then Eisenhower would commit and then recommit to safeguarding the independence of the Republic of China based on Formosa (Taiwan). The result of all this was disastrous: apart from the human toll, which is in the unknown millions, the Korean War led to military ties to states across east Asia, including Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines – and despite the Cold War’s end it is important to note that these treaties are still active and commit the United States to fighting conflicts on their behalf! So, too, in Taiwan, where red baiting combined with intense pressure from the China lobby to prevent the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War with a mutual defense treaty – and despite the treaty having been ripped up when relations between Washington and Beijing were normalized in 1979, a de facto commitment to fight a war with mainland China on the Taipei’s behalf if it comes down to it is still a clear and present danger to Americans and America! In the words of the late, great Justin Raimondo: 'All foreign policy is domestic policy,' and this was never truer than of the events surrounding the 'loss of China' and the plunging of the United States into war – I mean, uh, 'police action' – in Korea. The applicable lessons for today are obvious, and perhaps nowhere more obvious than the failure of the Biden administration to reenter the Iran nuclear deal: fearing the political consequences at home, they stuck with Trump’s policy. The same could probably be argued about Trump’s economic war with China or his administration’s decision to rip up important treaties with the Russians. Beyond this, Americans should be constantly reminded that their government has enlisted them to fight a war with China over some rocks and piles of sand in the South and East China Seas whenever anyone in Tokyo or Manila happens to push the line too far with their larger neighbor. As a concluding note or disclaimer: none of the above should be seen as a defense of Dean Acheson, if for no other reason than that he, more than any other single person, was responsible for U.S. entry into Korea – an intervention that put the kibosh on his simultaneous plans to coup Chiang Kai-Shek and replace him with someone more amenable to his own plans for the future of Taiwan…perhaps an article for another day… This article was published by the Mises Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpPSsGeDso5kF	2024-12-10T16:45:14-08:00	
Trump’s Return To Power And The Future Of Climate Action – Analys...	By Krishna Vohra While the world anxiously awaits to learn what Donald Trump’s second term in office might look like, climate experts seem to have accepted that his win is a 'major threat to the planet'. This is unsurprising given that, in his first term, Trump withdrew the United States (US) from the 2015 Paris Climate Accords and has made it a promise to do so again. During his campaign, Trump emphasised the importance of oil and claimed that his first term achieved the best environmental numbers, 'the cleanest air … [and] … the cleanest water.' Trump’s opinions are a stale reprise of the period in history when climate action was considered to be nothing more than an expensive inconvenience that slows down economic growth. His scepticism towards climate change is well-known; Trump has never been reluctant to make his explicit thoughts on social media being a platform for his candid thoughts explicit on social media. While the language around his position has evolved, his position remains unchanged. In September earlier this year, he claimed that the effects of climate change in America are exaggerated and 'not our problem', promising a swift return to fossil fuels. At a recent rally, Trump was asked about how he plans to tackle inflation. He replied that once energy costs are brought down, everything else will naturally follow. In another interview, Trump remarked: 'There’s never been [a] mess like this and it’s all because of what they [the Biden administration] did with energy.' The fix to rising energy costs, for Trump, is restoring the predominance of oil and burning fossil fuels. Chris Wright, Trump’s newly appointed energy secretary has made this solution quite clear: to move away from 'very expensive' green energy and back to old-school high-emission energy. A strong critic of the Democratic Party’s recent decarbonisation policies, one of Wright’s first points of action may be to end the pause on natural gas export permits that were put in place a year ago by President Biden's administration. The energy secretary appointee has previously denied the existence of the climate crisis, reiterating that environmental regulations need to be lifted to decrease costs. Wright also claimed that burning fossil fuels is the answer to rising costs, inflation, and poverty. Repealing the IRA— 'green new scam' The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been a frequent point of discussion during the Trump campaign, but the name is by no means self-explanatory. The IRA was enacted by the Biden administration in 2022, though it has little to do with inflation reduction, at least in the short term. It’s a significant piece of legislation that is more concerned with climate policy, manufacturing, and trade. The act proposes a US$1.2 trillion investment package in clean technology, including EVs, wind turbines, and solar panels. It was regarded as Biden’s most successful action as president, which has proven to be an accelerating factor towards achieving emission reductions while also building a more resilient supply chain for clean energy. Trump has vowed to repeal the IRA, or the 'green new scam', as he refers to it. Repealing the act could cost the US billions and would require approval from the United States Congress. Trump might face resistance from Republican members of Congress, as 80 percent of the act’s manufacturing investments have already flown to Republican districts. For instance, manufacturing plants for solar panels and electric vehicle (EV) components in Georgia and battery factories in South Carolina have received significant funding and generated thousands of clean jobs. Many of Trump’s allies like Elon Musk and his company Tesla have also already benefited from tax credits provided by the IRA. The Biden administration’s infrastructure and clean energy investments by state: Map Deregulating drilling and fracking 'We will drill baby drill, expand all forms of Energy production to grow our economy, and create good-paying jobs,' wrote Trump in a recent statement, naming Doug Burgum as the new head of the White House Council on Energy. Burgum will work alongside Wright in making key energy-related decisions and shaping policies. Trump’s new slogan can be viewed as an explicit promise to further increase US emissions. The President-elect has also made clear his commitment to achieving 'energy dominance', by reinstating oil and gas leases for American corporations that were previously removed by the Biden administration. Some experts believe that Trump’s strategy may not actually lower energy prices as promised; as merely pumping more oil may not decrease energy costs for several reasons. With investment facilitated by the Biden administration’s IRA, many Republican states have been given an 'inconvenient gift,', as one report describes it. It will prove costly and difficult to backtrack on climate finance that has already flown into red states like Georgia and South Carolina that benefited from the IRA. It would also cause thousands of jobs that were created as a result of the new legislation, to essentially disappear in these states. US$250 million was pumped into Republican states; it will not be simple convincing a Republican Congress to repeal it. Some believe that the world will survive another American withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Climate Accords. Contrary to expectations, other countries did not follow suit and pull out from the agreement, and they may show their resilience once again. Trump’s decisions and new policies essentially absolves the US of its responsibilities, like multilateral cooperation and to even report on emissions, which are expected to further increase dramatically after the swearing-in of the 47th President. Furthermore, this also removes any obligation for America to provide billions of dollars in international climate finance, which would have been invaluable in the global climate effort. Whatever the outcome, Trump 2.0 is going to be inherently unpredictable - just as his recent creation of the new governmental entity, the 'Department of Governmental Efficiency' (DOGE). DOGE is a non-governmental task force, created to fire federal employees, reduce government programs, and eliminate federal regulations. This is part of Trump’s 'Save America' initiative and he has appointed Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to head the department. In a domestic context, Trump’s first term in office showed that progress was made in clean energy initiatives despite his rhetoric because companies and American states continued to proceed with renewables, even Republican states. In California, the private sector kept greening its energy choices in response to consumer demand. Despite Biden’s nominal acceptance of climate change as a serious threat, however, little changed in practice. Biden promised 'no more drilling' in the run-up to the 2020 election. In reality, the Biden administration did not live up to this promise. The US also did not deliver on its commitments to global climate action and finance. The time for a paradigm shift is now For climate-vulnerable countries, inadequate climate finance is hardly surprising. Even with more progressive policies during Joe Biden’s four years, the deficiency of climate finance in the Global South remains severe. Less than 3 percent of all climate finance flows to ‘developing’ countries, already a pitiable figure. Emerging economies should already realise that it is time to stop relying on an insular America. The walkout by climate-vulnerable nations from COP29 in Baku is the culmination of growing frustration with the current paradigm. The rest of the world must move forward and persist with climate action while holding space for the US to rejoin whenever that time may come. Countries in the Indo-Pacific region are the primary drivers of the world’s economic growth, and emerging powers must take the lead. This needs to be achieved with South-led action through bilateral and trilateral cooperation that reimagines the existing notions of multilateral cooperation. This is not to say that the Global South should insulate itself. Quite contrarily, it should prepare for scenarios where America’s absence will be less pronounced. An important component of a more multi-centric world must involve renewed and strengthened leadership within the Indo-Pacific. In light of growing uncertainties with the shifting balance of power, key regional players in the Indo-Pacific—such as India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, are already taking proactive measures aimed at ensuring a just transition in the region. It is becoming increasingly clear that these nations must collaborate towards common goals without direct American involvement. To begin with, India, Japan, and Korea should scale up efforts to generate renewable energy through sources like solar power, wind turbines, biomass, and hydroelectricity. Moreover, these nations must also lead the way and take a step further in addressing hard-to-abate industries, namely steel, iron, and cement. The use of new alternative fuels like green hydrogen will be indispensable in the transition of these industries to greener pathways. While the outcome of this election may feel like a palpable loss for the planet as a whole, other nations must seize the opportunity to fill in the vacuum that America may leave and provide strong leadership.

What Does Assad’s Downfall Mean For The Millions Of Syrians Displ...	By Anan Tello Although Syria remains in a precarious state just days after the fall of the regime of Bashar Assad, hundreds of displaced Syrians have flocked to border crossings in Lebanon and Turkiye, eager to return to their homeland after more than 13 grueling years of civil war. At daybreak on Monday, scores of people gathered at the Cilvegozu and Oncupinar border gates in southern Turkiye and the Masnaa crossing in Lebanon, confident for the first time in years that they would not face arrest or conscription when they reached the other side. On Sunday, in a historic moment for the Middle East, a coalition of armed opposition groups led by Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham seized Damascus. Now a refugee himself, Assad fled the country and sought asylum in Russia, marking an inglorious end of his family’s brutal 54-year rule. Syrians displaced across the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and further afield by the years of fighting and persecution in their home country poured into the streets in celebration, jubilant that the uprising that began in 2011 had finally succeeded in dislodging Assad. Syria remains the world’s largest refugee crisis. Since the outbreak of civil war in 2011 following the regime’s brutal suppression of anti-government protests, the UN says more than 14 million Syrians have been forced to flee their homes. While the majority sought refuge in other parts of Syria, including areas outside the regime’s control, others fled to neighboring countries — primarily Turkiye and Lebanon, but also Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq. Many more risked the perilous Mediterranean crossing to Europe. Some 7.2 million Syrians remain internally displaced, where 70 percent of the population is deemed to require humanitarian assistance and where 90 percent live below the poverty line, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. More than 5 million Syrian refugees live in the five neighboring countries — Turkiye, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt. Turkiye alone hosts around 3.2 million registered with the UNHCR, while Lebanon hosts at least 830,000. Karam Shaar, a senior fellow at the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, believes the first Syrians to return are likely 'the most vulnerable,' such as those in Lebanon and in Turkiye, who have endured poverty and mounting hostility. 'In general, because of the situation in Lebanon and Turkiye being so bad, I think these people would be the most likely to come back,' Shaar told Arab News. 'Many of them would be willing to go back to the rubble of their houses as long as Assad is not there because it just can’t get any worse.' In Lebanon, anti-Syrian sentiment has grown significantly since the country was plunged into a debilitating economic crisis in 2019. There have even been cases of violence against members of the community and their property. In April, Syrians were attacked and publicly humiliated in the streets of Byblos after a senior Lebanese Forces official, Pascal Suleiman, was reportedly killed by a Syrian gang during a botched carjacking. Compounding the plight of Syrians, the recent Israeli assault on Lebanon has displaced many families already struggling to survive, forcing them to live on the streets amid reports they have been denied access to municipal shelters. Even before the outbreak of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, displaced Syrians were subjected to restrictions on work and access to public services. Some 90 percent of them lived in extreme poverty, according to the UN. Returning to Syria while Assad remained in power was out of the question for many. Before the regime’s downfall on Sunday, Human Rights Watch warned that Syrians fleeing Lebanon risked repression and persecution upon their return, including 'enforced disappearance, torture, and death in detention.' Indeed, the Syrian Network for Human Rights documented at least nine arrests of returnees prior to Oct. 2, most of which were reportedly linked to 'mandatory and reserve' military conscription. In Turkiye, Syrians have frequently been scapegoated by politicians. In July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused opposition parties of fueling xenophobia and racism. His remarks came a day after anti-Syrian riots broke out in the Kayseri province after a Syrian refugee there was alleged to have sexually assaulted a 7-year-old Syrian girl. A similar wave of violence erupted in an Ankara neighborhood in 2021 after a Turkish teenager was stabbed to death by a group of young Syrians. Hundreds of people took to the streets, vandalizing Syrian owned businesses. Erdogan announced on Monday that Turkiye was opening its Yayladagi border gate with Syria to facilitate the safe and voluntary return of refugees, Reuters reported. Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country would support the return of Syrians to contribute to the reconstruction of the conflict-ravaged country. 'Those with families in Syria are eager to at least pay them a visit,' Marwah Morhly, a Turkiye-based media professional, told Arab News. 'Many are making plans to visit their hometowns with their children, who were born in Turkiye and have never been to Syria or met their relatives in person.' However, given the ongoing insecurity and political uncertainty in Syria, and the fact that many Syrians have built lives in Turkiye, the decision to return is not an easy one to make. Morhly herself is hesitant about visiting, despite longing for her hometown of Damascus. 'I can’t take a risk with a young child,' she said, referring to her son. Such a decision would depend on a Syrian-Turkish agreement on the refugee issue, she added. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said 'there is a remarkable opportunity' for Syrians 'to begin returning home.' 'But with the situation still uncertain, millions of refugees are carefully assessing how safe it is to do so. Some are eager, while others are hesitant,' he added in a statement on Monday. Urging 'patience and vigilance,' he expressed hope that refugees would be able to 'make informed decisions' based on developments on the ground. Those decisions, he added, would depend on 'whether the parties in Syria prioritize law and order.' He stressed that 'a transition that respects the rights, lives, and aspirations of all Syrians — regardless of ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs — is crucial for people to feel safe.' UNHCR 'will monitor developments, engage with refugee communities, and support states in any organized voluntary returns,' he added, pledging to 'support Syrians wherever they are.' Grandi also highlighted that 'the needs within Syria remain immense,' as more than 13 years of war and economic sanctions had 'shattered infrastructure.' In Europe, home to at least 4.5 million Syrian refugees, several countries — including Austria, France, The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Greece, and the UK — announced they had halted Syrian asylum applications just hours after Assad’s fall. Germany, which is home to the continent’s largest Syrian diaspora, was one of the first European countries to respond. Nancy Faeser, Germany’s interior minister, said in a statement on Monday that the current 'volatile situation' in Syria is the reason her country’s migration authority has paused asylum decisions, leaving thousands of Syrian applicants in limbo. Austria has gone a step further, announcing plans to deport Syrian migrants. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner told Austrian media he has 'instructed the ministry to prepare an orderly return and deportation program to Syria. In The Netherlands, the government said it would stop assessing applications for six months. However, many are concerned it may also begin deportations. Discussions about sending refugees back to Syria amid such uncertainty have left many Syrians anxious about their future. This is particularly concerning for those who have built lives and established roots in their host countries. Anti-refugee discourse has become increasingly common since the height of the European refugee crisis in 2015, when around 5.2 million people from conflict zones across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East arrived on European shores. For many governments in Europe, the fall of the Assad regime could offer just the opportunity they were waiting for to show they are addressing public concerns about migration by removing thousands of Syrians. But until Syria’s security situation stabilizes and its political future under its new de facto leadership becomes clearer, forced returns may be premature — or could even break international laws against refoulement should returnees come to harm. Indeed, with the country still divided among rival factions, extremist groups like Daesh still at large, infrastructure in ruins, an economy crippled by sanctions, and uncertainty over the political agenda of the victorious HTS, Syria is by no means guaranteed peace and security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpMBbxmj5gdmq	2024-12-10T16:37:42-08:00	
The Golden State Unleashes The Anonymous Snoop Dogs – OpEd	In their quest to 'Trump proof' California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Attorney General Rob Bonta invoke 'California values.' If people across the country wonder what exactly these values might be, state politicians have provided clues. As they gear up for the holiday season, California retailers stock items they think people will want to buy. California politicians want the state to determine what stores must offer to their customers. Assembly Bill 1084, signed by Newsom in 2021 and effective Jan. 1, 2024, mandates that large retail department stores that sell childcare items or toys must maintain a 'gender-neutral' section for these items or face fines. 'By requiring large retailers to maintain a gender-neutral section,' Bonta’s office explains, 'AB 1084 makes it more difficult for these retailers to engage in gender-based pricing discrimination and reduces the imposition of gender stereotypes on children.' In support of this cause, the attorney general recruits shoppers as informants. 'If you do not see an adequate gender-neutral product section in a large retail department store in California that you believe is covered by this law, you may take pictures, document, and file a complaint with our office at oag.ca.gov/report.' As Californians and people across the country should know, deploying citizens to inform on each other was a value of East Germany, a Stalinist dictatorship. Other similarities may also be apparent. California workers value their independence and many strive to be their own boss. Newsom doesn’t value that effort. In 2019, the governor signed Assembly Bill 5, by San Diego Democrat Lorena Gonzalez, a veritable declaration against workers’ independence and their ability to earn a living. The measure primarily targeted truck owner-operators and ride-share drivers, but in its original form, it was more far-reaching. Assembly Bill 5 targeted all kinds of independent contractors including freelance writers who did not provide more than 35 submissions per publication, per year. Musicians became de-facto employees of the venues where they played, effectively reducing their already meager pay. During the pandemic, a group of 151 prominent economists and political scientists from 40 universities and think tanks, called for the suspension of Assembly Bill 5 to permit independent medical contractors to fill key positions in understaffed hospitals and clinics. Newsom kept the measure in place so he must value what may be the most repressive legislation in California history. A prime mover of the measure was Julie Su, the Biden–Harris administration’s 'acting' labor secretary, and overseer of California’s $30 billion unemployment scandal during the pandemic. Strictly speaking, accountability is not a California value. On the other hand, Golden State politicians always support their pillage of people. California imposes one of the heaviest tax burdens of any state, and Californians are now fleeing in droves. When he was a member of the California Assembly, Rob Bonta promoted Assembly Bill 2088, the California Wealth Tax that would have slapped a 0.4 percent tax on the portion of a taxpayer’s net worth that exceeded $30 million. Assemblyman Bonta also wanted to keep taxing people for 10 years after they left California. The Yale law alum should know the state can’t do that. Government greed is a value for politicians but not for California’s working people. In 1978, when seniors were being taxed out of their homes, voters passed Proposition 13, the People’s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation. Californians also thought it was wrong to exclude people from state colleges on the basis of their race, so they passed the California Civil Rights Initiative, Proposition 209, on the November 1996 ballot. The measure banned racial and ethnic preferences in state education, employment, and contracting. California politicians have defied state law by establishing a vast DEI bureaucracy that serves no educational purpose but does help to bulk up the University of California’s $500 million budget deficit. Safe to say, California’s woke politburo does not value merit and fiscal responsibility. When Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta tout 'California values,' they mean high taxes, quashing workers’ independence, dictating what stores can sell, and transforming shoppers into informers for the state. Happy holidays everybody. This article was also published in The American Spectator	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpGtTB3uCJS-k	2024-12-10T16:36:20-08:00	
Syria After 13 Years Of US State Terrorism… What Do You Expect? –...	In less than 13 days, a coalition of U.S.-backed jihadist militant groups took over Syria. The offensive, which began on November 27, culminated in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad hastily stepping down and fleeing to Russia. Assad and his wife were confirmed to be in Moscow by December 9. Assad said he made his decision to preserve the peace in Syria. Russia said it was not involved in his decision-making. The gloating by American and European politicians reflects the years of investment by the Western powers for regime change in Syria. An investment that seems to have paid off, finally. It is misplaced to speculate that there may have been some kind of betrayal or 'deal' by Assad and his allies in Russia and Iran to let the country go. Yes, the Syrian army and authorities capitulated in breath-taking short order. But it is callow to conjecture about a more devious move behind the scenes, such as Russia or Iran leaving its Syrian ally to the mercy of insurgents. Syria was simply broken and exhausted by years of Western aggression and attrition. There was little that Russia or Iran could do to salvage an allied country. The final collapse of Syria did not come after a 13-day blitzkrieg. It came after 13 years of non-stop state terrorism by the United States and its European NATO allies. The earlier phase of U.S.-sponsored proxy terrorism (2011 to 2020) was checked by the intervention of Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah. But the West’s proxies weren’t defeated definitively. In retrospect, that may be seen as a fateful strategic blunder. The continuation of the proxy war after 2020 relied on the imposition of crippling economic and trade sanctions on Syria by the U.S. and the European Union. War by other means also involved the American and Turkish military forces illegally occupying Syrian territory in the north, east, and south, which enabled the theft of Syria’s oil and wheat exports. During Trump’s previous presidency, he openly bragged about 'stealing Syria’s oil.' So, from 2011, when the Obama administration targeted Syria for regime change, until the fall of Damascus at the weekend, the nation has endured a 13-year war of attrition. Even after the relative peace obtained due to Russia and Iran’s intervention from around 2020 onwards, Syrians have been starved of food, medicines and fuel. Over half its population suffered displacement from their homes. The Syrian economy was in ruins. Its currency had become worthless, adjusting for inflation by the hour. When the Western-backed insurgents launched their offensive on November 27 from the northern Idlib enclave, there was nothing left of the Syrian state to put up resistance. Aleppo, Hama, Homs and the capital fell like dominoes. The main insurgent faction is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led by Mohammed al-Jawlani. HTS is an internationally proscribed terrorist organization that even the U.S. officially designates as an outlawed group. Its leader has a bounty of $10 million on his head offered by the State Department. But in the shell game of U.S. proxy war, HTS and its leader are Washington’s assets. From 2011, the Americans and their NATO partners used Al Qaeda, ISIS, Jabhat al Nusra Front (later HTS) with ratlines of weapons and fighters from Libya, Turkey and all over the world to descend on Syria to inflict horrors. The Western media propagated the charade by cynically referring to the terrorist proxies as 'moderate rebels.' The Pentagon-run military base at Al Tanf in southern Syria is said to be for training 'moderate rebels' when, in reality, it is jihadist extremists who are weaponized. Only last week before the final push on the Syria capital, Damascus, Al-Jawlani, the HTS commander, was given a primetime interview/platform by CNN, the U.S. news channel, to rehabilitate his image as a statesman-like leader instead of being a wanted terrorist. Al-Jawlani says the days when he and his organization were associates of ISIS and Al Qaeda are long gone. And CNN and other Western media do their best to make the claim sound plausible. Ah, such a happy ending! It’s not clear at this early stage if Syria will now be plunged into sectarian bloodletting, reprisals, and murderous mayhem that characterized the earlier phase of U.S.-sponsored proxy war in Syria when Shia, Alawites, and Christians were beheaded for being 'apostates and infidels.' Ominously, the United States and Israel immediately started bombing the country, cynically claiming that they were trying to stabilize the situation. The rapid events in Syria have taken aback the whole world. Who would have thought only two weeks ago that Assad would end up exiled in Moscow? The reaction of the U.S., Israel and other Western leaders is almost disbelief in what they see as their great luck. Russia and Iran seem to have been genuinely blindsided. The NATO proxy war in Ukraine on Russia’s doorstep has no doubt taken a toll on Russian military resources. Iran is preoccupied with securing its own country from Israeli aggression. American President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke excitedly about the new 'opportunity' in Syria. Both claimed to have had a hand in the triumph of a terrorist insurgency. Netanyahu took credit for his genocidal war on Gaza and Lebanon for weakening Syria’s allies in Hezbollah and Iran. Biden was even more shameless in spelling out how U.S. state terrorism destroyed Syria and paved the way for its takeover by terrorist proxies. He said: 'Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East through a combination of support for our partners, sanctions, diplomacy [sic], and targeted military force.' In Washington’s double-speak, 'support for partners, sanctions and targeted military force' translates as sponsoring terrorists to traumatize a nation, economic warfare to grind it down, and illegal aggression to force final submission. The destruction of Syria is another vast crime by the U.S.-led imperialist West.

Canada Considers Financing For Polish Nuclear Power Plant	Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe announced it has received a letter of intent from Export Development Canada, for up to CAD2.02 billion (USD1.45 billion) to potentially support Poland's first nuclear power plant project. The letter of intent with Export Development Canada (EDC) - a Canadian Crown corporation - is in support of the sale of goods and services by Canadian suppliers. EDC support is subject to the successful completion of its detailed due diligence process and credit approval. Westinghouse - jointly owned by Canadian firms Brookfield and Cameco - welcomed the signing of the letter of intent, which it said it helped facilitate. 'Not only does this financing agreement underscore the important role Canada will play in helping Europe secure and diversify its energy future, but it will also help prepare the nation's nuclear supply chain to support the next AP1000 plant in North America,' said Westinghouse Energy Systems President Dan Lipman. 'We appreciate the close cooperation of the EDC in helping Westinghouse make AP1000 projects a reality for its customers while bringing home economic benefits to Canada.' Westinghouse said the announcement demonstrates its 'deep commitment to Canada's economy by securing work for Canadian firms and trade unions supporting Westinghouse's global fleet of advanced reactors'. For each AP1000 unit that is built outside of Canada, Westinghouse says it could generate almost CAD1 billion in gross domestic product through local suppliers. Last month, the US International Development Finance Corporation - the USA's development bank - signed a letter of interest with Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe (PEJ) to provide more than USD980 million in financing for Poland's first nuclear power plant. A similar declaration, for the equivalent of about PLN70 billion (USD17.3 billion), was made earlier by the US Export-Import Bank. Westinghouse and Bechtel jointly form a consortium that implements the PEJ investment project in Pomerania. 'We are pleased to see strong interest in our investment project from leading players in the global financial market, with whom we are in constant contact. The letter of intent from Export Development Canada is another confirmation of this fact, and at the same time our next step towards implementation of the strategy for obtaining financing for the entire project,' said PEJ Vice President Piotr Piela. PEJ said: 'Cooperation with export credit agencies is an important part of the strategy for securing financing for the nuclear power plant in Pomerania – it involves continuing discussions with, among others, entities from countries with extensive nuclear supply chains, in order to maximise and optimise financing opportunities for this key investment project for Poland.' In November 2022, the then Polish government selected the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor technology for construction at the Lubiatowo-Kopalino site in the Choczewo municipality in Pomerania in northern Poland. An agreement setting a plan for the delivery of the plant was signed in May last year by Westinghouse, Bechtel and PEJ - a special-purpose vehicle 100% owned by Poland's State Treasury. The Ministry of Climate and Environment in July issued a decision-in-principle for PEJ to construct the plant. The aim is for Poland's first AP1000 reactor to enter commercial operation in 2033. Under an engineering services signed in September last year, in cooperation with PEJ, Westinghouse and Bechtel will finalise a site-specific design for a plant featuring three AP1000 reactors. The design/engineering documentation includes the main components of the power plant: the nuclear island, the turbine island and the associated installations and auxiliary equipment, as well as administrative buildings and infrastructure related to the safety of the facility. The contract also involves supporting the investment process and bringing it in line with current legal regulations in cooperation with the National Atomic Energy Agency and the Office of Technical Inspection. In September, the Polish government announced its intention to allocate PLN60 billion to fund the country's first nuclear power plant.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpHu8trs9uD2V	2024-12-10T16:26:16-08:00	
Brazil: Lula’s Brain Functions Not Affected By Bleeding, Doctor S...	By Pedro Peduzzi The brain bleed detected in President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has not compromised any of his cerebral functions. The medical team, led by Dr. Roberto Kalil, expects President Lula to resume his activities next week. As a precaution, he should remain in intensive care at the Sírio-Libanês Hospital in São Paulo for 48 hours. The procedure undergone by the president includes a small perforation in the skull, between two meningeal blades, followed by the insertion of a drain to remove the accumulated blood, the doctors explained. Dr. Roberto Kalil also pointed out that the holes made in the skull are small and should heal spontaneously, with no need for future intervention. President Lula is lucid and awake, accompanied only by First Lady Janja da Silva. The procedure is known as trepanation. Dr. Kalil reported the patient reacted well to the procedure and is now eating and communicating well. No complications 'The president will have no sequelae and there is no risk of complications, because the bruise was located between the skull bone and the brain. There is no damage to his brain. This procedure aims to prevent the bruise from compressing the brain. The bruise, located between two meningeal layers, has been completely drained. The most important thing is that there was no trauma to his brain,' the doctor said during a press conference at the Sírio-Libanês Hospital. According to the medical team, the president had a flu-like illness in the early hours of the morning, followed by a headache. He was sent to hospital in Brasília. 'Since he fell, we immediately carried out all the tests [CT and MRI scans],' Dr. Kalil said. President Lula was then sent to intensive care at the same hospital in São Paulo.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpMgPXZujybuV	2024-12-10T16:21:50-08:00	
Ralph Nader: The ‘Silent Violence’ Of Corporate Greed And Power –...	For decades consumer groups have been sounding clarion calls for action against the 'silent violence' causing massive casualties that arise from the unbridled power of corporate greed, criminal negligence or indifference. They cite statistical and case studies that the media and lawmakers mostly ignored or relegated to low levels of enforcement. Corporate bosses just have their corporate lawyers and public relations hacks brush away such warnings and pleas. One day stories they knew would not have legs if they just kept quiet or mumbled some general words of regret, promising some vague improvements to their products and services. But year after year, the deadly toll goes up, not down, and the horrors continue. For example, at least 5000 people A WEEK die in hospitals in the U.S. due to 'preventable problems,' concluded a peer-reviewed study by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine physicians in 2016. This is just one of numerous such studies of hospital-induced infections, overuse of antibiotics, medical malpractice or what is called 'medical error,' prescribing bundles of drugs that backfire, 'accidents,' deskilling and understaffing. There has been no mass mobilization by either government officials or industry executives to address this staggering toll of at least 250,000 fatalities a year! Behind these figures are real people with families, friends and coworkers shocked, incensed or despondent over avoidable losses of life and preventable harms. Some of them undoubtedly knew the specific causes and demanded correction and compensation, to no avail. Avoidable casualties also arise from the sweeping denial of insurance coverage for ill or injured patients by greedy unregulated or underregulated health insurance companies maximizing profits and bonuses for CEOs. Many insurance companies are now using AI to help wear down consumers. About two thousand Americans a week lose their lives because they cannot afford health insurance to cover prompt diagnosis and treatment costs. System-driven patterns of denial of benefits by health insurers also cause deaths and injuries. The companies have algorithms that automatically delay or deny needed procedures without even seeing a patient’s medical records or speaking with the patient’s physician. Insurance policies are full of fine print deductibles, co-pays, waivers and exclusions that drive consumers and their doctors up the wall. Insurance premiums are paid by patients or employers ahead of time with advertised assurances. In the past two months, consumers have been overwhelmed by a blizzard of television ads by giant insurers e.g., Aetna, Cigna, and Humana for their Medicare (dis)Advantage plans aimed at elderly beneficiaries. The ads are loaded with 'freebies' that paint the companies as charities instead of cunning commercial marketers. In reality, denial of benefits is higher for these plans than for traditional Medicare. Moreover, these plans push patients into narrow networks of physicians and hospitals and subject them to dreadful over-use of 'prior authorization.' The latter means some remote company doctor or medical professional decides whether a physician with a patient can be reimbursed for a specific treatment. This results in overwhelming paperwork for the doctors, immense profits for the companies and degraded treatment for patients. An October 31, 2023 NBC investigation titled '‘Deny, deny, deny’: By rejecting claims, Medicare Advantage plans threaten rural hospitals and patients,' by star reporter Gretchen Morgenson exposed another deadly impact of Medicare (dis)Advantage programs on rural hospitals in America. These companies are so entrenched that they have become largely immune to exposés. They have gamed the system to straitjacket both patients and healthcare workers. The healthcare industry gets away with about $360 billion in computerized billing fraud and abuses every year. ( Prosecutions are minimal, and lawmakers are mostly indifferent as they count their campaign cash donations. Did you see any of the major party politicians in this year’s election campaigns even mention the devastating impact of the medical industry’s greed on innocent people or the taxpayers? Just under the surface is a seething whirlpool of resentment, anger, frustration and bitterness about corporate abuses. Such reactions are often most pronounced in poor areas or workplaces, where people are subjected to choking pollution or exposure to carcinogenic toxins leading to cancer, heart disease and other organ ailments. The corporate perpetrators, however, are remote from the impacts of their operations and policies. Their hugely overpaid bosses rule from elaborate suites and enjoy unimaginable luxuries. Very few people know the names, even of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies like ExxonMobil, Aetna, Humana, Duke Energy, Bank of America, and so on. The lethality, the theft, the domination, and the escape from the rule of law are rendered impersonally by the corporatists who are now investing huge sums to go even more abstract and remote with tyrannical generative AI algorithms. This week, a man, still on the run, made his anger very personal. Around 7:00 AM he singled out, in front of a busy midtown Manhattan hotel, the chief executive of the giant UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, and shot him. The assassin fled on an electric bike. Police collected the bullet casings from his pistol. On these casings were the words, 'deny,' 'delay' and 'depose.' As news of this fatal shooting spread over social media, a torrent of angry or morbid comments flooded the Internet. The New York Times reported a few, to wit: 'I’m an ER nurse and the things I’ve seen dying patients get denied for by insurance makes me physically sick. I just can’t feel sympathy for him because of all of those patients and their families.' 'Thoughts and deductibles to the family,' read one observer underneath a video of a CNN picture. 'Unfortunately, my condolences are out of network.' Tragically, Mr. Thompson, according to a company employee, was one of the few executives who spoke of changing the culture of the company. But corporate culture, marinated to the core with endless cravings for ever-growing easy profits, is very hard to change – especially when it is so easy to extract more and more premium dollars from powerless consumers who lack adequate regulatory protections. And so, the social media explosion included this typical comment on TikTok: 'I pay $1,300 a month for health insurance with an $8,000 deductible. ($23,000 yearly) When I finally reached that deductible, they denied my claims. He was making a million dollars a month.' The New York Times described a 'wrenching outpouring from patients and family members who posted horror stories of insurance claim reimbursement stagnation and denials.' The ugly reality will continue to exponentially pour out with volcanic fury as the media receives more public reactions. One wonders about the reaction if this were to have happened four months before the November election. Could the uproar have transformed the slimy rhythms of the Harris campaign, orchestrated by the Democrats’ corporate-conflicted political consultants who manage the candidate messages and who definitely don’t listen to the warnings and popular proposals by Senator Bernie Sanders?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpDAvgYX1QWNu	2024-12-10T16:15:23-08:00	
China ‘Made Wrong Bet’ On Assad Regime In Syria – Analysis	By Kitty Wang The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria on Dec. 8 will likely hamper Beijing’s diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and prompt a reevaluation of its support for Iran and Russia in the region, experts told Radio Free Asia in recent interviews. Back in September 2023, President Xi Jinping rolled out the red carpet for former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma, who made a six-day visit to the country amid great fanfare in the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s state media. The Assads were Xi’s guests at the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, which was hailed by the Global Times newspaper as an opportunity to strengthen trade and economic ties with the isolated regime. China was only the sixth country visited by Assad since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, and Beijing saw opportunities for Chinese companies in post-war economic reconstruction as part of Xi’s Belt and Road supply chain and global infrastructure program. China’s top envoy Wang Yi has pledged to play a key role in bringing peace to troubled global 'hotspots,' and has repeatedly sent diplomats to the Middle East in recent years. Beijing has also called for an end to the 'collective punishment' of Palestinian civilians by Israel. Beijing likely reevaluating Chinese diplomats brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year, but has yet to succeed in helping to facilitate the emergence of a unity government, despite repeated rounds of diplomatic efforts, Reuters reported. Its support for Assad, however, was largely based on its view of the Syrian resistance as being instigated by the United States and its allies, and its alignment with Iran and Russia, something that Beijing may now be reevaluating, analysts said. 'Beijing wants to expand its influence in the Middle East, and Syria was an important foothold for it to do that,' U.S.-based current affairs commentator Heng He told RFA Mandarin in a recent interview. 'This is at the very least a huge setback for the Chinese Communist Party’s desire to boost its influence ... by winning allies or supporting certain forces in the Middle East,' he said. But as Assad and his family arrive in Moscow, where they will reportedly be granted political asylum, China’s bet doesn’t appear to have paid off, according to Hudson Institute researcher Zineb Riboua. 'I think China is realizing that the costs of its of its alignment with Iran and Russia in the Middle East are high because they really relied on Iran to to expand their influence,' Riboua said. 'It is by being Iran’s closest friend that China was able to broker a deal, a normalization deal, with Saudi Arabia.' 'It is really by being close to Iran that China was able to say to everyone that it can handle the Yemen question. This is why they try to do some mediation and diplomatic missions in Yemen,' she said. 'But it seems that now that Assad fell, that all that everything that Iran has tried to achieve in terms of influence and also in terms of nourishing its proxies across the Middle East is vanishing.' She said she expects Beijing to distance itself from Tehran in the future, and adjust its Middle East strategy to reflect Turkey’s status as 'a real regional power.' China seeks to build ties with anti-Western authoritarian and totalitarian regimes including Iran and the Assad regime in Syria, Riboua said. 'I would say that China made the wrong bet, and it’s going to pay a certain price for it,' she said. Beijing has said it remains open-minded about recognition for a future Syrian government. 'The future and destiny of Syria should be decided by the Syrian people,' foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told journalist on Dec. 9. 'We hope that all parties concerned will find a political solution to restore stability and order as soon as possible.' Social media takes Meanwhile, social media comments about the issue focused on expectations of Israel’s further expansion into Syria and satirical comments about the failure of China’s foreign policy experts to predict the fall of Assad. 'Hehe, the freedom of the Syrian people is over, for the next few decades at least,' commented @qinyuehanguan1900 from Chongqing. 'Israel is far worse than any terrorist.' 'We hereby announce to the world that, from now on, Jerusalem will be our southern capital, Damascus the capital and Tel Aviv our temporary residence,' @pingwaqingsheng from Beijing quoted an imaginary Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu as saying. 'Do you all think this is over?' commented @tianyahuiguke from Beijing. 'It’s only just getting started.' Comments also took aim at Li Shaoxian, dean of the China-Arab States Research Institute at Ningxia University, who said in a Dec. 4 interview with Phoenix TV that it was highly unlikely that anti-government forces would succeed in overthrowing the government. 'How embarrassing!' said one comment on the story. 'I could be an expert like him,' scoffed another. Heng said China’s international relations experts are typically hampered by their need to repeat the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s official line on everything, rather than taking a coldly analytical view of international developments. 'Some experts ... basically go along with the Chinese Communist Party line when commenting, rather than analyzing and judging based on the international situation,' he said, adding that many commentators are wary of being accused of bad-mouthing Beijing’s allies. 'These misjudgments are political, based on their political position,' Heng said. While news coverage of the unfolding situation in Syria was widely available on Chinese social media on Tuesday, not everyone is being allowed to post anything they like about the situation in the Middle East, according to current affairs commentator Ji Feng, who has a background in the pro-democracy movement. 'I [tried to] make a few posts about Assad today on WeChat,' Ji told RFA Mandarin. 'Others can post about it, but I can’t.' He said plenty of people in his circle have opinions about the situation in Syria, which he saw as a displacement of their dissatisfaction with their own government, sentiments that are banned under strict online censorship. 'The Assad issue is definitely an outlet for a lot of people,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpG6xRNJzdXYn	2024-12-10T16:09:09-08:00	
Child Soldiers’ Numbers Swelling In Eastern DRC	Constance was 13 years old when she left her home in North Kivu province in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to join a militia called the Alliance of Patriots for a Free and Sovereign Congo. Child soldiers are known as kadogos, which means 'little ones' in Swahili. Despite her small stature, she carried rocket-propelled grenades and supported fighters on the battlefront against M23 rebels. 'I went to war,' she told The Guardian from a displacement camp near the provincial capital, Goma. 'It was a nightmare.' Experts say the recruitment of children has surged since the Rwanda-backed M23 rebellion resurfaced in 2022. In the case of Constance, who requested the use of a pseudonym, poverty drove her to this path. But countless other children have been abducted by or coerced into the militias on both sides of the fighting. 'The militias, collectively known as Wazalendo (‘patriots’ in Swahili), are being used because of poor motivation and dysfunction within the ranks of DRC’s army, which has seen dozens of Soldiers and officers prosecuted for deserting the battlefield,' South Africa-based journalist Patricia Huon wrote in The New Humanitarian magazine in August. 'Yet the Wazalendo groups, some of which have previously fought each other, are committing serious human rights abuses and bringing large numbers of child soldiers to the frontlines, thwarting long-running efforts to prevent their recruitment.' Marie Soudnie Rivette, DRC director of the international charity War Child, said it is impossible to estimate how many children are caught up in the fighting, but she believes the actual number is much higher than is reported. 'It’s clearly rising,' she told The Guardian for a November 11 article. 'Children are cannon fodder today.' Most of the 14 children The Guardian interviewed in a displacement camp in Goma had recently escaped armed groups. Most said the only way to leave is to desert, and some said they were shot at as they fled. Onesphore Sematumba, an analyst in the DRC with the Crisis Group, said militias that forcibly enlist minors into their ranks often have hazy ideas about what a child is. 'They determine it by size or the ability to carry heavy weights,' he told The Guardian. A United Nations panel of experts detailed the extent of child recruitment in a July report, stating that 'all armed actors recruited and used children in hostilities on an unprecedented scale.' The experts wrote that the M23 'systematically' abducted children as young as 10 'in rural areas while working in the fields, individually or in large groups, as confirmed by several ex-M23 combatants who were recruited in such circumstances.' M23 also targeted children among other Congolese for recruitment from refugee camps in Rwanda and Uganda. At one M23 training camp, at least 20% of the estimated 1,000 recruits were children. 'Those who did not consent were taken forcefully,' the report stated. 'Recruits who attempted to escape faced execution.' Recruits who were 15 and above were trained for combat, including at some sites in Rwanda, before being deployed to the front lines to fight. They also were subjected to heavy labor, including digging tunnels and trenches. 'The youngest children, usually under 15 years old, did not receive full tactical training but carried out chores and acted as escorts or servants to commanders until they became ‘ripe’ for combat duty,' the report said. A number of sources told the U.N. experts that nearly all of the Wazalendo militias utilize children, and the sight of armed children has been widely reported around Goma, at or near military positions and camps for internally displaced people. 'One of the biggest concerns around the Wazalendo is their massive use of child soldiers, which has set back efforts to prevent their recruitment by many years,' Huon wrote.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpG9_Fm5zcskI	2024-12-10T16:05:53-08:00	
Macron To Head To Warsaw To Brief Tusk, Duda On US-Ukraine Talks	By Théo Bourgery-Gonse (EurActiv) -- French President Emmanuel Macron is expected in Warsaw on Thursday (12 December) to debrief on conversations he has had with US President-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the weekend, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced. The visit comes as a set of European leaders, including France, Poland, Germany and Italy, as well as the UK, look to act together as one in the face of a second Trump presidency and ensure unwavering support for Ukraine. Macron, who will be meeting Tusk and Polish President Andrzej Duda, is expected to share insights on the diplomatic exchange he had with Trump and Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Notre Dame reopening ceremony on Saturday (7 December). Trump has always been a fierce NATO critic, and claimed to be able to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 'in 24 hours,' without elaborating on his strategy. The President-elect’s recently-nominated Ukraine-Russia envoy, Keith Kellogg, who was not in Paris, vowed to enter 'tough negotiations' with both parties to agree a ceasefire. Kiyv-Moscow peace negotiations could start as early as this winter, Tusk said on Tuesday (10 December). Both the French president and the Polish prime minister agreed to the trip at the European Political Community summit in Budapest in early November, Gazeta Wyborcza, which first broke the news of Macron’s visit, reports. Macron's last official visit in Poland was in February 2020. Poland is becoming an ever-more powerful European member state, as Weimar Triangle allies France and Germany are embroiled in an unprecedented political crisis and a tense run-in to federal elections, respectively. Poland's defence spending is over 4% of GDP, making it an audible interlocutor to the Trump administration – and both men know each other from the time Tusk was President of the European Council and Trump held office for a first term. Paris also has its eyes set on Warsaw as a key ally in its fight against a EU-Mercosur trade deal, as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced last week a technical deal had been struck. Poland, along with France, said it would not vote to approve the deal as is. The trip risks delaying the nomination of a new French prime minister, after the government collapse over a no-confidence vote. Contacted by Euractiv, the Elysée had not confirmed Macron’s trip by the time of publication.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpA_iMPSw8ApS	2024-12-10T16:03:32-08:00	
US Blacklists North Macedonia Ex-Deputy PM For Bribery, Corruptio...	By Sinisa Jakov Marusic The US State Department on Monday said it was adding Artan Grubi and Enver Behxheti to its blacklist 'for their involvement in significant corruption by accepting bribes to undermine judicial processes tied to the criminal conviction of Saso Mijalkov', the former head of North Macedonia’s secret police. Mijalkov, who faced trial in several big court cases over the past years but is now free, was put on the US blacklist in 2022, also for involvement in significant corruption. Members of Grubi’s immediate family have also been blacklisted, the US State Department said. Grubi, a top official of the main ethnic Albanian opposition party, the Democratic Union for Integration, DUI, has been one of the most prominent politicians in North Macedonia over the past decade. On social media on Tuesday, Grubi said he found out about his blacklisting from the media. 'As someone who dedicated his public life to the protection of Western democratic values, and who always worked hard for the country’s membership of NATO and the EU, this decision concerns me personally,' Grubi wrote. He added that 'transparency and dedication to democratic values will remain a main pillar of all of my actions'. A close associate of the long-standing DUI leader, Ali Ahmeti, and the party’s main mouthpiece, Grubi was First Deputy PM in the previous government led by the Social Democrats from 2020 until elections earlier this year, when the government lost power. During that time, he was also Minister for the Political System and for Relations Between [ethnic] Communities. On Tuesday, the DUI said it would respect the US decision. 'As a party, we remain focused on strategic cooperation with the US and on strengthening democratic values and transparency,' it stated. Links to biggest court case in years In the biggest court case in North Macedonia’s recent history, the Criminal Court in Skopje in February 2021 sentenced Mijalkov to 12 years in prison for 'criminal association', 'illegal wiretapping' and 'destruction of wiretapping equipment'. The case, codenamed 'Target–Fortress', found him guilty of masterminding the illegal wiretapping of thousands of people between 2008 and 2015 under the authoritarian regime of his cousin, former PM Nikola Gruevski, who, after losing power in 2017, fled to Hungary. Gruevski is also on the US blacklist. However, the first-instance verdict was appealed successfully, forcing a retrial. In January 2023, the Judicial Council, the judiciary’s top body, determined that Appeals Court Judge Enver Behxheti, the judge in the 'Target–Fortress' case, had effectively kept the case in a drawer for nine months 'without any justification', rendering it expired. Behxheti was fined with a reduction of his salary. In October, 2023, the Criminal Court in Skopje duly discontinued charges in the illegal wiretapping case, citing the statute of limitations, effectively ending the retrial of Mijalkov and co-defendants. In July 2022, in a separate case, codenamed 'Empire', Mijalkov received a three-year prison sentence and assets worth some 30 million euros were confiscated after admitting guilt and striking a plea deal with the court. He was charged with criminal association and unlawful acquisition and concealment of property. But instead of serving his jail sentence in the main Idrizovo prison near Skopje, he served it at an open prison in the town of Struga, after changing his residential address from Skopje to Ohrid, which is near Struga. In May this year, he was granted early release for good conduct. The number of prominent figures from North Macedonia blacklisted by the US has increased in recent years to include prominent politicians, business people as well judicial officials. In March, the former chief of North Macedonia’s now defuncts Special Prosecution, Katica Janeva, was added to the list.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpI_Q45W_AtSU	2024-12-10T16:00:31-08:00	
Syrian Rebels Who Overthrew Assad Name Interim Government Leader	The Syrian rebels who overthrew longtime iron-fisted ruler Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday appointed a transitional head of government to run the country until March 1. After a cabinet meeting in Damascus of rebel leaders and ousted officials from Assad’s government, Mohammed al-Bashir, a figure little known across most of Syria who previously ran an administration in a small pocket of the northwest controlled by rebels, said he was picked to lead the interim government. 'The meeting was under the headline of transferring the files and institutions to caretake the government,' Bashir said. He stood in front of two flags: the green, black and white flag flown by opponents of Assad throughout the civil war, and a white flag with the Islamic oath of faith in black writing, typically flown in Syria by Sunni Islamist fighters. There was some sense of normalcy returning to the Syrian capital, with a notable decrease in the number of armed people on the streets. Sources close to the rebels said commanders had ordered fighters to withdraw from cities and for police and internal security forces affiliated with the main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, to deploy instead. Banks and shops reopened for the first time since Assad's overthrow on Sunday and his flight to asylum in Russia. Traffic returned to the roads, construction workers were back fixing a roundabout in the Damascus city center and street cleaners swept roadways. The signs of Middle East conflict remained, however. Israel launched airstrikes against Syrian army bases, whose forces had melted away in the face of the lightning rebel advance that ousted Assad over a two-week period. Israel sent forces across the border into a demilitarized zone inside Syria, saying its airstrikes were aimed at keeping weapons from falling into hostile hands. It denied reports that its forces had advanced beyond the buffer zone into the countryside southwest of Damascus. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the Islamist leader who headed the offensive that forced Assad out, vowed to pursue former senior government officials responsible for torture and war crimes. 'Rewards will be offered to those who will provide information about senior army and security officers involved in war crimes,' Golani said in a statement. The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham he leads is rooted in Syria's al-Qaida branch and is designated by many Western governments as a terrorist organization, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric. Geir Pedersen, the United Nations envoy for Syria, said in Geneva that the groups that forced Assad to flee must transform their 'good messages' into actions on the ground. 'They have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness,' Pedersen said, adding that in Aleppo and Hama, 'we have also seen ... reassuring things on the ground.' But 'what we need not to see is of course that the good statements and what we are seeing on the ground at the beginning, that this is not followed up in practice in the days and the weeks ahead of us.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, 'The United States reaffirms its full support for a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition. This transition process should lead to credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance that meets international standards of transparency and accountability.' 'The Syrian people will decide the future of Syria,' the top U.S. diplomat said. 'All nations should pledge to support an inclusive and transparent process and refrain from external interference.' A German government statement late Monday said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the end of the Assad regime, and said they are 'prepared to work together with the new rulers on the basis of fundamental human rights and the protection of ethnic and religious minorities.' Scholz and Macron emphasized the importance of maintaining Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the statement said. The United Nations has expressed concerns about Israel’s deployment of troops across a demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights, which Israel says is necessary to protect its own security. U.N. envoy Pederson said Tuesday that the world body is continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. 'This needs to stop,' Pederson said. Israeli troops were on the Syrian side of the buffer zone Tuesday, about 25 kilometers southwest of Damascus, according to several security sources cited by Reuters and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Avichay Adraee said reports that Israeli forces were approaching Damascus were incorrect. He said Israeli troops were located inside the buffer zone and at defensive points close to the border. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday that Israeli forces had struck suspected chemical weapons sites as well as long-range rockets as part of an effort to prevent them from ending up in the possession of hostile actors. Saudi Arabia condemned Israel’s actions in Syria, saying in a statement Tuesday that they violate international law and 'sabotage Syria’s chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpKDlCik7Jqnc	2024-12-10T15:56:40-08:00	
Starmer Must View Saudi Ties As Personal, Not Just Business – OpE...	By Chris Doyle British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to Saudi Arabia should herald a step forward in the trading and business relationship between the two countries. Even historic relationships need renewal and updating. Fresh commercial ties will be welcomed by both governments, which will no doubt look to build on them. Bilateral trade has reached record levels, topping £17.3 billion ($22 billion). The UK’s Labour government has a tough economic horizon. Even though the British economy is still strong, the sixth-largest in the world, like others it is struggling. Yet, even post-Brexit, it has much going for it and the country remains attractive for foreign direct investment. But Starmer and Rachel Reeves, his chancellor of the exchequer — what we in Britain call our finance minister — have staked their political futures on growth because, given the tight finances, growing the economy will be the only way the government will be able to escape the tight constraints it has imposed on itself. It is why the UK is keen to close a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council. Boosting economic ties with the Arab world’s largest economy will be appealing. The two governments have agreed a target of boosting bilateral trade to £30 billion by 2030, a significant but achievable challenge. This is why Starmer, who was elected in July, made this visit so early in his tenure. His government needs some positive outcomes. It has not found its first five months in power easy. The UK is continuing a year-long drive to boost trade that started in the spring, with a special focus on the sectors essential to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. One aspect is the British attempt to engage Saudi business in artificial intelligence. For example, Northumbria University and King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia are working together on how to deploy AI to help make the construction industry greener. Both countries need to reduce the impact of this sector on the environment. Saudi Arabia’s direct investment in the UK since 2017 stands at about $21 billion. Already, the Kingdom’s investments in the northeast of England have been heralded as a major boost to the economy in an area long seen as deprived. This was announced close to the end of the last British government during the two-day UK-Saudi summit in May. The £3 billion Saudi Arabian investment should create about 2,000 jobs. This is centered on Newcastle, a city whose football club is now owned by the Public Investment Fund. The city is being billed as the 'the gateway to Saudi.' There are also Saudi Arabian investments in chemical plants in the northeast. Other major Saudi investments in the UK include a 40 percent stake in the famous central London department store Selfridges. The UK has some strong, secure brands that states like Saudi Arabia like to invest in. Starmer will be hoping to encourage further Saudi investment in both the renewable and nuclear energy sectors in the UK. But the UK is also the second-largest foreign investor in Saudi Arabia. It has £16 billion in share investment. Some 52 UK companies have set up regional headquarters in Riyadh alone. Many companies will be attracted by a host of sectors in Saudi Arabia, not least energy, the environment and tourism. Could this relationship flourish? Yes, but, as with any relationship, it needs nurturing and requires genuine input. Mutual respect is vital. Starmer will have to listen to his hosts’ concerns as well as their ambitions. He would do well to explore the changes in Saudi Arabia and consider that it is no longer a case of UK-Saudi relations being restricted to oil and defense interests, with a much wider array of opportunities. He should look at how women have become a greater part of the workforce, how the country is opening up and how tourism and cultural projects have boomed. In the education sector, five British independent schools have established branches in Saudi Arabia. The University of Strathclyde is set to become the first British higher education institution to have a presence in the Kingdom. Yet perhaps one of the most telling features is the fact that there are more than 14,000 Saudi students studying at UK universities. If Starmer truly wishes to boost the trading part of the UK-Saudi relationship, then he and his colleagues have to establish closer personal ties. It is something that British businesspeople over the years have had to learn: that long-term ties built on personal dynamics make progress. The prime minister will have to cast aside the domestic carping that he has been traveling too much since taking office. This matters if he wishes to promote UK business interests. Starmer has not had great exposure to the Arab world, so any visit like this will be a huge learning curve. British politicians and others can come across as distant in contrast to their Arab counterparts. If they are to flourish in this market, Starmer and his team must see things through a long-term lens and as a relationship that is personal, not just commercial.

US Loans Ukraine $20 Billion Before Biden’s Departure	(RFE/RL) -- The United States on December 10 said it has loaned Ukraine $20 billion backed by the interest earned on frozen Russian assets, part of a $50 billion G7 support package agreed to this summer. The Biden administration had promised to distribute the loan before the end of the year amid concern over whether President-elect Donald Trump would continue U.S. support for Ukraine. Trump, who enters office on January 20, has repeatedly criticized the amount of U.S. aid to Ukraine but also said he would support a lend-lease program. Ukraine is heavily dependent on U.S. and European military and financial aid as it seeks to stop Russia's invasion, now in its third year. The $61 billion U.S. aid package for Ukraine passed in April -- the fifth since the war started in February 2022 -- but will likely run out by early next year. That means the $50 billion G7 loan is crucial to ensuring Ukraine has enough funds and weapons to defend itself through the first part of 2025 should Trump halt further support. 'These funds -- paid for by the windfall proceeds earned from Russia's own immobilized assets -- will provide Ukraine a critical infusion of support as it defends its country against an unprovoked war of aggression,' U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a December 10 statement. The G7's loans 'will help ensure Ukraine has the resources it needs to sustain emergency services, hospitals, and other foundations of its brave resistance,' Yellen said, adding that Washington's support would help Kyiv 'defend its sovereignty and achieve a just peace.' The loan announcement follows many months of talks between the United States and its allies -- including the European Union -- about the best way to use frozen Russian assets, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to help Ukraine without breaking international law. The treasury said Washington had transferred $20 billion to a World Bank fund, which will make the money available to Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpFhdwK0ORpRD	2024-12-10T15:47:36-08:00	
The Fall Of Bashar Al-Assad In Syria And Implications For Interna...	The fall of Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s authoritarian leader since 2000, would represent a pivotal moment for both the Middle East and international security. As a centre of geopolitical rivalry, ousting Assad could trigger widespread instability, intensify terrorism, and challenge the international community's ability to manage post-conflict governance and reconstruction. The intricacies of Syria’s sectarian landscape, compounded by conflicting foreign interests, highlight the significance of such a transition. This essay argues that while Assad’s removal could end decades of oppressive rule, it is likely to result in severe regional fragmentation, increased global insecurity, and widespread humanitarian and economic challenges that will require robust international cooperation to mitigate cascading consequences. Assad's fall could create a power vacuum that destabilises the already fragile Middle East. Without his central authority, Syria risks splitting along sectarian lines, with Sunni opposition groups, Kurdish factions, and Alawite loyalists competing for control. Historical precedents in Libya and Iraq show that such power vacuums often lead to prolonged chaos rather than stability. In this scenario, regional actors like Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia may seek to expand their influence through proxies. Iran's loss of a key ally in Assad would likely provoke more aggressive efforts to maintain its presence in the region, further escalating tensions with Israel and the Gulf states. Similarly, Turkey, concerned about Kurdish autonomy, might increase military actions in northern Syria, heightening conflict dynamics and straining relations with NATO allies.The security ramifications of Assad’s fall extend well beyond Syria’s borders. Extremist groups like ISIS, although weakened in recent years, could take advantage of the ensuing instability to regain influence. Uncontrolled territories in post-Assad Syria would likely become breeding grounds for jihadist networks, allowing them to regroup, coordinate, and plan transnational attacks. Furthermore, the dispersal of foreign fighters who once operated in Syria poses a significant threat to global security, as they may return to their home countries with enhanced combat experience and radicalised beliefs. The international community's past failures to effectively address similar risks, such as after the collapse of ISIS's territorial caliphate, highlight the challenges of combating terrorism in post-conflict environments. The humanitarian impact of Assad’s departure would be immense. Syria’s civil war has already displaced over 14 million people, and millions more may flee in the wake of renewed violence. This refugee crisis would strain neighbouring countries like Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey while reigniting political tensions in Europe over immigration. Internally, the lack of cohesive governance would impede the delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services, worsening the plight of civilians in conflict zones. Syria’s deteriorating infrastructure, combined with ongoing international sanctions, would further complicate efforts to rebuild the country and stabilize its economy.Geopolitically, the fall of Assad would alter the roles of global powers in the Middle East. For Russia, Syria has been central to its regional strategy, with Assad’s government providing Moscow access to naval and air bases. His removal would diminish Russia’s influence, forcing a recalibration of its foreign policy and risking confrontations with the United States over Syria's future. Meanwhile, China, although less militarily involved, might see an opportunity to exert influence through post-conflict reconstruction initiatives, aligning with its broader Belt and Road Initiative goals. The United States, having supported opposition factions but avoided full-scale intervention, would face pressure to spearhead stabilization efforts, necessitating a balance between counterterrorism priorities and limiting Iranian and Russian influence in the region.The economic repercussions of Assad’s fall would resonate globally. Syria’s destabilization could disrupt trade routes and energy supplies in the region, potentially driving up oil prices and impacting global markets. Reconstructing Syria—estimated to cost over $250 billion—would demand significant international investment; however, the absence of a credible and unified governing body would likely deter potential donors. The burden of reconstruction would probably fall disproportionately on Western countries and international organizations, leading to contentious debates over resource allocation and burden-sharing. On a normative level, Assad’s ousting would reignite discussions surrounding sovereignty, intervention, and justice. The international community's failure to prevent atrocities in Syria, including chemical weapon attacks, has eroded trust in global institutions such as the United Nations. Post-Assad Syria would represent a critical test for international law, as calls for accountability over war crimes and human rights abuses grow louder. However, the pursuit of justice—while maintaining stability—poses a dilemma, as prioritizing one can undermine the other. The lessons learned—or overlooked—in Syria will shape future interventions in similar conflicts.To effectively tackle these multifaceted challenges, the international community must adopt a coordinated, forward-looking approach. This includes establishing an inclusive transitional government, prioritizing humanitarian aid, and integrating counterterrorism strategies into long-term reconstruction plans. A comprehensive framework backed by major powers and regional stakeholders is essential to prevent Syria from descending into a failed state. Efforts to rebuild Syria’s institutions must strike a balance between accountability for past atrocities and pragmatic measures to ensure stability and reconciliation. In conclusion, the fall of Bashar al-Assad would represent a turning point for Syria and the broader Middle East, offering both opportunities and threats. While removing a repressive regime may inspire hope for a more democratic future, the immediate aftermath would likely be marked by instability, humanitarian crises, and increased global security risks. Successfully managing this transition requires unprecedented international cooperation, balancing geopolitical interests with the urgent need to alleviate human suffering. As the world reflects on the lessons of Syria, the question remains whether it can unite to address one of the most complex crises of the twenty-first century.

China Compels Myanmar Rebel Groups To Negotiate With Junta – OpEd	China has forced two powerful armed rebel groups in north Myanmar to start negotiations with the Burmese military junta and call off the 1027 offensive they started October last year. Experts say this might well be the most decisive Chinese intervention to stop a conflict in its neighborhood and might well set the tenor for a more proactive future policy on such issues. The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDDA), which represents ethnic Kokangs, recently agreed to engage in talks with the State Administrative Council (SAC) under Chinese mediation. This is the second Three Brotherhood Alliance member to offer to negotiate to the junta after the Ta'ang National Liberation Army made a similar move last week. The MNDAA, the TNLA and the Arakan Army are part of the three-group Brotherhood Alliance which started the 1027 offensive in October last year. But the Arakan Army which has liberated much of the coastal province of Rakhine (formerly Arakans) has refused to stop fighting and this week captured a key border outpost in Maungdaw district bordering Bangladesh. That may worry China because the deep-sea port of Kyaukphyu it funded on the Rakhine coast may come under attack. Kyaukphyu sits at one end of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor that connect its southwestern province of Yunnan with the Rakhine province on the Bay of Bengal . Other ethnic rebel groups like the powerful Kachin Independence Army have also continued their armed offensive against the junta alongwith by majority Bamar armed groups like People's Defense Forces owing allegiance to the National Unity Government (NUG). The Burmese army has suffered huge loss of territory to the rebels. The Kachin state borders on China and is hub of the burgeoning rare earth's mining hub of Pang War, which is now in the hands of the KIA. The devout Christians that the Kachins are, their rebel group has been uncomfortable with China's expanding economic and strategic footprint in Myanmar. Fifteen years ago, the KIA and other Kachin organisations forced the Myanmar military junta to stop work on the 6000MW Myitsone hydroelectric project on the upstream of Irrawaddy River in the Kachin state. The huge 6 billion US dollar project, the Kachin feared, would submerge huge swathes of fertile lands and the electricity generated would be totally exported to China without any benefit for the local economy. MNDAA, TNLA Announce Ceasefire 'We will cease fire immediately and will not actively attack the Myanmar army from today onwards,' the MNDAA said in a statement last week. It also promised to 'firmly safeguard Myanmar's sovereignty and territorial integrity as a unified country and will not split the country or seek independence'. 'Under the mediation of China, we are willing to engage in peace talks with the Myanmar army on issues such as Lashio,' the MNDAA statement said, referring to the town in northern Shan State it seized in August along with the military's North Eastern Command. Reports from Lashio say that Myanmar national flags were hoisted along with MNDAA flags in several places in the city. The MNDAA also said it's 'willing to send a high-level delegation' to hold talks with the regime aimed at 'resolving conflicts and differences through political means'. However, the group also called on the regime to stop its 'aerial attacks and ground offensives across the country', and claimed that it's preserving its right to self-defense. The MNDAA decision to start negotiations comes amid reports that Chinese intelligence had placed one of its top commander under house arrest in Yunnan capital Kunming to pressure his troops to withdraw from Lashio. MNDAA's Commander Detained MNDAA's top commander Peng Daxun (aka Peng Daren) has been in China since his meeting with Chinese special envoy to Myanmar Deng Xijun in Yunnan Province's Kunming city in late October. The Chinese said he was undergoing medical treatment but a senior member of the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC) claimed that Peng Daxun had not been allowed to return to Myanmar because he had resisted Chinese pressure to withdraw his fighters from Lashio. The FPNCC is an alliance of seven ethnic armed groups including the MNDAA. 'I can confirm that he has been detained, but I can't provide details. We're facing challenges and pressures,' the FPNCC member said last month, insisting on anonymity. Other sources in the resistance say China was alarmed when the National Unity Government ( NUG), which claims to be the 'real government' of Myanmar, offered to make Peng Daxun its vice-president in an attempt to integrate the ethnic armed groups including a broader national coalition against the junta. China sees the NUG as pro-western and inimical to its extensive interests in Myanmar. Junta's Lashio Loss Rattled China The seizure of Lashio marked the loss of a capital city and a regional command headquarters by the Burmese military to anti-regime forces, which dented the junta's image and raised serious questions over its ability to defeat the rebel offensive 1027. It emboldened the anti-junta resistance forces to encircle Myanmar's second biggest city Mandalay where the army's Central Command is headquartered. China was rattled by the fall of Lashio and the encirclement of Mandalay because it put at grave risk most of its mega projects on the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor ( CMEC) funded under President Xi Jinping's ambitious Belt & Road Initiative ( BRI). That included the oil-gas pipeline and the railroad connecting Yunnan with the China-funded deep seaport of Kyaukphyu on the Rakhine coast in the Bay of Bengal, where rebels of the Arakan Army has notched major success in recent months. Mandalay is not only the hub of the lucrative Burmese gems and precious stones that is largely controlled by Chinese traders but also sits on the Kunming-Kyaukphyu oil-gas pipeline. Two years ago, the PDF rebels had set off explosions on an offtake station of the pipeline in Natogyi township of Mandalay and caused considerable damage. China's Multi-Pronged Myanmar Strategy China has for long played all sides in Myanmar, cultivating both the military junta and the ethnic armed groups active near the its border with Myanma , including the MNDAA. Realising the threat to its economic and strategic interests, Beijing lost no time in decisively intervening in the Myanmar conflict. It not only pressurised the MNDAA and the TNLA to withdraw from Lashio but also forced the United Wa State Army (UWSA) to cut off the supply of food, fuel, medicines and other resources to the two ethnic armies, driving a wedge between it and the other two groups. The UWSA is Myanmar's most powerful ethnic rebel army with nearly 30000 fighters heavily armed by the Chinese and its coffers bolstered by the synthetic drug trade. The Wa tribe formed the bulk of the combat elements of the once-powerful but now-defunct Burmese Communist Party before their leaders broke away to form the UWSA, which has been in effective control of the Wa Autonomous Region in the northern Shan State. The junta has practised live-and-let-live with UWSA, which has been supplied. Beijing Hosts Junta Supremo Following the fall of Lashio, the Chinese not only hosted junta supremo Senior General Min Aung Hlaing in Beijing to boost his legitimacy, the first time since the Feb 2021 coup, but also backed his plans to organise nationsl elections in late 2025. According to latest reports, Chinese intelligence is trying to coax another powerful ethnic armed rebel group in the north to announce a ceasefire and stop fighting the Burmese army. Sources in the powerful Kachin Independence Army (KIA) have confirmed the Chinese push for a stop to its offensive which has led to loss of much territory by the junta in the Kachin state. The KIA in late October overran the Pang War township and huge areas around it that is considered the hub of Myanmar's rare earth mining industry which almost wholly supplies China. Despite Chinese pressure, the KIA has so far not only refused to stop its offensive against the Burmese army but it has also shut down the most important border crossing with China, sending its rare earth companies in a tizzy and shares of its companies in a free fall in the country's stock markets. 'While China continues to pay lip service to ASEAN centrality and leadership on the Myanmar issue, it has emerged as the dominant external actor pushing to shape developments to its advantage,' says Myanmar expert Jason Tower in one of his recent publication . 'In many respects,' writes Tower, 'Myanmar is emerging as a test case for more robust Chinese security involvement overseas. Everything is on the table, from deploying Chinese police, to using technology to monitor and surveil activities beyond China's border, to rolling out new approaches for overseas security on Belt and Road Initiative projects, to gaining a strategic advantage in platforms such as ASEAN.' In stark contrast, India has broadly followed a policy of 'wait-and- watch', reposing its hope on the ASEAN to break the deadlock with its Five-Point Consensus in Myanmar. It is now waking up to the need to deal with other non-state actors to address its connectivity and security concerns, but its actions have been limited to covert exploratory contacts.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cf_IMdCVDzTh	2024-12-10T09:43:34-08:00	
Malaysia: TotalEnergies Completes Acquisition Of Upstream Gas Ass...	TotalEnergies finalized Tuesday the acquisition of the interests of OMV (50%) and Sapura Upstream Assets (50%) in SapuraOMV Upstream (SapuraOMV), an independent gas producer in Malaysia. SapuraOMV’s main assets are its 40% operated interest in block SK408 and 30% operated interest in block SK310, both located offshore Sarawak in Malaysia. In 2024, SapuraOMV’s operated production (100%), supported by the start-up of the Jerun gas field in July, is expected to reach approximately 590 Mcf/d of natural gas, feeding the Bintulu LNG plant operated by Petronas, as well as 10 kb/d of condensates. The assets have production costs (ASC932) below 5 $/boe and an overall emission intensity below 10 kg CO2e/boe. TotalEnergies has been operating in Malaysia since 1985, and is a long-standing partner of the national oil company Petronas. Following the completion of the acquisition of SapuraOMV Upstream, TotalEnergies employs about 300 people in the country, and holds operated interests of 40% in block SK408 and 30% in block SK310, as well as a 40% interest in block SB412. These interests round out its existing portfolio of 34.9% in both blocks SB-2K and SB-N and 85% in block DW2E. Via its affiliate TotalEnergies Marketing Malaysia, TotalEnergies also markets petroleum products. The Company also signed a deal with Petronas and Mitsui in 2023 to develop a CO2 storage project in Southeast Asia and assess several potential sites in the Malay Basin.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cfgrEGZ28LHm	2024-12-10T09:40:57-08:00	
Nuclear War: How Western Media Preps The World – OpEd	Recent modification by the Russian government of its nuclear doctrine has given rise to a wave of news reports and analysis by western media that appears less concerned about the application of the updated doctrine than to tell the world that anything the Russians may want to do in its militarism, the West can do better. In a 2020 decree, well before its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia had warned that it may use nuclear weapons in case of a nuclear attack by an enemy or conventional attack that threatened the existence of the Russian state. This doctrine - enacted well before the war with Ukraine in 2022 - did not cause concern as it mirrored a similar if unpublicised doctrine of the United States and its western allies. A later version of this decree proposed in September 2024 for a broadening of the threats under which Russia would consider a nuclear strike. It also included Belarus, an ally, under Russia’s nuclear umbrella and the warning that a rival nuclear power supporting a conventional strike on Russia or its ally would also be considered to be attacking it. Since then there has been a worsening of the war situation in Ukraine with President Biden’s approval of the use of US long range missiles to strike targets within Russia. This was responded to by President Putin signing into law the earlier proposed September changes. To remind the West of the new red lines, Putin approved the launching of a potentially nuclear warhead carrying missile into Ukraine. Nicknamed ‘Oreshnik’, the hypersonic missile is capable of carrying six nuclear warheads and reaching its targets in Europe in 15-30 minutes. Western Media Response to Oreshnik Much of the reaction in western media circles, war analysts and think tanks has been not only to pour cold water on Russia's capacity to begin a qualitatively new and more destructive phase of military combat. The Ukrainian newspaper. The Kyiv Independent, argued that Russia is engaged in a psych and propaganda offensive to create a climate of fear and scare Ukrainians and the West into submission ( Quoting The Moscow Times, a pro-west paper, the paper claimed that the propaganda offensive was coordinated between government, military, and intelligence officials, as well as PR experts as a response to the West's decision to permit Ukraine to strike inside Russia with US and ally ATACM missiles (Army Tactical Missile System). Although the US has said that it will not change its nuclear posture despite the lowering of the Russian threshold, western media have begun a counter propaganda offensive aimed at heightening condemnation of the Russian measures. At the same time a more intensive propaganda campaign is now ongoing amongst the wolf warrior forces of the west to impress western public on the ability of the US to successfully conduct a nuclear war. Engaged are also more reputed western media channels intent on increasing their readership by putting up the nuclear war subject in their front page whilst assigning the blame for the start of any nuclear war to the enemies of the West. For the ‘benefit’ of its Asian readership, the latest report by American weekly, Newsweek, which claims a large multicultural audience and ‘fair and independent’ journalism, provides detailed maps of the impact of a US initiated nuclear war in Asia. The report starts off with the following lead statement which is intended to absolve the US from responsibility in any of the wars taking place. 'The U.S. is inadvertently involved in multiple conflicts around the world in backing its allies, while also facing tensions with China over several issues including trade.' According to the report casualties, in an US initiated first nuclear strike, would be of the following magnitude: See: What is especially noteworthy in the report is that it is a follow up to initial modelling of the casualties likely from a Russian nuclear strike against the US and NATO capitals. This appears to give the impression that the magazine is fair in its reportage although the emphasis on the American ‘inadvertent involvement’ in multiple conflicts clearly exposes the paper's real intentions. The impact of such obviously slanted and clearly mischievous journalism is not only to play up the war fantasies of the forces and lobbies of war in the US and NATO. It is also to desensitize and harden the public into acceptance of the lives to be paid for in any nuclear conflict; and to justify this by assigning blame and responsibility to Russia, China and North Korea. Policy of NFU on Nuclear Weapons Most important and crucially missing from the current news reports and analysis on the possibility of a nuclear war taking place is discussion on the policy of first use of nuclear weapons (NFU). For now, China and India are the only two nuclear power countries that have formally committed to a no first use policy. In 1964, following the detonation of its first atomic bomb, China declared that it would never be the first to use nuclear weapons. Today it is the only nuclear-armed nation with an unconditional policy of NFU of nuclear weapons. In contrast the US and NATO, and its member states of France and the United Kingdom, have repeatedly spurned demands from their public to commit to a NFU policy, thus showing a policy intent not only aimed at deterrence but also to warfighting and first strike. Media and other stake players committed to preventing a nuclear conflict would do well to highlight the importance of all nations in subscribing to NFU. This would be a more constructive and worthwhile subject for their front pages than what they are now focusing on to prevent a nuclear holocaust.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cT9FIVIytyu3	2024-12-10T09:39:50-08:00	
Adversarial Convergence Raises Alarm, Warns Socom General At Reag...	By Army Maj. Wes Shinego U.S. Army Gen. Bryan P. Fenton, commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, highlighted the cooperation among adversarial nations and nonstate actors, and called for decisive action in the face of increasing complex global security threats at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California on Saturday. Fenton detailed how partnerships between Russia, Iran, North Korea and China are reshaping the international security landscape — specifically with regard to the present conflict in Ukraine. Fenton explained how these alliances provide adversaries with a dangerous synergy. 'This is not just Russia fighting Ukraine,' Fenton said. 'It's Russia, backed by Iranian drones, North Korean personnel and indirect Chinese contributions.' The general cited Iran's transfer of 'material solutions' — like its Shahed 136 drones and Fath 360 ballistic missiles — to Russia as a prime example. The Fath 360 missiles, which can strike targets up to 75 miles away, enhance Russia's ability to sustain its war effort while preserving its long-range arsenal. Fenton's example echoed similar concerns voiced by the Defense Department in recent months. In October, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed that Iran has trained Russian personnel to operate its munitions, solidifying the growing military ties between the two nations. 'The concerning aspect of this,' Ryder said, 'is the developing relationship between Russia and Iran. It's reasonable to expect that this missile delivery will not be a one-time event.' He continued, noting that Russia's partnerships with nations like Iran and North Korea often involve exchanges of intelligence and technology, further deepening their strategic alignment. North Korea's increasing role in the conflict adds another dimension to this adversarial convergence. During a Nov. 4 press briefing, Ryder reported that more than 12,000 North Korean troops deployed to Russia's Kursk Oblast, to train in combat tactics alongside Russian forces. These troops replaced Russian personnel depleted by heavy casualties in Ukraine. Fenton expanded on the implications of these alliances, stressing that the convergence of state and nonstate actors represents a fundamental shift in the character of warfare. He noted that Ukraine's innovative use of drones and artificial intelligence to counter these threats represents a 'revolutionary' approach worth emulating. The general urged the department to scale similar technologies, emphasizing the need for affordable and scalable solutions. 'We need tools that impose costs on adversaries without draining our resources,' Fenton said, pointing to Ukraine's production of millions of drones as a model for how smaller systems can effectively challenge larger forces. Fenton also called for stronger collaboration between the military and private industry. He praised Socom's ability to quickly adapt to battlefield needs through partnerships with defense companies but emphasized the need to expand these efforts across the department. 'Our modernization priorities must be clear, and we need to bring industry closer to the problem,' he said. Despite these challenges, the general expressed optimism in America's ability to counter these emerging threats through its own global partnerships. He highlighted multinational military exercises like the Rim of the Pacific Exercise, which integrates allied forces to enhance readiness and interoperability. 'Our allies bring unique capabilities that, combined with ours, create a powerful force multiplier,' he noted. In his closing remarks, Fenton urged policymakers to adopt a whole-of-nation approach to security. He emphasized the importance of innovation, bipartisan support and public understanding of the threats posed by adversarial blocs. 'We're in a decisive decade,' he said. 'The convergence of threats demands a convergence of our own capabilities.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cSCbvh2Vx6BW	2024-12-10T09:37:29-08:00	
Failure To Find All TB Cases Defeats Us In #endTB Efforts – OpEd	If we fail to find all cases of an infectious disease (and put them on care), then it will keep spreading. 'We are not able to find all TB cases as of now. We had an estimated 1.1 million new TB cases in 2023 in Indonesia as per the latest WHO Global TB Report 2024. But the highest we could reach with TB services was around 804,800. So, we still missed a few hundred thousands. If we do not find these missing cases, and put them on treatment, they will remain there as a source of infection to the rest of the community,' rightly said Dr Erlina Burhan, a widely acclaimed TB and lung disease medical expert. Breaking the chain of infection transmission is central to disease prevention and control 'So, while we cure people who we find, it is also critically important to note that those who we miss are still transmitting the disease to others - and going through avoidable suffering because treatment, care and support is free in public sector. So, I am very supportive of the global call to #FindAllTB, #TreatAllTB and #PreventAllTB - so that we can #endTB. If we miss even one of these pillars, we will not be able to achieve TB elimination,' added Dr Burhan. And we have to find, treat and prevent TB in a people-centred, rights-based and gender transformative manner. Dr Erlina Burhan, is a leading lung infection specialist at the Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia, and Professor of Pulmonology at the University of Indonesia. She is on the Board of Directors of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and is also a member of the WHO TB Guideline Development Board. Dr Burhan was in conversation with CNS at the Union World Lung Health Conference (largest world conference on TB and lung diseases) held recently in Bali. As per the WHO Global TB Report 2024, 30 high TB burden countries accounted for 87% of the global TB burden in 2023. Eight countries accounted for more than two thirds of the worldwide total: India (26%), Indonesia (10%), China (6.8%), the Philippines (6.8%) and Pakistan (6.3%), Nigeria (4.6%), Bangladesh (3.5%) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (3.1%). Failure to prevent TB It is ironical that on one hand governments have promised to end TB by 2030 but on the other hand they are not addressing the risk factors that put people at heightened TB risk. 'We have not fully addressed the poor socio-economic problems of the people that lead to malnutrition. TB is a transmissible disease and unless all infection prevention and control measures are in place it will spread to others,' said Dr Erlina Burhan. As per the WHO Global TB Report 2024, malnutrition, tobacco use, alcohol use, diabetes and HIV continue to be the top five TB risk factors worldwide. Malnutrition is usually the biggest risk TB factor in most high TB burden nations but in Indonesia, tobacco use is the biggest TB risk factor as it caused TB in 147,000 people in 2023. Undernutrition was the close second TB risk factor in Indonesia in 2023 with 84,000 people developing TB disease because of it, followed by diabetes (32,000 people got TB because of it), HIV (23,000 people got TB because of HIV), and alcohol use (16,000 people got TB because of it). What is preventing us from finding the missing cases? 'TB can never be eliminated by merely a medical response. We surely need a robust medical and health component but we also need to pay attention to all other necessary non-medical partners who can help end TB. This is where the problem lies. We have all the latest technology for diagnosis and treatment. Sputum microscopy is already being replaced by molecular testing [globally over half of TB cases are found using an upfront molecular testing]. And we have got all the different treatment regimens- even the new shorter regimens are being rolled out,' said Dr Burhan. 'The tools are there but there is very weak implementation on the ground. Indonesia has more than 2500 WHO recommended rapid molecular diagnostic devices. It also has the point-of-care and decentralised molecular testing machines - Truenat. There is also an incredibly strong political will and commitment, led by the new President. But Indonesia consists of 17,000 islands and many of them are in remote and hard to reach geographical locations. We have to make extra efforts to deploy the tools more efficiently in remote areas of the archipelago- especially the point-of-care tools/devices that are user-friendly and can be deployed in low infrastructure situations,' she added. 'Ideally we should screen everyone through artificial intelligence (AI) supported ultraportable handheld x-ray devices, and diagnose presumptive TB cases with upfront molecular testing,' rightly says Dr Burhan. What should change if we have to end TB? 'We cannot do business as usual anymore. We need to take aggressive transformative actions. National TB programmes will have to do 'business unusual' in order to find all the TB cases, including drug-resistant TB cases, to end TB. Also we have to do something more than just to diagnose and to cure. We have to go back to the basics - do infection control and prevention. And not only talk about TB preventive therapy but also the TB vaccine (which is currently under research). There are now 6 new TB vaccine candidates in Phase 3 clinical studies. Indonesia is one of the countries that is taking part in the study of M72. I am very hopeful that this new vaccine will have a good efficacy and safety profile. If this is achieved hopefully in two years, then we will have to move fast to get approvals from various authorities for its registration, licensing, marketing and use it rapidly for the community. No business as usual procedure,' asserts Dr Burhan. [CNS Editor's note: If shown to be well-tolerated and effective, M72 could potentially become the first vaccine to help prevent pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults, and the first new TB vaccine in over a century]. But having new health technologies is not enough. We have to ensure these are rolled out equitably where they are needed the most. 'We also have to learn from our experiences of the inequitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine- and put in place beforehand all measures for the accessibility, affordability, and availability in all countries- especially high TB burden countries,' says Dr Burhan. Also engaging with other stakeholders is lacking. If we can engage with and collaborate with different sectors (as had happened during COVID-19 pandemic where almost whole of society and whole of government approach became a reality)- public and private sector, the community, opinion leaders, influencers, religious leaders- I am sure we can end TB, she said. Science has given us evidence-based tools, which can help prevent TB infection, diagnose TB early on and put those diagnosed with TB on treatment without delay. So early and accurate diagnosis followed by treatment without any delay and its completion is crucial to end TB. But one also has to take a nutritious diet, quit smoking and alcohol, do physical exercise, protect oneself from HIV or diabetes and those with HIV and diabetes need to ensure standard management, and all of us should lead a healthy lifestyle. The Global TB Report 2024 lists undernutrition as the top risk factor for developing TB. A study conducted in India has also proven beyond doubt that giving good nutrition to the community can reduce TB incidence substantially. [CNS Editor's Note: The RATIONS (Reducing Activation of Tuberculosis by Improvement of Nutritional Status) study done in India found that providing nutritional support to TB patients and their household members reduced TB incidence and mortality substantially. It was conducted in a population with high rates of malnutrition in contacts and very severe undernutrition in patients. It was the first study globally to aim for a reduction of TB incidence by improving the nutritional status of those at risk, and it was the largest cohort study of patients with TB who were given nutritional support to improve TB treatment outcomes. TB incidence was reduced by nearly 40-50% in household contacts of TB patients, while in the case of patients with TB, there was 35-50% lower mortality, better weight gain, low rates of loss to follow up and high rates of return to normal work]. Dr Burhan's message for all is that we should not wholly rely on the government- it has its own budgetary constraints. It is time for the community also to help each other. Be kind to your neighbour. In all religions we spare some money to help people in need. We should use this religious activity to help others in need- especially in the form of providing them with good nutrition. As a human being, please be kind to other human beings. Ani Herna Sari, a TB survivor and Chairperson, Rekat Peduli Foundation Indonesia, reiterated Dr Burhan's appeal for diagnosing and treating TB early on. Sharing her personal experience of surviving drug-resistant TB (and again surviving drug-sensitive TB along with her son), in a webinar organised by WHO during the World AMR Awareness Week this year, she said that, 'There is a very clear link between test and treatment. Genetic sequencing enables rapid and comprehensive testing of drug-resistant TB directly from clinical samples. The comprehensive drug resistance profiling provided by sequencing will ensure that affected people get the right treatment. Reaching out to the missing millions is crucial- they are the ones who remain undiagnosed due to diagnostic barriers, and/or get delayed treatment. To find the missing millions we need to innovate. But innovations are useful only when all those in need of them can access them. We need to ensure that the existing rapid molecular diagnostics and drug sensitivity testing are available for all.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5ce1y71TFsyma	2024-12-10T09:36:10-08:00	
NATO Allies Join Forces To Enhance Security Of Critical Undersea ...	Military and civilian experts from across NATO met at NATO Headquarters on Tuesday (10 December 2024) to ramp up further cooperation to counter threats to critical undersea infrastructure. They were joined by industry representatives, including telecommunications operators. Participants at the meeting reviewed mechanisms to boost situational awareness, to enhance information sharing and preparedness, and to deter and defend against attacks to undersea infrastructure. 'Leveraging innovation and technology, including through increased sensing and monitoring to detect suspicious activity near critical undersea infrastructure, is a key focus,' said Ambassador Jean-Charles Ellermann-Kingombe, NATO’s Assistant Secretary General for Innovation, Hybrid and Cyber. 'This is not a new problem set for NATO, but it is one that requires even closer cooperation between civilian and military actors in the face of intensifying hostile campaigns, including by Russia.' In May, NATO launched a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within the Alliance’s Maritime Command in the United Kingdom. With growing threats to subsea infrastructure, NATO created earlier this year a Critical Undersea Network to improve information sharing and coordination for the security of undersea cables and pipelines. The Network brings together stakeholders from Allies’ governments, industries, NATO’s civilian and military headquarters as well as other relevant actors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cY83ZgXm-4UF	2024-12-10T09:34:51-08:00	
Peace Plans, Schmese Plans: Key Path To Ukraine Peace Long Ignore...	Politico ran the headline, 'Ukraine Peace Plans Galore.' Ukraine, Russia, and China each have a peace plan. Trump is developing one. The Alliance of Democracies has one. It looks a lot like Ukraine's plan at first glance. There's talk of a Demilitarized Zone between Ukraine and Russia. There's also the suggestion of imposing a frozen conflict. They seem like an open invitation for continued stress between the countries, not real peace. So, what's the ignored key path to peace I'm talking about? The first step along that path involves adopting a strategy of honesty. That requires sharp awareness of a troubling situation. It is that the mainstream Ukraine narrative expressed by most of our politicians is fabricated. Likewise are the stories reported by our media. Instead of debunking all the falsehoods one by one I'll describe the truths that the false narratives ignore. They became apparent to me by closely following what actually happened during and after the revolution. Here's what I saw: When in 2014 the Maidan revolutionaries took over by force, they cancelled Ukraine's democracy. --They illegally chased the democratically elected president out of the country, falsely claiming he was impeached. But on close examination he wasn't. The United States has admitted that. A Ukrainian official also confirmed it to me personally. No impeachment. No resignation, either. --The revolutionaries threw out the democratically promulgated constitution and replaced it with an old one that the legitimate Supreme Court had previously declared unconstitutional. --They began to rule as militant, self-appointed, unelected leaders of a new, non-democratic state. --They showed early intentions of drastically altering what had been successfully a Ukrainian-Russian multilingual state. That actually played out in later overt initiatives to linguistically and culturally cleanse things Russian from the new Ukrainian state. That brought about the oppression of Ukraine's significant Russian minority population. Most areas of Ukraine accepted all that as a fait accompli. Two did not: Crimea and Donbas. (Donbas consists of the areas known as Donetsk and Luhansk.) Both Crimea and Donbas rejected the loss of democracy and also the unelected revolutionary leaders that caused it. Crimea and Donbas each declared their respective independence. In response, the revolutionaries launched a hostile attack. They waged war on what was by then the independent area of Donbas. The intent was apparently to capture it by force. They didn't attack Crimea, however. You see, a treaty that Russia had with Ukraine gave Russia control over its historical naval base at Sevastopol, Crimea. It also allowed for up to 25,000 Russian troops to be stationed there. According to the March 18, 2014 Washington Post, Russia was believed to have had about 15,000 on-base at the time of the revolution. That may have deterred an attack by the revolutionaries. The net effect of the revolution was to create in a very real sense a different country, a different Ukraine. Look at the chain of events I described above. Pre revolution -- democracy. Post revolution -- unelected rule by force. There was a complete break from the earlier government. There was no continuity. Pre revolution -- control over Donbas and Crimea. Post revolution -- no such control. They both had achieved independence. In a de facto sense, pre-revolution Ukraine and post-revolution Ukraine aren't the same country when it comes to statehood. The post-revolution Ukrainian state was given some semblance of democracy in June 2014. That's when it installed its first democratically elected president, Petro Poroshenko. This was about two months after the revolutionaries had already attacked Donbas. Upon taking office Poroshenko continued to attack Donbas as did Volodymyr Zelensky who followed as president. To appreciate the concept of post-revolution Ukraine as a 'different country' think of China in the 1900s. It had a revolution, too. Pre revolution it was the Republic of China. Post revolution it was the communist People's Republic of China. Again, a complete break. Who would argue that they were the same country? This perspective is consistent with a multinational treaty. It is the Montevideo Convention of 1933. It was signed on behalf of the United States by Cordell Hull, President Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of state. In international law this treaty is widely regarded as definitional regarding statehood and country status. Two essential qualifications are government and territory. Pre- and post-revolution Ukraine were discontinuous on both qualifications. Why have the politicians and media gone for the false narrative? The full answer is beyond the scope of this article. But suffice to say, the extended war has been very lucrative and beneficial for many investors/financiers, defense industry companies, and politicians. The impact of this on a potentially successful peace plan is a misalignment of interests. The interests of the war beneficiaries are served by prolonged war and tensions, not by sustainable peace. That's exactly why a sustainable peace agreement must be based on an honest perspective. The so-called peace plans that I've seen in the news all are accommodations of the false narrative. An honest accounting of the etiology of war in Ukraine will serve as a sounder basis. I'm not suggesting that this be used to place blame. That would not be a wise approach. Rick Staggenborg, MD has followed this situation and explains: 'To move toward peace in Ukraine we don't have to agree on who is at fault. Unfortunately too many make that a big issue -- but that's gotten us nowhere. As a psychotherapist with training in family therapy, I know from experience that focusing on who is responsible for a problem almost never leads to a satisfactory solution; indeed it can be counterproductive.' The key principals in negotiating a genuine peace plan must be the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. I fail to see how they can bring about sustainable peace if the pretense of the false narrative is not broken, regardless of how entrenched it has become. An approach based on honesty will have a better chance. Here's an example of an honest approach on a related matter: In mapping Ukraine, the National Geographic Society in 2014 chose not to include Crimea as part of it. U.S. News quoted the Society's geographer and director of editorial and research, 'We map de facto, in other words we map the world as it is, not as people would like it to be.' That's honesty on display. In contrast, a spokesperson for Rand McNally said, 'We take our direction from the State Department.' At that time the State Department was headed by politician John Kerry. But fighting the false mainstream narrative will be difficult. There is a lot of dishonest narrative to discard. Many countries have recognized the bogus territorial claims of the revolutionaries as factual. They've accepted the false narrative as being true. They side with the war beneficiaries. Those countries do so in disregard of the actual facts that are at hand. However, in traditional diplomacy the concept of 'recognition' is very powerful. Many judgments are based on that concept. Negotiators will need strength to oppose that. 'Recognition' is a political contrivance, though. It does not necessarily comport with the honest truth. Frankly, recognition sounds to me like a genteel euphemism for mob rule. The negotiators will have a lot of controversial issues to deal with: Russia's sudden 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the disposition of post-Ukraine territories now claimed by Russia, the main water supply for Crimea that the revolutionaries cut off, just to start with. Then there are Russia's security concerns over NATO advancement. History tells that President John F. Kennedy brought the world to the brink of nuclear war in 1962 over a Soviet missile threat far smaller than the NATO threat now perceived by Russia. In due fairness, Russia deserves having NATO threats considered with a comparable level of seriousness. The peace negotiators will need the courage and integrity to resist pressure from the war beneficiaries and their allies, and reject the entrenched false narrative about Ukraine. I hope that an honest view of the real circumstances will prevail if and when the three presidents meet to negotiate peace. That in effect is the 'key path to Ukraine peace that has been long ignored by all.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cR6KlferGs33	2024-12-10T09:32:05-08:00	
Are Young Ukrainians Volunteers Now? – OpEd	The US Department of Defense (DoD) announced (Dec. 7, 2024) a significant new security assistance package an additional $988 million to prevail in its fight against Russian aggression. This package also includes programs to help Ukraine reconstitute its forces and build and sustain combat power along with Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Equipment, components, and spare parts to maintain, repair, and overhaul artillery systems, tanks, and armored vehicles. This is the Biden Administration's twenty-second package as part of the surge of aid for Ukraine and may be the last from the Biden Administration. This aid actually aims to counter the incoming Donald Trump administration's plan on Ukraine, which has been taking the opposite position of reducing aid to Kiev. As the Trump administration is to push for an immediate cease-fire after taking office, could be on the horns of a dilemma and accused of being too oblivious to Ukrainian interests as well as letting its guard down against Russia. In other words, instead of calling for peace, US seeks 'Input to Output' results.US politicians don't care how many people die in Ukraine. Ukrainians have eventually turned out to be cannon fodder for the US. According to a Washington Post report on Dec. 7, 2024, a senior US official stated, 'Even with the money, even with the munitions, there have to be people on the front lines to deal with the Russian aggression.' Clearly, meaning Washington has emphasized the need for Ukraine to mobilize more of its population to maintain the status quo on the frontline and deal with the possibility of a prolonged war. The report reveals a harsh truth for the Ukrainian people, especially the youth. The Ukrainian government is worried about the public opposition that lowering the conscription age might generate in Ukraine and what challenges such a decision might pose. Contradictory Signals President Zelensky made the case for a diplomatic settlement to Russia’s 33-month-old war in Ukraine and raised the idea of foreign troops being deployed in his country until it could join the NATO military alliance. The remarks at a joint press conference (Dec. 7, 2024) with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz were the latest to signal Kyiv’s increasing openness to war negotiations, with Donald Trump preparing to return to the White House on Jan 20. The US president-elect Donald Trump, who has said he wants to end the war quickly, called on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations to end the 'madness', after he met Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron for talks in Paris. 'Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. No doubt, a diplomatic resolution would save more lives. We do seek it,' Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv on Dec. 9, 2024. Are Young Ukrainians Volunteers? An unnamed senior US official said that Ukraine should consider lowering the age of military service from 25 to 18 years, as the country was not mobilising or training enough new soldiers to replace those killed in action. 'The need right now is manpower.' The Russians are in fact making steady progress and Ukrainian are being pushed back on all battlefield fronts including in Kursk. However, the Ukrainian’s counter by stating that 'Right now, with our current mobilisation efforts, we don’t have enough equipment, for example, armoured vehicles, to support all the troops we are calling up.' Analysts and war bloggers have said Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the invasion, capturing an area half the size of London over the past month. Ukraine is actively recruiting volunteers, including foreign citizens between 18 and 60 years old without criminal records. Applicants must be physically sound and able to enter Ukraine. The Ukraine volunteer unit provides brief training before deploying volunteers alongside Ukrainian soldiers. This just means that young Ukrainian volunteers are not coming forward to join the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Government is seeking foreign citizens between 18 and 60 years old. What an anomaly! 'Ukraine by now should have lowered the conscription age to 18 on its own to defend the country against the major Russian advances in Ukraine to make up for the losses.' The Truth A Ukrainian serviceman stressed that despite Russians’ advantage in personnel and equipment, they couldn’t make significant progress over a large area. 'We’re facing a huge shortage of personnel, and that’s the biggest challenge for Ukrainian forces right now. If this shortage continues, and the Russian army keeps increasing its numbers, we’ll be facing very tough times ahead. Russia knows about our manpower shortage, which is why they're launching heavy assaults. When they see they outnumber us, they try to push forward.' The initial euphoria of February 2022 of joining the forces to protect their motherland has evaporated, owing to an astronomical number of deaths. Ukraine’s military is now ‘Outgunned and Outnumbered’, struggling with low morale and high rate of desertions. As the battlefield situation deteriorated, an increasing number of troops have started to desert. In just the first four months of 2024, prosecutors launched criminal proceedings against almost 19,000 soldiers who either abandoned their posts or deserted, according to the Ukrainian parliament. This prolonged war nearing three years have near decimated many Ukrainian infantry battalions making the situation grim on the battle fronts. Reinforcements are few and difficult to be created-leaving soldiers exhausted, demoralized to desert. Despite Ukrainian President Zelensky determined to continue fighting the war, young Ukrainians are fiercely opposing conscription and refusing to go to the warfront to get killed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cby51QE7HLhO	2024-12-10T09:29:38-08:00	
Journalistic View Of India-Bangladesh Tensions – OpEd	The role of media in shaping public perception is undeniably critical, particularly in fostering understanding between nations. However, when it is used as a tool for disinformation, the consequences can be severe, exacerbating mistrust and undermining diplomatic relations. A case in point is the recent interviews conducted by prominent Indian media outlets with Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to the chief adviser of Bangladesh. These interactions provide a revealing glimpse into how disinformation tactics are employed to construct a biased narrative against Bangladesh, particularly regarding its treatment of minorities. The India Today interview, aired on December 3, exemplifies how narratives are shaped to fit a preconceived agenda. From the outset, Shafiqul was introduced as someone denying 'Hindu hate,' framing the discussion as if this claim were already established fact. Such introductions create a charged atmosphere, placing the interviewee on the defensive and limiting their ability to present a balanced perspective. The opening question further reinforces this bias. Gaurav Sawant, the interviewer, described the situation in Bangladesh as 'grim' for minorities, citing a 'sharp rise' in attacks on Hindus and other groups. However, no evidence was provided to substantiate these claims, presenting them as universal truths rather than allegations needing verification. This tactic sets a premise that is hard to dismantle within the constraints of a live interview. Visual elements are a potent tool in reinforcing disinformation. During Shafiqul's response, India Today displayed images and captions alleging religiously motivated violence, such as the attack on Ramen Roy, a Supreme Court lawyer. The captions misleadingly described Roy as the lawyer for Chinmoy Krishna Das, an ex-ISKCON monk. In reality, Roy’s attack occurred during a protest and was unrelated to religious tensions. The deliberate misrepresentation of events, paired with emotionally charged visuals, amplifies the perception of widespread unrest targeting minorities. By omitting the broader context, such as Roy’s presence at a politically charged protest, these reports manipulate viewer sentiment and paint an inaccurate picture of Bangladesh. Misinformation thrives on selective storytelling. Sawant's claims about Hindu temples being burned and Hindu teachers resigning en masse distort the reality on the ground. While incidents of vandalism have occurred, they are isolated and not indicative of systemic targeting of Hindus. Similarly, resignations among teachers and police officers were linked to political retribution, not religious discrimination. The NDTV interview aired the following day mirrored these tactics. It showcased unrelated footage of violence during earlier protests, misleading viewers to believe they were witnessing recent minority-targeted unrest. Such selective presentation of facts undermines the credibility of the interviewee and perpetuates a distorted narrative. These disinformation campaigns are not random. They align with a broader ideological and political agenda. Branding Bangladesh as a hostile state for minorities serves to bolster India’s self-image as a protector of Hindus globally. This narrative aligns with the Indian government’s domestic policies, which emphasize Hindu nationalism under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). However, this approach is counterproductive. By fostering mistrust between nations, it undermines regional cooperation and stability. Bangladesh, which has consistently refuted such allegations, finds its international image tarnished by these campaigns. Furthermore, the focus on external narratives diverts attention from pressing domestic issues in India, including rising communal violence and systemic discrimination against minorities. The decline in ethical journalism in India has been widely acknowledged. While credible voices like Karan Thapar and Rajdeep Sardesai continue to uphold journalistic integrity, they are increasingly overshadowed by sensationalism. Sardesai’s recent interview with Karan Thapar for The Wire highlighted his disillusionment with the state of Indian media, describing its transformation into a vehicle for propaganda rather than a platform for truth. Such practices erode public trust in the media and contribute to the polarization of society. When media outlets prioritize sensationalism over accuracy, they not only fail their audience but also harm their nation’s standing on the global stage. Addressing disinformation requires a collective effort. Indian media must prioritize evidence-based reporting and uphold the principles of journalistic integrity. Governments and regulatory bodies should also play a role in combating the spread of false narratives. For Bangladesh and India, maintaining open channels of communication is vital to counter the effects of disinformation. Diplomatic initiatives should focus on fostering mutual understanding and addressing grievances constructively. The manipulation of media narratives to serve political agendas is a disservice to journalism and diplomacy. Indian media’s portrayal of Bangladesh as an intolerant state for minorities is not only inaccurate but also detrimental to bilateral relations. By embracing ethical journalism and fostering truthful narratives, both nations can work towards a future of cooperation and mutual respect.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cdZq1YHa6Gi2	2024-12-10T09:28:00-08:00	
The Renovated Notre Dame Cathedral: History, Faith, And Diplomacy...	Notre Dame de Paris, located on the Île de la Cité island in the 4th district of Paris, is a medieval Catholic cathedral considered one of the most impressive examples of French Gothic architecture. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary, this structure represents the pinnacle of the Gothic style with its architectural innovations, flying buttresses, massive rose windows, and sculptures adorned with natural elements. It also draws attention with its three great pipe organs and enormous bells. Construction of the cathedral began in 1163 under Archbishop Maurice de Sully, and it was largely completed by 1260, undergoing various modifications in the centuries that followed. However, the great fire of 2019 led to its restoration. Finally, in 2024, Notre Dame reopened its doors, reclaiming its place on the world stage as a center where history, faith, and culture meet. Visitors from Different Faiths and Reservations Notre Dame is not only a fascinating site for Catholics but also for people of different faiths and cultural tourists. However, some non-Catholic Christians may have reservations about entering such religious buildings, either due to concerns about their faith being influenced or fears of questioning their own denomination in the face of the cathedral's grandeur. Nevertheless, these structures should not be viewed solely as places of worship but also as cultural treasures. An example of this perspective is seen in the participation of Jewish-Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Protestant U.S. President Donald Trump in the cathedral's reopening ceremony, highlighting the cultural and diplomatic significance of Notre Dame. In addition to Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Prince William of the United Kingdom also attended the opening. The Importance of Cultural Experiences Notre Dame, one of the essential stops for any visit to Paris, has also been a cultural discovery point for me. While attending an energy fair in Paris, I was struck by the deep admiration I felt when I saw the cathedral still in its restoration phase. Religious structures are not limited to worship; they are places that enrich the human experience culturally and historically. Diplomacy and Reunion The reopening of Notre Dame is not only a success in restoration but also a significant diplomatic event. World leaders gathered at the opening ceremony, finding an opportunity to strengthen ties between countries through art and culture. Such events once again demonstrate how art and history serve as bridges for international dialogue and cooperation. The Rebirth of a Cultural Heritage The renovation and reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral is not only a great achievement for France but also a significant development for global cultural heritage. These structures carry the marks of the past into the present, offering a common ground for people of different faiths and cultures to come together. The renovated Notre Dame continues to offer humanity an unforgettable legacy as a platform of diplomacy intertwined with history and faith. In a place like Büyükada, where people of every faith and denomination live together, it is perfectly natural and beautiful to witness the peaceful coexistence of Armenian Orthodox, Catholic, Jewish, Sunni, and Alevi beliefs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cTXUzSm7OO-v	2024-12-10T09:25:45-08:00	
The Machinery Of Occupation: Israel’s Military-Industrial Complex...	Israel’s military-industrial complex is no mere appendage to its statehood—it is the central artery through which its economy, diplomacy, and national identity flow. From its inception in 1948, the state of Israel has fused militarism with statecraft, creating a war economy that wields influence far beyond its Middle Eastern borders. This machinery thrives on the confluence of four interlocking components: a deeply ingrained militaristic ethos, unparalleled U.S. patronage, the weaponization of occupied Palestinian territories, and a commanding role in the global arms trade. Each element sustains Israel’s militarized identity while projecting its impact onto the wider world. Militarism as a National Creed In Israel, militarism transcends the realm of defense to become a defining feature of society. Conscription is not merely a civic duty but a rite of passage, ensuring that nearly every Jewish Israeli has a direct connection to the armed forces. This bond extends well beyond service; it infiltrates academia, industry, and politics, creating a seamless integration of military priorities into civilian life. Universities and defense sectors collaborate in a synergy that blurs the line between innovation and weaponization. Programs like Talpiot and Havatzalot epitomize this fusion, churning out a steady stream of technocrats and entrepreneurs who fuel Israel’s defense startups. These enterprises, lauded as paragons of innovation, mask an uncomfortable truth: they are underpinned by a narrative of existential insecurity that both justifies and perpetuates a militarized society. The result is a populace conditioned to view military supremacy as synonymous with national survival—a self-reinforcing ideology that sustains the cycle of conflict. America’s Strategic Stake Israel’s war economy would be unrecognizable without the robust scaffolding provided by the United States. Since 1949, American military aid to Israel has exceeded $158 billion, a sum that underscores the strategic partnership between the two nations. This relationship is not one of mere benefactor and beneficiary; it is a mutually reinforcing alliance rooted in shared geopolitical goals. Unique among U.S. allies, Israel is permitted to channel a portion of this aid into its domestic arms industry, bolstering its technological edge while entrenching its dependence on American support. Successive U.S. administrations have embraced Israel as a cornerstone of their Middle Eastern strategy, whether countering Soviet influence during the Cold War or shaping the post-9/11 security landscape. This alignment allows Israel a degree of impunity that complicates Washington’s professed commitment to human rights, particularly in its dealings with Palestinians. Occupation as Innovation The Palestinian territories, occupied and heavily surveilled, function as a grim testing ground for Israel’s military-industrial complex. The phrase 'combat-tested' is not just a marketing tool; it is a chilling descriptor of the methods and technologies honed in real-time against Palestinian populations. From drones and surveillance systems to advanced counterinsurgency tactics, Israel’s arsenal carries the mark of its occupation—a fact that amplifies its global appeal. This export of militarized expertise extends far beyond the region. From the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, to the contentious borders of Kashmir, Israeli-developed tools and tactics are deployed in ways that often replicate the oppressive dynamics of their origin. This commodification of conflict creates a feedback loop in which occupation begets innovation, and innovation fuels occupation—a cycle that places profits above the human cost. Arms Trade as Diplomacy Israel’s role in the global arms trade extends its influence into unexpected quarters. Ranking among the world’s top arms exporters, it supplies advanced weaponry to regimes with questionable human rights records, from Myanmar to Azerbaijan. These transactions are not purely economic; they serve as instruments of geopolitical strategy, forging alliances and cementing Israel’s standing in an increasingly militarized international order. This trade is emblematic of a broader phenomenon: the normalization of militarized governance as a global standard. Nations eager to acquire Israeli expertise become unwitting participants in legitimizing its policies, particularly those concerning Palestinians. The arms trade thus operates as both an economic lifeline and a diplomatic lever, perpetuating a cycle in which military dominance is both the means and the end The Cost of Conflict The consequences of this militarized paradigm are profound and far-reaching. For Palestinians, it manifests as a relentless siege that reduces lives to mere metrics in a system driven by profit and control. For Israelis, it comes at the expense of civil society, as the imperatives of war erode democratic principles and entrench a national identity centered on conflict. Nevertheless, the consequences have a wider impact. 'l’s model of securitized governance resonates globally, influencing how states manage dissent, secure borders, and engage with perceived threats. This militarized template risks undermining international norms, replacing diplomacy and cooperation with surveillance and coercion as the default tools of statecraft. A Reckoning on the Horizon Can Israel, a state so deeply entrenched in the mechanics of war, envision a future anchored in peace? The answer lies not in superficial policy adjustments but in a profound reimagining of its ideological and economic underpinnings. Such a pivot demands an acknowledgment of the human and moral costs of its militarized identity—a reckoning with the structures that have normalized conflict as a national necessity. This transformation is not Israel’s challenge alone. The international community bears a collective responsibility to confront its complicity in sustaining this system, whether through arms purchases, diplomatic indulgence, or uncritical alliances. A global reckoning is imperative, one that prioritizes justice over expedience and human dignity over profit. Navigating the Path Forward The road to peace, fraught with obstacles, begins with dismantling the ideological constructs that equate security with militarism. It requires both Israelis and Palestinians to envision a future not defined by walls and checkpoints but by coexistence and mutual recognition. For the international community, it demands a recalibration of priorities, placing human rights and justice above the entrenched interests of the military-industrial complex. Only by addressing these interlocking challenges can the machinery of occupation be disassembled. The stakes are global, and the cost of inaction is clear: a world increasingly defined by securitization, division, and perpetual conflict. The time for change is not merely urgent—it is long overdue.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cfa6spQ9QuM1	2024-12-10T09:24:13-08:00	
Fall of Dhaka – December 16, 1971: Context, Allegations, And Rebu...	The fall of Dhaka on December 16, 1971, marked a pivotal and tragic moment in the history of South Asia. This event, culminating in the secession of East Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh, remains one of the most controversial and emotionally charged chapters in the region's history. The discourse surrounding it is mired in myths, distortions, and conflicting narratives from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India. To understand this event, it is essential to address the major allegations against Pakistan and provide a nuanced rebuttal to establish a clearer picture. The dismemberment of East Pakistan has often been attributed to several factors that allegedly highlighted the marginalization and mistreatment of Bengalis by the then West Pakistan. The scars of the partition of 1947, which witnessed mass displacement and violence, continued to affect India-Pakistan relations. India’s consistent aim to weaken Pakistan is argued to have fueled its support for the Bengali insurgency in East Pakistan, which exacerbated internal tensions within the nascent state. Critics claim that East Pakistan, constituting 55% of Pakistan’s population, should have had Dhaka as the capital. The decision to choose Karachi, and later Islamabad, as the capital was perceived by some as a deliberate exclusion of Bengalis from the nation’s political center. The choice of Urdu as Pakistan’s national language was another flashpoint. Bengalis felt their mother tongue was being disregarded, deepening the rift between the two wings. The allocation of resources, particularly foreign exchange earned from East Pakistan's jute exports, was seen as disproportionately benefiting West Pakistan. These fostered economic grievances among Bengalis. Bengalis were perceived as being systematically excluded from influential positions in civil and military institutions, where West Pakistanis dominated. The failure to hand over the premiership to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League, after its landslide victory in the 1970 elections was the final straw that pushed East Pakistan toward rebellion. While these allegations form the basis of much discourse, a closer examination reveals counterpoints and mitigating factors that challenge the prevailing narratives. The decision to promote Urdu as a national language was driven by the need for a unifying lingua franca for a diverse and newly formed state. Urdu’s widespread use in northern India and West Pakistan made it a logical choice. Similarly, Karachi, with its developed infrastructure, was a more practical choice for the capital than Dhaka at the time. Contrary to claims of exclusion, several prominent politicians from Bengal, such as Khwaja Nazimuddin, Mohammad Ali Bogra, and Hussain Shaheed Suhrawardy, held high offices in Pakistan. In the military, the number of Bengali officers had steadily grown by 1970, with notable figures like MM Alam and Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui emerging as heroes. The claim that three million Bengalis were killed by the Pakistani Army has been challenged as a gross exaggeration. Scholars like Sarmila Bose estimate the death toll to be between 50,000 and 100,000, emphasizing that numbers were politically manipulated. Bose also debunks the notion of widespread support for Mujibur Rahman’s separatist agenda, noting that 40% of the population did not vote for the Awami League. India’s role in training, arming, and sheltering Mukti Bahini insurgents was a significant factor in the conflict. American diplomat Archer Blood documented how Indian territory served as a base for Mukti Bahini operations. India’s active support for the insurgency and its eventual military intervention highlight its geopolitical motivations rather than purely humanitarian concerns. While the Pakistani Army faced accusations of atrocities, the brutalities committed by Mukti Bahini and their targeting of the Bihari community often go unacknowledged. More than 500,000 Biharis were massacred, with their deaths misattributed to Pakistani forces. The plight of stateless Biharis in Bangladesh remains a testament to this overlooked tragedy. India’s use of media to internationalize the conflict and portray Pakistan as a brutal aggressor was strategic. Indira Gandhi skillfully leveraged democratic and humanitarian rhetoric to gain Western support while masking her country’s active aggression. The twisted portrayal of events isolated Pakistan diplomatically. The dismemberment of Pakistan was not solely the result of internal mismanagement but also a calculated effort by India to exploit existing fault lines. RAW’s involvement, as revealed by Indian insiders, underscores the external orchestration of the crisis. Furthermore, the language controversy and political alienation of East Pakistan did not necessarily signify a desire for secession but reflected grievances that could have been addressed through dialogue and reform. The fall of Dhaka offers important lessons for Pakistan. It underscores the importance of addressing regional disparities, promoting inclusivity, and fostering national cohesion. It also highlights the need to counter external propaganda and safeguard national interests. The sacrifices of Pakistani soldiers in 1971, who fought valiantly under dire circumstances, deserve recognition as a testament to their commitment to the nation. While the wounds of 1971 remain deep, understanding the multifaceted causes of the conflict is essential to preventing similar tragedies in the future. The narrative of the fall of Dhaka must be revisited with a balanced perspective to honor the truth and move forward as a resilient nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cSVKazl6QtDd	2024-12-10T09:22:35-08:00	
Human Rights Day: A Call For Global Responsibility And Justice – ...	Human Rights Day, observed annually on December 10, commemorates the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. This milestone document in human history declares the inalienable rights to which all humans are entitled, regardless of race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other status. Despite its profound significance, 76 years later, millions worldwide remain deprived of basic human rights. Among the most glaring examples of such violations is the plight of Kashmiris under Indian illegal occupation, where systematic oppression and abuses continue unabated. The UDHR is a guiding beacon for equality and justice, enshrining fundamental rights such as life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, the right to work and education, and freedom of opinion and expression. Available in over 500 languages, it is the most translated document globally, symbolizing its universal relevance and importance. The 2024 Human Rights Day theme, 'Our Rights, Our Future, Right Now,' underscores the urgency of securing these rights for all, as they form the foundation of a just and equitable future. Kashmir, under Indian illegal occupation, presents a stark contrast to the ideals proclaimed in the UDHR. Since 1989, Indian security forces have reportedly committed widespread human rights violations in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K). According to the Kashmir Media Service, these atrocities include the killing of 96,382 individuals, 7,369 custodial deaths, and the arrest of 172,464 civilians. Moreover, the destruction of over 110,521 structures, the widowing of 22,980 women, the orphaning of 107,974 children, and the gang-rape or molestation of 11,265 women illustrate the depth of the suffering endured by Kashmiris. Indian forces have used pellet guns, resulting in injuries to 3,800 individuals, symbolizing a regime of state-sponsored violence. The draconian security laws, including the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (1978), the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (1990), and the Prevention of Terrorism Act (2002), grant Indian security personnel unchecked powers to detain, torture, or even kill unarmed civilians with impunity. These laws embolden the perpetrators, ensuring that accountability remains a distant dream for the victims of IIOJ&K. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released reports in 2018 and 2019 documenting grave human rights violations in Kashmir and recommending the establishment of a commission of inquiry. However, these calls have largely gone unheeded, as geopolitical and economic considerations overshadow the pursuit of justice. The systematic suppression of human rights in Kashmir is part of a broader pattern of abuses within India. Religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits, face increasing marginalization and violence. Under the guise of nationalism, discriminatory laws and policies perpetuate an apartheid-like state where equality and justice are elusive. This stark contradiction between India’s democratic ideals and its ground realities highlights its failure to uphold the principles enshrined in the UDHR. India’s actions reflect a troubling trend where economic and strategic interests of global powers, particularly the United States and the European Union, often overshadow their commitment to human rights. The deafening silence in international policymaking circles regarding India’s human rights abuses raises questions about the moral compass of major powers. Human rights, a cornerstone of Western advocacy, seem to falter when confronted with monetary or geopolitical considerations. Human Rights Day serves as a reminder that protecting human dignity is a shared global responsibility. The international community, particularly influential powers like the U.S. and the EU, must prioritize human rights over economic and strategic alliances. Advocacy for the protection of minorities in India and the oppressed Kashmiris in IIOJ&K must move beyond mere rhetoric to tangible actions. Failure to do so risks eroding the credibility of the global human rights framework and emboldening violators. The silence of major powers in the face of gross human rights violations undermines the universality of the UDHR. By turning a blind eye to these atrocities, the world inadvertently sends a message that economic gains and strategic alignments take precedence over human dignity. This contradiction not only weakens the moral authority of these nations but also emboldens regimes to continue their oppressive practices without fear of reprisal. On this Human Rights Day, the world must reflect on the values that bind humanity together and act decisively to uphold them. Advocacy groups, civil society, and individual citizens must amplify their voices to demand accountability for human rights abuses. The plight of Kashmiris and other oppressed communities must not be relegated to the periphery of global discourse. Instead, it should serve as a rallying point for collective action. The UDHR was a visionary document that promised dignity, equality, and justice for all. To honor its legacy, the global community must confront the challenges that hinder its realization. This requires transcending economic interests and geopolitical calculations to prioritize humanity and justice. Human Rights Day is more than a commemoration; it is a call to action for individuals, communities, and nations. As the world marks this significant day, it must confront the stark reality that millions, like the Kashmiris in IIOJ&K, are denied the rights proclaimed in the UDHR. Upholding these rights requires unwavering commitment from all stakeholders. Only by ensuring justice, equality, and freedom for all can we truly honor the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and secure a future where humanity thrives in dignity and peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cSYmEnCHkSAu	2024-12-10T09:19:14-08:00	
Africa Must Prepare For Trump’s Comeback – Analysis	By Emmaculate A Liaga and Zenge Simakoloyi President Joe Biden’s recent trip to Angola – the first state visit by a United States (US) president in nine years – has highlighted America’s renewed engagement with Africa. But as Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, questions arise about the future of US-Africa relations, and whether this engagement will continue. Trump’s first term, characterised by an inward-focused ‘America First’ agenda, showed the need for Africa to recalibrate its strategies – particularly in key geopolitical and security engagements. Several critical issues at bilateral, regional and continental levels will be impacted by his second-term policies and the priorities of his inner circle. Trump’s return presents African countries with an opportunity to take a proactive stance in shaping their political and economic relations with the US and developing resilient strategies instead of reacting to shifting US policies. Key bilateral relationships, particularly between the US and South Africa, are expected to shift – stemming from US opposition to South Africa’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) case against Israel over Gaza, and the country’s close ties with China and Russia. Trump’s first term showed the need for Africa to recalibrate its geopolitical and security strategies In particular, South Africa’s neutral position on the Russia-Ukraine war will be a point of tension in a second Trump presidency. The president is also opposed to South Africa’s growing partnership with China, which is amplified by China’s efforts to direct global trade away from the US and BRICS’ attempt at de-dollarisation, a move criticised by Trump. Notable figures in Trump’s camp will also likely affect US-South Africa relations. For example, Senator Marco Rubio, the presumptive Secretary of State and a strong critic of China condemned South Africa’s decision to downgrade Taiwan’s embassy. Trump’s pick for UN Ambassador, Elise Stefanik, was part of a petition condemning South Africa’s ICJ case against Israel, calling it an attempt to ‘demonize’ Israel. Michael Waltz led a push to reviewUS-South Africa ties, a move Biden resisted, but with Waltz as Trump’s pick for National Security Advisor, it could gain momentum. South Africa assumed the G20 chair on 1 December and will host the 2025 Johannesburg summit. The country now faces a dual challenge of maintaining neutrality while addressing growing geopolitical divisions – seeking to build consensus among G20 members and an expanded BRICS group while managing a more isolationist US under Trump’s leadership. This also presents an opportunity for Pretoria to spotlight African priorities on the global stage, especially with the African Union (AU), now a full member of the G20. With the US succeeding South Africa as chair, this transition could pave the way for a possible Cyril Ramaphosa-Trump engagement within the year, offering a critical window for dialogue and potential recalibration of relations. In East Africa, Kenya’s newly elevated status as a major non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (MN-NATO) ally could offer Nairobi some bargaining chips in the international space. Despite Trump’s America First policy and negative views on NATO, he may temper his approach by focusing on strategic bilateral partnerships with MN-NATO allies, like Kenya. Key bilateral relations in Africa, particularly between the US and South Africa, are expected to shift The new US administration will probably continue its security relations in East Africa and the Horn – largely due to Rubio’s visit to Kenya and Somalia in 2019, part of a bipartisan oversight mission for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Furthermore, because of the declining US security influence in West Africa, resulting from successive coups and the subsequent expulsion of US troops from Niger, maintaining the security partnership with Kenya is expected to remain a priority. And given the Kenya-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission in Haiti, US-Kenya bilateral engagements might move the needle towards securing commitment to America’s over US$300 million funding pledge to the mission. Although this would be a tall order given the Trump camp’s reluctance to fund the UN, and peacekeeping in particular – despite the US proposing the resolution to replace the Kenyan-led MSS with a UN mission. Trump’s preference is for strategic partners to take up more of the burden without the US overextending its resources – so Kenya must look beyond the US for support. On the regional front, perhaps the most contentious area is the Horn of Africa. The controversial Project 2025 document of proposals produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation chapter on the State Department includes the recognition of Somaliland as a hedge against China’s growing influence in Djibouti. This aligns with former Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Tibor Nagy, who served in Trump’s first term and advocated for its recognition. Although denied by Trump, Project 2025 is predominantly written by key former Trump officials, including the State Department chapter author, Kiron K Skinner. Supporting this are optimistic statements of Somaliland recognition from former UK defence secretary Gavin Williamson after discussions with Trump’s policy leads. This could complicate US-Somalia and US-Ethiopia relations, as it will intensify brewing tensions over Ethiopia’s Red Sea access deal with Somaliland, much to the chagrin of Somalia, which has sought alliances with Egypt and Eritrea to counter them. Whether this is followed through will be crucial in determining the success of the AU’s Ethiopia-Somalia mediation efforts. Momentum for UNSC reform in Africa’s favour will unlikely increase under Trump’s second term On a continental level, how the US responds to United Nations Security Council (UNSC) reform proposals will matter to Africa. Current UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield has expressed support for Africa securing a permanent seat (albeit without veto) on the UNSC. Will the Trump administration continue this momentum? Given Trump’s first-term attempts at defunding the UN and preference for bilateral over multilateral relations, momentum for UNSC reform in Africa’s favour will unlikely increase under Trump’s second term. Regardless, Africa must address its internal divisions on how the two seats outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus will be allocated. A more consequential area facing US-Africa relations would be the US’s position and contribution to UNSC Resolution 2719, a mechanism designed to fund AU-led peace support operations (PSOs). America is the largest contributor to UN PSOs, at 27% of the 2023-24 US$6.1-billion budget. Within months of Trump’s first term, the US successfully lobbied to reduce the UN peacekeeping budget by US$600million, although they aimed for an initial US$1billion reduction. Although the resolution will be maintained, the case-by-case basis on which authorisation must be supported might present a significant challenge for Africa. UNSC discussions on implementation of 2719 in Somalia, for example, attract a strong negative US pushback. Whether Trump maintains America’s renewed focus on Africa will depend on aligning US and African interests – despite their diversity – and Washington’s push to counter Russia and China’s growing influence. Regardless of the US’s policy trajectory, Africa must be prepared.

The Rise Of The ‘Gators’ And Its Implications For The Indo-Pacifi...	By Jaehan Park (FPRI) -- The American people chose former president Donald J. Trump once again. For the rest of the world, the most important question is what Trump’s foreign policy will be like in his second term. Often described as 'isolationist' by pundits, his foreign policy views hew more closely to 'Jacksonianism'—a populist foreign policy named after the seventh president that is largely transactional, somewhat aloof yet, at times, heavy-handed—and the record of his first term somewhat vindicates this judgment. There are some similaritiesbetween the returning president and Andrew Jackson himself, such as their penchant for tariffs, 'don’t tread on me' quality, and distrust for the elite. Yet there is another trend one can glimpse from the composition of the Trump administration 2.0. Whether out of political expediency, strategic deliberations, or mere coincidence, the president-elect announced that several individuals from his adopted state of Florida would assume key roles in his administration. Of importance, from the president on down, key national security posts will be filled with Floridians—most notably Senator Marco Rubio as the Secretary of State and Representative Michael Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Hence, the rise of the 'Gators.' These appointments, in my view, will manifest as a certain kind of Jacksonianism: a focus on their own continent, the Americas. Unlike their predecessors who cut their teeth in the executive branch in Washington, DC, these individuals are from the legislature, which interacts directly with voters who are in turn affected by local geographies. And if, as historian Walter McDougall observed, statespersons’ geographic perceptions have shaped history, these individuals’ own outlook on American geography, informed by these experiences, will likely shape their own perspectives, knowingly or not. Not only is Florida much more conservative than the bicoastal regions where the traditional foreign policy elite comes from—Floridians are also more concerned with hemispheric issues than Eurasia. And this may have important foreign policy ramifications. *** The fledgling United States took over what is now Florida from the Spanish Empire in 1819. From the outset, the Florida peninsula was of interest to American statesmen due to its location as a gatekeeper to the Gulf of Mexico. For instance, Thomas Jefferson entertained the idea of purchasing it along with New Orleans. After the Louisiana Purchase, the border between the young republic and the erstwhile Spanish holding became unstable due to frequent skirmishes between the American settlers and the Seminole Indians. In response, Washington ordered Andrew Jackson, then commander of the southern district, to take 'necessary measures.' Jackson took the opportunity to not only crush the invaders, but also expel European powers who were backing them—the Spaniards and, to a lesser extent, the Brits—for good. The resultant annexation of Florida coincided with the period during which the burgeoning republic under the stewardship of James Monroe and John Quincy Adams pursued a strategy to undermine European powers’ influence in the Western Hemisphere—most notably exemplified by the Monroe Doctrine. Incidentally, Jackson was appointed as the first military governor of Florida. The annexation of Florida in effect secured the southeastern flank of the United States. More importantly, as geographer Donald Meinig described, this new territory brought attention to Cuba—a key Spanish holding in the Caribbean. Thereafter, Cuba became a thorny issue in the debate over American foreign policy since the mid-19th century. By the end of that century, the United States resolved the issue by expelling the Spaniards from the Caribbean for good. In 1898, the Spanish-American War broke out over the explosion, supposedly caused by the Spaniards, of USS Maine harbored at Havana to protect American citizens and properties on the island amidst a civil war that had been going on between the Spanish colonists and the indigenous population of Cuba. The Spanish-American War was an important milestone in the history of American foreign relations. During the war, the difficulty of moving ships between the Atlantic and the Pacific became pronounced, which rekindled the debate over the isthmus canal and ultimately resulted in Theodore Roosevelt’s support of Panamanian independence from Colombia several years later. Most importantly, although America’s initial casus belli was the emancipation of Cubans who had been persecuted under Spanish rule, the war in the Caribbean ultimately led to America’s involvement in the Far East by way of the annexation of the Philippines. It also acquired a set of islands leading to the erstwhile Spanish holding: Hawaii, Guam, and Wake Atoll. Previously, American concerns in the Pacific had been mostly commercial. With the annexation of the Philippines, however, Americans now had territorial and security stakes in the region. In other words, the control of Florida and its adjacent seas laid the foundation for America’s rise as a global power and its involvement with the broader world—especially what is now called the Indo-Pacific. *** Often, major foreign policy debates revolve around which frontier the country should focus on. In our time, the Republicans are split among three groups: libertarian-isolationists, or 'restrainers,' who favor a much reduced presence around the globe; 'primacists'—more commonly known as neoconservatives—who advocate for a continued forward presence in all three key regions of Eurasia (Europe, the Middle East, and Asia); and finally, the self-described realists who are calling for concentration of efforts on the Indo-Pacific front—hence the moniker 'prioritizers.' What all these groups share—perhaps with the exception of the first one—is their focus on Eurasia; the Western Hemisphere, in contrast, has been put on the back burner in recent years. While neglect of the Americas might have made sense given the benign circumstances in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, the geopolitical situation is calling for a rethink. America’s southern border is increasingly porous, through which illegal immigrants as well as deadly substances, such as fentanyl, flow. Drug cartels are not only bringing in narcotics, but also engaging in other heinous crimes, such as arms dealing and human trafficking. Aside from these nontraditional issues, hostile great powers have taken advantage of America’s neglect to exert influence in the region. For instance, Moscow signed a set of agreements with Caracas earlier this month, strengthening cooperation on intelligence and energy fronts. Similarly, Iran has maintained security ties with the region, either directly or vicariously through Hamas. Most importantly, China has been operating spy stations in Cuba and making significant investments in the rest of the region—exemplified most recently by the funding of a billion-dollar, deep-water port in Peru. The state of Florida is exposed to Latin America and the Caribbean more than the bicoastal regions—especially the Acela corridor and the Bay Area, which have deeper ties with Europe and Asia. For instance, South/Central America and the Caribbean were Florida’s largest market in 2023; in contrast, Asia was the largest market for both California and New York. In terms of population, Hispanics represent almost 30 percent of Florida’s population—far above the national level (approximately 20 percent). Unlike elsewhere, where Mexicans constitute the majority, however, Hispanics of Cuban origin account for the largest portion in Florida. Not surprisingly, their views are very different—more conservative than their southern brethren, if you will. Given their number, this has state-wide effects; in fact, Florida is more conservative than the rest of the country. *** Seen in this light, the rise of the 'Gators' may be hinting at the possibility of a change in America’s policy in the Western Hemisphere. Senator Marco Rubio’s anti-communist stance, originating in part from his Cuban-American background, and its possible consequences on America’s Latin America policy are widely discussed. Representative Michael Waltz was one of the lawmakers who introduced the bill to deploy U.S. military to root out drug cartels in Mexico; he has advocated for an 'updated Monroe Doctrine' in the Western Hemisphere to deal with cartels, energy security, and Chinese influence. It should be noted that his wife and fellow Floridian, Julia Nesheiwat, served as the homeland security advisor in the first Trump administration. Susie Wiles, Trump’s top campaign manager and chief of staff nominee, has deep ties with Florida politics, which may result in additional nominations of Floridians. The president-elect himself has made the southern border front and center of his campaign agenda; also, he was very critical of the Clinton administration’s attempt to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba. He reversed much of the Obama administration’s Cuba policies during his first term. What are foreign policy implications of the rise of the 'Gators'? First, the Western Hemisphere will figure more prominently in American foreign policy. This is truer given that hemispheric issues permeate domestic, economic, and foreign policies. The president-elect’s threat to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico to stop the influx of migrants and narcotics may prove to be an opening salvo of more heavy-handed approach in the Americas. Second, relatedly, this may at times result in rocky situations—for instance, between Washington and Mexico City. On the other hand, America might have an opportunity to make supply chains more secure, especially the sourcing of critical minerals or the production of semiconductors. More often, however, the result will be mixed. On Venezuela, for instance, the new administration will have to strike a delicate balance of interests concerning energy, strategic diplomacy, and migration. Even the author of The Art of the Deal will have to settle for less at times. Third, this focus on hemispheric issues, combined with America’s increasingly limited resources as well as the president-elect’s penchant for dealmaking, may result in America’s 'deprioritization' of less important regions. As of this writing, the U.S. national debt has reached approximately $35 trillion, out of which over $1 trillion were spent to cover interest payments—exceeding its defense budget earmarked at slightly over $800 billion. While brighter military minds will disagree, the new administration might want to tie loose ends on economic grounds. In fact, in his recent interview, Waltz already hinted that the incoming Trump administration would focus on the Western Hemisphere after quickly settling the ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. After all, no power can exert influence abroad without having secure peripheries. Looking at the Indo-Pacific, this may present both challenges and opportunities. While both Senator Rubio and Representative Waltz have been known as 'China hawks,' this does not mean that they would be easy on America’s regional allies crucial to deterring China. In fact, they may demand more financial, military, or other contributions, reflecting their principal’s well-known complaints about allied band-wagoning. That is, America’s allies may now have to turn their attention to the Americas to find ways to help the United States deal with these hemispheric issues, while taking on larger military roles in their respective theaters. Even so, they should confront the reality that America remains the best guarantor of their security and prosperity—at least better than the alternatives. And now it has problems in its own neighborhood. In the age of the 'Gators,' therefore, U.S. allies across the Indo-Pacific would do well to keep in mind the old adage: 'A friend in need is a friend indeed.'

The Keynesian Liquidity Trap Fable – Analysis	By Frank Shostak Many economists wrongly assume economic activity is accurately presented as a circular flow of money. Spending by one individual becomes part of the earnings of another individual; spending by another individual becomes part of the first individual’s earnings. Assuming this, recessions are because individuals—for whatever psychological reasons—have decided to cut down on their expenditure and raise their savings. For instance, if some individuals have become less confident about the future, they are likely to lower their outlays and 'hoard' (save) more money. Therefore, once individuals spend less, this will necessarily worsen the situation of some other individual, who, in turn, also cuts his spending. A vicious cycle, therefore, sets in—the decline in an individual’s confidence causes him to spend less and to 'hoard' more money; this lowers economic activity further, thereby causing individuals to 'hoard' more, etc. Following these faulty assumptions, in order to prevent a recession from getting out of hand, the central bank must expand the money supply and aggressively lower interest rates. Once individuals have more money in their pockets, it is believed, their confidence will increase and they will start spending again, thereby reestablishing the 'circular flow' of money. On the other hand, a situation could emerge when aggressive lowering of interest rates by the central bank could bring rates that could not decline further. As a result, the central bank will not be able to revive the economy. This situation is labeled as a 'liquidity trap.' Allegedly, the liquidity trap could occur because individuals might adopt a view that the interest rates have bottomed out and that the interest rates should subsequently rise, leading to capital losses on bond holdings. As a result, individuals’ demand for money would become extremely high, implying that individuals would 'hoard' money and refuse to spend it no matter how much the central bank tries to expand the money supply. Most experts are of the view that once a low-interest-rate policy becomes ineffective, monetary authorities should step in and spend. The spending can be on any and all sorts of projects. What matters here is that a lot of money must be pumped through inflation of money and credit. This is expected to boost consumer confidence. With the hoped-for higher level of confidence, consumers are likely to lower their savings and raise their expenditure, thereby reestablishing the 'circular flow' of money. Does the 'liquidity' trap emerge because of the lack of consumer spending? According to some popular thinking, the ever-expanding monetary flow is key for economic prosperity—what drives economic growth is spending. When individuals spend more of their money, this implies they save less. Conversely, when individuals reduce their monetary spending, they save more. Saving is supposed to be bad news for the economy—the more individuals save, the worse things become. The 'liquidity trap' comes from too much saving and the lack of spending, according to this theory. Observe, however, that individuals do not ultimately pay with money, but rather with goods that they have produced. The chief role of money is to fulfill the role of the medium of exchange. Hence, the demand for goods is constrained by the production of goods and not by the amount of money as such. (The role of money is to facilitate the exchange of goods). To suggest that people could have an almost-unlimited demand for money—leading to unlimited savings and a 'liquidity trap'—would imply that no one would be exchanging goods. Obviously, this is not a realistic proposition, especially given the fact that individuals require goods to support their continued existence. Being the medium of exchange, money can only assist in exchanging the goods of one producer for the goods of another producer. The medium-of-exchange service that money provides has nothing to do with the production of consumer goods as such. What permits the increase of these goods is production, saving, and accumulation of capital goods. With more capital goods (i.e., tools and machinery), individuals’ ability to produce goods of greater quantity and quality more efficiently increases. A so-called 'liquidity trap' does not emerge in response to consumers’ large increases in the demand for money, but comes as a result of expansionary monetary policies, which inflict damage and distort production, savings, and the capital structure. The 'Liquidity Trap' and the Shrinking of Savings As long as the growth rate of savings stays positive, this can continue to sustain productive and consumptive activities. Trouble erupts when, because of expansionary monetary policies, a structure of production emerges that ties up much more producer and consumer goods than the amount it creates and maintains. Excessive consumption relative to the production of capital and consumer goods leads to a decline in savings and capital. This, in turn, weakens the support for individuals that are employed in the various stages of the production structure, resulting in the economy plunging into a slump. Once the economy falls into a recession because of a declining savings and capital investment, any central bank attempts to revive the economy through further inflation will fail. Not only will these attempts fail to revive the economy, these attempts are going to deplete savings and distort the capital structure further, thereby prolonging the economic slump. The shrinking genuine savings and capital investment exposes the erroneous nature of the commonly-accepted view that expansionary monetary policies can grow an economy. The fact that central bank policies become ineffective in reviving the economy is not due to the 'liquidity trap.' Rather, this decline emerges due to previous expansionary monetary policies. The ineffectiveness of inflationary monetary policy to generate the illusion that the central banks can grow the economy has nothing to do with the 'liquidity trap.' The ineffectiveness is always present whenever the central authorities are attempting to 'grow the economy.' The only reason why it appears that these policies 'work' is because savings are still expanding during that period. Monetary Liquidity and the Stock Market When money supply increases, it enters various markets, including the stock market. Whenever new money enters a particular market, it means that now we have a greater amount of money per unit of goods in that market. A price of a good is the amount of money per good or per asset. Hence, all other things being equal, an increase in money supply results in an increase in the prices of goods. For a given amount of money, the value of stocks is going to be determined by the real wealth produced and expected by various activities that stocks represent. With the expansion and the enhancement of the infrastructure (i.e., capital goods) more wealth and hence a greater economic growth emerges. When the central bank tampers with money supply, however, this misleads investors. They perceive the increase in money as the increase in wealth. This, in turn, causes them to push the stock market prices higher. As long as savings are still expanding, the central bank’s expansionary monetary policies are driving the stock market higher. Once savings start to decline and/or the central bank contracts monetary policy, the stock market follows suit. In this sense, the attempt by the central bank to counter the 'liquidity trap' prolongs the economic slump and the bear market in stocks. Conclusion Contrary to much popular thinking, if the US economy were to fall into a so-called 'liquidity trap,' the reason for this is not a strong increase in the demand for money, but because previous expansionary monetary policies have depleted savings and distorted the structure of production.

A One-Time ICC Advocate Recants – OpEd	We are fast approaching the five-year anniversary of the pandemic outbreak that began my disillusionment with the United Nations system of which I had been a lifelong devotee both as a professor and a senior insider. My book The United Nations, Peace and Security was published by Cambridge University Press in 2006 with a revised and updated second edition in 2017 and has more than 1,000 Google Scholar citations. Its concluding chapter brought together the various threads of the previous thematic chapters to argue that the UN’s challenge was to reconcile realism with idealism, the world in which it actually operates with the idealised vision of a better world towards which humanity strives. The World Health Organisation betrayed both realism and idealism in its performance as the global lead authority on responding to the novel coronavirus in 2020. It trampled on core human rights principles and may actually have caused more long-term public health harms around the world than it helped to avert and mitigate. A second consequence of the disenchantment was to look afresh at the science and data behind the global warming-cum-climate change agenda, the reliance on assumptions-driven modelling, the fear porn, the multitude of failed alarmist predictions, and the strenuous efforts to silence, suppress, censor, and defund contrarian and dissenting research and voices. In both agendas, moreover, governments and international organisations have colluded with rent-seeking enterprises to coerce and shame people into changing behaviour to align with elite policy priorities, hypocritical elites broke the very rules they imposed on the public, economic costs were borne mainly by the less well-off while the wealthy profited from generous public subsidies and transfer of risks to the taxpayer, and poor peoples and countries have been further impoverished. Now comes the third leg of the disillusionment with regard to the institutions of international criminal justice, where too the conceit of professional international elites and technocrats is leading them into appropriating powers of sovereign states to make calculated policy trade-offs. To understand why, we need to go back almost 20 years to the time when the inaugural Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued the first dramatic arrest warrant for a sitting head of state. Will it prove a case of three strikes and you are out with respect to global governance? Looking Back at 2005–08: The First Prosecutor In retelling the first case, I draw entirely on two publicly accessible documents, even today, on the websites of the ICC itself and the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) which is a specialised agency of the UN. It was set up in 1946 as the successor to the Administrative Tribunal of the League of Nations established in 1927. The 7-judge ILO Tribunal adjudicates more than 150 employee-employer conflicts annually involving 60 intergovernmental organisations, including the ICC, covering around 60,000 international civil servants. In Judgment No. 2757 handed down in Geneva on Wednesday 9 July 2008, the Tribunal ruled on an appeal by the ICC Public Information Adviser Christian Palme of Sweden against summary dismissal by the first ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo. The bulk of the judgment, as we shall see shortly, was not favourable to the prosecutor or to the ICC judges. On Thursday, Moreno-Ocampo issued a statement, reported by the Washington Postand PBS on Friday, that he would be submitting a request for an arrest warrant against Sudan’s President Omar Hassan al-Bashir. He duly did so on Monday 14 July. The ICC issued the warrant on 4 March 2009. Regardless of the prosecutor’s motivations and calculations which we have no way of determining, the coincidence of the proximity of timing meant that news of the first head of state facing the prospect of arrest by the ICC-dominated news coverage and the ILO finding was lost in the noise. The Timeline The ILO judgment begins with a bare-bones timeline of events. On 20 October 2006, Palme submitted an internal complaint to the ICC president accusing the prosecutor of ‘serious misconduct…by committing the crime of rape, or sexual assault, or sexual coercion, or sexual abuse against [a named individual] and that for this reason he should be removed from Office.’ Note that the ILO does not name Palme, identifying him merely as a 52-year-old Swede who joined the ICC on 6 June 2004 and a year later was promoted to the position of Public Information Adviser. Not only does this make it relatively simple to figure out who the person is. In fact he is identified by name in a 2009 article by two respected Africa experts Julie Flint and Alex de Waal that is available from the ICC’s website directly, as the first document in Annex 1. Returning to the ILO document, a panel of three ICC judges was set up to look into the complaint. On 8 December the ICC informed Palme that it had accepted the panel’s finding that his complaint was manifestly unfounded. Palme had submitted an audio recording of a telephone conversation between the alleged victim and an ICC colleague [Yves Soroboki] as supporting evidence. The ICC demanded all copies of the recording to be handed over for destruction. On 23 January 2007, the ICC’s HR section head wrote to Palme that he was being placed on a three-month suspension while the prosecutor’s complaint against him of serious misconduct was investigated. A follow-up letter on 16 March informed Palme that the prosecutor was considering dismissal. On 13 April Palme was told in a letter dated the 11th that he had been summarily dismissed. On 1 May Palme appealed to the internal Disciplinary Advisory Board alleging procedural and substantive flaws in the dismissal. The board requested and was given a copy of the panel’s report with an accompanying advisory that it was confidential. However, the board was asked to inform both Palme and Moreno-Ocampo that no findings of bad faith or malicious intent had been made against Palme. The board informed both parties of this on 26 May. On 18 June the board unanimously ruled that the dismissal was procedurally flawed and had also failed to establish the substantive charge of ‘obvious malicious intent.’ Accordingly, it called for the summary dismissal decision to be rescinded. On 13 July the prosecutor rejected the board’s recommendation and reconfirmed the summary dismissal of Palme. Palme then submitted an appeal to the ILO repeating his complaint of lack of due process and arbitrary dismissal and added that the prosecutor’s rejection of the board’s unanimous recommendation demonstrated the retaliatory nature of his dismissal. He urged the ILO Tribunal to quash the impugned decision and award material damages. The Tribunal’s Decision In the decision summarised at the end on p. 7 of the judgment, the Tribunal ‘set aside’ the prosecutor’s decisions of 11 April (Palme’s dismissal) and 13 July (rejecting the board’s recommendation); awarded Palme salary compensation worth the time that had remained in his contract plus a repatriation grant and other benefits payable when an employee separates from the organisation, plus 5 percent annual interest on these amounts; material damages amounting to two years of salary plus relevant allowances; moral damages; and costs. The total value of the monetary compensation came to €248,000. The reasoning behind the Tribunal’s conclusions is especially interesting. The court (not the prosecutor) had contended that it had separately interviewed the alleged victim and the prosecutor and both had ‘unambiguously denied’ the charge of rape. The Tribunal responded that Palme had alleged an act of ‘rape, or sexual assault, or sexual coercion, or sexual abuse,’ to which end the prosecutor had taken the alleged victim’s car keys and refused to return them until she consented to sexual intercourse (p. 3, consideration 2). The Disciplinary Board seems to have concluded there was no rape because force was not used (p. 4, consideration 10). Palme had not alleged the use of force, but rather that the journalist had consented to sexual intercourse in order to regain her car keys that had been taken by the prosecutor. He had submitted an audio recording in evidence in which the female journalist ‘sounded distressed and denied that she had been forced to have sexual intercourse but did not deny that she had consented in order to regain possession of her keys’ (consideration 3). The Board did not at any stage consider the precise factual allegation made by the complainant; namely, that the alleged victim had consented to sexual intercourse in order to regain possession of her keys (p. 4, consideration 7). The Tribunal noted that if a complainant makes a statement believing it to be true on reasonable grounds then, even if the statement turns out to be false, it does not meet the threshold of serious misconduct (consideration 9). Palme made the complaint based on information from a colleague whose admittedly ‘secondary evidence’ ‘may have been probative in criminal proceedings,’ ‘depending on the circumstances.’ Moreover, there was nothing to suggest that the ‘colleague was unreliable or untrustworthy, much less that he was known to be so by the complainant’ (p. 5, consideration 11). In the recorded conversation, the journalist ‘indicated unambiguously that the Prosecutor 'took [her] keys' and that she had consented to sexual intercourse 'to get out of [the situation]'’ (p. 5, consideration 11). Palme had ‘characterised the Prosecutor’s alleged conduct as 'rape, or sexual assault, or sexual coercion or sexual abuse' which, given differing national laws, is tolerably accurate’ (p. 5, consideration 10). Hence ‘it is not correct’ for the ICC to have concluded that ‘the complainant acted '[w]ithout any evidence of relevant probative value'.’ Nor can malice be inferred from his conduct. ‘The protection of the standing of the ICC, a matter in which the complainant had a legitimate interest, is also a proper purpose, as are other purposes such as ensuring observance of the law’ (p. 5, consideration 14). ‘Accordingly, the material on which the ICC relies does not justify a finding that the complainant acted with malicious intent’ (p. 6, consideration 16). Nuanced Initial Support for and of the ICC The 2008 ILO decision has a two-fold relevance to current events. First, it explains why some early advocates of universal international criminal justice who had welcomed the creation of the ICC began to have serious doubts about it. The judgment helped change my mind on the threat-benefit equation regarding the ICC. The arrest warrants against Israel’s PM and former defence minister have turned the 2009 disillusionment into outright opposition. The current Israeli case is all too familiar to observers of Middle Eastern and world affairs. The earlier case is mostly unfamiliar. Writing in the International Herald Tribune on 17 July 2001, I drew a distinction between activists who assert ‘the primacy of justice without borders’ and sceptics who warn of ‘international anarchy if we depart from realpolitik in a state-based system of world order.’ Even though the potential exists for abuse of universal justice ‘for vexatious and vindictive purposes,’ I concluded, the world was moving ‘inexorably from the culture of national impunity of previous centuries to a culture of international accountability more suited to the modern sensibility.’ In an article published in the same paper on 16 August 2002, I warned that with the newly operational ICC, the shift in balance in favour of the prosecution was producing a ‘transformation from protecting the rights of the accused to privileging the case for the prosecution.’ In addition, ‘Criminal law, however effective, cannot replace public or foreign policy.’ Both these articles were published while I was a senior UN official, with the disclaimer that they expressed personal opinions. The third article I wish to recall was published in the Daily Yomiuri (which no longer exists) on 12 July 2007, shortly after I left the UN, but summarising a presentation I made to a group of Japanese MPs just before my separation. Japan’s Parliament was debating ratification of the ICC at the time which did come about and possibly my presentation was helpful to that outcome. I argued that ‘Revulsion at the murder of large numbers of civilians in atrocity crimes has led to a softening of public and governmental support for the norms and institutions that shield the perpetrators of atrocity crimes from international criminal accountability.’ The UN Charter ‘was never meant to be a tyrant’s charter of impunity.’ Even so, international criminal justice still requires ‘sensitive judgment calls…the prosecution of alleged atrocity criminals must be balanced against the consequences for the prospects and process of peace, the need for post-conflict reconciliation and the fragility of international as well as domestic institutions.’ Chapter 5 of The United Nations, Peace and Security, originally published when I was still a senior UN official, is entitled ‘International Crime Justice.’ It analysed ‘the dynamic interaction between law and politics in the search for universal justice.’ I concluded that although the establishment of the ICC marked ‘one of the most significant advances in international law,’ the debates around the effort and negotiations ‘were testimony to a significant division of opinion in the international community.’ Finally, I also oversaw two international projects in collaboration with institutes in the Netherlands and Ireland and co-edited the two resulting books that were published by the United Nations University Press: From Sovereign Impunity to International Accountability: The Search for Justice in a World of States (2004) and Atrocities and International Accountability: Beyond Transitional Justice (2007). Damaging the International Criminal Justice Project Neither the world’s most powerful countries nor those representing the majority of the world’s peoples are party to the ICC statute. Of the ten most populous countries, only three are ICC members: Nigeria, Brazil, and Bangladesh. In the group of sixteen countries with a population of over 100 million, there’s also Mexico, Japan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Non-members comprise 88 percent of the ten most populous and 84 percent of the hundred million population club of countries. As for the group of powerful countries, the only two of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (P5) included among the ICC states parties are France and the UK. Judicial romantics privilege legal processes over every other consideration. This can be problematic in some cases even in domestic systems with well-established rule of law and separation of the different branches of government. Consider the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision (24 June 2022) which overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade decision. Contrary to much of the hysterical immediate reaction, Dobbs did not ban abortion. Rather, it made two important statements. The issue was not one of federal Constitutional power but of state jurisdiction. And it was not a judicial but a political issue, to be resolved by state-by-state political processes. The Court noted that women possess electoral and political power that can be exercised ‘by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office.’ In this context, the court pointed out (pp. 65–66): It is noteworthy that the percentage of women who register to vote and cast ballots is consistently higher than the percentage of men who do so. In the last election in November 2020, women, who make up around 51.5 percent of the population of Mississippi, constituted 55.5 percent of the voters who cast ballots. In effect, the Court concluded that politicising the judiciary to resolve bitterly contested moral beliefs and social policy can increase social conflict. Judges should not be the arbiter of bioethics. Rather, it is for people through their elected representatives to find the appropriate balance between the competing interests of women, the unborn child, and society’s moral compass. Judicial romanticism is fraught with even more risks in international affairs where conflicts are typically resolved through diplomatic negotiations and/or on the battlefield. The absence of world government also means that the World Court and the ICC depend on the UN Security Council for enforcement action. But the P5-dominated Security Council reflects the power structure of 1945 and is dangerously misaligned with the current distribution of power in the real world. It is also the supreme political organ of the UN system. The blowback effects of criminal convictions of state leaders that remain unenforced damage the credibility, authority, and legitimacy of the courts themselves. Bashir never did stand trial at The Hague. The growing African irritation and anger with the ICC culminated in South Africa, despite being an ICC state party, defying its own courts to facilitate the departure of Bashir out of the country. The third India-Africa Forum summit was held in New Delhi from 26–29 October 2015, with 41 of 54 Africa’s heads of government/state in attendance. The summit was among the largest gatherings of African leaders in a foreign country and also the largest diplomatic event in India in over three decades. In an op-ed in the Japan Times on 4 November 2015, I wrote that Bashir’s presence at the India summit ‘was a challenge’ to the ICC and the UN Security Council. ‘Superficially, this signified disrespect for the rule of law. In reality, it is a rebellion against a normative enterprise of international criminal justice being subverted into a political project.’ The challenge to the ICC’s authority has only intensified in the decade since then. President Vladimir Putin, wanted over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, was warmly welcomed on an official visit to ICC member state Mongolia in September. He shook hands with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the BRICS meeting in Kazan, Russia the following month and is expected to travel to India shortly. All 124 ICC member states, including the 27 members of the EU, are legally obligated to arrest Netanyahu should he travel to their country. Ireland, Denmark, and the Netherlands – which hosts the ICC at The Hague – have said they would enforce the arrest warrants. The UK is likely to do so. Germany has said no ‘because of its Nazi history.’ In open defiance of the ICC, PM Viktor Orbán has invited Netanyahu to visit Hungary. Several experts in France and the UK believe that arresting Netanyahu could be illegal under their national laws which confer immunity on the head of government of Israel, a state that is not a signatory to the Rome Statute (1998) that established the ICC. PM Justin Trudeau says Netanyahu will be arrested if he were to come to Canada: ‘We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts…This is just who we are as Canadians.’ Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre, ahead by more than 20 points in the polls, responded that Trudeau should be ‘fired’ for his ‘extreme’ views against ‘the leader of a democratically-elected government…which has been besieged by terrorists and foreign tyrants attacking its land.’ Back in the day, then-Foreign Minister Alexander Downer won the argument in cabinet against PM John Howard and Australia joined the ICC. He believed at the time that sufficient safeguards had been built into the system to prevent malicious and frivolous investigations of democratic leaders of countries with robust rule of law, as is the case in Israel. He too has now concluded that the good faith towards the court has been betrayed. However, today’s Labor PM Anthony Albanese has reiterated that Australia follows the court’s ruling as ‘a point of principle.’ President Joe Biden has condemned the decision as ‘outrageous’ and the US ‘fundamentally rejected’ the call for arrests. Trump’s national security adviser-designate Mike Waltz says the arrest warrants have no legitimacy and the world ‘can expect a strong response to the anti-Semitic bias of the ICC and UN come January.’ On 2 December Trump himself warned of ‘all hell to pay in the Middle East’ if Hamas had not released the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza before he takes office on 20 January. I suspect that, given Trump’s strong antipathy towards the ICC and his earlier sanctions on ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda on 2 September 2020 (lifted by Biden in April 2021), most Western countries will be wary of antagonising him by taking action against Netanyahu. Consequently, the ICC warrants are unlikely to lead to the arrest of either Netanyahu or Gallant anytime soon. Attempts to enforce them almost certainly will attract the hostile attention of Trump after 20 January.

The Real Scandal Of Hunter‘s Pardon – OpEd	Politicians and pundits spent much of last week commenting on President Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter for lying on a federal gun purchase form, failing to pay taxes, and any other offenses he may have committed over the past decade. Much of the controversy is because President Biden repeatedly pledged that he would never pardon his son. Some have also observed that the pardon’s timeline starts the year Hunter Biden joined the board of the Ukraine energy company Burisma. This has led to speculation that President Biden is trying to block any investigation into links between his son’s business dealings and President Biden’s Ukraine policy. What has not been widely discussed is the fact that Hunter Biden may be the only American President Biden has pardoned for violating unconstitutional federal gun and drug laws. Hunter Biden was convicted of lying on federal Form 4473. This is a form Americans must fill out to get federal government 'permission' to purchase a firearm. Specifically, Hunter Biden gave a false answer to the question, 'Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?' The Second Amendment forbids the federal government from limiting the ability of any American to exercise his natural right to own a firearm. Furthermore, federal drug laws are themselves unconstitutional. The Constitution only creates three federal crimes: treason, piracy, and counterfeiting. All other crimes are under the jurisdiction of state and local governments. So, the required use of this form is a constitutional violation of the rights of Hunter Biden and all other Americans who are subjected to it when they seek to obtain a gun. Form 4473 warns Americans that 'the use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under Federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside.' Thus, someone could be prevented from exercising his Second Amendment right because of his activities that are perfectly legal in his state. This turns federalism on its head. Hunter Biden was also convicted of, and pardoned for, tax evasion and the filing of fraudulent tax returns. It is hard for anyone who values liberty to get upset at those who violate the tax laws since the income tax is a form of theft by the government of people’s hard-earned income. An outrage of Hunter Biden’s pardon is President Biden’s hypocrisy. When he served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 1990s, then-Senator Biden played a major role in getting through Congress the Brady Law that created the federal gun purchase background check system that Hunter Biden was convicted of violating. Senator Biden also was a leading drug warrior who led the fight to pass the 1994 crime bill and was a champion of mandatory minimums and other infringements of civil liberties in the name of the war on drugs. President Biden also supported hiring more IRS agents to squeeze more money from taxpayers. Then-Senator Biden wrote large parts of the PATRIOT Act. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden also led the effort to pass the unconstitutional (and disastrous) 'authorization for use of military force' against Iraq. President Biden should spend his last month in office pardoning more Americans for violations of unconstitutional drug and gun laws. This would serve as a small gesture of atonement for a political career spent advocating policies destructive of peace, prosperity, and liberty.

Trump’s 2025 Agenda Trades US Global Leadership For Tariffs – Ana...	By Gary Hufbauer The surprise was not so much Donald Trump’s election in the 2024 US presidential race as Republican victories in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The resulting trifecta will enable Trump to reshape the US role on the world stage, making changes that ripple across the international order. When he takes office on 20 January 2025, Trump can again deploy not only the extensive executive authority conferred on the president by past statutes. He can also pursue new legislation to further his radical economic agenda. Trump seems on course to dismantle four pillars of the Washington Consensus that guided US economic policy before his first election in 2017 — relatively free and non-discriminatory trade, open capital markets, modest budget deficits and an independent central bank. Trump can impose tariffs of any measure, on any country or product through executive orders. During his campaign, Trump advocated a tariff wall of 10 or 20 per cent on all imports on top of existing bound tariffs against all US trade partners, including those with free trade agreements. He also proposed hiking 2019’s partial 19 per cent tariffs to 60 per cent on all imports from China. Shortly after the election, Trump threatened Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent tariffs on all US imports unless they stop fentanyl exports and illegal emigration. He also threatened BRICS with 100 per cent tariffs if they seek an alternative currency to the US dollar. The practical limitation facing Trump is not the scope of executive power but rather the magnitude of domestic political pushback arising from three main sources. The President-elect’s trade policy will be constrained by foreign retaliation against US exports, higher prices on sensitive consumer goods and potential harm to US firms that rely on foreign components. Yet pre-inauguration statements indicate that Trump may frequently use the threat of new tariffs as leverage to extract concessions from foreign partners. The annual US National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers — a document summarising trade concessions that Washington might seek — may foretell the details of Trump’s potential demands. He may allow exceptions for ‘essential’ or price-sensitive products and items dear to important corporate supporters. The tariff wall and its exceptions will create considerable drama, not least at the World Trade Organization. The outcome will be considerably less free trade and extensive discrimination between and against partners. Trump has discarded the notion of mutual gain from trade and instead views commerce as a tool of combat between nations. Among Trump’s long-standing complaints about US economic governance is the size and persistence of US trade deficits — the current account deficit is approximately US$950 billion in 2024. Unlike economists, Trump does not see deficits as the outcome of the internal balance between savings, investment and government spending. He perceives the cause to be unfair foreign trade practices and industrial policies. If the US dollar appreciates due to tariffs and the trade deficit widens, the second Trump administration may seek to devalue the dollar as a remedy. The federal budget deficit reached US$1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024, almost 7 per cent of projected GDP at US$29 trillion. Legislation in 2025 will seek to extend and expand the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Trump wants to slash the corporate tax rate from 21 to 15 per cent and eliminate income tax on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Macroeconomists suggest that Trump’s tax agenda could add US$800 billion to the annual federal deficit even allowing for higher tariff revenue. This stimulus could overheat the already robust US economy. Inflationary pressure and the impact of tariffs on the cost of living would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates — a manoeuvre that Trump rejects. Scarred by its tepid response to incipient inflation in 2021 and 2022, the Federal Reserve will step on the monetary brakes if the economy overheats. Trump could then ask Congress to draft legislation giving the president sweeping powers over the Federal Reserve. These could include the ability to dismiss governors — or to be consulted on monetary policy — potentially eroding the dollar’s preeminent role in world trade and finance. Trump’s aversion to foreign US military involvement may mean that Washington’s alliances no longer guarantee its support against Russian or Chinese aggression. In fact, Trump’s penchant for ‘big deals’ could lead to accommodations with Russia on Ukraine and potentially with China on Taiwan. All told, Trump’s economic and foreign policy playbooks could amount to US abdication of global leadership. Short of global war, a more disruptive outcome is hard to imagine.

When Rights Become Privileges: Is The Constitution Becoming Optio...	Disguising its power grabs in the self-righteous fervor of national security, the Deep State has mastered the art of the bait-and-switch. It works like this: first, the government foments fear about some crisis or threat to national security, then they capitalize on it by seizing greater power and using those powers against the American people. We’ve seen this play out over and over again. The government used its so-called War on Terror to transform itself into a police state. Then the police state used its War on COVID-19 to claim lockdown powers. All indications are that the government’s promised War on Illegal Immigration will be yet another sleight of hand that allows the powers-that-be to engage in greater power grabs while weakening the Constitution. Therein lies the danger of the government’s growing addiction to power. Whatever dangerous practices you allow the government to carry out now—whether it’s in the name of national security or protecting America’s borders or making America healthy again—inevitably, these same practices can and will be used against you when the government decides to set its sights on you. The slippery slope that starts with illegal immigration has all the makings of a thinly veiled plot to empower the government to become the arbiter of who is deserving of rights and who isn’t. That quickly, we could find ourselves navigating a world in which the rights enshrined in the Constitution for all persons living in the United States are transformed into privileges enjoyed only by those whom the government chooses to recognize as legitimate. By persuading the public that non-citizens, particularly illegal immigrants, do not enjoy the same inalienable rights as law-abiding citizens (a fact refuted by the Constitution and every credible legal scholar in the country), the Deep State is leading us down a road in which all rights are transitory. This is how you establish a hierarchy of rights, contingent on whether you belong to a favored political class. Be warned. At such a time as the government is emboldened to flip that switch and appoint itself the ultimate authority on which protected class of individuals gets to enjoy the rights enshrined within the Constitution, the dividing line will not be between legal citizens and illegal immigrants. It will not even be between Republicans and Democrats. Rather, the purpose of that line of demarcation will be to distinguish the compliant, obedient, subservient vassal of the American police state (the so-called Loyalists) from everyone else. We’re almost at that point now. This is how tyranny rises and freedom falls. Here are some of the inherent dangers in allowing the government to become the arbiter of who is deserving of rights: It leads to the erosion of universal rights. The Bill of Rights was designed to protect the fundamental rights of all persons within the United States, regardless of their citizenship status, race, religion, or any other factor. When the government starts making distinctions about who is entitled to these rights, it undermines the universality that makes them so powerful. This creates a slippery slope where rights become privileges, subject to the whims of those in power. It gives rise to authoritarianism. History is replete with examples of governments that consolidated power by first stripping away the rights of marginalized groups. Once the principle of universal rights is breached, it becomes easier to target other groups deemed 'undesirable' or 'unworthy.' This paves the way for authoritarianism, where the government dictates who enjoys freedom and who does not. It creates a two-tiered society. A hierarchy of rights inevitably leads to a two-tiered society, where some individuals enjoy full protection under the law while others are relegated to second-class status. This fosters resentment, division, and social unrest. It also creates a vulnerable population that can be easily exploited and abused. It undermines the rule of law. The rule of law is a fundamental principle of a just society. It means that everyone is subject to the same laws and that no one is above the law. When the government selectively applies the law based on arbitrary criteria, it undermines the rule of law and erodes trust in the legal system. It chills free speech and dissent, i.e., the right to criticize the government. When people fear that their rights are contingent on their political views or social status, they are less likely to speak out against injustice or challenge the government. This chilling effect on dissent stifles free speech and creates a climate of fear and conformity. It contributes to the loss of moral authority. A nation that claims to champion liberty and justice for all loses its moral authority when it denies those principles to certain groups within its borders. This undermines its standing in the world and diminishes its ability to promote human rights abroad. Remember, the erosion of inalienable rights often starts subtly, with the government chipping away at the edges of those rights for specific groups. The pattern is subtle at first, with government officials exploiting fear and prejudice in order to target groups that are already marginalized or perceived as 'outsiders.' Incrementally, the net is cast wider and wider, so that by the time the injustice is widespread enough to inspire outrage in the greater populace, it’s too late to resist. Historic examples abound of how the government has manufactured a blatantly unjust hierarchy of rights in order to diminish certain segments of society. These run the gamut from slavery and the persecution of Native Americans to the Japanese internment camps and segregation. More recently, we’ve seen this tactic deployed in order to justify policies that run afoul of the Constitution, ranging from immigration policies and mass surveillance programs to SWAT team raids, voting rights, and the erosion of due process. Clearly, Martin Niemöller’s warning about the widening net that ensnares us all, a warning issued in response to the threat posed by Nazi Germany’s fascist regime, still applies. 'First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.' This is how the slippery slope to all-out persecution starts. It doesn’t help that growing numbers of American citizens barely know their rights. Consider that only 5% of the U.S. adults surveyed could correctly name all five rights in the First Amendment, 20% could not correctly name any, and less than one in 10 Americans know they have a right to petition the government. Such civic illiteracy lays the groundwork for all manner of tyrannies to follow. After all, how can you defend your rights if you don’t know what those rights are? Then again, civic illiteracy among government officials, who are entrusted with upholding and protecting the Constitution, doesn’t appear to be much better. It was ten years ago on December 15, National Bill of Rights Day, that the U.S. Supreme Court in its 8-1 ruling in Heien v. State of North Carolina gave police in America one more ready excuse to routinely violate the laws of the land, this time under the guise of ignorance. The Heien case, which started with an improper traffic stop based on a police officer’s ignorance of the law and ended with an unlawful search, seizure and arrest, was supposed to ensure that ignorance of the law did not become a ready excuse for government officials to routinely violate the law. It failed to do so. In failing to enforce the Constitution, the Court gave police the go-ahead to justify a laundry list of misconduct, from police shootings of unarmed citizens to SWAT team raids, roadside strip searches, and the tasering of vulnerable individuals with paltry excuses such as 'they looked suspicious' and 'she wouldn’t obey our orders.' Ignorance of the law has become an all-too-convenient cover for all manner of abuses by government officials who should know better. I’m not sure which is worse: government officials who know nothing about the laws they have sworn to uphold, support and defend, or a constitutionally illiterate citizenry so clueless about their rights that they don’t even know when those rights are being violated. This much I do know, however: for anyone to advocate terminating or suspending the Constitution is tantamount to a declaration of war against the founding principles of our representative government and the rule of law. If there is one point on which there should be no political parsing, no legal jockeying, and no disagreement, it is this. Then again, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, one could well make the case that the Constitution has alreadybeen terminated after years on life support, given the extent to which the safeguards enshrined in the Bill of Rights—adopted 233 years ago as a means of protecting the people against government overreach and abuse—have been steadily chipped away at, undermined, eroded, whittled down, and generally discarded with the support of Congress, the White House, and the courts. History provides chilling examples of how quickly rights can vanish, even in a nation such as ours founded on the principles of freedom. As George Carlin astutely observed: 'If you think you do have rights, next time you’re at the computer, get on the internet, go to Wikipedia. When you get to Wikipedia, in the search field for Wikipedia, I want you to type in ‘Japanese Americans 1942’ and you’ll find out all about your precious … rights. In 1942, there were 110,000 Japanese American citizens in good standing, law-abiding people, who were thrown into internment camps simply because their parents were born in the wrong country. That’s all they did wrong. They had no right to a lawyer, no right to a fair trial, no right to a jury of their peers, no right to due process of any kind. The only right they had: ‘right this way’ into the internment camps. Just when these American citizens needed their rights the most, their government took them away. And rights aren’t rights if someone can take them away.' Remember you were warned, folks. At the point that rights become privileges, then the Constitution and the government’s adherence to the rule of law will become optional.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKeJLQaPFxyaH	2024-12-09T17:16:52-08:00	
World’s Top Arms Producers See Revenues Rise On Back Of Wars And ...	Revenues from sales of arms and military services by the 100 largest companies in the industry reached $632 billion in 2023, a real-terms increase of 4.2 per cent compared with 2022. Arms revenue increases were seen in all regions, with particularly sharp rises among companies based in Russia and the Middle East. Overall, smaller producers were more efficient at responding to new demand linked to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, growing tensions in East Asia and rearmament programmes elsewhere. SIPRI Top 100 companies ramp up production and build workforces In 2023 many arms producers ramped up their production in response to surging demand. The total arms revenues of the Top 100 bounced back after a dip in 2022. Almost three quarters of companies increased their arms revenues year-on-year. Notably, most of the companies that increased their revenues were in the lower half of the Top 100. ‘There was a marked rise in arms revenues in 2023, and this is likely to continue in 2024,’ said Lorenzo Scarazzato, a Researcher with the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. ‘The arms revenues of the Top 100 arms producers still did not fully reflect the scale of demand, and many companies have launched recruitment drives, suggesting they are optimistic about future sales.’ US companies’ arms revenues rise, but production challenges remain The 41 companies in the Top 100 based in the United States recorded arms revenues of $317 billion, half the total arms revenues of the Top 100 and 2.5 per cent more than in 2022. Since 2018, the top five companies in the Top 100 have all been based in the USA. Of the 41 US companies, 30 increased their arms revenues in 2023. However, Lockheed Martin and RTX, the world’s two largest arms producers, were among those registering a drop. ‘Larger companies like Lockheed Martin and RTX manufacturing a wide range of arms products often depend on complex, multi-tiered supply chains, which made them vulnerable to lingering supply chain challenges in 2023,’ said Dr Nan Tian, Director of SIPRI’s Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. ‘This was particularly the case in the aeronautics and missile sectors.’ European arms industry trails rest of world in revenue growth The combined arms revenues of the 27 Top 100 companies based in Europe (excluding Russia) totalled $133 billion in 2023. This was only 0.2 per cent more than in 2022, the smallest increase in any world region. However, behind the low growth figure the picture is more nuanced. European arms companies producing complex weapon systems were mostly working on older contracts during 2023 and their revenues for the year consequently do not reflect the influx of orders. ‘Complex weapon systems have longer lead times,’ said Lorenzo Scarazzato. ‘Companies that produce them are thus inherently slower in reacting to changes in demand. That explains why their arms revenues were relatively low in 2023, despite a surge in new orders.’ At the same time, a number of other European producers saw their arms revenues grow substantially, driven by demand linked to the war in Ukraine, particularly for ammunition, artillery and air defence and land systems. Notably, companies in Germany, Sweden, Ukraine, Poland, Norway and Czechia were able to tap into this demand. For instance, Germany’s Rheinmetall increased production capacity of 155-mm ammunition and its revenues were boosted by deliveries of its Leopard tanks and new orders, including through war-related ‘ring-exchange’ programmes (under which countries supply military goods to Ukraine and receive replacements from allies). Wartime production leads to sharp rise in Russian firms’ arms revenues The two Russian companies listed in the Top 100 saw their combined revenues increase by 40 per cent to reach an estimated $25.5 billion. This was almost entirely due to the 49 per cent increase in arms revenues recorded by Rostec, a state-owned holding company controlling many arms producers, including seven previously listed in the Top 100 for which individual revenue data could not be obtained. ‘Official data on Russian arms production is scarce and questionable but most analysts believe that the production of new military equipment increased substantially in 2023, while Russia’s existing arsenal underwent extensive refurbishment and modernization,’ said Dr Nan Tian. ‘In particular, combat aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, tanks, munitions and missiles are all thought to have been produced in greater numbers as Russia continued its offensive in Ukraine.’ South Korean and Japanese companies lead revenue growth in Asia and Oceania The 23 companies in the Top 100 based in Asia and Oceania recorded 5.7 per cent arms revenue growth year-on-year, to reach $136 billion. The four South Korea-based companies recorded a combined 39 per cent increase in arms revenues to reach $11.0 billion. The five companies based in Japan saw their combined arms revenues rise by 35 per cent to $10.0 billion. A policy of military build-up in Japan since 2022 drove a flurry of domestic orders, with some companies seeing the value of new orders increase more than 300 per cent. ‘The sharp growth in arms revenues among South Korean and Japanese companies reflects the bigger picture of military build-ups taking place in the region in response to heightened threat perceptions,’ said Xiao Liang, a Researcher with the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. ‘South Korean firms are also trying to expand their share of the global arms market, including demand in Europe related to the war in Ukraine.’ Middle East arms producers see revenue growth linked to Gaza, Ukraine conflicts Six of the Top 100 arms companies were based in the Middle East. Their combined arms revenues grew by 18 per cent to $19.6 billion. With the outbreak of war in Gaza, the arms revenues of the three companies based in Israel in the Top 100 reached $13.6 billion. This was the highest figure ever recorded by Israeli companies in the SIPRI Top 100. The three companies based in Türkiye saw their arms revenues grow by 24 per cent to $6.0 billion, benefiting from exports prompted by the war in Ukraine and from the Turkish government’s continued push towards self-reliance in arms production. ‘The biggest Middle Eastern arms producers in the Top 100 saw their arms revenues reach unprecedented heights in 2023 and the growth looks set to continue,’ said Dr Diego Lopes da Silva, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. ‘In particular, as well as taking in record arms revenues in 2023, Israeli arms producers are booking many more orders as the war in Gaza rages on and spreads.’ Other notable developments The nine companies in the Top 100 based in China saw their smallest year-on-year percentage increase in arms revenues (+0.7 per cent) since 2019 amid a slowing economy. Their total arms revenues in 2023 reached $103 billion. The combined arms revenues of the three Indian companies in the Top 100 increased to $6.7 billion (+5.8 per cent). NCSIST, the only Taiwan-based company in the Top 100, recorded a 27 per cent increase in its arms revenues to $3.2 billion. Türkiye’s Baykar produces armed uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) that have been widely used in the war in Ukraine. Exports accounted for around 90 per cent of its arms revenues in 2023, which increased by 25 per cent over the year to $1.9 billion. The United Kingdom’s Atomic Weapons Establishment, which designs, manufactures and maintains nuclear warheads, recorded the largest year-on-year percentage increase in arms revenues (+16 per cent) among UK companies in the Top 100, to reach $2.2 billion.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKWrupIZCEG9e	2024-12-09T17:14:00-08:00	
Fico Proposes ‘COVID Amnesty’ And Compensation For Thousands Of S...	(EurActiv) -- Slovakia's Prime Minister, Robert Fico, proposed a measure to forgive misdemeanours related to the COVID-19 pandemic, covering a period spanning 42 months. The intervention has been approved by the government and is currently pending parliamentary approval. The Ministry of Interior will reimburse funds for fines imposed by police officers and district offices and meal expenses charged to individuals placed in quarantine facilities. Fines will also be reimbursed by other institutions that imposed them at the time for violations of anti-pandemic measures, such as regional public health offices, municipalities, and cities. The Ministry's preliminary estimates indicate more than 17,000 invoices for meal expenses in state quarantine facilities and approximately 58,000 records of infractions under the Public Health and Civil Protection Acts. 'First and foremost, it should be noted that it is the government that is authorised, under article 90 of the Misdemeanours Act, to grant amnesty in matters of misdemeanours adjudicated by the authorities of the Slovak Republic,' Slovak Ombudsman Róbert Dobrovodský explained to Euractiv. 'Correcting injustice' The total amount of fines imposed during the delineated COVID-19 period is € 2.7 million, of which around €989 thousand have been paid. The total amount invoiced for meals is above €1.5 million, with invoices amounting to more than €1.36 million already paid. The government also approved an amnesty for all unpaid fines imposed for infractions related to anti-pandemic measures during the entire period when a state of emergency or crisis was declared due to the pandemic. The amnesty also includes an order to halt all ongoing proceedings related to misdemeanours. PM Fico stated that this was the first step toward correcting injustices. 'It was a dark period in terms of the legal order and the violation of human rights,' the PM added. The proposal is expected to cost the state budget €3.3 million, a sum the Prime Minister deems manageable. The validity of leniency Under Article 121 of the Slovak Constitution, the government has the right to grant amnesty in matters of misdemeanours. The government concession is also anchored in the Misdemeanours Act. According to Dobrovodský, similar to the case of granting pardons by the Slovak President, the decision on the scope and recipients of amnesty for misdemeanours granted by the government is exclusively within the government's discretion. 'It is established that, in legal theory, amnesty is granted based on generally defined criteria to an unspecified group of recipients. Legally, therefore, the amnesty meets these criteria,' Dobrovodský added. Amnesty and self-exoneration According to the Ombudsman, the legal doctrine also states that amnesty is often granted in connection with significant historical events. In the case of pardons, this instrument is used to mitigate the severity or injustice of a law. 'Regarding the question of whether a significant historical circumstance has arisen or whether the law was unduly harsh in penalising individuals who violated COVID-19 measures contrary to applicable and effective rules, the government likely assessed this positively, as it decided to grant the amnesty,' he continued. 'Whether this reasoning is correct and based on solid grounds is not for me to judge, especially since the government falls outside the scope of my authority,' Dobrovodský concluded. The compensation could also be claimed by the PM's Smer-SD party, which, while in opposition, violated pandemic measures during a rally in Rimavská Sobota, a town in southern Slovakia, resulting in a €3,000 fine. The practicalities The draft law regulates financial reimbursement for individuals who suffered financial damage due to the implementation of pandemic measures. This includes compensation for fines paid for COVID-19-related infractions committed between March 12, 2020, and September 15, 2023. 'The compensation system itself will be set up as reimbursement of paid amounts, based on the submission of an application by an authorised person along with the relevant documents. Once the draft law is approved, the Ministry of the Interior will make a form available for submitting such applications. The anticipated deadline for submitting applications is August 31, 2025,' the Ministry of Interior said. According to the Ministry, the amounts to be compensated will also include any other verifiable costs incurred by the authorised person in connection with imposing the obligation and executing the decision. For example, expenses related to misdemeanours, court or enforcement proceedings, and late payment interest. If the application is complete and the compensation conditions are met, the Ministry of the Interior will disburse the funds to the eligible persons within 60 days of receiving the full application.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKUTpkk5ejJP-	2024-12-09T17:12:09-08:00	
How Assad’s Fall Threatens Russia’s Military Influence In Syria, ...	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- Nine years ago, a caravan of hulking military cargo planes and aging naval ships began shuttling back and forth from Russian bases depositing a massive expeditionary military force to western Syria, cementing Russia's muscular presence in the Middle East and ultimately saving the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad is now gone, the fate of those bases are now jeopardy, and the question of Russia's entire Middle East strategy is now very much up in the air. The fall of the Assad regime this past weekend was a tectonic event, reverberating across the entire Middle East and further. The Kremlin's 2015 Syria intervention, which scrambled the regional calculus, is now being scrambled yet again as Moscow tries to figure out what to do next. As of December 9, there were no confirmed signs of any Russian pullout from Syria. An unnamed Kremlin official told the TASS state news agency that Russia had reached an agreement to ensure the safety of its military assets in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment to reporters. 'It's still premature to discuss this,' he told reporters. 'However, this will be a topic for discussion with whomever will be in charge in Syria in the future.' Here's what you need to know about Russia's presence in Syria, and what might come next. What, Where, And Who Russia's presence with Syria dates back to Soviet relations with Assad's father, and resulted in a critical asset for Moscow in 1971: naval access to the deep-water Mediterranean port at Tartus. Moscow's attention waned until 2011, when a popular uprising morphed into outright civil war threatening Assad's government. In September 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's largest expeditionary force in decades, if ever, to deploy to Syria to bolster Assad's sputtering efforts to battle rebels and extremist groups. Syria granted Russia a 49-year lease access to Tartus and the air base at Hmeimim. 'The situation was very difficult, both in terms of morale and exhaustion,' General Valery Gerasimov, the chairman of Russia's General Staff, said in an interview published in 2017. 'A lack of ammunition, necessary types of support, command. Our operation began, and after some time we saw the first successes…. Today the Syrian Army is capable of performing tasks to protect its territory.' The following year, after months of relentless air strikes that obliterated cities -- a campaign so ruthless that the commander who ordered it was given the nickname 'General Armageddon' -- Syria's military had the upper hand. Emboldened Russian forces, whose numbers also included private Wagner Group mercenaries, clashed with U.S.-backed forces in eastern Syria in 2018. At the peak of Russia's intervention in Syria, around 2017, as many as 6,000 combat and auxiliary troops were deployed, including mercenary forces, according to estimates by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Most of those ground forces were employed to advise Syria's military, but commanders also deployed Russian artillery and armored units, as well as special forces, to support Syrian infantry, particularly in 2016 during the offensive to retake Aleppo, Syria's largest city. It's unclear how big the current Russian contingent on the ground is. The Telegram channel YeZh estimated 7,000 troops remained in the country. Whither The Warm-Water Port Tartus was a springboard for Russia to project power, not only in Syria throughout the Middle East but into Africa and elsewhere. After 2015, Russia used its Baltic and Black Sea ships extensively to supply the port and transport heavy weaponry and construction equipment. A construction company linked to a Kremlin-allied businessman was awarded a contract in 2019 to manage and expand the port. The port's mooring capacity is as many as 11 vessels, including nuclear-powered ships. Several diesel-electric submarines cycled in and out of the facility and were used to fire Kalibr cruise missiles at Syrian targets. The port's water depth also accommodated larger ships, including the Russian Navy's oft-mocked flagship, the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, which was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean between October 2016 and January 2017. In days prior to the capture of Damascus by Syrian rebel groups, several ships, most of which that had been berthed at Tartus, were spotted heading out to sea, stoking speculation that an evacuation was under way. Тhe Defense Ministry, however, on December 3 released footage of the flotilla firing missiles, saying the maneuvers were a training exercise. 'What Tartus meant for Russia was the ability to project maritime power and political influence relatively uncontested in the Middle East and allowed to punch above its weight,' Fredrik Van Lokeren, a retired Belgian naval officer, wrote in a December 8 blog post. The Russian ships at Tartus might have been utilized to help Russia's operations in the Black Sea, which have also been severely curtailed by innovative Ukrainian tactics. But the warships are barred from transiting Turkey's Bosporus by international treaty. Forced Air Located some 60 kilometers up the coast from Tartus, Russia's air forces have utilized the Hmeimim air base. In addition to hosting fighter jets and helicopters, it's also served as the destination for the massive cargo planes that have shuttled men and materiel in and out of Syria. Russian engineers enlarged the base in 2016-17, lengthening runways and expanding parking capacity. Putin paid an unannounced visit to the base in December 2017, where he declared victory of Syria's rebel forces, whom he called 'terrorists.' 'If the terrorists again raise their heads, we will deal such blows to them as they have never seen,' he said at the time. Russia's air fleet in Syria included more than two dozen Su-24 and Su-25 frontline bombers and ground-attack aircraft, according to a semi-official report published in 2016, along with at least eight advanced Su-30 fighter bombers and 12 Mi-24 and Ka-52 attack helicopters, among others. From September 2015 to January 2018, CSIS estimates, Russian forces flew more than 34,000 combat sorties, with Su-24s and Su-34s serving as the primary strike aircraft. Russian forces also deployed short-range Iskander-M ballistic missiles systems, as well as the sophisticated long-range S-400 air-defense system and short-range defenses like Pantsir and Tor systems. All would have to be shipped out by air or sea. In recent days, commercial satellite imagery has shown the presence of several Ilyushin Il-76 jets -- heavy-lift workhorse cargo planes -- parked on the runways at Hmeimim, suggesting the possibility of the beginning of an evacuation. However, given the amount of weaponry and equipment deployed to Syria and Moscow's reluctance to leave it for Syrian rebels, it would require dozens of flights or sea shipment to remove it all. It will be difficult to hide that, said Dara Massicot, an expert on the Russian military at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. From Latakia To Donbas The best explanation for the dizzying collapse of Assad and his military is the absence of support from Damascus's two strongest allies: Iran and Russia. Where Russia is concerned, the explanation leads to its unrelenting invasion of Ukraine, now in its 34th month with no end in sight. Russia's casualties there have climbed past 600,000, according to Western estimates, and its economy is running at torrid pace, as defense factories rush to keep pace with Ukraine's destruction of weaponry and equipment. That means little spare capacity -- men and material -- to bolster Syria's efforts. The Kremlin may still end up reaching an agreement with the rebel leadership and preserve access to one or both facilities in Syria. If not, however, Russia's ability to project military or economic power will be severely curtailed. The two facilities were a key conduit for covert and overt military supplies in north and central Africa, as well as a conduit for revenues generated in several countries, often under dubious circumstances. That includes places like Libya, where Russian mercenaries and irregular forces fought alongside a renegade Libyan general, Khalifa Haftar, in a 2019 offensive to seize the port of Tripoli. Russia operations have also spread to other troubled African regions like the Central African Republic and Niger. Last July, in Mali, a Russian mercenary force suffered major losses in a battle with Tuareg rebels. Experts say Russia could shift some aviation operations to Libya, about 1,500 kilometers to the southwest across the Mediterranean. But it would be more difficult to fly cargo jets all the way from Russia to Libya loaded down with heavy weaponry -- even assuming Russia could secure overflight rights from Turkey. Russian war bloggers have voiced alarmed about the potential loss of Russian bases in Syria. 'Russia's military presence in the Middle East region hangs by a thread,' Rybar, a blogger with links to Defense Ministry, said in a post on Telegram. 'It is almost impossible to evacuate the bases. In the best case, it is possible to evacuate most of the personnel, documentation and serviceable aircraft,' one prominent blogger, named FighterBomber, said in a Telegram post prior to Assad's fall. 'Some equipment that's still running can be packed into dry cargo ships and landing ships, but of course not all. All the rest of the property will remain at the bases.'

Chinese Electric Vehicle Sales In Indonesia Gain On Japanese Domi...	By Ami Afriatni On the streets of Jakarta and other major Indonesian cities, Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a familiar sight – a sign of their growing appeal in Southeast Asia’s largest auto market. Chinese brands including Wuling, BYD and Chery are making inroads into Indonesia’s auto industry by offering affordability, cutting-edge technology and design, challenging Japanese stalwarts including Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi. Indonesia’s EV infrastructure – including charging stations – remains underdeveloped, but the country’s upper-middle class is not daunted by such challenges, said Syakur Usman, an automotive observer and author of The Automotive Industry in Indonesia. 'These are global-minded consumers who frequently travel abroad and are already familiar with EVs,' he said. Though electric vehicles account for just 5% of Indonesia’s total car sales this year so far, analysts see vast potential in a market of over 270 million people where environmental awareness is on the rise. 'Public acceptance of EVs is steadily increasing,' said Muhammad Nur Yuniarto, executive director of the Automotive Control System Center at the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology in Surabaya. 'Initially, there were concerns about battery durability and reliability, but these have been dispelled as EVs have proven reliable and safe for daily use,' he told BenarNews. While Toyota and Daihatsu still hold the top spots, Chinese sales are increasing. BYD has sold over 11,000 vehicles in Indonesia since deliveries began in July. It rose to sixth place in October, with sales that month reaching 2,488 units, according to data from the Indonesian Automotive Industry Association (Gaikindo). Meanwhile, Wuling Motors reported selling 9,000 EVs in 2023. 'BYD’s success in Indonesia as a market leader is a testament to our commitment to providing high-quality, affordable electric vehicles that meet the needs and preferences of Indonesian consumers,' Eagle Zhao, president director of BYD Motor Indonesia, said in a statement last month. The resurgence of Chinese automakers is striking given their rocky start in Indonesia. Early entries in the 2000s struggled with perceptions of poor quality, causing brands such as Chery and Geely to withdraw. But by 2017, companies including Wuling Motors had returned, making local investments including a U.S. $700 million factory near Jakarta. BYD, meanwhile, is building a $1.3 billion factory in West Java, which is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles annually. In addition, Chinese manufacturers have benefited from government incentives aimed at boosting EV adoption. Policies introduced in 2023, including reduced luxury taxes and import duties, have made EVs more accessible. Chinese automakers now command an 80% share of Indonesia’s EV market. This year, the government issued a regulation exempting import duties on completely constructed electric vehicles, spurring a 347% increase in imports, according to Gaikindo. Domestic parts requirements To boost local manufacturing, the government has ordered that 40% of EV parts be domestically produced by 2026 and 80% by 2030. Officials said this shift is crucial to developing Indonesia’s domestic EV ecosystem, creating jobs and growing the local economy. Syakur, the automotive observer, said Chinese companies have leveraged their extensive manufacturing capabilities to dominate the still developing EV industry in Indonesia. 'They aren’t held back by legacy technologies or hesitation,' Syakur told BenarNews, contrasting this with the approach of Japanese brands, which have been slower to embrace EVs. Japanese brands including Toyota and Honda continue to focus on conventional and hybrid vehicles that combine internal combustion engines with batteries. Last month, a Toyota official said the company is focusing on hybrid vehicles in Indonesia. According to him, consumers preferred hybrids over battery electric vehicles. 'Hybrid vehicles are a vital stepping stone in the transition to electrification,' said Bob Azam, deputy president director of PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia. 'They need support to help bridge the gap between conventional cars and fully electric models,' he added. In 2025, the government is planning a set of tax incentives with a particular focus on hybrid and other types of vehicles, Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said Friday. 'For example, we recently discussed incentives or stimulus for the automotive sector,' Agus told reporters. 'Policies such as luxury goods sales tax and VAT exemptions will be applied not only for electric vehicles but also for hybrids and other types.' Groups like the NGO Walhi have argued that measures to promote EVs such as subsidies and tax incentives fail to address the broader sources of the environmental crisis, including the continued use of coal-fired power plants, industrial emissions and waste-burning practices. The focus on EVs also overlooks impactful solutions such as improving public transportation systems. Competitive pricing Airlangga Hartanto, the country’s top economic minister, urged automakers to make EVs more affordable. 'Prices must become more competitive for the market to absorb them,' Airlangga said this month. China’s Wuling Air EV, priced at around 200 million rupiah ($12,600), caters to the middle class, while the BYD Dolphin at $22,812 and the Chery Omoda E5 at $26,250 attracts wealthier buyers. By contrast, Toyota’s bZ4X and European brands such as BMW remain prohibitively expensive, according to authorities. Bany Akbar, 45, a Jakarta office worker, has owned an Air EV for 18 months. He said he has specific needs including school drop-offs and weekday commutes. 'It’s my second car,' he told BenarNews. 'The price was reasonable, and it suited our needs.'

Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3: Humanity Has A Surprisingly Diverse Und...	Numeracy or numerosity, the ability to think about and use numbers, varies among human cultures and within populations, much like intelligence does. Many known languages, for example, have no words for numerals above 2 or 3. A linguist who curated a database of the world's languages in 2015 estimated that of the 6,880 languages for which there are published data on numerals, 1,093 had a counting system that ends at 2 or 3. Compare that lack of a developed counting system to today's technologically complex societies, where the average person encounters about 1,000 numbers an hour in daily life, as estimated by cognitive neuroscientist Brian Butterworth, professor emeritus at University College London. At a simple level, we keep time, keep a calendar, memorize addresses and phone numbers, and at a more complex level, we calculate interest rates and stock valuations, election vote percentages, temperatures and rain accumulations, missile trajectories, and astronomical relationships. Cultures With Restricted Numeracy What does a culture with a restricted number system look like? Early reports of this came from 16th-century explorers, who described the hunter-gatherer tribes they found, for example, the Taino and Tupinambá in the Americas. Anthropologists later documented hundreds of other societies that only used numbers up to 2 or 3. Today, the Pirahã in Brazil are 'the only known tribe/people whose language and culture appear not to have progressed beyond an analog notion of magnitude, similar to that of higher animals,' an applied mathematician wrote in 2023 in his review of prehistoric mathematics origins. The cultural reason suggested for this is that the Pirahã 'reject the value of future planning and are completely non-materialistic.' Anthropologist Caleb Everett, the son of missionaries who lived with the Pirahã in his youth, describes the tribe as 'cognitively normal and well-adapted' to their environment, with a 'superior understanding' of their river ecology. The Pirahã number about 700 people and live in very small villages along the Maici River, a small tributary of the Amazon. They are semi-nomadic and thus have regular contact with outsiders. A comprehensive 2011 review of Pirahã numeracy described experiments in two Pirahã villages to test whether tribal individuals could match quantities larger than 3, which is where their number system ends. Matching consisted of selecting how many empty rubber balloons would match three spools of thread in various arrangements. Everett and co-author Keren Madora reviewed previous research on the Pirahã and numeracy that had contradictory results about the Pirahã ability to make one-to-one number correspondence for quantities greater than 3. The reason, Everett and Madora suggested, is that the Pirahã have no number words for integers more than 3. They based their conclusion on fieldwork that Madora did with the Pirahã. Madora, who has 30 years of experience speaking the Pirahã language, spent months in one village, and at the request of the Pirahã, taught them basic arithmetic. To do this, she invented words for numbers 4 through 10, based on their existing word for hand. After becoming familiar with the new number words, the research review stated that the Pirahã demonstrated 'heightened performance on the one-to-one matching task.' The researchers concluded that exact recognition of quantities greater than 3 'relies on a culturally constructed conceptual tool, namely precise number terminology, which is not universal to all human societies.' The Brain and Numbers The fact that members of a society with a restricted number system could accurately work with numbers larger than three when adult individuals were taught new words for larger numbers indicates both the importance of a language for numbers and the inherent ability of the human brain to develop. Perhaps there is a capacity for numeracy, whether or not it is developed across all human cultures and within cultures. Studies of the brain and numeracy may provide evidence of whether a capacity for numeracy is universal, even when a language for numbers is not. Today advanced imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other neuro-imaging methods, can help assess the capacity for numeracy by identifying the brain cortex areas and neural networks associated with specific skills in math competence. A 2023 review of the neural bases of math competence proposed that a 'distributed and interconnected network of regions across the brain, primarily focused on frontal and parietal cortices' is key for complex math skills. The frontoparietal area of the brain is generally the control network responsible for coordinating goal-directed tasks. For adolescents with better math ability, the review reported that gray matter volume in the frontoparietal area is important, as is the thinning of the cortex and having a larger frontoparietal network surface. The authors of the review also emphasized that 'cortical plasticity' in childhood makes it an important time for math training. The authors noted that although the number of studies investigating the effects of short-term math training on children is 'scarce,' the existing studies demonstrate that proper training improves 'neural processing and function.' They also cited one study that 'showed that aerobic fitness training could improve children's math learning outcomes via cortical thinning.' Overall, studies show that math training improves neural efficiency in math, and over time, makes specific math tasks more automatic. Not surprisingly, math skills were associated with general intelligence, reading capability, and cognitive ability. More studies are needed, the review concluded, to examine specific neural connections in math abilities. Importantly, the authors also cautioned that the present studies' conclusions don't permit 'causal relations' between brain structure and math abilities, only correlations. What Are Numbers and Which Species Can Count? A continuing controversy in the study of numeracy is whether number sense precedes language historically, or vice versa. Another debated question is whether number literacy is the basis for abstract thinking. Homo sapiens may be the only species with symbolic thinking, but research has demonstrated that many animal species can count and that the neural mechanisms involved may be similar to those of humans. As one specialist in psychology and language described it, 'animals are mathematically inclined, but only to a certain degree.' This researcher noted, for example, that monkeys could remember and compare sets of numbers (performing similarly to young children) and could learn the meaning of Arabic numerals. Comparing numbers is important for animal survival. 'Any creature that can tell the difference between a tree with 10 pieces of fruit from another with only six pieces, or between two predators and three on the horizon, has a better chance of surviving and reproducing,' the researcher commented. It's not only primates that can perform numerical comparisons: Studies have shown that other mammals (including dogs, cats, rodents, and dolphins) and some species of fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians can also discriminate between numbers to varying degrees. A detailed 2021 neuroscience reviewof 'how evolution shaped different animal brains to process numerical information' points out what is now known and the research needed. From Restricted Numeracy to Calculus How Homo sapiens evolved from having rudimentary numeracy to using calculus is a fascinating question. Did numeracy start with our hands and feet, as some linguists, anthropologists, and others suggest? Most of the world's number systems use multiples of base 5, 10, or 20—corresponding to the number of fingers on one hand, two hands, plus the toes on both feet. The word 'five' in many languages is derived from the word for 'hand,' Everett wrote. Others argue that numeracy is inherently abstract. University of Bologna philologists Miguel Valério and Silvia Ferrara wrote in 2020, 'Linguistic evidence does not support an evolution of numbers from concrete to abstract. There is no evidence that early numbers were conceived as fused with counted objects.' The authors reviewed the early Mesopotamian development of language and counting, as well as that of other ancient cultures where writing might have been independently invented and concluded that numbers were 'always abstract.' The convergence of number development and writing, they wrote, 'pivots on the appearance of power-based systems of number notation.' In other words, a system of notating numbers came into being using a number base and its powers and this coincides with the beginning of writing in Mesopotamia. Further evidence to support the argument that numeracy is abstract comes from experiments with newborn infants. An international group of researchers, writing in 2008, showed that newborns 'spontaneously associate stationary, visual-spatial arrays of 4–18 objects with auditory sequences of events on the basis of number.' In other words, the infants recognize and compare numbers when they hear and see them. The experiments familiarized the infants with a particular sequence of sounds or images and then measured the length of their gaze when presented with matching or non-matching sequences. The infants looked longer at the matching sequences. The authors concluded: 'Their performance provides evidence for abstract numerical representations at the start of postnatal experience.' An Open Field of Study Many fascinating questions remain in the study of numerosity in humans and animals in addition to those discussed here. For example, did numerosity lead to the cognitive basis for abstractive and symbolic thinking? Or what role did plants play in the human development of mathematics? Finally, some of the research on this subject is quite practical: It can have immediate application to helping children and adults with math learning difficulties, so that fewer people will be able to say, 'I'm not good at math.'

Chilling Warnings For Syria: When Foreign Interventions Go Bad – ...	The reports through Western presses read rather familiarly. Joyful residents taking selfies on abandoned, sullen tanks. Armed men ebullient and shooting into the sky with adventurist stupidity. The removal of statues and vulgar reminders of a regime. Prisoners freed; torture prisons emptied. The tyrant, deposed. This is the scene in Syria, a war with more external backers and sponsors than causes. The terrain for some years had been rococo in complexity: Russia, Iran and Shia militants in one bolstering camp; Gulf states and Turkey pushing their own mixture of Sunni cause and disruption in another; and the US throwing in its lot behind the Kurdish backed People’s Protection Units (YPG). Even this schema is simplified. While there will be an innumerable number of those delighted at the fall of Bashar al-Assad, the end of the Arab socialist Baathist regime provides much rich food for thought. Already, the whitewash and publicity relations teams are doing the rounds, suggesting that we are seeing a sound, balanced group of combatants that will ensure a smooth transition to stable rule. Little thought is given to the motley collection of rebels who might, at any moment, seek retribution or turn on each other, be they members of the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA), or those from the largest, most noted group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). There is little mention, for instance, about the blotted resume of the aspiring usurper, Abu Mohammad Al-Jolani, who retains a bounty of US$10 million for information on his whereabouts and capture by US authorities. Human rights activist and former British diplomat Craig Murray helpfully posted a link from the US embassy in Syria from 2017, with the blood red title 'Stop This Terrorist'. As he acidly notes, 'You might want to retweet this before they delete it.' When foreign powers meddle, particularly in the Middle East, the result is very often a cure worse than the disease. The billowy rhetoric follows a template: evil dictators, oppressors of their people, finally get their just desserts at the hands of a clearly demarcated, popular insurrection, helped along, naturally, by the world’s freedom lovers and democracy hailers. That those same freedom loving powers tolerated, traded and sponsored those same despots when it was convenient to do so is a matter confined to amnesia and the archives. A few examples suffice. The scene in Libya in the immediate aftermath of the 2011 NATO intervention that overthrew Muammar al-Gaddafi saw commentary of delight, relief and hope. New prospects were in the offing, especially with the news of his brutal murder. 'For four decades the Gaddafi regime ruled the Libyan people with an iron fist,' stated US President Barack Obama. 'Basic human rights were denied, innocent civilians were detained, beaten and killed.' At the end of the regime, Obama confidently claimed that the new administration was 'consolidating their control over the country and one of the world’s longest serving dictators is no more.' UK Prime Minister David Cameron struck the same note. 'Today is a day to remember all of Colonel Gaddafi’s victims.' Libyans 'have an even greater chance, after this news, of building themselves a strong and democratic future.' French President Nicolas Sarkozy chose to see the overthrow of Gaddafi as the result of a unified, uniform resistance from 'the Libyan people' who emancipated 'themselves from the dictatorial and violent regime imposed on them for more than 40 years.' What followed was not stability, consolidation and democratic development. Jihadi fundamentalism exploded with paroxysms of zeal. The patchwork of unsupervised and anarchically disposed militia groups, aided by NATO’s intervention, got busy. Killings, torture, enforced disappearances, forced displacement and abductions became common fare. The country was nigh dismembered, fragmenting from 2014 onwards between rival coalitions backed by different foreign powers. The same gruesome pattern could also be seen in the post-Saddam Hussein Iraq of 2003. It began with a US-led invasion based on sham premises: Weapons of Mass Destruction that were never found. It also resulted in the overthrow of another Arab socialist Baathist regime. Statues were toppled. There was much celebration and looting. Even before the invasion in March that year, US President George W. Bush was airily declaring that 'a new regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom for other nations in the region.' In November 2004, Bush would dreamily state that the US and Britain 'have shown our determination to help Iraqis achieve their liberty and to defend the security of the world.' The consequences of the invasion: the effective balkanisation of Iraq aided by the banning of the Baath Party and the disbanding of the Iraqi Army; the murderous split between Sunni and Shia groups long held in check by Saddam with Kurdish rebels also staking their claim; the emergence of Iran as a regional power of significance; the continued thriving of al-Qaeda and the emergence of the caliphate-inspired Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) group. Even as the body count was rising in 2006, Britain’s Prime Minister Tony Blair was still fantasising about the political wishes of a country he had been so instrumental in destroying. 'This is a child of democracy struggling to be born,' he told a gathering at Georgetown University in May that year with evangelical purpose. 'The struggle for Iraqis for democracy should unite them.' The unfolding disasters were mere 'setbacks and missteps'. Blair continued to 'strongly believe we did and are doing the right thing.' And so, we see the same pieties, the same reassurances, the same promises, played on a sedating loop regarding Syria’s fate, the promise of democratic healing, the transfiguration of a traumatised society. How long will such prisons as Sednaya remain unfilled? Therein lies the danger, and the pity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKYbYF3KCAszo	2024-12-09T16:58:19-08:00	
India And Bangladesh Begin Mending Fences – Analysis	I have underlined today India's desire to work closely with the interim government of Bangladesh authorities,' said Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri after talks with his Bangladeshi counterparty Md.Jashim Uddin in Dhaka on Monday. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and his Bangladeshi counterpart, Md. Jashim Uddin, who met in Dhaka on Monday, voiced the concerns of their countries but at the same time expressed a desire to continue bilateral cooperation and people-to-people ties. According to sources in Dhaka, Misri's talks with Jashim Uddin have prepared the ground for a political rapprochement between the estranged neighbours. Both sides expressed a desire to continue bilateral cooperation in development works and also to promote strong people-to-people ties that had benefited both countries until a rupture occurred following a mass movement which ousted the pro-Indian Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5. Though described as being part of a regular 'structured dialogue' between the two countries, Vikram Misri's engagement with the Interim Government in Dhaka was basically a fire fighting exercise as bilateral relations were suffering due to incendiary statements and actions of groups on both sides with a political axe to grind. After his meeting with his Bangladeshi counterpart, the Indian Foreign Secretary Misri said that the close relationship between the two countries 'is reflected on a daily basis with development projects that have been executed on the ground in Bangladesh and that continue to be developed.' 'The close relationship is also reflected in the mutually beneficial engagement we have on a whole set of issues ranging from trade, commerce, connectivity, power, water, energy, development and other areas of cooperation.' 'There is no reason why this mutually beneficial relationship should not continue to develop in the interest of our people. To that end, therefore, I have underlined today India's desire to work closely with the interim government of Bangladesh authorities,' Misri said. Concerns Expressed In the free and frank interaction, both sides expressed their pressing concerns. The Indian foreign secretary said: 'We also had the opportunity to discuss certain developments and issues and I conveyed our concerns, including those related to the safety, security and welfare of the minorities.' He was referring to some regrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious and other properties in Bangladesh. 'We expect an overall constructive approach on all these issues by the Bangladesh authorities and we look forward to moving the relationship forward in a positive, forward looking and constructive direction.' 'Today's discussions have given both of us the opportunity to take stock of our relations, and I appreciate the opportunity today to have had a frank, candid and constructive exchange of views with all my interlocutors.' 'I emphasised on a positive, constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with Bangladesh,' Misri said. He further said that India has always seen, and will continue to see in the future, the Indian-Bangladesh relationship as a people-centric and people-oriented relationship—one that has the benefits of all the people as it's central motivational force. Bangladesh Raises Sovereignty Issue The Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Jashim Uddin told journalists that Dhaka asked New Delhi not to interfere in Bangladesh's internal affairs. 'We said people of all religions in Bangladesh freely practice their faiths. This is our internal affair. It is not expected (of other countries) to make comments on our internal affairs. We don't do it for other countries.' Reasons for Standoff After Sheikh Hasina was ousted from the Premiership of Bangladesh and was forced to flee to India on August 5, India-Bangladesh relations went down the chute. It went further down consistently since then, with serious charges being bandied about by both sides, not officially, but by loud mouths in political parties and YouTube channels. Demonstrations were held in various cities in both countries queering the pitch and adding fuel to the fire. Interested parties in India have, for their own narrow political gain, interpreted the July-August student-led mass movement against Hasina's oppressive rule as a movement against the Hindu minority in Bangladesh and also against India with which the Hindus have been unfairly bracketed. On the Bangladesh side, radical Islamic forces like the Jamaat-e-Islami and Hefazat-i-Islam saw in the July-August political crisis and its uncertain aftermath, an ideal opportunity to attack the Hindus who they dubbed as infidels deserving only a subordinate place in an 'Muslim' Bangladesh. Thus, a popular, though violent, movement, against a dictatorial ruler, turned out to be a Hindu-Muslim and an India-Bangladesh conflict. The crisis has made the Hindus of Bangladesh (who are 8% of the 170 million Bangladeshis), fear attacks from the Muslim side. Indeed, a large number of Hindu properties and even temples were vandalized by Islamic zealots and anti-Awami League hot heads. And the Muslim majority feared an Indian attempt to twist the arms of the weak Interim Government of Prof. Muhammad Yunus to restore Hasina's rule. This was based on a popular belief in Bangladesh that Hasina was powerful for 15 years because she had India's full backing. Hackles went up in New Delhi when the Bangladeshi authorities said that Hasina would be extradited from India and tried in the International Criminal Court (ICC) at the Hague. Forces opposed to Hasina saw her relations with India during her 15-year tenure as having been patently asymmetrical and skewed in favour of powerful India. But those of this view had turned a blind eye to the fact that Bangladesh too had gained a lot from close ties with India. Bangladesh would not have been able to grow and even survive without close economic and people to people ties with India. Bangladesh is surrounded on three sides by India and the Bay of Bengal in the fourth side. Many commodities of common use are available in Bangladesh at reasonable prices thanks to trade with India. India is the main medical treatment destination for middle class Bangladeshis. Geopolitical Dimension The crisis had acquired geopolitical dimensions as well. Among Indians, the attacks on the Hindus in Bangladesh rekindled fears of rising radical Islam. They rekindled Islamophobia in the West. Some British MPs condemned the attacks on the Hindus in Bangladesh. US President-elect Donald Trump stung Bangladeshis by his condemnation of the attacks on Hindus on October 31. Bangladeshis saw a US-India axis emerging to thwart the August 5 regime change. On the other hand, Indians tended to see the ouster of Hasina as a 'Pakistani-US plot' aimed at ending India's monopoly of influence over Bangladesh. When Bangladesh eased visa procedures for Pakistanis and improved trade with Pakistan, India smelt an anti-India axis emerging. The India-Bangladesh conflict is being exacerbated by unverified reports of India deploying troops on the border and Bangladesh using Turkish drones over the border. There were attacks on the Bangladesh mission in Tripura and demonstrations in Dhaka against the Indian mission. Bangladeshi and Indian flags were burnt. For Indian Hindus, the latest provocation has been the arrest of a Hindu monk, Chinmoy Krishna Das Sammilita Sanatani Jote, on 'sedition' charges and the denial of bail to him. There was intense propaganda in India that Chinmoy Das is a member of the renowned International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). It was alleged that Chinmoy has no lawyer to defend him because they were beaten up. India called for a fair trial. However, ISKCON's international spokesman monk Devshekhar Das told The Week that Chinmoy Das did not belong to ISKCON. He had left the organization some months ago to start his own outfit. Earlier, ISKCON Bangladesh had publicly stated that Chinmoy Das was sacked in July for child abuse. Chinmoy Das's issue is of immediate importance politically. There is a Hindu nationalistic government firmly ensconced in New Delhi for which the Hindus are the core political constituency. And the brand 'ISKCON' is highly valued in India, though in this case ISKCON is not actually involved, as its spokesman Deveshekhar Das stated. Businesses to the Rescue However, in the midst of gloom, there was light at the end of the tunnel. The business community both in India and Bangladesh pressed the two governments to bury the hatchet and resume normal relations. Reports from India said that businessmen both in retail and in cross border trade, were feeling the pitch after entry and exit points were threatened with closure. The call for a boycott of Bangladeshis by eating houses and hospitals in Tripura and Kolkata had begun to hurt these institutions financially. Eventually, the boycotts were lifted. Indian and Bangladeshi authorities reopened the largest land port between the two countries which connects Petrapole in India and Benapole in Bangladesh. The speedy restoration of trade was a result of the economic interdependence between India and Bangladesh. India is Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner. Bangladesh shares 94% of its 4,367 km-long border with India and it relies on India for many essentials like rice, wheat, cotton, iron and steel, electronic equipment and textiles for its garment industry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKYLEXa9ku6nd	2024-12-09T16:56:45-08:00	
Myanmar: Rebels Capture Last Military Post On Bangladesh Border	Ethnic minority insurgents have captured the last Myanmar military position on the border with Bangladesh after its defenders, including pro-junta militiamen from the mostly Muslim Rohingya community, abandoned the post and fled, the rebel group and residents said. The Arakan Army, or AA, which is fighting for self-determination in Rakhine state, seized the military stronghold known as Border Guard Post No. 5 near the town of Maungdaw on Sunday, the group said. 'The Arakan army successfully captured and neutralized the last remaining outpost … in the Maungdaw region,' it said in a statement. Junta forces and members of Rohingya militia raised by the junta to battle the AA were trying to flee across the Naf River, which forms the border with Bangladesh, 'using motorboats and canoes' and launching attacks as they did so, the AA said. 'Clashes are still occurring … Therefore, due to military necessities and public security concerns, all river transportation in the Naf River will be indefinitely suspended,' the group said. Residents of Maungdaw said they were worried about the possibility of a navy boat operating offshore opening fire in retaliation for the AA’s capture of the position. 'The AA has captured the entire border with Bangladesh,' said one resident who declined to be identified for safety reasons. 'There’s still one junta navy ship … we need to keep that in mind, they can still shoot pretty far with their cannon.' The junta that seized power with the ouster of an elected government in February 2021 has been pushed back by insurgents in several parts of the country over the past year, raising questions about the sustainability of military rule. The capture of the entire border with Bangladesh by one of Myanmar’s most powerful insurgents armies comes days after ethnic minority Kachin insurgents in northern Myanmar, seized control of all of the border with China where its forces operate. ‘Commander captured’ A source close to the AA said the commander of military operations in the area, Brig. Thurein Tun, was among junta forces captured as they were trying to flee after the fall of the base. 'He was arrested last night on the road that goes down to the river along with his personal staff, majors, captains and senior police officers,' said the source, who also declined to be identified. RFA tried to telephone the AA spokesperson, Khaing Thu Kha, and the junta spokesperson, Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, to ask them about the situation but neither answered calls. Rohingya militia men from groups such as the Rohingya Solidarity Organization, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army and Arakan Rohingya Army, were among the pro-jutna forces that fled, the AA said. AA fighters were on Monday searching for fleeing junta forces along the Ah Leh Than Kyaw Beach and in various waterways, residents said. The AA draws its support from the state’s Buddhist majority and has a fraught relationship with members of the Muslim minority, particularly since the junta started recruiting Rohingya this year into militias to battle the AA. Human rights investigators said the AA was responsible for killing scores of Rohingya civilians trying to flee from Maungdaw to Bangladesh on Aug. 5, when they were attacked with drones and artillery as the AA intensified its campaign to capture the town. The AA denied responsibility. The AA controls about 80% of Rakhine state – 10 of its 17 townships and one in neighboring Chin state. In townships it does not control, it has pinned junta forces into pockets of territory, such as the state capital, Sittwe, a military headquarters in the town of Ann and the Kyaukpyu economic zone on the coast where China has energy facilities and wants to build a deep-sea port.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKYfoP8GGySvr	2024-12-09T16:51:01-08:00	
India-Myanmar: Simmering Insurgency – Analysis	By Afsara Shaheen On December 3, 2024, the Yung Aung faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K-YA) issued a demand of INR two million from Oil India Limited (OIL), a prominent petroleum company. The extortion note was delivered to the company's office in the Manabhum Reserve in the Lohit District of Arunachal Pradesh, by Tha Aung, an NSCN-K-YA 'major'. The note had set a deadline of December 10, 2024, for the payment. OIL Spokesperson Prankush Malla Buzarbaruah accepted that the company had received the extortion note from the outfit. On November 24, 2024, two civilians - Vignesh Kumar Jha and Bishnu Chetry - were abducted by a heavily armed 10-member NSCN-K-YA group, from a bridge construction site located between Pongchau and Konnu villages in the Longding District of Arunachal Pradesh. Sources disclosed that the group was led by NSCN-K-YA leader Akham Konyak. On October 25, 2024, a clash occurred between the Assam Rifles and NSCN-K-YA in Longding District, in which an NSCN-K-YA cadre was killed. The NSCN-K-YA initiated the attack by firing at the Assam Rifles personnel, while they were moving from Wakka towards the Indo-Myanmar border. On February 18, 2024, 10 workers employed at the Finboro coal mine in Changlang District of Arunachal Pradesh, were abducted by suspected militants of NSCN-K-YA and the Independent faction of United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA-I), after a failure to meet extortion demands. Sources stated that a group of seven armed militants held the workers at gunpoint and transported them in a dumper truck towards Old Longtoi, a remote location within Arunachal Pradesh. Security forces (SFs) later rescued seven of the 10 miners. Three workers were rescued after several months. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), there were three NSCN-K-YA-linked incidents of violence in 2024, which included one incident of killing and two of abduction (data till December 8, 2024), resulting in the death of one terrorist. In 2023, there were six such incidents, which included one incident of killing (one civilian), one incident of injury (one militant injured), and four abductions, in which seven persons were abducted. Since August 17, 2018, when the outfit 'officially' came into existence, there have been 27 such incidents, including 15 of killing, nine of abduction (24 persons abducted) and three of injury (two SFs, one civilian and one terrorist). The incidents of killing resulted in the death of 15 persons: two civilians, four SF personnel and nine militants. Some of the incidents of killing, in addition to the one mentioned above, included: December 28, 2023: NSCN-K-YA through a press release, claimed responsibility for the execution of former legislator Yumsen Matey on December 16, 2023, along the Indo-Myanmar border in the Tirap District of Arunachal Pradesh. NSCN-K-YA justified the execution, asserting that Matey was 'awarded capital punishment on 16/12/2023 due to his active involvement in all sorts of anti-NSCN activities.' The insurgent group accused Matey of 'masterminding anti-NSCN propagandas and slogans in Tirap District of Arunachal Pradesh' and of conspiring against the NSCN/Government of the People's Republic of Nagaland (GPRN), the armed wing of the outfit. July 28, 2021: Two NSCN-K-YA militants were gunned down during a search operation in the Kottam Forest area of Tirap District. The two militants fired at SFs when asked to surrender, and were shot dead in retaliatory firing. NSCN was formed in 1980, initially under the leadership of Isak Chishi Swu, Thuingaleng Muivah, and S.S. Khaplang. The organization aimed to establish a 'Greater Nagaland' or 'Nagalim,' a territory that would encompass all Naga-inhabited areas, transcending state and even international boundaries. However, NSCN split in 1988, primarily over ideological and operational differences, giving rise to two factions: NSCN-IM (led by Isak and Muivah) and NSCN-K (under Khaplang). The NSCN-K, with its base largely in Myanmar, pursued a different strategy from that of its India-based counterpart, the NSCN-IM. While the NSCN-IM eventually engaged in peace negotiations with the Indian government, resulting in the 1997 ceasefire and subsequent political dialogue, the NSCN-K maintained its militant stance under Khaplang's leadership for some more time. NSCN-K's militant opposition to compromise stemmed from Khaplang's belief in Naga sovereignty that transcended borders, particularly given his own roots in Myanmar's Naga-inhabited regions. However, Khaplang's militant stance did not last longer and within a month of the Union Government's announcement of a ceasefire with the outfit on November 14, 1998, the NSCK-N declared a ceasefire on December 18, 1998. The ceasefire continued thereafter, and a significant milestone was achieved in April 2001 with the formulation of a 15-point charter of cease-fire ground rules. The peace process culminated in September 2001 with formal talks in Kohima, emphasizing sustained dialogue and mutual cooperation for conflict resolution. However, S.S. Khaplang, the leader of the NSCN-K, unilaterally withdrew from the ceasefire agreement with the Government of India on March 27, 2015. This decision surprised the Indian authorities, as there was no prior official communication. The ceasefire, established in 2001, had been periodically renewed, but Khaplang's withdrawal marked a significant escalation in hostilities, including ambushes and attacks on Indian SFs. Following S.S. Khaplang's death in 2017, the NSCN-K saw internal divisions over leadership and ideological direction. In this environment, Yung Aung, a nephew of Khaplang, rose to prominence, leading a faction that upheld a radical vision for Naga independence. Finally, a splinter faction under Yung Aung - NSCN-K-YA - was formed in 2018. Unlike the faction that sought a ceasefire with the Indian government, Yung Aung's group categorically rejected any peace accords, denouncing them as betrayals of the Naga cause. Yung Aung's ascent reflects a generational shift in the NSCN-K, with younger leaders adopting an uncompromising stance, shaped by a narrative of unrelenting struggle and skepticism toward diplomacy. The Yung Aung faction thus reflects a commitment to armed struggle, paired with its cross-border alliances and anti-establishment rhetoric. By rejecting any formal engagement with the Indian state, the faction seeks to assert its legitimacy and differentiate itself from the NSCN-IM, which it perceives as having 'sold out' through negotiations. Later, differences emerged within the NSCN-K-YA. This division was fueled by dissatisfaction with Yung Aung's leadership, with allegations of mismanagement and policies contrary to the group's principles and resulted in a split within the outfit. 'Major General' (Retd.) Ang Mai, who had previously been expelled from the faction in 2019, was elected as the leader of the new faction during an emergency meeting held on June 27, 2023. His faction criticized the Yung Aung group for isolationist policies, while Yung Aung accused Ang Mai of colluding with the Myanmar military, further straining Naga unity. The Ang Mai faction operates in the border areas between India and Myanmar, primarily in Tirap, Changlang, and Longding Districts of Arunachal Pradesh as well as Mon District of Nagaland in India whereas on the Myanmar side, the Ang Mai faction operates in the Sagaing Region. The Yung Aung faction's ideology is steeped in a sense of historical grievance and the demand for sovereignty. It contends that Naga aspirations cannot be fulfilled within the constitutional framework of India or Myanmar, both of which it views as 'colonial' powers. Unlike the NSCN-IM, which has settled for an autonomy model under Indian federalism, the Yung Aung faction advocates complete secession. Its ideological framework includes elements of nationalism, ethno-political identity, and an aversion to any form of 'integration' with either the Indian or Myanmar state structures. This uncompromising vision is reflected in the faction's modus operandi: maintaining an armed presence across the India-Myanmar border, targeting Indian security forces, and allying with other insurgent groups in the region, including the ULFA-I and the Manipuri insurgent group People's Liberation Army (PLA). Strategically, the faction leverages the geography of Northeast India and Myanmar, operating from remote, forested areas that are difficult for state forces to penetrate. The NSCN-K-YA reportedly has camps in Haukyat, Khanmoi, Lohan, Kamai and Pangsau in the Sagaing Division of Myanmar. These are areas falling along the main locus of operations of the militant group in India - the Tirap, Changlang and Longding Districts of Arunachal Pradesh and the Mon District of Nagaland. This approach enables the faction to sustain its activities and maintain connections with other ethnic armed groups in Myanmar, forming a network of mutual support. The organizational structure of the Yung Aung faction is both hierarchical and decentralized. The leadership under Yung Aung maintains central authority over major decisions; however, field operations are often conducted by semi-autonomous local commanders. This setup allows for flexibility and adaptability in response to SF pressures. The faction's operations frequently involve small, mobile units capable of conducting hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, and other forms of guerrilla warfare, minimizing large-scale confrontations with state forces. A defining characteristic of the Yung Aung faction is its cross-border operational framework. The faction's base in Myanmar allows it to evade Indian security forces, which face jurisdictional constraints. This cross-border refuge also facilitates its alliances with other insurgent groups, including ULFA-I and PLA. These alliances have enhanced its operational capabilities, with support in the form of logistical resources, intelligence, and mutual access to safe havens across borders. The existence of the Yung Aung faction poses a significant challenge to the Naga peace process. While the NSCN-IM's 2015 framework agreement with the Indian government represents a step towards reconciliation, the Yung Aung faction's unyielding stance underscores the limitations of such agreements. As long as factions like NSCN-K-YA continue to operate outside the peace framework, the vision of a comprehensive Naga peace deal will remain elusive. For India, the faction's activities complicate counter-insurgency efforts in the Northeast. The faction's cross-border operations require a coordinated response, involving both Indian and Myanmar authorities. However, the porous nature of the India-Myanmar border, combined with limited state presence in the border regions on Myanmar's side, provide significant operational leeway for the insurgents. Further, the faction's alliances with other militant groups contribute to an interconnected insurgent landscape in the Northeast, creating challenges for regional stability. The NSCN-K-YA's unyielding militancy underscores the fragile nature of the peace processes in Northeast India. Sustainable peace hinges on a unified strategy involving India and Myanmar, recognizing the complexities of the Naga identity and aspirations, and the conflicting ambitions of multiple stakeholders.

The Geopolitics Of Elite Insanity: Teetering On The Brink Of Arma...	As the world simultaneously teeters on the brink of nuclear war in Central Asia, shatters any remaining sense of ‘international justice’ by taking no effective action to halt the televised genocide in Palestine (let alone the risk of a dramatically expanded war in West Asia), and runs headlong into the rapidly advancing technocracy – to nominate just three of the more pronounced threats – the bulk of the human population yawns while they scroll through the latest entries in the various chat groups on their phone. Virtually all of these chat groups (and the channels through which they are distributed), like the ‘news’ distributed by the corporate media through television, radio and newspapers, find an endless sequence of inconsequential issues to distract people from reality. And so our death or transhuman slavery awaits us. As I have explained many times in the past, it is only a rare person who understands how the world works, who orchestrates and drives events, how they do so, and the purposes of their program. For one account of this, see Historical Analysis of the Global Elite: Ransacking the World Economy Until ‘You’ll Own Nothing.’ Consequently, most analysts misconceive what is taking place and, therefore, what is necessary to resist it effectively. Inevitably therefore, the human population continues to be victimized by this program, as has been routinely demonstrated throughout history. Unfortunately, time is now rapidly running out with the Elite program – heavily concealed by this endless barrage of corporate ‘news’, among other techniques (see ‘The Elite’s 5,000-Year War on Your Mind is Climaxing. Can We Defeat it?’) designed to divert attention from the fundamental threats – to depopulate Earth and imprison those left alive in a technocratic ‘smart city’ prison advancing daily. In the latest, most significant development, NATO-produced and guided weapons were fired from Ukraine to attack Russian territory: On 19 & 20 November, U.S. ATACMS (supersonic tactical ballistic) missiles and British ‘Storm Shadow’ (cruise) missiles were used to destroy targets in Russia. In response, and immediately following the latest update of Russian nuclear doctrine – English translation here ‘Full Text of Russia’s Updated Nuclear Doctrine’ and briefly and simply explained by Andrew Korybko here ‘Russia’s Updated Nuke Doctrine Aims To Deter Unacceptable Provocations From NATO’ – Russia fired an ‘experimental’ version of the new hypersonic ‘Oreshnik’ (ICBM) missile (equipped with six independently-targetable warheads, each containing six submunitions) which traveled at Mach 10 (that is, ten times the speed of sound) to destroy the Yuzmash missile factory in the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk. Among a wide range of expert commentaries expressing grave concern, including because of the latest update of NATO strategy – see ‘NATO After the Washington Summit: Future-Proofing the Alliance and Supporting Ukraine until Victory: Resolution 494’ – see Scott Ritter’s ‘On the Brink’, Drago Bosnic’s ‘Nukes and medium-range missiles for Neo-Nazi junta, perfect recipe for WW3’ and watch Colonel Doug Macgregor’s recent interview ‘How Close Are We to WWIII?’ And geostrategic analyst Drago Bosnic specifically draws attention to the lack of evidence that President Biden has officially authorized the delivery of US nuclear weapons for use by Ukraine despite the fact that prominent media outlets, starting with the New York Times, have indicated, without offering any evidence, that this has taken place. Watch ‘Say No to Nuclear War! Peace on the Planet’. So while we can speculate about the identity of the person or persons responsible for such a decision, assuming it has been made, it simply highlights the point that those we believe are in control are not, in fact, in control. The Elite is scripting key world events and simply using the chosen puppets in governments, bureaucracies, international organizations and the media to offer an endlessly disconnected sequence of actions and announcements so that most people are confused and left unable, even if inclined to do so, to act decisively and effectively. Two factors seriously complicating this conflict are that Russia appears to possess at least one type of weapon and a weapon delivery system that can generate the equivalent damage as the blast impacts of a nuclear weapon but without the massively damaging heat and deadly radioactive fallout of nuclear weapons. This means that the damage can be ‘contained’ to a precise, if very large, target. And delivery of the weapon cannot be intercepted. The destructive power of this weapon, based on the descriptions offered by Ritter in his articles ‘On the Brink’ cited above and ‘Fahrenheit 7232’ – ‘Each war head in turn contained six separate submunitions, consisting of metal slugs forged from exotic alloys that enabled them to maintain their form during the extreme heat generated by hypersonic re-entry speeds. These slugs are not explosive; rather they use the combined effects of the kinetic impact at high speed and the extreme heat absorbed by the exotic alloy to destroy their intended target on impact.’ – suggests a substantially scaled-down version of the geoengineering weapon known as a ‘Rod from God’. Unlike the original version of this weapon, this Russian weapon was delivered using a hypersonic missile and fired against its target as a cluster of ‘smaller’ weapons. The geoengineering version of this weapon was fired from a satellite and used to generate the earthquake in Turkey and Syria in February 2023. It was thoughtfully described by the head of the Turkish Space Agency, Serdar Hussein Yildirim here, but earlier description of these Hypervelocity Rod Bundles (‘Rods from God’) are available in US military literature and elsewhere. See, for example, the U.S. Air Force ‘Transformation Flight Plan’ with the subject simply discussed in ‘Hypervelocity Rod Bundles’. Separately from its destructive power, the delivery system for this Russian weapon was the Oreshnik missile, which is hypersonic. It can travel at speeds up to Mach 10 and it cannot be intercepted with any existing technology, as was made clear by Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in his official statement following the strike. See ‘Statement by the President of the Russian Federation’ [re firing of the Oreshnik missile on 20 Nov 2024]. So while Russia has recently updated its nuclear doctrine to allow a lower threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, it has already developed, deployed and used a non-nuclear technology that can, by using modest quantities of the weapon, replicate the blast impact of a nuclear weapon and be delivered at breathtaking speed. The fundamental complication of this state of affairs is that the United States does not have weapons with equivalent capacities so it is more likely to resort to the use of nuclear weapons despite the fact that their impacts are far from ‘clean’, relatively confined or even short-lived. Consequently, the world stands at a dangerous turning point. This is particularly because the Elite orchestrating this and other critical conflicts is insane, as I have explained many times previously – see ‘The Global Elite is Insane Revisited’ – and most of their agents throughout governments and key international organizations are likewise insane, with many even holding fundamentalist or otherwise extreme beliefs (as one aspect of their insanity). One variation of this insanity is those people sometimes labeled ‘Armageddonists’ – people who believe, as indicated by this comment to Professor Bernard Lown by a senior US State Department official in 1998, ‘if there is a nuclear war, we will be the first ones to rise up and meet Jesus in the sky’. When Lown queried the official about whether anyone else in the US State Department felt the same way, the official replied: ‘Oh yes, many of us do.’ Quotes cited in ‘Iran: The Road to Armageddon? Would the US Administration really endanger the Entire planet?’ If you are unfamiliar with the damage that a nuclear weapon can do, this 18-minute video will make it clear enough: ‘The True Scale of Modern Nuclear Weapons’. And Annie Jacobsen’s latest book makes it clear too: Nuclear War: A Scenario. But, I want to emphasize yet again, whether or not the war in Central Asia goes nuclear (or the Israeli genocide of the Palestinians and war against its Arab/Persian neighbours in West Asia goes the same way), a wide range of Elite objectives in relation to its genocidal and transhumanist/technocratic program is being fulfilled and no amount of complaining about it, signing petitions or statements, lobbying of Elite agents in governments and international organizations, or demonstrating on the streets can make a difference. For a fuller explanation, see ‘The Elite Coup to Kill or Enslave Us: Why Can’t Governments, Legal Actions and Protests Stop Them?’ So I can only encourage any reader to have a ponder about the dangerous predicament in which we find ourselves and to seriously consider participating in comprehensive grassroots nonviolent strategies to halt the war in Central Asia, end the genocide against the Palestinians and defeat the advancing technocracy. In the following articles, I have explained the Elite program that drives each of these conflicts. Crucially, I have explained (or linked to) the nonviolent strategies necessary to end each of them. Strategies to address many other threats have already been elaborated elsewhere or in some cases (including geoengineering and synthetic biology) are being developed. ‘The War in Ukraine: Understanding and Resisting the Global Elite’s Deeper Agenda’which references a list of Strategic Goals for a Nonviolent Struggle to End a War. ‘Nonviolent Strategy to Halt the Genocide in Gaza, Liberate Palestine and Defeat the Global Technocracy’. ‘Fighting for Our Humanity, Fighting for Our Future’. Each article also links to the ‘We Are Human We Are Free’ campaign – which identifies the strategic action necessary to defend yourself from the advancing technocracy (explained, most simply, on the ‘We Are Human We Are Free’ one-page flyer, available in 23 languages). As the title of the last article suggests, there is an monumental amount at stake and it is going to take enormous effort by a substantial number of people to defend human life and a life worth living. And yet, despite the enormity of these threats, there no effective resistance to the threat of nuclear war, the rapidly advancing technocracy or even the televised genocide in Gaza. Why? The Other Side of the Coin This is because there is an even bigger hurdle that must be overcome for effective resistance to manifest. Most ‘ordinary’ people are trapped in a childhood version of submissive obedience. That is, most adults are incapable of doing anything beyond the adult equivalent of the powerless complaining about an injustice that they learned to do as a child. After all, whether or not it is consciously realized by any adult, the primary purpose of ‘socialization’ generally and punishment specifically is to terrorize the child into submissive obedience of ‘higher authorities’ in the child’s life: parents, teachers and religious figures. This is done so that the future adult will be submissively obedient to employers, the legal system and other state actors as well as (for some) military officers. See ‘Punishment is Violent and Counterproductive’. Overwhelmed by the deluge of ‘visible’, ‘invisible’ and ‘utterly invisible’ violence inflicted on them during childhood – see ‘Why Violence?’ and ‘Fearless Psychology and Fearful Psychology: Principles and Practice’ – the child ultimately learns that powerless complaining to their perpetrators is the limit of their permissible ‘action’. Consequently, the typical adult is submissively obedient and confines their ‘action’ to the adult equivalents of complaining such as signing a petition or letter of complaint to a higher authority (often a government), lobbying a politician or attending a protest gathering. Their fear ensures that the idea of taking strategically powerful action never even occurs to them or, in the case of the person to whom the idea occurs or is presented, is quickly discarded from thought and memory. In essence, effective resistance requires strategically-oriented action and that is inherently frightening to most people. It is ‘safer’ to do something ineffective (that is, confined within the ‘permissible’ range) rather than to take action that will make a difference but likely incur punishment (such as a fine or prison sentence for civil disobedience). Conclusion Major international processes and events are driven by the Global Elite which is insane. While the Elite remains largely hidden from view, their equally insane or submissively obedient agents in international organizations, governments, corporations and non-government organizations carry out their insane will. At the moment, this includes driving the world to the brink (and possibly over the brink) of nuclear war, against a backdrop of the rapidly advancing technocracy and the genocide in Gaza. And while there is zero effective resistance to any of these threats – even with much hang-wringing in some quarters – the Elite program proceeds unimpeded. So if you are not taking action that is going to make a strategic difference, I can only encourage you to do so – perhaps as part of a group so that your fear might be contained – while there is still time to defend a life worth living, both for ourselves and others.

Syrian Rebel Leader, Outgoing PM Discuss ‘Transfer Of Power’	Syrian rebels say leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani met for the first time Monday with the outgoing prime minister following the lightning advance by rebels who ousted President Bashar Assad. A statement posted on the rebels' Telegram channels said Golani met with Mohammed Ghazi Jalali to 'coordinate a transfer of power.' Jalali told Sky News Arabia TV on Monday, 'We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth.' He said most Cabinet ministers are still working from offices in Damascus. However, the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator for Syria, Adam Abdelmoula, told The Associated Press that some key government services had shut down as anxious state workers stayed home. The U.N. Security Council scheduled closed-door talks Monday on the situation in Syria. Russia, which provided military assistance to Assad during the nearly 14-year Syrian civil war, requested the Security Council session to discuss the developments, including the potential implications on the U.N.’s peacekeeping mission in the Golan Heights. Many questions remained Monday about who will lead Syria and how the country will try to recover after years of war and more than five decades under the rule of the Assad family. Israeli troops deployed Sunday to the U.N.-monitored buffer zone in the Golan Heights, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying the move was necessary to protect Israelis after Syrian forces abandoned their positions. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday it was a 'limited, temporary' step. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to grant asylum to Assad. Peskov said there were no plans for Putin to meet with Assad, and he declined to comment on Assad’s location. Russian news agencies said Sunday that Assad and his family had arrived in Moscow. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country hopes for a 'new Syria' that has good relations with its neighbors and helps bring regional stability. 'We expect international actors, especially the United Nations, to reach out to the Syrian people and support the establishment of an inclusive administration,' Fidan said in a speech to ambassadors. A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said Monday that China was watching the developments in Syria and that the 'future and destiny of Syria should be decided by the Syrian people.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement late Sunday that the United States will be 'closely monitoring developments as they unfold and engaging with our partners in the region.' 'The United States strongly supports a peaceful transition of power to an accountable Syrian government through an inclusive Syrian-led process,' Blinken said. 'During this transitional period, the Syrian people have every right to demand the preservation of state institutions, the resumption of key services, and the protection of vulnerable communities.' Blinken said the United States will support international efforts to hold Assad and others accountable for abuses against the Syrian people and detention of civilians such as U.S. journalist Austin Tice. Assad was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the country’s civil war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus. More than half a million Syrians died in the war, and the conflict displaced at least half the country’s pre-war population of 22 million people. Assad’s fall prompted crowds to gather and celebrate in Damascus and elsewhere. Rebels opened prisons where the Assad government held thousands of people as part of its crackdown against the uprising that began in 2011 against his rule. There was continued focus Monday on the Saydnaya prison outside of Damascus, where the White Helmets rescue organization said it deployed teams to search for potential hidden, underground cells where people may still be held. Assad’s downfall was stunningly quick, with the rebels capturing the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs in a matter of days as the Syrian army ended any opposition. The rebels are led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group (HTS) which has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. Golani is a former al-Qaida commander who cut ties with the group years ago and says he embraces pluralism and religious tolerance. Syria still faces divides, with Turkey-backed opposition fighters battling U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group still active in some remote areas.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKYkRYL6TkpJg	2024-12-09T16:43:25-08:00	
Hanukah And The Origins Of Religious Martyrdom – OpEd	Rabbi Marty Lockshin points out that while Hanukah celebrates the miraculous military victories of the 'few over the many,' and of Jewish religion over Greek culture; Hanukah has also given us a new genre of Jewish literature, one that has been in frequent use ever since: Religious Martyrdom. The original martyrdom accounts like those of 'Channa' and her seven sons spawned more in this genre: most famously the story of the ten rabbis who were martyred in the 2nd century C.E., a story featured in the liturgy of the Ninth of Av and Yom Kippur. Martyrdom stories remained popular in Jewish circles through the ages for the sad reason that Jews often found themselves in similar situations, having to decide whether to give up their lives or their religion. The events of the four books about the Maccabees' victories over the Syrian-Greeks are not found in the Hebrew Bible. But the books of the Maccabees, now found in the Apocrypha, were written by proud Jews with strong commitment to Jewish values and observance. Even if these books are not 'holy,' they represent what many loyal Jews were thinking between the middle of 2nd century B.C.E. and the end of the 1st century C.E. In these books, descriptions of glorious victories are mixed with tales of failures and of heroes dying in battle. In the 1 Maccabees chapter 6, Eleazar, the brother of Judah the Maccabee, 'win for himself an everlasting name' by dying heroically: 1 Maccabees 6:40 states: 'Now a part of the king's army was spread out on the high hills, and some troops were on the plain, and they advanced steadily and in good order. 6:41 All who heard the noise made by their multitude, by the marching of the multitude and the clanking of their arms, trembled, for the army was very large and strong. 6:42 But Judas and his army advanced to the battle, and six hundred of the king's army fell. 6:43 Now Eleazar, called Avaran, saw that one of the animals was equipped with royal armor. It was taller than all the others, and he supposed that the king was on it. 6:44 So he gave his life to save his people and to win for himself an everlasting name. 6:45 He courageously ran into the midst of the phalanx to reach it; he killed men right and left, and they parted before him on both sides. 6:46 He got under the elephant, stabbed it from beneath, and killed it; but it fell to the ground upon him and he died.' Eleazar's death is not attributed to any sin that he committed, but to his brave action and his willingness to risk almost certain death. He did not immediately accomplish any military gain: in the continuation of the story, 'when the Jews saw the royal might and the fierce attack of the forces, they turned away in flight.' Still, the author sees Eleazar's actions as heroic and worthy of emulation. No narrative like this martyrdom account appears in the Hebrew Bible. The most famous martyrdom story in the four books of the Maccabees is 'Channa and her seven sons'. The story appears, with significant variations, in many ancient sources (including both 2 Maccabees and 4 Maccabees). In the core story, a tyrannical non-Jewish king gives the seven sons of a woman (usually described as a widow) the choice of transgressing Jewish law (by worshiping idols or eating 'polluted' food) or dying a terrible death. With the encouragement of their mother, all seven sons remain steadfast and are killed by the tyrant. The story was originally told in connection with the events of Chanukah; the tyrant being Antiochus. But in later sources, from the classical rabbinic period, the events take place in the Roman period, as part of the Hadrianic persecutions, three hundred years after the events of Chanukah. In the earliest versions of the story from Maccabees 2 and 4, the woman is not given a name. In the rabbinic text of Eikhah Rabbah (written between the 5th and 7th centuries) she is referred to as Miriam bat Tanhum. In other midrashim, she is called Miriam bat Nahtom. Referring to the woman as Channa, which is ubiquitous in Jewish circles today, originates in Yossipon, a medieval Jewish history book that reworks much material from Josephus, and was probably edited in Italy in the ninth century. By the days of Rabbi Maimonides (1138-1205), the story was well known, and the mother's name was simply assumed to be Channa. In 4 Maccabees, religious martyrdom is the core of the book which praises the martyrs for their loyalty to Judaism and for resisting both the threats of the Syrian-Greek monarch and the attractions of Greek culture. The original martyrdom stories like those of 'Channa and her seven sons' spawned more in this genre: most famously the story of the ten rabbis who were martyred in the 2nd century C.E., which was featured in the liturgy of the Ninth of Av and Yom Kippur. Martyrdom stories remained popular in Jewish circles through the ages for the sad reason that Jews often found themselves in similar situations, having to decide whether to give up their lives or their religion. The dedication and valor of the Maccabees, and all those who joined them in their resistance to the attempt by the ruling powers to force the Jews to abandon their God given religion, and conform to Greek forms of worship and culture. Abandoning circumcision was one example. Those Jews who militantly resisted the pressure to conform to the majority culture were Muslims (Arabic for faithful followers of God's will) and their dedication eventually led to religious freedom and national independence for the oppressed Jews living in the Land of Israel. The oppression of Judaism by Antiochus IV, the Syrian Greek king, was the first known historical attempt at suppressing a minority religion, but unfortunately not the last. Other well known attempts were the three century long Roman persecution of Christianity, and the persecution of Prophet Muhammad and his followers by the majority of pagan Arabs in Makka. Muslims and Jews who celebrate Christmas, deny that they believe Jesus was the Son of God. They just desire to join in the merry mood of Christmas together with their Christian neighbors and friends, most of whom are not church going Christians anyway. But, like Jews who also do the same thing, Muslims are usually ambivalent and defensive about what they are doing. Jews who celebrate Christmas often show their ambivalence by calling their own Christmas tree; a Hanukah bush. Most Jews, who resist the normal desire of both children and adults to fit in and conform to the majority, claim that a Hanukah bush in a Jewish home, is the direct opposite of the Jewish holiday of Hanukah, which celebrates the values of religious freedom and religious diversity. Hanukah, the Hebrew word for Dedication refers both to two things: The rededication of the ancient Temple in Jerusalem after it was profaned in 168 BCE by an idol installed in it by the Syrian Greek king Antiochus IV; and The dedication and valor of the Maccabees, and all those who joined them in their resistance to the attempt by the ruling powers to force the Jews to abandon their God given religion, and conform to Greek forms of worship and culture. Abandoning circumcision was one example. Those Jews who militantly resisted the pressure to conform to the majority culture were Muslims (Arabic for faithful followers of God's will) and their dedication eventually led to religious freedom and national independence for the oppressed Jews living in the Land of Israel. Hanukah is a celebration of religious freedom; especially the freedom of all religious minorities to observe their religious practices with equal treatment and respect. But freedom is not only freedom from oppression. It is also freedom to do the right things, and to become a really good loving person. A free person is not free to oppress, hurt or insult other people or their religious beliefs. Freedom comes from fulfilling your responsibilities to other people, to nature, and to God. I think that this year we need to focus on increasing hope for peace by putting people first and land second and saying: 'From the river to the sea Palestinians and Israelis should be freed from hatred and suffering' with 'a two state for two peoples sharing of the land peacefully solution.' The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation/community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. 'Lo yisa goy el goy kherev velo yilmedu od milkhama' 'Nation shall not lift sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore. (Isaiah 2:4) If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKajdS2EZun3D	2024-12-09T16:40:50-08:00	
Post-Assad Power Struggle: A New Battle Awaits Syria – OpEd	The watershed moment in Syria with the ousting of Bashar al-Assad has triggered a complex and high-stakes scramble for influence in a region already rife with instability. As Syrian rebel forces have seized Damascus, toppling over more than 50 years of Assad family’s autocratic rule, the implications for regional geopolitics are profound. A newly fragmented Syria presents both opportunity and peril, as regional powers, each with divergent interests, race to reshape the country’s future. Regional Rivalries: A Battle for Influence In this rapidly evolving power vacuum, countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, Turkey and Qatar will very soon start attempting to assert their influence. Each of these states has its own vision for Syria’s future, guided by broader regional ambitions and ideological leanings. For Egypt and the Gulf monarchies, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the overriding concern will be preventing the rise of Islamist groups they deem a threat to their political systems. Specifically, the Muslim Brotherhood, long seen as an existential threat by these states, will be at the center of their strategy. Both Saudi Arabia and Egypt, along with the UAE, have been vocal in their opposition to any group affiliated with the Brotherhood or those espousing similar ideological leanings. In the post-Assad landscape, they will likely back rebel factions that can check the influence of these Islamist groups, ensuring that Syria’s future more aligned with their own authoritarian models, which are hostile to political Islam. On the other hand, Turkey and Qatar, which have long supported the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates, will work to ensure that Syria’s political future accommodates groups sympathetic to their cause. Turkey, already heavily involved in the Syrian conflict and keen on countering Kurdish influence, will push for a post-Assad Syria that is friendly to its interests. Ankara’s backing of rebel factions with Islamist leanings will be key in shaping the future trajectory of Syrian politics, which may involve an uneasy coalition of Islamist and nationalist forces that align more closely with Turkey’s regional goals. Israel's Security Interests: Covert Operations and Syria’s Fragmentation Israel, having spent years trying to weaken the Assad regime and its allies, especially Iran and Hezbollah, will welcome the collapse of Assad’s rule. Israel will likely continue its covert operations in Syria, targeting any remaining Iranian and Hezbollah assets as well as any rebel factions it perceives as a threat. Israel has already signaled its intention to maintain a visible and strategic military presence in the region, especially along the Golan Heights and in areas near the Syrian border. Israel’s goal will be to ensure that no single force, whether a rebel faction or a pro-Iranian proxy, can dominate Syria and pose a direct threat to Israeli security. Accordingly, Israel’s primary goal after the fall of Assad would be the ongoing fragmentation of the country. A divided Syria, with competing rebel factions and no strong central government, serves Israel’s strategic interests, as it avoids the consolidation of a unified and hostile neighbor on its border. U.S. Pursuit of Democracy in Syria The U.S.’s objectives in Syria revolve around maintaining a foothold in the region and advancing its ideological goals. In particular, Washington has consistently supported Kurdish-led forces, such as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which it sees as a counterbalance to ISIS and other adversarial forces. These groups are also positioned as important U.S. allies in the broader effort to promote liberal values and establish democracy in Syria and the Middle East. However, the U.S. faces a difficult balancing act. While it has long advocated for a post-Assad Syria governed by democratic principles, the presence of Islamist factions, such as those aligned with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS, complicates this vision. Washington will likely continue to back those forces it deems most likely to resist Islamism, even if those forces, like the SDF, are viewed as terrorists by regional players such as Turkey. The future of U.S. involvement in Syria will be shaped by the need to prevent the resurgence of ISIS and similar groups. With Assad out of the picture and Russia distracted by the ongoing war in Ukraine, the U.S. may seek to strengthen its influence over the Syrian political process, but it will be hampered by the complexity of dealing with a patchwork of militias, regional players and global powers all vying for control. Daunting and Fragile Road to Reconstruction As celebrations in Damascus give way to the sobering realities of post-Assad Syria, the challenges ahead are immense. With competing factions, sectarian divides and the looming specter of groups like ISIS, the path to stability will be long and fraught with obstacles. Rebuilding the country will require not just military victory but economic reconstruction, social reconciliation and political transition. The international community, particularly Western nations, will likely be called upon to provide aid and assistance in Syria’s rebuilding efforts. However, this assistance will be highly contingent on the political direction the country takes. Will Syria lean towards the liberal values championed by the West, or will it move toward Islamist governance? How the new Syrian leadership, likely to be dominated by HTS or similar groups, navigates this question will be crucial. Sanctions, Diplomacy and Alliances in the New Reality One of the most pressing questions is how the international community will engage with Syria’s new rulers. The Western powers, which have long shunned Assad, will have to grapple with the reality that many of the factions now in control of Syria, especially those linked to HTS, are considered terrorist organizations by the U.S. and its allies. A significant challenge will be determining how to engage with a new Syria while balancing the need for stabilization with the desire to avoid empowering forces that the U.S. and its allies view as terrorists. The geopolitical contest will also involve Russia and Iran, whose influence in Syria has been severely weakened by the fall of Assad. Russia, bogged down by the war in Ukraine, will be unable to project power in Syria as it once did. Iran, similarly, has seen its position erode with the departure of Assad. In Syria, the future of Russia and Iran will depend on their ability to recalibrate their strategies, possibly by backing certain rebel factions or negotiating with new political authorities in Damascus. Battle for Syria’s Future is Far from Over While the fall of Assad marks a historic moment, the true test of Syria’s future will be how the country rebuilds politically, economically and socially. Regional and global players are positioning themselves to shape the outcome, with each having a stake in what comes next. What is clear, however, is that the road ahead will be turbulent, with power struggles both within Syria and across the Middle East. In the end, Syria’s fate will be shaped not only by its own people but by the shifting dynamics of regional and international politics.

Pakistan’s Proxy War Intensifies In Kashmir – Analysis	By Ayjaz Wani After an uneasy lull in violence since the abrogation of Article 370 and increased vigilance from the counterterrorism strategies by Indian security forces, Pakistan is back to fomenting trouble in the Kashmir Valley. India’s northwestern neighbour has now resorted to using terrorists and sleeper cells to disrupt peace in Jammu and Kashmir, to sabotage the democratic process in the region. Shortly after Omar Abdullah was sworn in as the first Chief Minister of the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), a series of terror incidents unfolded in the Kashmir Valley. Between 16 October and 7 November, terrorists targeted eight locations across Kashmir. The recent grenade blast in Srinagar city that left 11 people injured, and the killing of a wanted Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) commander in the heart of Srinagar indicates that terrorism is making a comeback, with Pakistan intensifying its proxy war against India. Between 1 and 9 November, eight terrorists were killed in six encounters across the Kashmir region; four taking place in North Kashmir. As of 4 December, since January 2024, there have been 60 terror incidentsinvolving killings in 2024, resulting in the deaths of 31 civilians, 26 security personnel and 64 terrorists in J&K. Civilian casualties from terrorist attacks have doubled this year than in 2023, with most victims being non-locals. Pakistan’s proxy war and foreign terrorists in J&K Since 2020, terrorists have been operating in the south of the Pir Panjal and Jammu regions. The recently held J&K assembly elections saw a 63.9 percent voter turnout, but with only six out of 20 districts of Kashmir showing increased participation—Kulgam by 3.4 percent, Pulwama by 2.5 percent, Shopian by 8.5 percent, Srinagar by 2.1 percent, and Baramulla by 3.3 percent. The elections were conducted without any terror incidents, marking a successful first test of democracy in the UT after the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A. Even foreign diplomats from 15 countries observed the election process and visited polling stations in Budgam and Srinagar to witness the UT’s vibrant democracy in action. The peaceful elections in J&K were the result of a zero-tolerance approach towards the terror ecosystem and its sympathisers in the region. The security forces dismantled the Over Ground Workers (OGW) network and acted against terror funding through arrests, raids, account freezing, and the denial of government jobs. Moreover, a significant positive shift in youth perception towards New Delhi contributed to decreased violence. The youth realised that Islamabad and Pakistan-based terror groups are exploiting religion to incite trouble and use narcotics to fund terrorism. Due to enhanced security measures and positive changes, only four individuals joined local terror outfits as of November this year. This marked a significant decline in local recruitment from 22 in 2023 and 113 in 2022. Consequently, there are currently around 16 or fewer local insurgents compared to more than 80 foreign terrorists. Due to the increasingly peaceful environment and the recent success of democracy in J&K, Islamabad and its terrorist groups are attempting to induce radicalisation and escalate terrorist violence through manipulative top-down techniques. Pakistan not only established new virtual terrorist groups but also intensified anti-India activities across social media platforms such as Facebook, X, Telegram, as well as the Dark Web. In October 2024, security agencies reported over 2,000 concerning posts, a significant increase from just 89 during the same period in 2023. Among these posts, 130 were related to terrorism, 310 posed threats to infrastructure, and 33 supported separatism. Pakistan and terror groups in Islamabad are strategically using cyber-enabled influence campaigns and propaganda to shape the public discourse on terrorism and terror violence. The four years have seen a steady increase in foreign terrorists, initially in the south of Pir Panjal and now in Jammu as well as in the Kashmir region. These groups exploit the dense forests and complex terrain for their activities. Following deadly ambushes and attacks in the Rajouri-Poonch area, terrorist activities have surged across six districts in Jammu, resulting in the deaths of 44 people, including 18 security personneland 13 terrorists. After elections, there is typically a rise in the activities of foreign terrorists in the Kashmir Valley, particularly in the districts of Baramulla, Kupwara, Bandipora, and Ganderbal. This trend ignites the disturbing memories of the period from 2004 to 2016, during which foreign terrorists successfully carried out terrorist activities to keep J&K on the boil. Pakistan’s nefarious activities were supported by Burhan Wani and other local insurgents, who used social media to boost local recruitment. Way forward The Af-Pak region has become a cradle for terrorism due to Islamabad’s state policy of using terror for geopolitical and geostrategic interests. The use of terrorism as a foreign policy tool, distortion of the hadith, the use of encrypted apps and social media for recruitment, and state support from Pakistan and other terror groups have complicated New Delhi’s counterterrorism strategies in J&K. The TECHINT-based (Technical Intelligence) information about the presence and movement of the terrorist has diminished, forcing the security agencies to reinforce HUMINT (Human Intelligence) for successful operations against the terrorists. New Delhi should strengthen its counterterrorism strategies and enhance coordination within the Multi-Agency Centre (MAC). India’s Home Minister has made it clear that greater collaboration among agencies is essential to tackle the evolving security threats facing the nation and to effectively dismantle terror networks. To respond to terrorism and a proxy war in J&K proactively and reactively, New Delhi should think of establishing four dedicated fusion centres for improved coordination in North Kashmir, South Kashmir, Rajouri-Poonch and Jammu, with locals from different agencies under the supervision of a multi-agency centre (SMAC) at the UT level. To remain a step ahead, joint training and exercises should be conducted between the different agencies at these fusion centres on the use of big data, technological advancements and Artificial Intelligence to curb terrorism. Joint training is also essential to establish priorities and operational procedures that will significantly contribute to achieving lasting peace in J&K. While coordination at the upper levels of the MAC is commendable, New Delhi must enhance collaboration at the lower level to ensure a better understanding of robust intelligence.

US–China Relationship’s Fragile Stability Shows Fractures In 2024...	By Jia Qingguo As 2024 draws to a close, the stability of US–China relations is fragile at best. Even this fragile stability cannot be sustainable after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. But there may be a silver lining. People in the United States, China and other countries will likely fear escalating tensions and oppose further confrontation. The year began with some modest optimism following the stabilising San Francisco summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in November 2023. The meeting indicated the possibility of real progress in cooperation on some issues, occurring halfway through the US Trade Representative’s statutory four-year review of Trump’s tariffs. Some observers believed that the Biden administration would find it in US interests to lift at least some tariffs on China, given their controversial results. Senior officials from both nations maintained a sense of normalcy and stability in their diplomacy. President Xi and President Biden held a phone call in April and met in person at the November APEC Leaders’ Summit in Lima. They reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining dialogue and careful management of this complex relationship. Meanwhile, high-level meetings continued, including US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s separate visits to China in April and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart in May. Both countries’ economic officials and military officers also conducted dialogues on topics of shared interest and concern in more institutionalised settings and cooperated on issues such as climate change, fentanyl trafficking and repatriation of illegal immigrants. But the relationship has remained largely confrontational. The United States has continued to pursue its policy of strategic competition with China, and China has enacted countermeasures. The Biden administration did not make much effort to improve the relationship. The review of Trump’s high and counterproductive tariffs on Chinese imports did not produce recommendations for meaningful tariff reductions. The Biden administration spent much time and energy devising ways to implement the policy of strategic competition — or confrontation — with China. These included incentives promoting near-shoring and friend-shoring in the production of certain commodities, and additional high-tech export restrictions against China. The administration also added more Chinese companies to the restrictive US Bureau of Industry and Security’s Entity List and prohibited US investment in China’s high-tech sectors. The administration has sold more and better weapons to Taiwan. Biden’s State Department even issued a travel warning for China until relaxing it on 27 November 2024. The administration has also tried to rally other countries to develop common security and economic policies against China. The US Congress has been busy drafting various anti-China statutes and resolutions, ranging from providing more support to Taiwan to suspending China’s permanent normal trade relations with the United States. Both the administration and Congress have threatened sanctions against China over its alleged support for Russia as its battlefield odds amid the invasion of Ukraine shifted in Russia’s favour. Despite US pressure, China has remained strategically defiant. It has accelerated efforts to diversify its trade relations away from the US market. It has intensified indigenous technology development to counteract US export restrictions and continued to advocate for free trade through initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and through applying to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. China expanded cooperation with Russia, deepening trade and conducting joint military exercises despite US frustration. Beijing has also promoted international cooperation through the BRICS bloc and the Belt and Road Initiative. While demanding that the United States observe its commitments regarding Taiwan under the three foundational US–China communiques, China increased military activity around Taiwan in response to perceived US and Taiwanese provocations. The country has also accelerated its military modernisation programs to deter potential US intervention. These interactions have contributed to uncertainty in bilateral trade, relatively declining technological import dependence, reduced foreign investment, and increasingly negative public sentiment. Even the fragile stability may be ending with Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. The second Trump Administration is likely to present even more serious challenges to the US–China relationship given his political track record and the policy inclinations of some key cabinet appointees. The relationship’s trajectory will likely be defined by increased tariffs on Chinese exports to the US, more controls on high-tech exports to China and more Chinese companies added to the Entity List. Trump’s presidency will likely also obstruct people-to-people exchanges, intensify provocations in the Taiwan Strait and reduce diplomatic communication. Under these circumstances, the risk of accidental military conflict would drastically increase. But challenges often come with opportunities. Further deterioration of the US–China relationship poses serious risks for both countries and the world. Trump’s campaign promise to impose 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports would have dire consequences if implemented. It would trigger further inflation in the United States, massive job losses in both countries, global trade disruption and lower the threshold for China to undertake potential retaliatory actions. Beijing could refuse to cooperate with Washington to reduce fentanyl trafficking, expand military actions in the Taiwan Strait, pursue an arms race or offer support for global activities against US interests. Such prospects may motivate US citizens and the international community to resist further escalation in tensions. If the mutual benefits of cooperation cannot rescue US–China relations, they may ironically be salvaged by people of both countries and the international community against efforts to escalate confrontation for fear of the catastrophic consequences of any potential confrontation.

Is Laos Actually Tackling Its Vast Scam Industry? – Analysis	By David Hutt In early August, the authorities in Laos delivered an ultimatum to scammers operating in the notorious Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone: Clear out or face the consequences. On Aug. 12, the Lao police, supported by their Chinese counterparts, swooped in. Some 711 people were arrested during the first week. Another 60 Lao and Chinese nationals were arrested by the end of the month, and more arrests have been made since. The way Vientiane frames it, Laos is now getting tough on the vast cyber-scamming industry that has infested much of mainland Southeast Asia. In Laos, the sector could be worth as much as the equivalent of 40 percent of the formal economy, according to a United States Institute of Peace report earlier this year. The think tank estimated that criminal gangs could be holding as many as 85,000 workers in slave-like conditions in compounds in Laos. People in Laos tell me there is some truth to Vientiane’s assertions. This might have been why Laos was downgraded to Tier 2 on the U.S. State Department’s annual human trafficking ranking in July, while Myanmar and Cambodia were downgraded to the lower Tier 3. According to one expert, 'Laos is taking this issue more seriously than Cambodia and has more capacity to respond than Myanmar.' Admitting a problem is the first step, but Vientiane has been somewhat fortunate in how the scam industry has structured itself differently in Laos. In Cambodia and Myanmar, for instance, scamming tends to be geographically dispersed with compounds across the country and controlled by different syndicates. Zhao Wei’s empire In Laos, however, the industry was, until very recently, almost entirely centered in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone, an autonomous area long notorious for organized crime and run by the Chinese crime boss Zhao Wei and his Kings Roman Group, which has close ties to organized crime in China and Hong Kong. The United Wa State Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, Myanmar-based militias with large stakes in Southeast Asia’s drug trade, are also active in criminal activity, including scam centers, within the SEZ. Initially, this centralization of criminality was a problem. After the Golden Triangle SEZ was founded in 2007, on a 99-year concession awarded to Zhao, it essentially operated as a mini-fiefdom. The Lao authorities were not even allowed entrance to the economic zone, giving the criminals carte blanche. This was a concern of a few nationalists within Laos’s communist party but tolerated by the majority, who regarded crime as a lesser evil, since Zhao and his associates were bringing in considerable foreign investment — and, of course, some cash to the political elites. However, as the cyberscam problem has metastasized since 2022, this situation has made it somewhat easier for Laos to respond. Because Zhao and his associates had established laundering trails to China and Myanmar years earlier, it meant that, unlike in Cambodia, most of the revenue from the scam industry immediately left Laos. This limited the amount of money needing to be recycled or laundered through local conglomerates, thus reducing the sums needed to corrupt Laotian officials, politicians, and tycoons. This meant that officials, especially those outside Bokeo province where the SEZ is located, weren’t contaminated by scam money, so they were not invested in protecting the racket. Sovereignty over SEZ By comparison, the scam industry is more geographically dispersed and controlled by more numerous players in Cambodia. This means much of the revenue stays within Cambodia where it is laundered through businesses run by some of the most prominent Cambodian oligarchs and politicians. So well-connected has the industry become that even if a faction within Cambodia’s government favored a full-frontal assault on the scammers, they know they would have to take on most of the country’s political aristocracy and oligarchy, risking strife within the ruling party. Scamming isn’t such an existential threat for the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party, or LPRP. Indeed, the normally sedate National Assembly has noisily pressed Vientiane to tackle the scam problem, even last year rejecting a proposed government bill to toughen up regulations on SEZs for being too weak. In May, the Lao government reshuffled the leadership of Bokeo province, where the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone is located, ostensibly to clean out officials who had been bought off. Vientiane has somewhat reasserted its sovereignty over the zone this year. Through discussion and threats, it got Zhao and his Kings Roman Group to accept greater access for Laotian police and troops to the economic zone. That said, Zhao and associates can still limit what Lao authorities can do in the zone Another advantage is that Zhao serves more at the whim of the Chinese Communist Party, which wants to crack down on parts of the scam industry in Southeast Asia, than some of the more independent operators in Cambodia and Myanmar. And the Lao government is also more dependent on Beijing than Cambodia’s authoritarian government. Pressure from China That means Vientiane, which relies almost entirely on Chinese investment for economic growth and on Chinese debt relief so the state doesn’t go bust, cannot say no when Beijing orders it to move on the scammers. The raids on the Golden Triangle SEZ in August came after a meeting earlier that month between the Lao Ministry of Public Security and Zhao – and just weeks after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Vientiane. However, we must also ask whether Laos’s cure is actually creating a worse disease. According to a USIP report last month, the Aug. 6 meeting between government officials and Zhao Wei, weeks before the raid on his GTSEZ, 'gave criminal kingpins and their senior [scam] compound managers ample time to relocate. Many of them shifted operations to Cambodia or the Myanmar border with Thailand.' Simply scaring off some scammers to Cambodia might not be the best regional response, although Vientiane probably won’t give a fig about this. However, Vientiane would care if scammers are now merely set up shop elsewhere in Laos. One source tells me that they are already embedding themselves in the capital and near the Laos-China border. Depending on how things play out, Laos might end up with a diffuse scam industry that’s structured a lot more like Cambodia’s — and which is far harder to dismantle. Dispersing the scam compounds means increasing contacts between the criminals and officials from other provinces. Less sophisticated syndicates mean more of the scamming profits stay in-country, laundered through the local economy, infecting everything. Narco-states like Mexico and Colombia have learned the brutal lesson that it’s simpler to deal with an illegal industry run by one dominant cartel, even one you have to tolerate, rather than a scorched-earth free-for-all between many warring factions. Possibly, a similar impulse may be why Vientiane seemingly wants to push Zhao and his associates enough for some smaller operators to flee the country, but not enough that the Golden Triangle SEZ collapses.

From Korean War To Ukraine Conflict: The Evolution Of North Korea...	A critical period in the Cold War, the Korean War (1950–1953) represented the ideological conflict between capitalism and communist. The Soviet Union's secret intervention at this time was crucial in determining the course of the conflict and laid the groundwork for its long-lasting alliance with North Korea. The dynamics of this alliance have changed in the present as North Korea provides Russia with reciprocal assistance in the context of the crisis in Ukraine. This analysis looks at how North Korea and Russia's relationship has changed over time, examining how their current strategic partnership is influenced by historical ties established during the Korean War. The Korean War: Soviet Support to North Korea Following the conclusion of World War II, the Korean Peninsula experienced a division along the 38th parallel, with the northern region coming under the occupation of the Soviet Union and the southern region under the control of the United States. This division established the foundation for rival regimes: a communist state led by Kim Il Sung in the northern region, significantly supported by Moscow, and a democratic state in the southern region, under the backing of Washington. The military and logistical assistance provided by the Soviet Union played a crucial role in the formation of the North Korean People’s Army (KPA) and its air force, thereby laying the groundwork for the conflict that would ensue in 1950. In the late 1940s, as geopolitical tensions escalated, Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union strategically sought to extend its influence in Asia, perceiving the Korean Peninsula as an essential buffer against Western powers. Stalin's measured yet tactical choice to back Kim Il Sung's intentions to invade South Korea—dependent on Chinese backing—illustrated the intricate geopolitical strategy of expanding communist dominance while steering clear of direct conflict with the United States. The assistance provided by the Soviet Union to North Korea throughout the war included a range of military equipment, specialized knowledge, and essential logistical backing. The military initiatives of North Korea were significantly enhanced by the provision of Soviet-supplied T-34/85 tanks, artillery, and small arms, including the PPSh-41 submachine gun. The support provided facilitated the North's unexpected incursion into South Korea in June 1950, allowing for a swift advance southward until the intervention of the UN. The contributions of the Soviet Union transcended mere military cooperation and contribution. Moscow rendered essential medical and logistical assistance by deploying medical professionals and teams to support the forces of North Korea and China. Soviet advisers provided training to North Korean personnel, thereby augmenting the operational capabilities of the Korean People's Army in their military campaigns. The aerial conflict in Korea represented a crucial arena in which Soviet participation was notably impactful. The deployment of the MiG-15 fighter jet, flown by Soviet pilots under the guise of Chinese personnel, posed a significant challenge to the air superiority of UN forces. The 64th Fighter Aviation Corps, a Soviet military formation engaged in operations over Korean airspace, imposed considerable losses on United Nations aircraft, notably including advanced American fighter jets such as the F-86 Sabre. Although Soviet pilots adhered to strict protocols to maintain plausible deniability—wearing Chinese uniforms and avoiding speaking Russian—their presence became evident. These efforts showcased the Soviet Union’s commitment to North Korea while carefully managing the risks of direct engagement with the United States. The Soviet Union’s covert yet substantial role in the Korean War cemented its alliance with North Korea, fostering a relationship rooted in mutual strategic interests. For Moscow, North Korea served as a critical ally in the fight against Western imperialism, while Pyongyang relied on Soviet support to build its military and economic infrastructure. The war’s outcome—a stalemate leading to the division of the peninsula—solidified the Cold War’s bipolar order and set the stage for enduring alliances. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a turning point in North Korea-Russia relations. While ties weakened during Russia’s economic and political transitions in the 1990s, they never fully dissolved. By the early 2000s, under Vladimir Putin’s leadership, Russia began to reassert its influence in East Asia, seeking to restore its partnership with Pyongyang. This renewed relationship was driven by shared interests in countering U.S. dominance and fostering economic cooperation. North Korea, facing international isolation and economic sanctions, viewed Russia as a valuable ally in its efforts to secure diplomatic and economic support. The partnership evolved into a pragmatic alignment, with Russia providing political backing in international forums and limited economic assistance. The Ukraine Conflict: North Korea’s Support for Russia In the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the dynamics of North Korea-Russia relations have undergone a notable shift. For the first time in their history, North Korea has emerged as a proactive supporter of Russia’s military campaign, underscoring a reciprocal dynamic rooted in their Cold War-era alliance. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has been openly supporting Russia’s actions in Ukraine, framing the conflict as a legitimate exercise of self-defense against Western aggression. Pyongyang has criticized Western arms supplies to Ukraine as provocations and has aligned itself with Moscow’s narrative of resisting U.S.-led imperialism. Reports indicate that North Korea has provided material and logistical support to Russia, including the deployment of thousands of troops to Russia’s western Kursk region. This unprecedented move reflects Pyongyang’s willingness to reciprocate the Soviet Union’s support during the Korean War, albeit under vastly different geopolitical circumstances. According to Matt Murphy BBC Report (28 October 2024), North Korean forces have aided Russia in the conflict in Ukraine, which is a major development in the conflict. For the first time, North Korean troops are stationed in the Kursk border region of Russia, where Ukrainian forces have advanced, according to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Between 1,500 and 10,000 North Korean troops, including specialized units, are thought to have been deployed to support Russian operations. This deployment is a component of Pyongyang and Moscow's larger military partnership. In order to support Russia's war operations, North Korea has also sent ballistic missiles and artillery munitions. In return, Russia is allegedly giving North Korea financial assistance and cutting-edge military hardware to help it get over international sanctions. In view of Russia's growing international isolation after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, this relationship demonstrates a growing agreement between the two countries.Although North Korean participation increases Russian soldiers, logistical difficulties, a language barrier, and a lack of recent combat experience have caused observers to question the efficacy of these forces. However, their deployment highlights the war in Ukraine's expanding international character, causing Western capitals to worry about possible escalation and the instability of international security. The implications of this partnership extend beyond the immediate conflict in Ukraine. The North Korea-Russia alliance exemplifies the shifting dynamics of global power, where traditional Cold War alliances are repurposed to address contemporary challenges. This realignment poses a challenge to the rules-based international order, underscoring the complexities of managing global security in an era of multipolar competition. Conclusion The trajectory of North Korea-Russia relations from the Korean War to the Ukraine conflict illustrates the enduring significance of historical alliances in shaping contemporary geopolitics. The Soviet Union’s covert support during the Korean War laid the foundation for a relationship characterized by strategic reciprocity. Decades later, North Korea’s reciprocal support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict underscores the resilience of this alliance, even amidst evolving global dynamics. As the international community grapples with the challenges posed by the North Korea-Russia partnership, it is essential to recognize the historical context that informs their collaboration. Addressing these challenges requires a nuanced understanding of the legacy of Cold War alliances and their implications for modern geopolitics. The evolution of North Korea-Russia reciprocity serves as a reminder of the enduring relevance of history in shaping the future of international relations.

Trump: Sweeping Changes Starting On First Day He Takes Office – A...	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is vowing to make swift and sweeping changes as he takes office on January 20, deporting millions of migrants in the country illegally, imposing tariffs on imported goods that could raise consumer prices for Americans and pardoning rioters who tried to upend his 2020 reelection loss. Six weeks ahead of taking office for a new four-year tenure in the White House, Trump seemed emboldened by his victory last month, making him only the second American president elected to a second, nonconsecutive term after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. 'People like me now, you know?' he told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' in an interview conducted Friday in New York and broadcast Sunday. 'It’s different than the first — you know, when I won the first time [in 2016], I wasn’t nearly as popular as this,' he said. 'And one thing that’s very important, in terms of the election, I love that I won the popular vote, and by a lot,' with about a 2.3 million-vote margin in his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris out of the 155 million ballots that were cast. But Trump, a Republican, also lapsed into familiar grievances, refusing as he has for four years to concede he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden because of unfounded claims of fraudulent balloting and vote counting. Asked by NBC anchor Kristen Welker how, in his view, Democrats were able to steal that election but not the one a month ago, Trump said, 'Because I think it was too big to rig.' Trump blamed Biden for the nation’s political divide and heaped insults on his perceived foes, including the nine-member House of Representatives committee that spent more than a year examining the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters trying to block lawmakers from certifying that Biden had won the 2020 election. He called the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the investigative panel 'political thugs and, you know, creeps. For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.' Trump said that on his first day in office he would be 'acting very quickly' to pardon many of the more than 1,200 people convicted of an array of offenses linked to the rioting at the Capitol. Many of them have already completed their prison sentences while others have years to go or have to be tried. He has characterized those imprisoned as 'hostages' and called them 'patriots.' 'These people are living in hell,' he said. Yet Trump said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden. 'I’m not looking to go back into the past,' he said. 'Retribution will be through success.' But he said that if the Senate confirms his choices of former Florida state attorney general, Pam Bondi, as attorney general, and loyal political supporter Kash Patel as FBI director, they would have autonomy in deciding what to investigate and prosecute. Trump described special counsel Jack Smith, who twice indicted him, as 'very corrupt.' Trump centered much of his campaign on closing the southwestern U.S. border with Mexico and said mass deportations will begin quickly. First will be convicted criminals, he said, while other incoming Trump officials have said those with deportation orders will also be among the first to be deported. 'I think you have to do it, and it’s a hard — it’s a very tough thing to do. It’s — but you have to have, you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally,' he said. Trump made no exceptions for families with mixed immigration status, where some family members are in the U.S. legally and some illegally. 'I don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back,' he declared. Trump said the cost and logistical complexity of such a massive deportation plan does not faze him. 'You have no choice,' he said. 'First of all, they’re costing us a fortune. But we’re starting with the criminals, and we’ve got to do it. And then we’re starting with the others, and we’re going to see how it goes.' But he said he would attempt to work with Democratic lawmakers to exempt so-called 'dreamers' from deportation, young children who were brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents and have little connection to their native countries. He also said he will attempt to end birthright citizenship in the U.S., now embedded in the country’s Constitution, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of the legality of their parents being in the U.S. Trump said he would keep a campaign promise to levy tariffs on imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada. He acknowledged that he could not 'guarantee American families won’t pay more' as a result of his plan. 'I can’t guarantee anything,' Trump said. 'I can’t guarantee tomorrow.' He said he is actively trying to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, 'if I can.' He said Kyiv may not get as much military assistance under his administration as it has under Biden. During a political debate in September, Trump declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj16YNRypq0wL	2024-12-08T16:06:38-08:00	
A Defining Moment In The Ukraine War – OpEd	The Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement on Thursday regarding the two attacks by Western long-range weapons on Russian territory on November 19 and 21 and Moscow’s reactive strike on a facility within Ukraine’s defence industrial complex in the city of Dnepropetrovsk with a hitherto unknown non-nuclear hypersonic ballistic missile named Oreshnik. On Friday, at a meeting in the Kremlin with the military top brass, Putin revisited the topic where he clarified that Oreshnik not really at an 'experimental' stage, as Pentagon had determined, but its serial production has actually commenced. And he added, 'Given the particular strength of this weapon, its power, it will be put into service with the Strategic Missile Forces.' He then went on to reveal, 'It is also important that along with the Oreshnik system, several similar systems are currently being tested in Russia. Based on the test results, these weapons will also go into production. In other words, we have a whole line of medium- and shorter-range systems.' Putin reflected on the geopolitical backdrop: 'The current military and political situation in the world is largely determined by the results of competition in the creation of new technologies, new weapons systems and economic development.' Succinctly put, the escalatory move authorised by the US president Joe Biden has boomeranged. Did Biden bite more than he could chew? This is the first thing. The US apparently decided that Putin’s 'red lines' and Russia’s nuclear deterrence were the stuff of rhetoric. Washington was clueless about the existence of a wonder weapon like the Oreshnik in the Russian armoury that is as demonic frightening as a nuclear missile in its sheer destructive apocalyptic potential but will spare human lives. Putin added calmly that Russia intends to give advance notice to civilians to get out of the way before Oreshnik heads for its designated target to annihilate it. The shock and awe in the western capitals speaks for itself. Biden avoided commenting on the issue when asked by reporters. The Oreshnik is not an upgrade of old Soviet-era systems but 'relies entirely on contemporary cutting-edge innovations,' Putin stressed. Izvestia reported that Oreshnik is a new generation of Russian intermediate-range missiles with a range of 2,500-3,000km and potentially extending to 5,000km, but not intercontinental, equipped with multiple independently targeted re-entry vehicles (MIRV) — ie., having separating warheads with individual guidance units. It has a speed between Mach 10 and Mach 11 (exceeding 12,000 kms per hour). The Russian daily Readovka, published from Smolensk, which copiously covers the war, reported that with an estimated 1,500 kgs of combat payload, lifting to a maximum height of 12 km and moving at a speed of Mach 10, the Oreshnik launched from the Russian base at Kaliningrad would strike Warsaw in 1 minute 21 seconds; Berlin, 2 min 35 sec; Paris, 6 min 52 sec; and London, 6 min 56 sec. In his statement on Thursday, Putin said, 'there are no means of countering such weapons today. Missiles attack targets at a speed of Mach 10, which is 2.5 to 3 kilometres per second. Air defence systems currently available in the world and missile defence systems being created by the Americans in Europe cannot intercept such missiles. It is impossible.' Indeed, a terribly beauty is born. For, Oreshnik is not just an effective hypersonic weapon and is neither a strategic weapon nor an intercontinental ballistic missile. But its striking power is such that when used en masse and in combination with other long-range precision systems, its effect and power is on par with strategic weapons. Yet, it is not a weapon of mass destruction — rather, it’s a high-precision weapon. Serial production implies that dozens of Oreshnik are in the process of being deployed, which means that no US / NATO staff group and no Anglo-American target intelligence unit in bunkers in Kiev or Lvov is safe any longer. Oreshnik is also a signal to the incoming US president Donald Trump who is ad nauseam calling for an immediate end-of-war settlement. Oreshnik, ironically, has been developed only as Moscow’s reaction to the hawkish decision by then US president Trump in 2019 to unilaterally withdraw from the 1987 Soviet-American treaty on intermediate range nuclear forces (INF). Hence this also signals that Moscow’s trust in Trump is near zero. To drive home this point, on the very same day Oreshnik emerged out of its silo, Tass carried an unusual interview with a top Russian think tanker affiliated to the foreign ministry and Kremlin — Andrey Sushentsov, program director of the Valdai Discussion Club, dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s MGIMO International Relations Department, and member of the Scientific Council under the Russian Security Council. The following excerpts of the interview, plain-speaking and startling, should scatter the hypothesis that there is something special going on between Trump and Putin: 'Trump is considering ending the Ukrainian crisis, not out of any sympathy for Russia, but because he acknowledges that Ukraine has no realistic chance of winning. His goal is to preserve Ukraine as a tool for US interests, focusing on freezing the conflict rather than resolving it. Consequently, under Trump, the long-term strategy of countering Russia will persist. The US continues to benefit from the Ukrainian crisis, regardless of which administration is in power.' 'The United States has regained its position as the European Union’s top trading partner for the first time in years. It is the Europeans who are bearing the financial burden of prolonging the Ukrainian crisis, while the US has no interest in resolving it. Instead, it is more beneficial for them to freeze the conflict, keeping Ukraine as a tool to weaken Russia and as a persistent hotspot in Europe to maintain their confrontational approach.' 'Trump has made numerous statements that differ from the policies of Joe Biden’s administration. However, the US state system is an inertial structure that resists decisions it deems contrary to American interests, so not all of Trump’s ideas will come to fruition.' 'Trump will have a two-year window before the midterm congressional elections, during which he will have a certain freedom to push his policies through the Senate and the House of Representatives. After that, his decisions could face resistance both domestically and from US allies.' Make no mistake, Russia is under no illusions. Putin will not waver from the conditions he outlined in June for resolving the conflict: the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Donbass and Novorossiya; Kiev’s commitment to abstain from joining NATO; the lifting of all Western sanctions against Russia; and the establishment of a non-aligned, nuclear-free Ukraine. Clearly, this war will continue on its course till it reaches its only logical conclusion, which is Russian victory. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev is spot on when he said in an interview with Al Arabiya yesterday that the use of Oreshnik missile 'changes the course' of the Ukrainian conflict. The Western capitals will have to reconcile with the reality that the scope for escalation of the war is ending. Make no mistake, if another ATAMCS strike inside Russia is attempted, it will have devastating consequences for the West. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic put it nicely: 'If you [NATO] think you can attack everything on Russian territory with Western logistics and weapons without getting a response, and that Putin won’t use whatever weapons he deems necessary, then you either don’t know him or you’re abnormal.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj1gaeiG6aKiZ	2024-12-08T16:05:25-08:00	
From Oblivion To Influence: Rediscovering Milton’s Eikonoklastes ...	Introduction: 'Eikonoklastes' is a polemical work written by John Milton in 1649, directly responding to 'Eikon Basilike,' a work attributed to Charles I that presented the executed king as a pious martyr. Commissioned by the Commonwealth government, Milton's 'Eikonoklastes' aimed to counteract this royalist narrative, defending the actions of the Parliamentarians and justifying the regicide. The book is a substantial treatise, characteristic of 17th-century political and religious discourse, spanning several hundred pages of dense, scholarly prose. Belonging to the genre of polemical literature, 'Eikonoklastes' is a piece of political and religious advocacy. It falls within the broader category of pamphlet literature, a common medium for public debate during the English Civil War and Interregnum. Milton's polemic is intended to persuade and influence public opinion through rigorous argumentation and rhetorical strategies, showcasing his engagement with Puritanism and republicanism. Milton wrote 'Eikonoklastes' in English, making it accessible to a wide audience in England. The language of the text is sophisticated and erudite, reflecting Milton's extensive education and mastery of classical rhetoric. His complex and forceful use of English aims to convince readers through the power of his arguments and the clarity of his prose. The Influence of Religious Forces: Religion played a crucial role in shaping Milton's arguments in 'Eikonoklastes.' As a staunch Puritan, Milton was deeply influenced by the tenets of personal piety, moral rigor, and opposition to religious corruption. These beliefs permeate 'Eikonoklastes,' where Milton critiques the religious hypocrisy of Charles I and argues for a more authentic Christian leadership. His Puritan convictions are evident throughout the text, reflecting his deep-seated belief that true Christian governance must align with scriptural teachings and moral integrity. Milton criticizes the portrayal of Charles I in 'Eikon Basilike' as a saintly martyr, arguing that the king's actions were inconsistent with true Christian values. He writes, 'He who would have thought himself most wronged, and counted it half no less than treason to have been so cited, if this were a question, whether he loved God or no; and yet being able to bring witness of his not loving him, should lose by the verdict.' This critique of Charles's religious hypocrisy is central to Milton's argument, as it undermines the royalist portrayal of the king as a pious and just ruler. Milton exposes the disparity between Charles's public persona and his actual deeds, emphasizing the king's failure to embody the virtues he purportedly espoused. Furthermore, Milton challenges the notion of divine right, asserting that political legitimacy must be based on reason and justice rather than hereditary privilege. He argues that the misuse of religion by monarchs like Charles I undermines true Christian governance and leads to tyranny. Milton writes, 'For it were a kind of treason to his person, and a sacrilege to the commonwealth, to judge that he who is their King should be their enemy.' This critique of the divine right of kings is a recurring theme in 'Eikonoklastes,' reflecting Milton's belief in the separation of religious and political authority. He contends that kings who exploit religious sentiment to bolster their authority are guilty of corrupting the very foundations of Christian ethics and governance. Milton's disdain for the abuse of religious authority by monarchs is evident in his condemnation of Charles's supposed piety. He criticizes Charles I's public prayers as hypocritical, pointing out the inconsistencies between the king's religious posturing and his political actions. 'He that prays for the peace of his people, but does not endeavor to promote it, is not a peacemaker but a deceiver,' Milton writes, highlighting the gap between the king's words and deeds. This moral indictment of Charles I serves to dismantle the sanctified image presented in 'Eikon Basilike,' revealing the king's duplicity and moral failings. Questioning the Divine Right of Kings: Why does Milton vehemently oppose the divine right of kings? For centuries, this doctrine justified the absolute power of monarchs, arguing that their authority was derived directly from God and therefore unquestionable. Milton's critique strikes at the heart of this belief, asserting that political legitimacy must be based on reason and justice rather than hereditary privilege. He contends that when monarchs misuse religion to justify their actions, they undermine true Christian governance and lead their people into tyranny. 'For it were a kind of treason to his person, and a sacrilege to the commonwealth, to judge that he who is their King should be their enemy,' Milton writes, highlighting the betrayal inherent in the misuse of divine right. Political Advocacy and Republicanism: Milton's political beliefs were profoundly shaped by his support for the Commonwealth and republican principles. He believed in the sovereignty of the people and the accountability of rulers, and these beliefs are evident throughout 'Eikonoklastes.' Milton's arguments against tyranny and for rational governance reflect his commitment to republicanism and his opposition to monarchical autocracy. His political philosophy is rooted in the idea that legitimate authority derives from the consent of the governed, rather than divine mandate or hereditary succession. In 'Eikonoklastes,' Milton employs a range of political arguments to justify the execution of Charles I and defend the actions of the Parliament. He critiques the notion of royal inviolability, arguing that kings, like all rulers, must be accountable to the people. Milton states, 'Kings most commonly, though strong in legions, are but weak at arguments; as they who ever have accustomed from the cradle to use their will only as their right hand, their reason always as their left.' This critique of the inherent weakness of monarchical rule underscores Milton's belief in the importance of rational governance and accountability. He portrays kings as being unaccustomed to reasoned debate and reliant on brute force, contrasting this with the rational deliberations of a republican government. Milton also highlights the importance of liberty and the dangers of tyranny. He writes, 'For indeed none can love freedom heartily, but good men; the rest love not freedom, but license.' This statement reflects Milton's belief that only virtuous individuals can truly appreciate and uphold liberty, contrasting with the corrupt and arbitrary rule of tyrants like Charles I. Milton argues that genuine freedom is grounded in moral virtue and rational governance, whereas tyrannical rule represents a perversion of liberty into mere license. Accountability of Rulers: Why must rulers be accountable to the people? Milton's belief in accountability is grounded in his commitment to republican principles. He argues that the power of rulers must be derived from the consent of the governed and that they should be subject to the same laws and moral standards as their subjects. In 'Eikonoklastes,' Milton contends that Charles I's actions had consistently undermined the commonwealth and the welfare of the people. 'When a king instead of defending becomes a destroyer of his people, a patron of evil-doers, and a persecutor of good men,' Milton writes, 'he forfeits his right to govern and becomes an enemy of the state.' This powerful indictment of Charles I's reign serves to justify the regicide and the establishment of a government that prioritizes the common good over monarchical privilege. Narrative Techniques and Rhetorical Strategies: Several narrative techniques are employed by Milton in 'Eikonoklastes' to strengthen his arguments and engage readers. He often uses direct address, speaking to the reader with second-person pronouns to create a sense of immediacy and involvement. This technique helps to draw the reader into the argument and emphasize the urgency of his message. By directly addressing the reader, Milton fosters a sense of personal engagement with the political and moral issues at stake. The book is structured around the method of refutation, systematically deconstructing the claims made in 'Eikon Basilike' point by point, showcasing Milton's analytical skills. This methodical approach allows Milton to address each of Charles's claims in detail, providing a comprehensive rebuttal that dismantles the royalist narrative. By engaging directly with the text of 'Eikon Basilike,' Milton demonstrates his thorough understanding of the arguments he opposes and the rhetorical strategies he employs to counter them. As a devout Puritan, Milton frequently references the Bible, using scriptural allusions to bolster his arguments and align his political stance with religious authority. He employs biblical imagery and quotations to lend moral weight to his critique of Charles I and to frame his political arguments within a broader theological context. This use of scriptural references serves to legitimize Milton's arguments and to appeal to the deeply religious sensibilities of his contemporaries. Engaging the Reader: How does Milton engage the reader effectively? Direct address and rhetorical questions are key techniques. Milton often speaks directly to the reader, using second-person pronouns to create a sense of immediacy and involvement. This direct address fosters a sense of personal engagement, making the reader an active participant in the debate. Additionally, Milton uses rhetorical questions to challenge the assertions of 'Eikon Basilike' and provoke critical thinking. These questions are designed to undermine the royalist narrative and highlight the contradictions in Charles I's portrayal. By posing rhetorical questions, Milton encourages readers to question the validity of the claims made in 'Eikon Basilike' and to consider alternative perspectives. In addition, Milton employs analogies and metaphors to illustrate his points and make complex ideas more relatable. For example, he likens Charles I's manipulation of religious imagery to the actions of a deceiver, enhancing the reader's understanding of his critique. By using vivid and accessible metaphors, Milton makes his arguments more engaging and persuasive. The Reception and Impact of 'Eikonoklastes': 'Eikonoklastes' was published in October 1649, just months after the execution of Charles I, at a time when public opinion was deeply divided. The royalist narrative presented in 'Eikon Basilike' had gained significant traction, and many viewed Charles I as a martyr. Milton's work aimed to counter this narrative and provide a justification for the Parliamentarian actions. While Milton's arguments were persuasive to some, they did not completely neutralize the impact of 'Eikon Basilike.' However, 'Eikonoklastes' contributed to the broader pamphlet wars and the ongoing ideological battle between royalists and Parliamentarians. The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 led to the suppression of works like 'Eikonoklastes.' The re-establishment of royal authority involved a campaign to erase the memory of the Commonwealth and the regicide. Works that defended or justified the execution of Charles I were suppressed, and Milton himself faced persecution for his republican writings. Many copies of 'Eikonoklastes' were destroyed or fell out of circulation during this period of royalist retribution.

Congressional Committee Condemns (Nearly) Every Feature Of The Co...	Are there words in the English language that fully describe what happened during the Covid years that are not already overused? Calamity comes to mind. Disaster. Cataclysm. Ruin, devastation, catastrophe, unprecedented debacle, fiasco, and utter wreckage – all fine words and phrases but nothing quite captures it. Given that, there is probably no report on the thing that can properly characterize the whole of it. On the other hand, it’s worth trying. Meanwhile, the results of Covid commissions of governments around the world have become unbearably predictable. So far they have mostly said their government failed because they didn’t act fast enough, did not enforce lockdowns hard enough, did not communicate and coordinate well enough, and so on. Everyone in the corporate world knows that when a committee reduces all problems to 'communication and coordination' you are being fed a load of bull. So far, it’s been almost entirely bureaucratic blather, and that helps account for the global loss of confidence in political systems. They cannot even be honest about the most catastrophic policies in our lifetimes or several. The amount of corruption, waste, and destruction from this period of our lives, lasting from 2020 until 2023 but with remnants of bad policies all around us, is so unspeakable that not one report has yet been fully honest about what happened, why it happened, who really won and lost, and what this period implies for how vast swaths of the public see the world. Among other astonishing revelations to come from this period was a full presentation of just how many institutions have been corrupted. It was not just governments and certainly not just the elected leaders and career bureaucrats. The problems are very deep and reach more deeply to intelligence agencies, military-based bioweapons systems, and preparedness agencies that guard their activities under the cloak of what is called classified. This is a major reason why so many questions are being left unasked and unanswered. Then we have the ancillary failures in a whole series of additional sectors. The media went along with the nonsense as if they are wholly owned and controlled by government and industry. Industry mostly went along too, at least the highest reaches of it, even as small business was crushed. The tech companies cooperated in a massive censorship operation. The retail end of the pharmaceutical companies enforced the government’s edicts, denying people basic medicines, as did the whole of the medical systems, which heavily enforced mandates on an experimental and failed product mistakenly called a vaccine. Academics were largely silent and public intellectuals fell in line. Most mainline religions cooperated in locking worshippers out. Banks were in on it too. And advertisers. In fact, it’s hard to think of any institution in society that leaves this period untarnished. It’s probably not possible for a government report on the subject to be fully honest. Maybe it is too soon, plus the hooks that created the whole problem are still embedded too deeply. All that said, we’ve got a solid start with the highest-level government report produced to date: After Action Review of the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Lessons Learned and a Path Forward, by the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic as assembled by the US House of Representatives. The report was written by the majority and it shows. Coming in at 550 pages with 2,000-plus footnotes (we have made a physical version available here), the preparation involved hearing from hundreds of witnesses, reading thousands of documents, listening to thousands of reports and interviews, and working at a furious pace for two years. Based on the outline and breadcrumbs of the Norfolk Group, while adding in additional material based on critiques of media and economic policy, it is a comprehensive blast against the public-health features of the pandemic response. The conclusion of the report: nothing worked and everything tried resulted in more damage than the pandemic could ever have achieved on its own. In this sense, and given the low bar of expectations for all such political commissions, every champion of truth, honesty, and freedom should celebrate this report. It is an excellent breaking of the ice around the topic. Note that this report has received very little press attention, which only further underscores the problem. Coming in for heavy criticism: gain-of-function research, the deference to the WHO, the lab-leak coverup, the funding of pharma cutouts, business and school closures, mask mandates, the lack of serious attention to disease monitoring, vaccine mandates, the sloppy approval process, the vaccine injury system, the banning of off-the-shelf therapeutics, social distancing, the rampant fraud in business loans, the effects of monetary policy, and more. The report contains nuggets that we cannot help but praise: Ignored in the report: the rental moratorium, the frenzy of Plexiglas and air filtration, the push for sanitizing all things, the reopening racket designed to prolong lockdowns, domestic capacity restrictions, the division of the workforce between essential and nonessential, the role of CISA and the intelligence agencies, the CDC’s push for mail-in ballots that might have been decisive in the national election, and the astonishing gibberish over the infection fatality and case fatality rates. There is so much more to chronicle and criticize that the report could have been 10 or 100 times as long. To be sure, the report has plenty of problems aside from these exclusions. Operation Warp Speed comes in for praise for saving 'millions' of lives but the citation is to a modeling exercise that assumes what it is trying to prove. Look at the footnote: It’s bad science. The real trouble with this section is not even its incorrect claim that the vaccine saved lives. The core issue is that the whole point of the lockdowns and all that followed was to create conditions for the release of the countermeasure. The plan from the beginning was: lockdown until vaccination. Praising the goal while criticizing the ineffective means diverts the point. This is precisely what was explained to me in the early days in a phone call from a member of George W. Bush’s biosecurity team, a man who now runs a vaccine company. He said we would stay locked down until the world’s population got a shot in the arm. This phone call happened in April 2020. Quite simply, I thought he had lost his mind and hung up. I did not believe that 1) the plan was always to stay in lockdowns until vaccination, and that 2) anyone seriously believed that governments could vaccinate their way out of a wave of respiratory infections insofar as the pathogen had a zoonotic reservoir. The very idea struck me as so preposterous that I was incredulous that an educated and responsible adult could ever advance it. And yet that was precisely the plan all along. Sometime in the last week of February 2020, a global cabal decided to pull the trigger on a worldwide campaign of shock and awe – tapping every asset in civil society for assistance – to bring about worldwide forced medicalization with a new technology. This was never really a public health response. That was only the cover story. This was a coup against science and against democracy, for purposes of industrial and political reset, not just in one nation but all nations at once. I get it: that is an ominous statement and hard to wrap one’s brain around the whole of it. In completely ignoring this point, the Select Subcommittee has missed the forest for the trees. Let’s attempt a different metaphor. Let’s say your car is hijacked in Manhattan and you are thrown in the backseat. The goal is to drive all the way to Los Angeles for a drug deal. You could object to the means and goal but instead you spend the entire trip complaining about potholes, reckless driving, warning of the need for an oil change, and complaining about the bad music playing on the car radio. At the end of the trip, you put out a report to this effect. Do you think that would be strange, to wholly ignore the theft of your car and the destination and purpose of the hijacking and instead focus on all the ways in which the grand larceny could have been smoother and happier for everyone involved? In that spirit, the Subcommittee’s separate recommendations list is weak, leaving governments wholly in charge of anything labeled a pandemic while only suggesting a more cautionary approach that takes into consideration all costs and benefits. For example, it says on travel restrictions: 'It is far easier to undo the restrictions that may have been unneeded than it is to take a ‘wait and see’ approach once the unknown virus of concern has entered our borders and thoroughly spread.' It seems like the core lesson – governments cannot be masters of the microbial kingdom and allowing them to pretend otherwise for purposes of an industrial and political reset cues up a moral hazard that is an ongoing threat to freedom and rights – is not yet learned, or even so much as admitted. We are still being invited to believe that the same people and institutions who created calamity last time should be trusted again next time. And keep in mind: this is the best report yet issued! My friends, we have a very long way to go to absorb the fullness of the reality of what was done to individuals, families, communities, societies, and the whole world. Nor is it truly possible to move on without a full accounting of this disaster. Has it begun? Yes, but there is a very long way to go.

Losing Syria Is A ‘Huge Slap In The Face’ For Russia – Analysis	By Michael Scollon and Frud Bezhan (RFE/RL) -- When Vladimir Putin took the reins of power in a post-Soviet Russia in shambles a quarter-century ago, he immediately set about restoring Moscow's status as a global power. It took 15 years, but Russia heralded its military intervention in the Syrian civil waras proof of its return as a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. Moscow leveraged that image to expand its influence throughout the Middle East and beyond as a counterweight to the West. Now, the fall of the government of President Bashar al-Assad, a key ally of Moscow, has dealt a serious blow to Russia's great-power ambitions. 'Putin's military adventure in Syria was designed to demonstrate that Russia is a great power and can project its influence abroad,' said Phillip Smyth, a Middle East expert. 'Losing Syria is a huge slap in the face for Putin.' Assad's ouster represents not only a reputational hit to Russia but likely a major strategic setback. Syria is home to two major Russia military installations: an air base in Hmeimim and a naval base in Tartus. The latter is Russia's only warm-water naval base outside the former Soviet Union and provides Moscow access to the Mediterranean Sea. 'Russia has used its bases in Syria to project its power both into the eastern Mediterranean and into the broader Middle East,' said Smyth. High-Maintenance Asset Russia's military intervention in Syria in 2015 changed the tide of the war. Moscow's devastating aerial campaigns against rebel positions helped the Syrian Army regain swaths of territory and keep Assad in power. Moscow's Syria campaign came a year after its invasion of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula as well as its support for separatist forces in Ukraine's east. Moscow capitalized on its involvement in both Syria and Ukraine to sell itself as a power capable of challenging the United States, NATO, and the West in general while expanding its global reach from the Mediterranean to Africa and Latin America. Following Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Syria became more of an asset for Moscow, experts say, while also presenting the challenge of maintaining military campaigns on two fronts. With the anticipated fall of Russian military assets in Syria, following the collapse of Assad's government, the task has become even more daunting. Russia is already heavily invested in a major counteroffensive to regain captured territory in its southwestern Kursk region that it lost to Ukraine, to the point that it is relying on help from North Korean troops. At the same time, it is trying to take as much territory as it can in Ukraine's east before possible peace talks. Russia military facilities along the Mediterranean coast in western Syria could be overrun by militants led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and its allies. Aaron Zelin, senior fellow at the Washington Institute, said Russia simply does not have the same firepower at its disposal to protect its assets in Syria. 'It is important to remember that Russia has to deal with its larger war in Ukraine now compared to when they first went in Syria in 2015,' said Zelin. 'Russia also has its assets fighting in sub-Saharan Africa, too. And unlike a decade ago, when Russia had the Wagner Group led by [the deceased Yevgeny] Prigozhin ... Russia doesn't have the same level of capacity or capability to deal with this now in the same way.' Zelin said losing the Tartus naval base, in particular, would be an 'extremely huge loss for Russia.' 'It's Russia's only warm-water port that it can use for its naval activities and power projection,' he said. 'Losing it would essentially cut Russia out of the core of the Middle East.' Moscow did not send ground troops to help Damascus, which fell to the HTS and its allies on December 8. Russia conducted dozens of air strikes since the militants launched their offensive against Assad's forces in late November, but Moscow's limited intervention did little to stop the rebel advance. Russia will pay a huge price for its failure in Syria, experts say. The fall of Assad is a 'major blow to Russia's claim of still being a global power in terms of sustaining military and political influence abroad,' said Hamidreza Azizi, fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. From there, actors in other regions such as Latin America and Africa might 'start rethinking their ties and their reliance on Russia as well,' he said.

Trump Has Strong Mandate For Immigration Reforms – OpEd	By Dalia Al-Aqidi Immigration took center stage in Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, solidifying its role as a defining issue in his political narrative. While the border wall symbolized his immigration stance in 2016, his current platform represents a strategic pivot, emphasizing robust interior enforcement and sweeping deportation policies. This shift, bolstered by discussions among his advisers and key stakeholders, highlights a detailed vision for immediate and large-scale immigration reforms.On his first day in office, President-elect Trump has vowed to reinstate many of the strict border and immigration policies of his previous administration, undoing the measures introduced under President Joe Biden.Among these priorities is the swift removal of undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes within the US. This initiative signals an uncompromising stance aimed at reshaping the country’s approach to immigration enforcement and prioritizing what he views as the restoration of law and order.At the heart of the planned policies is a reintroduction of the 'Remain in Mexico' program, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols. This policy requires asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their immigration cases are processed in US courts — a measure intended to deter unauthorized migration. Additionally, the plan includes imposing stricter limits on asylum applications, revoking protections under Biden’s humanitarian parole programs and rolling back enforcement priorities that shifted the focus away from low-level offenders.These initiatives collectively mark a return to a more aggressive approach to immigration control, which mirrors the hallmark strategies of Trump’s first term. With these policies, the new administration aims to signal a renewed commitment to curbing unauthorized migration and addressing what it perceives as loopholes in the existing system.According to several media outlets, the plan involves an executive order mandating the detention of migrants, effectively eliminating the practice of releasing individuals pending their immigration hearings. Historically, such releases have been a pragmatic response to limited federal detention resources. Trump’s plan seeks to challenge this norm by prioritizing detention at scale, paving the way for an ambitious deportation framework.It is estimated that more than 11 million undocumented immigrants currently reside in the US. Vice President-elect J.D. Vance has proposed a plan under which as many as 1 million individuals could face deportation annually, signaling a potential shift toward intensified immigration enforcement. Supporters argue that this policy would deter unauthorized crossings and strengthen border security. However, critics warn that it could overwhelm detention facilities, exacerbate humanitarian crises and infringe on the rights of asylum seekers. The logistics of implementing such a plan on a national scale also present significant challenges, including resource allocation, legal hurdles and international diplomacy.Trump has announced plans to issue an executive order aimed at redefining the constitutional principle of birthright citizenship, which has long granted automatic citizenship to children born within the US. Under his proposal, federal agencies could enforce stricter criteria, requiring that at least one parent be an American citizen or lawful permanent resident before issuing a passport or social security number. This significant shift in immigration policy would represent a departure from decades of legal precedent. However, any attempt to revoke or alter birthright citizenship is expected to face intense legal scrutiny and substantial challenges in federal courts. The new policies would introduce stricter measures, such as expanded background checks, prolonged administrative processing times and a higher rate of visa denials. Additionally, prior approvals for visa extensions might no longer be given the benefit of the doubt, even when the circumstances remain unchanged. Requiring biometrics for dependents, mandating more interviews for green card applicants and operating with reduced staffing levels could further slow the already lengthy adjudication processes.Under the Biden administration, immigrant visas for people with exceptional skills or whose work benefits the US became more popular, especially for professionals in areas like artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. While the rules for these visas may not change, a second Trump administration might take a stricter view of what counts as 'national interest' or 'benefiting the US,' making it harder for some to qualify.During the first Trump administration, employers seeking H-1B visas — a temporary nonimmigrant visa enabling foreign professionals to work in the US in specialized fields — faced heightened scrutiny as the government significantly increased the issuance of so-called requests for evidence. These requests questioned entry-level wages, creating obstacles for businesses hiring international workers. Meanwhile, the administration sought to raise the required salaries for visa holders and green card applicants. Certain professions, such as computer programmers, were excluded from the 'specialty occupations' classification.The proposed policies have sparked intense debate, highlighting the complexity and emotional weight of immigration reform. Nevertheless, it is essential to emphasize that Congress will hold significant authority in shaping any proposed large-scale deportation efforts. Its decisions on whether to approve or deny funding will be crucial in determining the feasibility of such initiatives. Furthermore, Congress is positioned as a vital safeguard, ensuring accountability if the new administration seeks to reallocate funds from other federal programs to finance deportations without explicit approval.The growing concern over the large flow of undocumented immigrants into cities across the US has amplified the need for these measures. More than 77 million Americans voted for Trump, signaling widespread support for stricter immigration policies aimed at addressing these challenges. This strong backing from the electorate highlights the urgency many citizens feel about restoring order at the border and managing the impact of illegal immigration on their communities.

In The Rawalpindi-Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Conflict, Pakistan’s T...	From the statement issued by Pakistan army’s media wing Inter Services Public Relations [ISPR] on conclusion of the 84th Formation Commanders Conference held last Thursday, it’s apparent that the spectre of 'propaganda and disinformation' against the country’s armed forces continues to give the Pakistan military’s top brass sleepless nights. This is understandable because in a country where the army is considered a holy cow by the people, anything that impinges on the military's exalted status is unacceptable as this can become a serious threat to the army’s phenomenal overreach and extra-constitutional authority. Hence it is evident that Pakistan army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir’s emphatic 'any effort to weaken our armed forces is akin to weakening the state' declaration is merely a cunning ploy to invoke nationalism for preserving Rawalpindi’s exclusive turf. Similarly, while there could well be 'foreign hand' involvement of in social media campaigns against the Pakistan army, but overplaying this issue to the extent of suggesting that this trend has acquired gargantuan proportions solely due to foreign intervention is clearly an attempt by Rawalpindi to conceal its own misdoings and highhandedness. Gen Munir wants the government to 'check unfettered and unethical use of freedom of expression to spew venom, lies and sow the seeds of polarisation' and maintains that 'those spreading fake news for vested political/financial interests need to be identified and brought to justice.' His observations and recommendations do create the misleading impression that even though the Pakistan army is being systematically demonised by 'vested political/financial interests,' the government unfortunately continues to remain a silent and inactive spectator. Readers would recall that after facing mounting criticism, Rawalpindi had in 2021 craftily orchestrated an amendment in Pakistan Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure through insertion of Section 500-A. This section which criminalises ridiculing of the armed forces states, 'Whosoever intentionally ridicules, brings into disrepute or defames the Armed Forces of Pakistan or a member thereof, he shall be guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or fine which may extend to five hundred thousand rupees, or with both.' That the Pakistan military is perhaps the only army within the community of democratic nations that needs legal protection against slander from its own countrymen, does convey a lot! With no clarity on what constitutes ridiculing, bringing into disrepute or defaming the armed forces or its members, this draconian law gives the army [which has its own full-fledged legal setup] the opportunity to take offenders to court. So, instead of initiating legal action against those who he perceives are maligning the army, why is Gen Munir unnecessarily complaining against what he considers to be government apathy and the army's helplessness? Isn’t it his moral responsibility to uphold the image of the army? However, for the army to blame the government is nothing new in Pakistan. [Didn't former Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa say that the 1971 debacle which led to creation of Bangladesh was 'a political failure and not a military one'?] The ISPR statement further mentions that 'This pre-planned coordinated and premeditated propaganda reflects the continuity of a sinister design by certain political elements as an attempt to drive a wedge between the public & Armed Forces and institutions of Pakistan.' [Emphasis added]. Though ISPR hasn’t named the 'political elements' that it accuses of spreading propaganda, it’s obvious that this barb is directed at Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf [PTI] party. This is yet another classic example of Rawalpindi’s unending interference in politics, which is the prime reason behind its burgeoning unpopularity. Remember former Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s matter-of-fact admission that 'The main reason for this [public criticism] is the involvement of the army in politics for the last 70 years, which is unconstitutional'? Gen Munir is enraged by PTI’s accusation that the Pakistan army and Rangers [which are commanded by army officers] had opened fire at protesters in D Chowk on November 26 causing death of 12 workers and injuries to several others. This is evident from ISPR’s statement that the 'Forum noted with concern the malicious propaganda done in the aftermath of the lawful deployment of the army in the capital to secure key government buildings and provide [a] safe and secure environment for the valued visiting dignitaries.' However, does this anger justify Rawalpindi’s getting into a one-on-one slugfest with PTI and creating a mess? Both the government and the Pakistan army may deny having fired live bullets at protesters but there’s credible evidence that suggests otherwise. In an Al Jazeera video, senior journalist Kamal Hyder reporting from ‘ground zero’ clearly mentions use of live bullets by security forces and even draws attention of listeners to what’s undoubtedly the repetitive staccato of semi-automatic rifle fire in the background. He also confirms not having seen any armed protesters at D Chowk.Then there are several horrific videos on social media that show civilians with gunshot wounds. Most importantly, abduction of TV anchor and You-tuber Matiullah Jan and his colleague Saqib Bashir by men in black uniforms while they were collecting data on protester casualties from Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences and booking Jan on terrorism and narcotics related charges also raises serious doubts regarding the official claim that no bullets were fired at protesters. The One of the most gruesome video that’s bound to generate anti-army sentiments amongst the people is that of an elderly man offering prayers mercilessly being pushed down from atop a container by Rangers. Why has Rawalpindi maintained a stoic silence and failed to take cognisance of this criminal act by soldiers commanded by Pakistan army officers is indeed intriguing and provides a reason for public resentment against the Pakistan army. Dawn in its December 7 editorial has aptly observed that 'The ruling party’s-and the establishment’s [Pakistan army]-disagreements with the PTI are political and need to be resolved through political means, while terrorist groups pose an existential threat to the nation…. It is unwise, therefore, to link the PTI to militant groups. Both the civilian and uniformed leaderships need to focus all their efforts on countering the terrorist threat… the effort to brand the PTI or other critics of the state as ‘terrorists’ will only divert attention from the real threat.' Whether Gen Munir will heed to this sagacious suggestion however remains a million dollar question.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj-9Gx40GDFmU	2024-12-08T15:57:53-08:00	
Indian Foreign Secretary’s Visit To Bangladesh Critical For Resto...	The Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri will be in Dhaka for 12 hours on December 9 to meet his counterpart and also the Chief Advisor to the Interim Government Dr. Muhammad Yunus. Though described as being part of a routine 'structured dialogue' between the two countries, Vikram Misri's talks with the Interim Government in Dhaka will decide if India and Bangladesh will return to being friends or will continue to be antagonistic. After Sheikh Hasina was ousted from the Premiership of Bangladesh and was forced to flee to India on August 5, India-Bangladesh relations went down the chute. It has been going further down consistently since then, with serious charges being bandied by both sides, not officially, but by loud mouths in political parties and YouTube channels. Demonstrations are held in various cities in both countries increasing the pitch and adding fuel to the fire. Interested parties in India have, for their own political gain, interpreted the July-August student-led mass movement against Hasina's oppressive rule into a movement against the Hindu minority in Bangladesh and against India with whom the Hindus have been linked. At the same time, some radical Islamic forces in Bangladesh like the Jamaat-e-Islami and Hefazat-i-Islam saw in the July-August political crisis and its uncertain aftermath, an ideal opportunity to attack the Hindus who they dub as infidels with only a subordinate place in Islamic Bangladesh. Thus, a popular, though violent, movement, against a dictatorial ruler, turned out to be a Hindu-Muslim and an India-Bangladesh conflict. The crisis has made the Hindus of Bangladesh (8% of the 170 million), fear attacks from the Muslims. And the Muslim majority are fearful of an Indian attempt to twist the arms of the weak Interim Government of Prof. Muhammad Yunus in order to restore Hasina's rule. The popular belief in Bangladesh has been that Hasina was powerful because she had India's full backing. Hackles went up in New Delhi when Bangladeshi authorities said that Hasina would be extradited and tried in the International Criminal Court (ICC). As per Dhaka Tribune, a complaint had been lodged against Hasina and 24 others in the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands for allegedly violating human rights. Forces opposed to Hasina saw her relations with India during her 15-year tenure as having been patently asymmetrical and skewed in favour of powerful India. A blind eye was turned to the fact that Bangladesh too had gained a lot and that Bangladesh would not have been able to grow and even survive without a close economic and people to people ties with India. Bangladesh is surrounded on three sides by India and the Bay of Bengal in the fourth side. Geopolitical Dimension The crisis had acquired geopolitical dimensions as well. Among Indians, the attacks on the Hindus in Bangladesh rekindled fears of radical Islamism. They rekindled Islamophobia in the West. Some British MPs condemned the attacks on the Hindus in Bangladesh. US President-elect Donal Trump's sharp comment in favour of the Hindus in Bangladesh has created apprehensions about an US-India axis to thwart the August 5 regime change in Bangladesh. Indians see the ouster of Hasina as a Pakistani-US plot aimed at ending India's monopoly over Bangladesh. Bangladesh's step of easing the granting of visas to Pakistanis and also improving trade with Pakistan are seen as the development of an anti-Indian axis. The India-Bangladesh conflict is being exacerbated by unverified reports of India deploying troops on the order and Bangladesh using Turkish drones over the border region to check on any hostile activities. There have attacks on the Bangladesh mission in Tripura and demonstrations in Dhaka against the Indian mission. Bangladeshi and Indian flags were burnt. For Indian Hindus, the latest provocation has been the arrest of a Hindu monk, Chinmoy Krishna Das, denial of bail to him, and the postponement of the hearing of the case to January 2025. He has no lawyer to defend him because volunteers had allegedly been beaten up. India charged the Interim Government of dereliction of duty in this matter.. It is amidst this volatile situation on both sides of the border that India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri would be in Dhaka on December 9 for talks with his counterpart and other leaders. Though described as being part of a routine 'structured dialogue' between the two countries, Misri's talks with the Interim Government in Dhaka will decide if India and Bangladesh will return to being friends or will continue to be antagonistic. Monk and Minorities Misri is expected to address India's concerns regarding rising violence against Hindus and other minorities, which is a political hot potato in India especially with the Hindu nationalist government ensconced in Delhi. 'Our position is clear—the interim government must fulfil its responsibility to protect minorities,' said Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on November 29. Misri is expected to seek a fair trial forcefully in his meetings in Dhaka. Backed as it is by the US in this matter, India would expect a fair trial for the Hindu monk. Business to the Rescue Meanwhile, despite the tension, trade between the two countries has not been perceptibly affected though there were calls for the boycott of Indian goods from the Bangladeshi side and blockades from the Indian side. Some Indian hospitals and hotels declared that they would not entrain Bangladeshis but later business sense prevailed and the notices were withdrawn. Indian and Bangladeshi authorities restored trade by reopening the largest land port between the two countries, which connects Petrapole (India) and Benapole (Bangladesh). This was done after India closed the six major land ports between the two countries in response to August forced change of government in Bangladesh. The speedy restoration of trade was a result of the economic interdependence. India and Bangladesh have a close economic relationship, with India being Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner. Bangladesh is almost entirely surrounded by India, sharing 94% of its 4,367 km-long border with it. Bangladesh relies on India for many supplies, including rice, wheat, cotton, iron and steel, electronic equipment and textile for its garment industry. Saner Voices Meanwhile, saner voices in both India and Bangladesh have called for restraint while being firm on fundamentals. Ambassador Harsh Vardhan Shingla, a former Indian Foreign Secretary, told an Indian TV channel that India-Bangladesh relations had a win-win quality as both nations had gained. Bangladesh needs India for its economic growth and survival, surrounded as it is by India on three sides. And India needs Bangladesh for its security and defence against separatism in the North East India and expansionist radical Islam. In Bangladesh, Zillur Rahman, executive director at the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS), wrote in The Daily Star: 'The worst thing Dr Muhammad Yunus' interim government can do is appear sympathetic to any side of this ongoing culture war. What Bangladesh needs right now is justice and a path to healing. The problem lies herein that justice and revenge are often impossible to distinguish.' Rahman further said: 'At present, no one can ignore the rise in vitriolic rhetoric targeting certain minority groups and Indigenous communities. This escalation has left these groups feeling frustrated and fearful, prompting some to resort to their own brand of vitriolic, populist, and anti-establishment sentiment. What is deeply concerning is that individuals carrying such radical views may now have the ear of some of the advisers.' 'At the moment, long unresolved divisions in society are catalysing due to the machinations of subversive foreign and domestic factors. This kind of division only worsens due to rampant misinformation pushed on social media without any accountability.' Rahman appealed to the Interim Government to remain above the fray of the culture war and focus squarely on its mandate and stop the public humiliation of groups or institutions not directly linked to the previous regime. 'Such actions would alienate important segments of society and deepen existing divisions, creating unnecessary distractions when the focus should remain on healing and rebuilding.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj0I_fWHgC03e	2024-12-08T15:55:58-08:00	
Why Is Russia Expanding Its Military Presence In Libya? – OpEd	The Telegraph's analysis of air bases in Libya reveals the presence of military transport aircraft, updated runways, reinforced perimeter defenses, and new buildings. Russia is now landing military aircraft in Libya on newly refurbished runways as part of its rapid expansion in Africa. The analysis conducted by The Telegraph at three Libyan air bases indicates the presence of Russian military transport aircraft, updated runways, reinforced perimeter defenses, and newly constructed buildings. Russia's military presence in Libya is growing significantly due to the developing partnership between General Khalifa Haftar, who commands the eastern and southern regions of the country, and the Russian president. The refurbishment of the airstrip has enhanced the base's ability to efficiently receive and launch military aircraft. Russian air operations are ongoing at the Brak al-Shati and al-Jufra bases, with satellite imagery showing active aircraft movements and frequent operations, suggesting a continuous transfer of supplies. The al-Qardabiya base is currently undergoing extensive renovations, including runway improvements and reinforced defenses, indicating a strategic move to expand and strengthen its defensive capabilities. Libya serves as a pivotal location for Russia's expanding operations in Africa, opening up opportunities for further access to countries such as Sudan, Mali, Chad, and the Central African Republic. By establishing military control in Libya, Russia can extend its sphere of influence from the eastern Mediterranean, where it already holds coastal positions in Syria, to the southern Mediterranean through Libya. Diplomatic relations between Moscow and Tripoli began on September 4, 1955. In December 1991, when Libya announced its official recognition of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, relations began to develop after Muammar Gaddafi took power. Relations were based on establishing projects in late 1990, and political contacts between the two countries became active. Gaddafi visited the Russian Federation in 2000 and 2001. Relations developed in April 2004 with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. On October 31, 2008, the first visit of the leader of the Libyan revolution, Muammar Gaddafi, to Moscow took place to conclude an agreement between the Russian and Libyan governments in the field of using nuclear energy and establishing a joint bank. Memoranda of Understanding were signed, aiming to... Russia's position emerged after the February 17 revolution, as the Russian Foreign Ministry called on all parties in Libya to find a peaceful solution through national dialogue to put an end to the violence. Russia also criticized the military intervention led by NATO in the Libyan civil war, although it chose not to use its veto in the UN Security Council to prevent this. The Russian Foreign Ministry announced on September 1, 2011, that Moscow recognized the Libyan National Transitional Council as the current authority in the country. Legal contracts and agreements began, such as signing the agreement on trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation and the agreement to form a bilateral government committee on trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation, and they cooperated in the field of oil and gas, while military cooperation came after the revolution. Alexander Fomin, head of the Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, announced on June 27, 2012, that Russia is counting on resuming the supply of weapons and military equipment to Libya and other countries with which military-technical cooperation was interrupted due to the deterioration of the political situation there. Tripoli - The strengthening of military cooperation between the Libyan National Army, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and Russia raises great American and Western concerns about the penetration of Russian influence in North Africa, in particular, and the conclusion of joint military agreements, as well as talk about Moscow's intention to establish a naval base in the east of the country. Russia has intervened in the Libyan crisis for years, as it supported the Libyan National Army forces in the fight against the National Accord forces, a support that raised Washington's concerns and was among the reasons that thwarted efforts to control the capital, Tripoli, and liberate the western region from the influence and dominance of the militias. Wagner elements, whose numbers range between 2,000 and 2,500, are stationed in several military sites in Libya. Russia established a military naval base in Libya, which has raised concerns in the West. Russia is providing expertise to strengthen the sovereignty and independence of the Libyan state and its armed forces. Within the framework of this cooperation, 250 students and officers were sent to study in military academies in the Russian Federation, including 100 students and officers in Russian naval academies. Russia has bolstered its military presence in Libya by incorporating the Wagner paramilitary forces into a broader strategy. Moscow aims to create a more open defense industry with the Libyan parties as part of a plan to destabilize the southern wing of NATO. Washington emphasizes its efforts to enhance military cooperation with Libya to combat terrorism, organized crime, and smuggling. A military expert close to the situation commented on these developments, stating, 'Russian moves indicate a long-term strategy to strengthen Russian influence in the region, focusing on developing crucial air capabilities for military and geopolitical balance. Renovation operations at Russian air bases like Brak al-Shati and Jufra are key in maintaining Russian logistical operations and their role in the Libyan military scene.' Russia has strategically utilized Libya as a new location, taking advantage of governance issues and corruption. Satellite images, local investigations, and interviews reveal Russian forces upgrading facilities at the Brak al-Shatti military base. Russian military planes have been landing at Brak and making maritime deliveries through the port of Tobruk. The European Council on Foreign Relations estimates thousands of tonnes of weapons have been delivered to the al-Jufra facility. Russian forces have fortified the al-Qardabiyah air base, revamping runways, and enhancing perimeter defenses. They also train Gen Haftar's forces at the base. Russian troop numbers, which peaked at 3,000 in 2020, are now around 2,000 personnel, with a return to previous levels expected. Ultimately, Russia stands to gain significant military cooperation, political power, status, and recognition through engagement in Libya, increasing their overall strength.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzjzpIxaHo2Lky	2024-12-08T15:54:40-08:00	
Developments In Syria: Regional Dynamics And Implications For Tur...	Recent political and military developments in Syria suggest a potential shift in regional power dynamics. Reports citing Kremlin sources claim that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his family have sought asylum in Moscow, sparking new debates about Russia's continued presence in Syria. The Potential Russian Withdrawal and Power Vacuum in the South The extent to which Russia will maintain its military presence at strategic sites such as Deir ez-Zor, Khmeimim Airbase, and Tartus Naval Base remains uncertain. A withdrawal from these locations, coupled with Israel's ongoing territorial expansion beyond the Golan Heights, could create a significant security vacuum in southern Syria. Russia's silence on Israel's actions in the Golan region further fuels speculation about its diminishing influence in the area. Uncontrolled Movements at the Lebanon-Syria Border.... Unregulated activity along the Lebanon-Syria border has reportedly accelerated the return of Syrian refugees from Lebanon to their homeland. However, the uncoordinated and insecure nature of these returns raises concerns about the potential for chaos in the region. Meanwhile, Turkey's border policy contrasts sharply: while Syrians under temporary protection are allowed to make permanent returns, those wishing to re-enter after leaving are denied, highlighting differing border management approaches. The Rise of HTS and the Risk of an Afghanistan-Style Administration.... The leadership of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), with its Taliban-linked background, raises concerns about the emergence of an Afghanistan-style regime along Turkey's southern border. HTS's efforts to establish a governance model based on Sharia principles in the territories under its control threaten to create further instability in the region. The growing strength of radical elements poses a long-term security challenge for Turkey. Turkey's Security Policies.... Turkey must adopt a more proactive approach to address both the return of refugees and cross-border security risks. As regional power dynamics continue to evolve rapidly, Turkey's collaboration with international actors to enhance border security and strengthen its regional influence is crucial. The current situation in Syria underscores the need for Turkey to develop a comprehensive strategy addressing both humanitarian and security challenges. It is imperative to closely monitor how these regional developments will shape Turkey's position moving forward.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj34u0l1Tok2g	2024-12-08T15:53:16-08:00	
Armenia: PM Pashinyan Insists Country Has Irrevocably Broken With...	By Ani Avetisyan (Eurasianet) -- Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan insists his country’s break with the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) has passed the 'point of no return.' But Russian officials are playing a waiting game, apparently believing Moscow’s gravitational force remains sufficiently strong to prevent Yerevan from escaping its orbit. Speaking at a parliamentary session in Yerevan on December 4, Pashinyan reiterated that Armenia now considers itself effectively outside the military alliance, having suspended its participation and choosing not to veto documents under discussion at the CSTO’s most recent meeting. He also criticized other CSTO members for failing to fulfill their treaty obligations by not coming to Armenia’s aid during the Second Karabakh War, which resulted in Azerbaijan’s reconquest of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. 'We have fulfilled all our allied obligations accurately, both morally, politically, and legally, but the allied obligations towards us have not been fulfilled,' the Armenpress news agency quoted Pashinyan as saying. 'In a difficult moment, they [the CSTO] left us alone, they abandoned us, and yes, there are opinions that we were betrayed.' The CSTO came into being in 1992 comprising six former Soviet republics — Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Envisioned as a counterbalance to NATO, the alliance was meant to ensure collective security among its members. But for many Armenians, the CSTO is now a symbol of unfulfilled promises. Pashinyan’s efforts to sever ties with the CSTO are part of a broader effort to move Armenia toward integration with Western political, economic and security institutions, and out from under Russia’s security and economic umbrella. Russia’s response to Pashinyan’s latest verbal salvo was relatively muted. On December 5, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the CSTO had not received any official communication from Armenian leader concerning the country’s organizational status, adding that Armenia remains a welcome member of the group. 'We hear these rumors that the prime minister of Armenia spoke and discussed many things on this topic in the parliament,' Lavrov told journalists. 'We are convinced that making the most of [CSTO] membership is in the interests of Armenia’s security. Russia and other CSTO members have not taken and are not going to take any action that will be perceived as closing the doors to Yerevan.' Earlier, at a CSTO summit in Kazakhstan on November 28, Russian leader Vladimir Putin expressed a belief that Armenia ultimately would not quit the CSTO, suggesting that Pashinyan’s statements were aimed at a domestic audience, motivated by internal factors relating to Armenia’s crushing defeat in the Karabakh conflict. He added that it would have been improper for the CSTO to intervene in the Karabakh conflict.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj4pSyrRivL-D	2024-12-08T15:52:31-08:00	
Macron Brings Together Trump, Zelenskyy Ahead Of Notre-Dame Cerem...	(EurActiv) -- US President-elect Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy held talks in Paris on Saturday (7 December), brought together by a grand ceremony to mark the reopening of Notre-Dame Cathedral. Macron convened the trilateral meeting ahead of an evening event he was hosting to celebrate the cathedral's restoration five years after it was ravaged by fire. President Zelenskyy and European leaders have been concerned that Trump, who takes office next month, could withdraw US military aid to Ukraine at a crucial juncture in Kyiv's battle to repel Russia. Zelenskyy said the meeting was 'good and productive' and that the three men agreed to continue working together. 'President Trump is, as always, resolute. I thank him,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media platform X. 'We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way.' Trump was on his first trip overseas since winning last month's presidential election and the visit to Paris was seen as offering Macron an early opportunity to play the role of mediator between Europe and the incoming president, a role the French leader has relished in the past. Macron is a strong supporter of the NATO alliance and Ukraine's fight, while Trump feels European nations need to pay more for their common defence. He has said a negotiated settlement is needed to end the Ukraine war. Arriving at the Elysée Palace, Trump told Macron they had enjoyed 'really great success' working together during his first term in office. 'And it certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now. And we'll be talking about that,' Trump added. Trump gave Zelenskyy a firm handshake and patted him on the back before Macron stood between them and Trump smiled for the camera. The meeting between the three men lasted about 20 minutes. By inviting Trump to the reopening of Notre-Dame, Macron was repeating a personalized approach that had some limited success during Trump's first term, said Heather Conley, senior adviser to the board of the German Marshall Fund, which promotes US-European ties. 'Mr. Macron knows Mr. Trump greatly appreciates the pomp, circumstance and grandeur of state and he provides it to him in abundance,' Conley said. Trump later joined world leaders, royals and business tycoons for a ceremony that got underway with the tolling of Notre-Dame's great bourdon bell. Trump, who will be sworn in on 20 January, has already held discussions with a number of world leaders and members of his team are trying to get up to speed on a number of world crises, including Ukraine and the Middle East. Global spectacle Trump, a Republican, was in power when Notre-Dame was devastated by fire in 2019 and visited France four times while president from 2017-2021, including D-Day anniversary ceremonies in 2019. 'Symbolically, both Mr. Trump's presidency and Notre-Dame have been restored in approximately the same time period. His visit to Paris is also the opening salvo of his return to the world stage, further diminishing the final days of the Biden administration,' Conley said. President Joe Biden's wife, first lady Jill Biden, was representing the United States at the Notre-Dame event. Republican strategist Doug Heye said Trump would convey a statesman-like position in Paris. 'It's not images of him at Mar-a-Lago,' Heye said, referring to Trump's Florida home where he has spent the bulk of his time since the election. 'This is the biggest event of the world and he'll be peer-to-peer with other leaders.' Macron, who is grappling with a deep political crisis at home after his government was ousted by parliament this week, pursued a non-confrontational approach toward Trump during the latter's first term, hoping that by engaging with him he could win concessions. But as the years passed, policy decisions on climate, taxation and Iran in particular caused friction between the two leaders. By the end it was a more fractious relationship. There could well be disputes in Trump's second administration, fueled by Trump's desire to impose sweeping tariffs on Europe and other US trade partners, and disagreement over how to handle the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Macron invited Trump to the annual Bastille Day military parade in Paris in July 2017, a spectacle that inspired Trump to order up his own military parade in Washington to mark America's Independence Day in 2019. Trump hosted Macron at a White House state dinner in 2018, but a year later the two quarrelled over comments Macron made about the state of NATO. 'Trump coming to Paris is a 'good coup' by Emmanuel Macron,' said Gérard Araud, a former French ambassador to Washington. 'It is indispensable to have a direct relationship with the only man who counts in the Trump administration, Trump himself.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj0-bWcJSA7qf	2024-12-08T15:51:22-08:00	
The Fall Of Damascus: How Opposition Forces Toppled Assad’s Stron...	Syria's civil war has reached a historic turning point, with opposition forces capturing most of Damascus, the capital and symbol of Bashar al-Assad's regime. In a series of rapid advances across key provinces, the opposition dismantled decades of authoritarian rule, culminating in a dramatic retreat of regime forces from strategic sites. The developments mark not only a significant shift in the civil war but also the end of 61 years of Baath Party dominance. The Road to Damascus: A Swift Advance The opposition's march toward Damascus was part of a coordinated offensive launched in late November 2024. The Syrian Free Army, alongside allied anti-regime groups, made substantial gains in northern and southern Syria, effectively encircling the regime's remaining strongholds. Beginning in Aleppo, opposition forces swiftly captured Idlib province by November 30, before turning their focus southward. By early December, opposition groups had taken control of Hama and Homs, key provinces along the route to Damascus. These victories were achieved with minimal resistance, as regime forces retreated or were overwhelmed by the speed and scale of the opposition's advance. On December 3, opposition fighters reached the outskirts of Damascus, their arrival marked by images of abandoned regime military equipment scattered along highways. By December 6, they had entered the heart of the capital, encountering little to no resistance. Damascus Falls: A Capital in Chaos The fall of Damascus was sudden and decisive. Protests erupted in multiple neighborhoods on the night of December 2, with demonstrators occupying key locations such as the Defense Ministry, Interior Ministry, and the international airport. The regime's forces, already weakened by earlier losses, abandoned these critical sites without a fight. By the morning of December 3, opposition fighters had taken control of central Damascus. The whereabouts of President Bashar al-Assad remain unknown, with rumors suggesting he fled to Homs or another regime stronghold. In a televised statement, the opposition announced the liberation of the capital and the overthrow of Assad's 24-year rule. One of the most symbolic moments came with the storming of Sednaya Prison, notorious for its association with regime atrocities. Demonstrators freed hundreds of detainees, many of whom had been held for years under brutal conditions. A Regime in Retreat: Key Losses Across Syria The collapse of the Assad regime's control in Damascus was preceded by a series of significant losses across Syria: Aleppo and Idlib: By November 30, opposition forces had seized most of Aleppo's city center and established dominance in Idlib province, a critical stronghold in the north. Hama and Homs: Intense clashes on December 1 resulted in the capture of Hama's city center, followed by rapid advances into Homs, a gateway to the capital. Southern Provinces: In the south, opposition groups captured Daraa, Suwayda, and Quneitra by December 5, solidifying their hold near the Jordanian border. Tel Rifaat: On December 1, the Syrian National Army launched 'Operation Dawn of Freedom,' liberating Tel Rifaat in Aleppo's countryside from PKK/YPG forces. The regime's forces retreated toward Damascus, abandoning positions in settlements such as Khan Sheikh, Zakyah, and Sasa in the southwestern countryside. Despite regrouping efforts, the regime was unable to halt the opposition's advance. End of an Era: The Fall of the Baath Party The capture of Damascus marks the end of the Baath Party's 61-year rule in Syria. The party came to power in 1963 through a military coup, and Hafez al-Assad consolidated control in 1970, ushering in decades of authoritarian rule. Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father in 2000, continuing the party's grip on power. The collapse of the Assad regime represents a dramatic reversal for a government that once held firm control over the nation. The uprising, which began in 2011 as a response to violent suppression of pro-democracy protests, has now culminated in the dismantling of the regime's power structure. The Humanitarian Crisis: Freedoms and Challenges The opposition's victories have been celebrated as a liberation, but the humanitarian challenges remain immense. The release of prisoners from facilities like Sednaya highlights the regime's history of human rights abuses, but it also underscores the need for justice and reconciliation in a deeply divided society. Civilian populations in newly liberated areas face ongoing threats, including the remnants of regime forces and the challenges of rebuilding infrastructure. International humanitarian organizations have called for urgent aid to address the crisis. International Reactions: Calls for Political Transition The international community has responded with cautious optimism to the fall of Damascus. UN Special Envoy for Syria, Geir O. Pedersen, has urged immediate political talks to implement Security Council Resolution 2254, which outlines a roadmap for peace and governance in Syria. 'The need for an orderly political transition has never been more urgent,' Pedersen stated at the Doha Forum 2024. He emphasized the importance of reducing tensions, protecting civilians, and forming inclusive transitional arrangements. Pedersen's efforts have garnered support from key international stakeholders, including Türkiye, Iran, Russia, and Western nations. However, the path to a stable political future in Syria remains fraught with challenges. A Nation Transformed: Looking Ahead The opposition's capture of Damascus marks a turning point in Syria's civil war, but it is not the end of the conflict. The country remains deeply divided, with competing factions and external powers vying for influence. As Syria enters a new chapter, the challenges of governance, reconstruction, and reconciliation loom large. The fall of the Assad regime offers an opportunity for renewal, but it also demands unity and vision from Syria's leaders and its people. The story of Damascus's fall is one of resilience and hope, but also of the immense cost of conflict. As the dust settles, Syria stands at a crossroads, its future yet to be written.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj3Tvrnb1zfTP	2024-12-08T15:49:45-08:00	
Nations Call For Stability, End Of Fighting In Syria	Nations have called for stability and an end of fighting in Syria after president Bashar Assad fled Damascus and militants took control of the capital, ending his 24-year rule. Egypt has called on all parties in Syria to preserve the capabilities of the state and national institutions, the Egyptian foreign ministry said on Sunday, following the surprise ousting of Assad. The foreign ministry, in the first comments on the situation in Syria from an Arab government, said it was following the situation with great care, affirming its support for the Syrian people and the country’s sovereignty and unity. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Sunday that international and regional actors should ensure a smooth transition from the Assad government of after Islamist-led militants took Damascus. 'We have to work very hard... with Syrian people, not just Turkiye, but also regional actors, the international actors, to make sure that there is a good and smooth transition period, no more harm to the civilian people,' Fidan said at the Doha Forum in Qatar. In a press conference, Fidan said the Syrian people were not in a position to rebuild on their own and international actors and regional powers had to act with prudence and preserve the country’s territorial integrity. Terrorist organizations must not be allowed to take advantage of the situation, he added. 'As of this morning, Syria has reached a stage where Syrian people will shape the future of their own country. Today there is hope,' Fidan said. 'The new (Syrian) administration must be established in an orderly manner, the principle of inclusiveness must never be compromised, there must never be a desire for revenge... It is time to unite and reconstruct the country,' he added. Asked about the whereabouts of Assad, Fidan said he believed he was out of the country. Germany’s top diplomat called the fall of Assad 'a great relief' for the people of war-torn country, while warning against radicalization. 'The end of Assad represents for millions of people in Syria a great relief,' said Annalena Baerbock, adding, 'the country must not now fall into the hands of other radicals, whatever form they take.' Jordan affirms the importance of preserving the unity and security of Syria in light of the fast-developing recent events, the government said on Sunday. Jordan added that bolstering the state of security in the region 'is being worked on', according to Petra News Agency. Jordan underscored its dedication to safeguarding Syria’s security, stability, and territorial integrity, and further emphasized the urgency of restoring the functionality of Syria’s national institutions, Petra reported. France meanwhile welcomed news of the fall of Assad and called for fighting to end and a peaceful political transition in the country. 'Now is the time for unity in Syria,' the foreign ministry said in a statement. 'France calls for weapons to fall silent, for the democratic institutions to be preserved, for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria to be respected,' it added. 'It calls for a peaceful political transition, one that respects the diversity of the Syrian people, and protects civilians and all minorities, in accordance with international law. It calls on all Syrians to unite, to reconcile, and to reject all forms of extremism. 'Steadfast in its position and in its solidarity with the Syrian people since the start of the revolution in 2011, France now invites its partners to do everything in their power to help the Syrians find the path toward reconciliation and reconstruction, through an inclusive political solution, in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 and with the will of the Syrian people. France will play its full part in this,' it continued. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer issued a statement on Sunday afternoon in which he said Britain welcomed the fall of Assad. 'The developments in Syria in recent hours and days are unprecedented, and we are speaking to our partners in the region and monitoring the situation closely. The Syrian people have suffered under Assad’s barbaric regime for too long and we welcome his departure,' the statement said. 'Our focus is now on ensuring a political solution prevails and peace and stability is restored. We call on all sides to protect civilians and minorities and ensure essential aid can reach the most vulnerable in the coming hours and days,' it added. Spain will support a peaceful solution for Syria that provides stability for the region, Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said following the reported fall of the Assad regime. Madrid wants 'any solution for the future of Syria to be a peaceful one... that benefits the Syrian people and in some way brings new stability to the Middle East and not more instability', Albares told Spanish public television. 'We have to take steps to ensure that it’s the Syrian people who decide how they are governed and by whom in future and, of course, that Syria’s territorial integrity is maintained,' he said. China’s foreign ministry said Sunday it hopes Syria 'returns to stability as soon as possible.' Beijing 'is closely following the development of the situation in Syria and hopes that Syria returns to stability as soon as possible', the foreign ministry said in a statement. The UAE diplomatic advisor to the president said that non-state actors should not be allowed the opportunity to exploit political vacuums, shortly after Syrian opposition fighters declared the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime in Damascus. 'Unfolding events in Syria are also a clear indication of political failure and the destructive nature of conflict and chaos,' Anwar Gargash told the Manama Dialogue security forum in the Bahraini capital in the first official comments from the UAE on the matter. Gargash also urged Syrians to collaborate to avert tumult: 'We hope that the Syrians will work together, that we don’t just see another episode of impending chaos.' The UN Secretary-General emphasized the 'historic opportunity for Syrians to build a stable and peaceful future' following nearly 14 years of war and the fall of Assad, adding: 'The future of Syria is a matter for the Syrians to determine.' He urged calm and the protection of all Syrians’ rights during the transition period. Highlighting the need for international support, he called for an inclusive and comprehensive political transition that respected Syria’s 'sovereignty, unity, independence, and territorial integrity,' Antonio Guterres said. The UN remained committed to helping Syrians create a future rooted in 'reconciliation, justice, freedom, and prosperity,' honoring the memory of those who suffered throughout the conflict. UN special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen underscored the clear desire expressed by millions of Syrians that stable and inclusive transitional arrangements are put in place, according to a statement published on Sunday. The diplomat urged all Syrians to prioritize dialogue, unity, and respect for international humanitarian law and human rights as they seek to rebuild their society, adding he stands ready to support the Syrian people in their journey toward a stable and inclusive future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzjwjCBbne-mbL	2024-12-08T15:48:45-08:00	
The Rise Of The Demonic – OpEd	By Father Myron J. Pereira (UCA News) -- Of all the angels whose names we keep, none exerts a greater fascination than the archangel Michael. Is this the reason why Michael is one of the most popular names for both boys and girls? Typically, Michael is a warrior in full armor, thrusting his spear into a powerful but defeated dragon who cowers at his feet. Or he wields a sword, uplifted to strike Lucifer and cast him into hell. Millions of artistic depictions have stamped this image of Michael upon our collective memory — and not just Michael, but of his 'look-alikes' as well: St George and the dragon; white Crusaders bearing down upon infidel Saracens; and in our Indian tradition, victorious Kali crushing the buffalo-demon, and devouring him. Our deepest fears Iconography has an intuitive way of evoking our deepest fears and longings. What do these pictures of violent struggle speak of? Do they depict the tensions between good and evil, so much part of our daily experience? Or the urges to power, violence, and self-assertive righteousness? Or the demands of appeasement, of bloody sacrifice? We don’t quite know. Michael. Satan. Crucifixion. Ram-Ravana. Mahakali. These are powerful symbols from our collective unconscious. Which means to say that they exist so close to us, that we can’t even get them into objective focus. If anyone doubts this, let him reflect just a moment on the war and violence that has erupted across the world these last two years — Manipur, Gaza, and Ukraine — and held us all in thrall. In the name of God and country, armies have moved to kill and destroy, giving vent to all those outpourings of blood and passion, which altogether escape the cool light of reason. I call this the rise of the demonic. Where are the demons? The demons are always within. It is wise and healthy to recognize this, as the ancients did, and not pretend otherwise. Even the Gospels, which transcend in form and vision so much of the ancient world, acknowledge the presence of the beast — dragons, serpents, betrayers, apostates, persecutors, devils, and unclean spirits — all forms of the 'strong man' [Luke 11.21] who holds this world in thrall. And today the demons are still within. The anger and hurt we carry with us over generations — caste hatreds, religious prejudices, fears of losing power, sexist fears, racist fears. The unclean spirits return sevenfold in the refurbished apartment which is clean but empty. In other words, unoccupied by good spirits [see Luke 11.24-26]. Demonic and angelic? The demonic and the angelic are those vital forces, for good as well as evil, which undergird reason, and often bypass it altogether. Where there are demons, there are angels too, so perhaps I should also use the term 'angelic' for a more accurate description of those benevolent spirits that fill our souls, and lead us on the paths of righteousness and wisdom. As ABBA sang, 'I believe in angels/something good in everything I see.' Angels lead us to kindness and mercy, and compassion for those in need. They signify self-sacrifice and surrender beyond the call of duty. They inspire a deeper wisdom and perception, which comes from a higher power. They open us to life and experience in all its forms. But angels and devils inhabit the same space, and as the poet Rilke once put it, 'If you drive away my demons, I fear my angels will also take flight.' The world of the spirits To open the windows of the soul to the world of the spirits is to experience the tussle of conflicting spirits, as Ignatius Loyola well knew. His rules 'to discern the spirits' are a classic guide in this field. But what if one decides that it is safer to bolt the doors and fasten the windows, so that one feels safe and closed within? The room may become unbearably hot and stifling, but it is safe... for a time. Ah, but what if the doors and windows cannot stand the pressure of the gales which blow without? The powers of religion traffic with the world of the spirit. Their symbols reach up to the heavens and plumb the fearful depths. Unlike law or politics which control only external behavior, religion addresses the demons within us. And what are these? One example: in our building of the saeculum, for instance. We have no potent symbols of the secular to stir our bowels or palpitate our hearts, as religion has. Our talk of the secular is just that: abstract words. We have not waded through the wars of religion, as Europe did. We have not been persecuted enough for the values of mercy and human rights. We have not struggled to become secular; we merely adopted the phrases. It is only through a public confrontation with the demons of our primitive past in which religion played its part, a struggle in which Satan and his minions are hurled into the pits of hell, that we will be able to join hands and build the saeculum. Michael and the dragon tell us that the field of righteousness is a constant battlefield. Maybe like Jacob wrestling with his angel, we will prevail, but limp forever. Or maybe our demons will scurry into the dark corners of the city sewers, like the rats in Camus’ The Plague, and bide their time before they strike again. *The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official editorial position of UCA News.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj_HVhF0_XvMh	2024-12-08T15:47:25-08:00	
Evaluating President Zelensky? – OpEd	Ukraine President Zelensky is the greatest salesman in history, every time he comes to US, he walks away with $60 billion.' - says Donald Trump President Zelensky has proved to be pretty smart enough leading Ukraine in the war against Russia now for almost three years. He initially earned the respect of most and was smart enough to strike the Russian military right where it hurts them most! Imagine what he could have done if he had the airpower and the pilots! However, now voices of varying black and white opinions on President Zelensky are being heard from across the world. The assessment of President Volodymyr Zelensky's leadership and its impact on Ukraine depends on the perspective and priorities of the evaluator. Zelensky has faced significant challenges during his tenure, including the ongoing Russian invasion, economic struggles, and political reform pressures. Zelensky: Inspirational War Leader Zelensky's background as a former comedian actor and his media-savviness have enabled him to connect with global audiences and portray Ukraine's plight. His refusal to flee Ukraine during the early days of the invasion strengthened morale within Ukraine and garnered respect globally. He has secured significant military, financial, and humanitarian aid from Western allies, bolstering Ukraine's defense efforts. Zelensky has proven to be just the leader Ukraine needed in her greatest hour of darkness since WW2. He is a wartime leader in the mold of Winston Churchill, uniting and rallying his nation against an unbridled and unjust attack on its sovereignty. Zelensky is also working tirelessly to form world opinion and getting support for Ukraine that makes a real difference on the battlefield. Zelensky has been an inspirational President. He has done what nobody thought possible. He has rallied the citizens of Ukraine to defy one of the world superpowers and, despite the murderous Russian assault on the civilian population, has fought them to a standstill. Zelensky will be remembered in Ukraine as a hero. If, by brilliant, you refer to his courage, and fortitude, in the face of almost insurmountable odds, then he's one of the most brilliant politicians of all time. He has been a beacon of light for every Ukrainian to stand up and fight for their country against their Invaders. He himself with military fatigue is with his army in the bunkers, unlike Putin who is suited and booted who sits at Kremlin Palace and gives orders. He has stunned the youth of the World to show them what Bravery is all about. Europe cannot let him fail, if we do then Russia will continue to roll up the former satellite countries, the buffer zone. There will be another Special Military Action in Poland. Even Finland and Sweden are in danger. The Cold War gets Hot again. Zelensky: Now under Criticism I fail to comprehend why he is cheerleading his nation in an internecine war that is already devastating his country with untold misery that is now afflicting the common people there. He urged all the warmongers to supply him with lethal weapons, a request they gleefully acknowledged. Now his friends are comfortably living thousands of kilometers away in their own countries, unwilling to put boots on the ground in Ukraine. Do they have any concern for innocent Ukrainian lives? No, they are doing so at the behest of their ‘Armament Industry’ and the construction companies that are ready to descend on to Ukraine for lucrative contracts once the dust has settled down. He genuinely thinks the West will start WWIII for Ukraine's sake! Former longest serving NATO Chief the preacher of 'Weapons are for Peace.' He is a sellout to US who never put Ukrainian interests above anything. Before the war broke out, he allowed his land to become a playground for American dirty games against Russia, which led to the war. After the war broke out, he did nothing to save people’s lives or the civilian establishments. He is squarely responsible for the destruction his country is seeing. Now the country is in complete shambles and half its population stays as refugees in different parts of Europe likely to never come back. Zelensky, is not innocent in the suffering of his country. Zelensky before the war one of the most hated because of his corruption practices. This is not unscrupulousness; this is simple greed or a lust for power. First, the United States buys them for a decent loot, then they turn them into obedient slaves - fascists. He simply did what he did best when war broke out. He’s an entertainer, a TV star, someone who can jump onto a stage and give an inspirational speech and make people enthusiastic. He’s not a military commander and appears to take the advice of those who are. He’s not an expert on infrastructure and appears to take the advice of those who are. He’s not an expert on economics and appears to take the advice of those who are. He knows he’s an inspiring figurehead for the resistance, and he’s excelled at that. He knew the invasion was coming and might have had his famous line about ammunition written beforehand by his script writers if it should come in handy, which doesn’t diminish the impact it had at the time. He is set to inspire Ukraine to actually defeat Russia. 'Foolish'? How, exactly? He has managed to use words to ensure the survival of Ukraine as an independent nation. He has single-handedly created Ukraine as the nation we will know for the coming century. I would prefer the term 'Foolhardy'. As a real president, I think he is a talking head and, again, an actor. This time tragic. He has been playing his role well, but now he cannot ignore the fact that the Ukrainian people are suffering largely because of him, his pointless stubbornness. Zelensky was pretty ordinary as Ukraine leader prior to this year. Zelensky in 2022 is Lincoln in 1861. Zelensky in 2022 is Churchill in 1940. A leader of unequaled brilliance for this season, if not all seasons. Could the War have been Avoided? He is simply a foolish person. He could have saved his country from the disaster without any loss. All Russia wanted is that Ukraine does not join NATO. Joining NATO was not a profitable bargain for Ukraine. Friendship with a mighty neighbour is better than a faraway enemy of the neighbour. Zelensky will now sue for peace and may have to accept all demands that were put before him before Russia was forced to invade Ukraine. Staying at his post looks brave. But with millions of the Ukraine citizens running away, due to the Russian attacks will rase lots of questions in the future. Could it have been avoided. Was it OK to sacrifice so much, for what. He is also a gullible daydreamer. He should have been able to see through the US ploy of using Ukraine as a pawn to weaken Russia. Now he has lost the war and still not understood that Joe Biden wants to defend Ukraine until the last Ukrainian is dead. Whatever happens his name will go down in the history of the world as a man who destroyed his country through his myopic vision and narrow-mindedness. The results are there for all to see - many regions razed to the ground and every day kms of destruction being witnessed. What after the War? When Ukrainians win the war? Much of their country will have been destroyed and desolate. Everything will have to be rebuilt. Not just the infrastructure but also their culture. How does one bring back thousands of people who have scattered away? How does one convince refugees that it's safe to come back on top of the fact that there's no homes or grocery stores to come back to? Zelensky will still be needed to rally the free world to help rebuild and secure Ukraine’s future. Remember how quickly after World War II the government of Winston Churchill was tossed out of office. Even then, Zelenskyy has an excellent chance of being considered Ukraine’s greatest 21st-century hero. Politics is a skill, Like my friend put it 'Zelensky tickled the bear for too long' He gambled with nation and ruined its future. Soon Zelensky’s 'Bravery' will be forgotten but 'Zelensky will have to live with the knowledge that he could have prevented a war and failed to do so.'

The Funan Techo Canal And Vietnam’s Maritime-Continental Dilemma ...	By Nguyen The Phuong Since the establishment of the modern Vietnamese nation-state in 1945, the country’s grand strategy has revolved around two pillars: 'building' and 'defending'. Before 1975, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) focused on two main tasks: 'building' socialism in the North, while 'fighting' against the southern regime and liberating the South from American imperialism.[1] This process was largely continental in nature, with most of the 'fighting' and 'building' taking place on land. The continental West and North were the main sources of Vietnam’s security concerns and formed the pillars of its defence strategy, as evidenced by its wars with China and the Khmer Rouge. After 1991, with the resolution of the Cambodian issue, Vietnam shifted its focus towards the 'building' pillar. At the same time, the country has increasingly turned to the maritime East for its economic prosperity. On 5 August 2024, Cambodia broke ground for the Funan Techo Canal Project, generating new tensions between Vietnam and Cambodia and sparking debates over its security implications for Vietnam. As Vietnam shifts its attention towards the 'maritime' East, this project brings back bitter memories of the 'continental' West that presented a grave security threat to the country during the 1970s and 1980s. Vietnam now faces the challenge of defending its interests from an increasingly assertive China in the South China Sea in the east, and a complex and growing non-traditional threat from the west.[2] This raises a crucial question: how should Vietnam, with its limited resources, balance its interests in the continental West and the maritime East? CONTINENTAL WEST VERSUS MARITIME EAST Since the turn of the 21st century, the maritime East has been designated a crucial area for Vietnam’s economic progress. Gazing out towards the sea serves as a way for the Vietnamese nation to reconnect with its maritime heritage. Throughout history, the maritime space has played a significant role in shaping the country’s political economy, even before the independence of the first Vietnamese dynasties from Chinese rule in the 10th century AD.[3] The prominence of Đại Việt (a feudal state encompassing parts of present-day Vietnam) in regional maritime trade networks, as well as the development of a distinct maritime identity in the southern Cochinchina kingdom during the 16th and 17th centuries, proves that the Vietnamese people have always had strong ties to the maritime domain[4] Moreover, by expanding its interests into the maritime sphere, Vietnam is also redefining its 'living space'.[5] After experiencing border conflicts with China and the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnamese leaders recognised the need to extend the country’s sovereignty and jurisdiction beyond its coast. This was done with the aim of creating a security buffer in the South China Sea[6] while maximising the country’s economic gains from maritime resources. The strategic importance of the sea was officially recognised in 1993, and this importance was further institutionalised in the following decades.[7] The goal was clear: to transform Vietnam into a 'strong maritime country'.[8] This objective was reiterated in the 2007 Maritime Strategy and the revised Blue Economy Strategy in 2018. These documents reflect the Vietnamese leadership’s strong maritime strategic mindset. The 2007 Maritime Strategy, for example, acknowledged that the 21st century would be the 'maritime century', hence the motto 'hướng ra biển là thịnh vượng' (turning to the sea brings prosperity).[9] The sea is considered the country’s 'living space', crucial to its development and security.[10] Therefore, developing and implementing a maritime strategy was imperative to steering the country’s sea-based development . That said, Vietnam’s traditional strategies have been primarily shaped by a continental mindset dominated by a Confucian, anti-mercantile ruling elite during the country’s dynastic era.[11] Throughout the 20th century, Vietnam faced numerous land-based security threats and engaged in wars fought primarily on land. The Vietnamese civilisation has thrived and been sustained by its extensive river systems. The Red River Delta in the North has long been considered the cradle of Vietnamese civilisation, while the Mekong Delta in the South is the country’s primary source of food. In fact, nearly half of the country’s rice, 65 per cent of its aquaculture, and 70 per cent of its fruits are produced in the Mekong Delta.[12] This strong continental identity is further reflected in the dominance of the army over the navy in terms of personnel and resources within the military. In sum, the co-existence of this continental mindset versus maritime thinking suggests that Vietnam cannot solely focus on one extreme or another. Vietnam’s future will be defined by both its maritime space and its investment in its continental landmass. THE FUNAN TECHO CANAL: A NON-TRADITIONAL THREAT FROM THE CONTINENTAL FRONTIERS The crux of the recent friction between Vietnam and Cambodia over the Funan Techo Canal Project lies in the lack of clarity over how Cambodia intends to utilise the water from the canal, including its intended purposes and volume. In 2023, the Cambodia National Mekong Committee (CNMC) released a 14-page report on the project. Vietnamese experts, however, criticised the report for failing to include information on the anticipated procedures of operation or the assessment of environmental impacts caused by the canal.[13] The report only mentioned the canal’s function as a waterway or navigation route, leaving unclear the extent to which it will serve purposes like irrigation, drainage, and water collection for various activities. As such, the report contradicts recent statements by Senate President Hun Sen that the canal would 'facilitate agricultural activities by providing water for crop cultivation'.[14] Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol also discussed the irrigation benefits of the canal in an English-language video interview.[15] Moreover, although the CNMC report mentions the use of a navigation lock system to prevent water from leaving the Mekong mainstream, more information is needed on its design, maintenance, and operations.[16] In September 2023, the Vietnamese Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment requested that experts assess the impacts of the project. The following month, the Vietnamese Meteorological and Hydrological Administration released a four-page report emphasising that 'the construction of a waterway canal in Cambodia will significantly exacerbate the issue of water resource depletion in the Mekong Delta, as seen in recent years.'[17] However, this analysis only considers the impact on water supply if the canal is used for transportation purposes. In April 2024, participants at a conference in Can Tho City highlighted the canal’s potential negative impacts on the Mekong Delta. At a regular press conference the same month, the spokesperson of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed interest in the Funan Techo Canal Project and urged the Cambodian government to closely coordinate with Vietnam and the Mekong River Commission, as well as the international community, in sharing information about the project.[18] This highlights the lack of information available to the Vietnamese government regarding the project. Both Vietnamese scholars and Western experts have expressed concerns over the environmental consequences of the project on the Lower Mekong River Basin.[19] However, Vietnamese experts have varying opinions on the scale and extent of the impact. The most extreme estimation suggests that the canal could decrease the water flow to the Mekong Delta by over 50 per cent or even 70 per cent during the dry season.[20] However, other experts disagree, stating that the potential scenario would not be as severe, with a loss of 5-13 per cent of water flowing to the Delta.[21] The project will also have a significant impact on the hydrological regime of the transboundary floodplain.[22] For example, seasonal flooding provides irrigation to the Vinh Te Canal in Vietnam’s Kien Giang Province. However, building high levees to protect the Funan Techo Canal from flood damage will cause a large area of the Mekong Delta and significant portions of Cambodia’s floodplain to suffer from reduced natural flooding and increased dryness, ultimately resulting in a loss of industrial-scale agricultural production.[23] It is evident that Vietnamese government officials and experts have been closely monitoring the issue since the CNMC submitted its initial document to the Mekong River Commission in 2023 regarding the construction of the Funan Techo Canal. Despite differences in assessing the potential impact of the project, most Vietnamese experts agree that Cambodia should be more transparent and provide more information and data on the operating procedures of the canal, its functions and purposes, as well as solutions to ensure safety in the event of any incidents. VIETNAM’S OLD DILEMMA IN A NEW CONTEXT Given Hanoi’s priorities of economic development and a peaceful approach to foreign and defence policy, it is highly unlikely that the Vietnamese government will respond aggressively to Cambodia’s plans to build the Funan Techo Canal. However, this recent friction has shed light on an important truth that has long been overlooked by the Vietnamese public: the increasing significance of the continental West in Vietnam’s security landscape, albeit of a different nature compared to the past. As Vietnam heavily relies on the sea for its grand strategy and faces potential conflicts in the South China Sea, the country must now navigate the challenge of balancing resources and strategic priorities between the maritime East and the continental West. Challenges from both domains are viewed as existential threats to Vietnam’s national interests, or, from a geostrategic standpoint, to its 'strategic space'. It is worth noting that 'strategic space' holds significant weight in Vietnam’s strategic lexicon. It refers to a country’s physical environment, including its land, sea, space, and surrounding areas, as well as neighbouring countries and their foreign policies. Vietnam’s current strategic space includes its continental North and West (with Cambodia, Laos, and China as immediate neighbours) and the maritime East, with the South China Sea serving as the new frontier in the 21st century. Balancing the threats in both of these strategic spaces is a daunting task, requiring skilled statecraft and resource allocation. Vietnam’s continental landmass and its immediate neighbours (Laos, Cambodia, and China) will always be crucial for its defence and security. Without stable and friendly neighbours, Vietnam would struggle to mobilise resources for economic and social development. Historically, the continental frontiers served as both sources of security and insecurity in a traditional sense, primarily focused on expanding and protecting territories. However, in the interconnected world of the 21st century, shaped by a specific international order, the nature of threats from the continental frontier has become more complex and less focused on territorial issues. These non-traditional challenges require Vietnam to be more adaptable, innovative, and skilled in managing its relationships, both bilaterally and multilaterally. Vietnam may need to focus on not only external factors but also internal development to secure its economic future and partnerships with neighbouring countries. A strong economic foundation is essential for ensuring long-term stability along Vietnam’s western border. The primary challenge for Vietnam’s grand strategy is finding a balance between the continental West and the maritime East. This involves effectively allocating resources to both domains, particularly in defence and security. It is not a matter of choosing one over the other, but rather identifying the strategic priority in a complex and ever-changing environment; this is no easy task and can be costly, especially for a middle-income country. China’s notorious illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities in the South China Sea pose a threat to Vietnam, forcing the country to invest heavily in developing and modernising its maritime forces. The recent controversy surrounding the Funan-Techo Canal Project highlights that future challenges from the continental West could potentially divert resources away from the South China Sea. CONCLUSION The growing influence of China on Vietnam’s western 'continental' frontiers is a legitimate concern for the country. As tensions in the South China Sea continue to escalate, the construction of the Funan Techo Canal raises a larger question at a grand-strategic level: how can Vietnam effectively balance its resources and vision between the 'continental' West and the 'maritime' East? While the South China Sea remains the primary battleground for sovereignty, the western frontiers are now faced with a variety of non-traditional security challenges, including issues in the Mekong region, human trafficking, and transnational crimes, which require a different approach. Some analysts believe that Vietnam should take proactive measures with expert-led strategies and practical solutions to mitigate any potential impact that may arise from the canal.[24] At the same time, the government must balance the competing needs of the continental West and the maritime East. It is crucial for Vietnam to continue leveraging on international support and collaboration in managing security and development concerns on both fronts. While the maritime domain offers opportunities for economic growth and prosperity, without the support of the continental domain, the foundation of Vietnam’s economic and security interests would not be sustainable.

The Use And Abuse Of Malaysia’s Law Enforcement And Judicial Syst...	Malaysia has one of the most crooked legal systems in the region The integrity of Malaysia’s legal-judicial system has rapidly decayed since Anwar Ibrahim became prime minister in November 2022. Since Anwar has been prime minister, a number of high-profile court cases were terminated with a 'Discharge Not Amounting to an Acquittal (DNAA),' allowing defendants to walk free from the court. Malaysians saw a number of high-profile politicians, including deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, being the most noteworthy, discharged from indictments of corruption and money laundering this year. Former prime minister Najib Razak’s prison sentence was commuted from 12 to 6 years, and fine reduced by 75 percent to RM 55 million by the Pardons Board. These visible special arrangements made for VVIPs has hastened the undermining the system of justice in Malaysia. A survey undertaken by the writer indicates a low level of trust and confidence in the Malaysian judicial system. It’s easy to speculate this low level of trust has come from citizens observing law enforcement and the legal system being used as a tool for bullying, intimidation, selective prosecution of critics of the government and the political opposition. At the same time, there is declining case diligence by the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) with cases involving government members on trial, amounting to case dismissals. Bullying and Intimidation The current modus operandi today is an environment where the police can act with impunity when bullying and intimidating a citizen over what he/she thinks and expresses to the community as opinion. If someone exposes the money laundering, corruption, and criminal activities of the elite, they will be chastised by the authorities. Corruption is covered up by the concoction of the 3Rs (race, religion and royalty), where any discussion of these subjects by ordinary citizens results in arrest and intimidation, while those on the government side do so with total impunity. This is a total abuse of the legal system. Upon examination, the 3Rs mantra puts itself above the Constitution. Any corruption regarding members of the monarchy can be suppressed, where the whistleblower exposing corruption punished. Other matters regarding race and religion impinge upon freedom of speech and freedom of religion, written into the constitution. The Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) acts upon consultation with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), the Malaysian Islamic Development Department (JAKIM), and even the governing political parties. The police often conduct joint raids with the above and state religious departments. These raids are made on the basis of a person’s beliefs, opinion, and faith, as well as political allegiance. Most of these raids don’t end up in charges. They are acts of intimidation, where people are falsely imprisoned for a short length of time, intimidated, where their computers and mobile phones confiscated, most often not returned to the owners. The treatment of citizens this way is a total abuse of power. Most of these acts are politically motivated, where opposition MPs and activists have been the prime victims. In addition, the police often hold press conferences asserting guilt of people through accusation, usually without any follow-up. Law enforcement in Malaysia is now a politicised system. There is no ombudsman or statutory body to report these abuses, as a means to seek any accountability by authorities. Lawfare and persecution are now specialities of the authorities in Malaysia. A number of prominent opposition MPs have been very publicly humiliated and charged, which is manipulated in a way the public cheer on and media highlights manipulated public support to the government’s advantage. These are now media spectacles, where police with firearms wearing balaclavas to hide their identities are used in this theatre. Most of the charges laid under these sham-operations end up being delayed and eventually dismissed by courts with little media coverage. It must be noted here that the home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, who is ultimately in charge of all these operations lost his seat in the last general election, and was appointed a senator. He will never be democratically accountability to the people. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has been conducting ‘revolving door’ persecutions of prime minister Anwar’s adversaries through very public investigations. These ‘suspects’ are called up for questioning, but to-date no criminal charges have been laid against any of them. Attorney General’s Chambers The work of the Attorney General’s Chambers must be called into question with their sloppy court preparations and presentations that have led to the dismissal of criminal charges against Anwar’s political allies. One way to fix a court trial is to prepare and present a poor prosecution that the court has no alternative but to discharge the defendant due to lack of evidence. This occurred to deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA) on 47 charges of corruption and money laundering. In some countries this would be called ‘fixing a trial’. This has been caused by either total incompetence of the AGC, or premeditated tampering of trials to acquit defendants. The AGC remains totally unaccountable for this. The case of Yusoff Rawther is very concerning. Yusoff was arrested on firearm and narcotics charges under suspicious circumstances, where the planting of evidence by police is a possibility. There is great concern for the personal wellbeing for Yusoff, where Yusoff had filed a suit against prime minister Anwar for sexual assault. Sections of the legal community are saying the case is politically motivated, where the police had assisted in perverting the course of justice. With 74 deaths, many of these in suspicious circumstances, in police custody during 2023, there is a need for concern. Bribery in the legal profession The writer has been told a number of stories about the poor performance of their attorneys, which led to their loss in court against civil powerful and politically connected plaintiffs. Many believe, although it must be said without proof, that appearances by their lawyers in court had been working against, in what appeared to be favouring the other side. This is not an isolated story. This is a common complaint the writer has received by aggrieved defendants How much this is a widespread practice, is difficult to ascertain. However, there exists a group of some lawyers who will ‘sell out’ their clients in the Malaysian legal profession today. The independence of the judiciary There is no evidence of members of the judiciary taking biased positions in cases, since Anwar Ibrahim’s sodomy 1 and corruption case in 1999, where he was convicted. However, public observation of case results against VVIPs have created an impression of bias. There is a long history of suspicion of judicial bias in Malaysia, particularly in political cases. This is what makes it very difficult to provide the perception that a judge is above any bias in a 3R case. The judge is a citizen of a state with a Sultan, he or she may personally be acquainted with or even socialise with. Thus, hearing cases in the same state, where any charges involve the current Sultan may prevent any defendant obtaining a fair trial, due to the perception of bias. Law enforcement authorities and prosecution attorneys may feel a misguided sense of duty towards their Sultan, above their duty towards the law. Malaysia is now a country where the fair treatment of a person by the police, investigating authority, and judiciary is suspect. One only has to look at the sentence of two years jail over a defamation case given to British journalist Clare Rewcastle Brown in absentia, over a book outlining corruption and the 1MDB financial scandal. The integrity and ability of a person obtaining a fair hearing in any Malaysian court must be questioned. One cannot even assume safety in detention with a politically biased police institution. Malaysia’s system of justice outwardly appears two-tiered where it’s depends upon who you are, as to the treatment one will receive. Ordinary citizens appear to have little chance of fairness throughout this decadent system. When a single uneducated mother gets 10 months jail for stealing a bottle of coffee and VVIPs get off for stealing billions, not millions, something is wrong. Malaysia has now joined a number of other countries, where lawfare against ‘enemies of the state’ is common practice. The home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail who oversees the system has no hesitation in using draconian laws his own political party pledged to repeal before coming to office. Malaysia is not a country one would want to submit themselves to a crooked legal and judicial system and expect a fair hearing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F8i6QlmHplcK	2024-12-07T20:25:43-08:00	
Matrilineal Society Of Meghalaya (India): Historical Roots And Co...	In a largely patriarchal society, Meghalaya is one of the northeastern regions of India, stands out as a shining example of matrilineal tradition. The Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia tribes have established a cultural framework that places women at the center of family and social structure in a system where social identity, inheritance, and lineage are carried down through the maternal line. However, the fundamental tenets of the matrilineal system are being questioned as Meghalaya experiences cultural and economic changes brought on by urbanization and globalization. The historical significance of matrilineality in Meghalaya, its changing nature, and the significant obstacles it faces today—particularly with regard to gender roles, political representation, and the effects on women's economic participation—are all covered in this discussion. Meghalaya’s Matrilineal Tradition: Historical Foundations The Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia tribes' cultural and religious traditions are firmly rooted in Meghalaya's matrilineal system, which has long served as a stabilizing influence on the social fabric of the area. With children taking on their mother's surname and property going to the youngest daughter ('Ka Khadduh') to maintain the family's history, this structure demonstrates respect for the maternal line. This system's origins can be found in the agrarian economy of the area, when women's efforts were essential to maintaining household stability and fostering community solidarity. The significance of maternal lineage was further strengthened by indigenous beliefs, such as the worship of the 'Goddess Mother,' which gave this distinctive social structure a spiritual component. The story of the Hynniewtrep ('seven huts') is one example of a folktale that links the Khasi identity to divine beginnings and highlights the sacred role of women as keepers of social and familial continuity.It is important to recognize that the matrilineal system, especially in its original form, has not resulted in women's unrestricted empowerment, despite the seeming respect for women in the home and in society. Women have traditionally held the reins of family power and property inheritance, but males have continued to hold the reins of political power and leadership positions, creating a paradox of gendered authority. Contemporary Challenges Meghalaya's matrilineal system is put to the test as it struggles with contemporary influences, putting its adaptation and tenacity to the test. These issues show themselves in a number of areas, including household decision-making, political representation, and the changing nature of gender roles as a result of globalization. The continued political underrepresentation of women in formal political organizations is one of the most glaring inconsistencies of Meghalaya's matrilineal society. Despite playing a crucial role in inheritance and family, women have had difficulty gaining traction in the political sphere. There are disproportionately more men than women running for office and elected as legislators, according to data from Meghalaya's legislative assembly elections over the years. For example, out of 379 candidates, just three women were elected in the 2023 elections—a stark discrepancy that highlights structural obstacles. Women are frequently excluded from decision-making positions in traditional governing structures like the 'Dorbar Shnong' (Village Councils) and 'Dorbar Kur' (Clan Councils), which are still controlled by men. This exclusion stems from societal traditions that confine women to the home and place a higher value on men's participation in public affairs. Furthermore, this imbalance is further entrenched by cultural norms that prevent women from pursuing political ambitions and political parties' reluctance to recruit female candidates. Women's capacity to influence laws and initiatives that cater to their needs and goals is significantly impacted by their lack of political representation, making it more than just a symbolic problem. The promise of female equality within Meghalaya's matrilineal structure remains unfulfilled in the absence of fair involvement in governance. In the matrilineal society of Meghalaya, women have historically been remained custodians of managing household finances and property. However, because of changing social and economic forces, these roles are becoming more and more threatened. Women's power within households has started to decline due to the increasing presence of men in the workforce and the invasion of patriarchal norms. On the other hand, women have frequently been shouldering the majority of unpaid household labor in rural areas, which declining of their decision making role on account of their economic prospects. This is especially noticeable in areas like West Garo Hills, where women's participation in market operations is impeded by their domestic duties. Although both sexes can technically access marketplaces, the fact that males predominate there adds to the obstacles facing women's economic autonomy. Women are further marginalized by the lack of financial knowledge and educational opportunities, especially in rural areas. As a result, they are less able to pursue jobs in formal industries like banking or finance, which increases their economic reliance and diminishes their sense of independence. The matrilineal customs of Meghalaya's tribes are being challenged by the external values brought about by urbanization and globalization. Local views on gender roles have been progressively impacted by media, migration, and exposure to patriarchal systems from other regions of India. Sensing that the current system disadvantages them, some Khasi males have called for a shift to patrilineal customs because they feel excluded by the traditional inheritance structure. Younger generations have also been impacted by these cultural changes, as they increasingly strive for contemporary lives that might not be consistent with conventions. Meghalayan society must thus do a difficult balancing act since the matrilineal structure is under pressure to change while maintaining its fundamental values. Implications for Gender Equality The paradox of Meghalaya's matrilineal society is that women's marginalization in public and political life coexists with their higher status in inheritance and family responsibilities. This dichotomy emphasizes the necessity of a sophisticated interpretation of gender equality that transcends cultural symbolism. Matrilineality can help women become more powerful, but it cannot provide gender equality in all spheres of life. Women's ability to promote change and fight for their rights is restricted when they are excluded from decision-making positions in both contemporary political systems and traditional institutions. Similarly, the revolutionary potential of the matrilineal framework is undermined by economic restrictions and the enduring patriarchal views. The Way Forward Meghalaya's matrilineal society faces challenges that require a comprehensive strategy that honors traditional practices while integrating progressive reforms. This includes promoting women's political participation, enhancing economic opportunities, and promoting intergenerational dialogue to reconcile traditional values with modern aspirations. Investment in educational and vocational training, particularly in rural regions, is crucial for women's economic independence. Community-driven initiatives can reinforce matrilineal practices while addressing gender role evolution grievances. Promoting gender-sensitive policies is essential to alleviate women's unpaid labor burden and promote an equitable distribution of household responsibilities. Creating platforms that amplify women's voices in policy discussions is crucial for their perspectives to be integral to decision-making. By integrating these strategies, Meghalaya's matrilineal society can evolve while preserving its distinctive traditions and promoting gender equality and inclusive development. Conclusion In conclusion, Meghalaya's matrilineal society, while rich in cultural heritage and offering a unique perspective on gender dynamics, faces significant challenges in the context of modernization and globalization. The need for a comprehensive strategy that honors traditional practices while implementing progressive reforms is paramount. By promoting women's political participation, enhancing economic opportunities, and fostering intergenerational dialogue, Meghalaya can reconcile its cultural identity with contemporary aspirations. Investment in education and vocational training, particularly in rural areas, alongside community-driven initiatives, will be crucial in empowering women and ensuring their voices are heard in decision-making processes. Ultimately, by embracing gender-sensitive policies and creating platforms for women's representation, Meghalaya has the potential to evolve its matrilineal legacy, setting a precedent for gender equality and inclusive development in societies grappling with the balance between tradition and modernity.

Atomic Salvation: Did The Atom Bombs Save 500,000 To 32 Million L...	By Joshua Mawhorter 'I wanted to save a half million boys on our side.... I never lost any sleep over my decision.'—Harry Truman, (quoted in Alfred Steinberg, The Man From Missouri (New York, 1962), p. 259) It is estimated that there were 416,480 American military deaths in WWII. Thus, what we are invited to believe by Truman’s assertion that the atomic bombs saved 500,000 (or many more) American lives is that, had the US invaded Japan, more Americans would have died in such actions than in all the theaters of WWII combined. Further, that prior to the bombs, Truman, Stimson, and Marshall would have approved an invasion plan (as those of Honshu and Kyushu) had they actually believed that 500,000 American deaths would have resulted, as opposed to more likely alternatives prior to invasion. The Bomb and Big Fish Stories Like the tendency of 'who-caught-the-biggest-fish' exaggerations to grow with each next story, it seems that the numbers of the American lives supposedly saved by the alternative of the atomic bomb seems to grow with each retelling! James B. Conant—wanting to get ahead of the story—convinced Secretary of War Stimson to publish an article justifying the use of the bomb. In the article in Harper’s (1947), it was claimed that the bomb probably prevented 'a million more' American casualties. However, in 1946, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey published the following assessment, Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey’s opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated. (emphasis added) In light of this early post-war evidence, it is doubtful that such a defeated force could have caused 500,000 American deaths or more. Shortly following Nagasaki, Churchill claimed that the bombings saved well over 1,200,000 Allied lives. In 1953, Winston Churchill wrote, 'To quell the Japanese resistance man by man and conquer the country yard by yard might well require the loss of a million American lives and half that number of British…' (emphasis added). This was based on memories of the Battle of Okinawa (65,631 casualties; 7,374 deaths), thus, nowhere near 500,000 American deaths, let alone 'a million.' While in the White House, Truman usually placed the number of American lives saved around 250,000, and occasionally around 200,000. After leaving the White House, Truman began upping the number to 300,000 lives in the first drafts of his memoirs. In 1955, Truman penned his Memoirs and, in volume 1—Year of Decisions (1955)—he wrote, 'General Marshall told me that it might cost half a million American lives to force the enemy’s surrender on his home grounds.' Truman also wrote a letter in 1953 that appears in The Army Air Force in World War II, Vol. 5, The Pacific, Matterhorn to Nagasaki, June, 1944-August, 1945, in which he stated, I asked General Marshall [at Potsdam] what it would cost in lives to land on the Tokyo plain and other places in Japan. It was his opinion that such an invasion would cost at a minimum a quarter of a million American casualties, and might cost as many as a million, with an equal number of the enemy. The other military men agreed. (emphasis added) Note that Truman admits that General Marshall spoke of casualties, not deaths. Based on the average ratio of casualties to deaths in the Pacific, this would entail about 50,000-250,000 deaths, not the 500,000 Truman would later claim in 1955. For those and other reasons, Barton J. Bernstein argues that, 'The claim of half a million was a post-war creation.' Even though the claim of 500,000 American lives saved by the avoidance of invasion because of the atomic bomb was unwarranted, the counterfactual numbers of lives allegedly saved by the atomic bomb continued to grow. A sampling of secondary school textbooks reported that invasion, instead of the bomb, could have caused the loss of one million American lives. In the Washington Post (December 1, 1991), President George H. W. Bush claimed that the atomic bombs 'spared millions of American lives.' Finally, Tom Lewis wrote Atomic Salvation: How the A-Bomb Attacks Saved the Lives of 32 Million People—described in a sympathetic review as assuming the dichotomy between atomic bomb or invasion without other options, as lacking an index, limited to only English-language sources, mainly built off of secondary works, and using primary sources that provide little insight into American decision-making—counting the total lives saved—American, Japanese, and others. Alternatives and Worst-Case Scenario While such counterfactual claims of lives saved may seem plausible given the viciousness of Pacific warfare, and while we should not fault anyone for a wrong estimate in general, and while history ought to be fair to what was known at the time, the confident claims of 500,000+ American lives saved by the atomic bomb are not only dubious, but were directly contrary to the evidence and estimates at the time. There were various invasion scenarios and, at worst, the American death estimates did not even come close to 500,000. Much of this evidence was unearthed by Gar Alperovitz in his Atomic Diplomacy (1965) and subsequent scholarship. In June 1945, US military planners estimated that, in the worst-case scenario, the most American deaths in an invasion plan amounted to 46,000. On June 15, 1945, the Joint War Plans Committee (JWPC) projected estimates for three invasion scenarios—1) an attack on southern Kyushu, followed by an assault on the Tokyo plain (40,000 dead); 2) an attack on southern Kyushu, followed by northwestern Kyushu (25,000 dead); and, 3) an attack on southern Kyushu, followed by northwestern Kyushu, and then the Tokyo plain (46,000 dead). Barton J. Bernstein concluded, Clearly, all these estimates fell far short—by at least 454,000—of later claims of 500,000 American lives. In fact, in early June 1945, when a layman suggested a high number as a half a million dead, army planners bluntly replied in a secret report: '[such an] estimated loss…is entirely too high.' In private writings soon after Hiroshima and Nagasaki—and thus having little reason to exaggerate numbers—US military leaders agreed that the claim of 500,000 American lives saved was entirely too high. Not only this, but General MacArhtur believed that the casualties and deaths would not be as high as the rate at Normandy and Okinawa (65,631 casualties; 7,374deaths), in fact, he estimated that total casualties would be well under 100,000. This was communicated to the White House by General Marshall. Even the more pessimistic Admiral Leahy—mistakenly overstating Okinawa casualty estimates for reference—suggested that the highest estimate for casualties at Kyushu would possibly be 230,000. Other estimates, based on similar historical documents, argue that 'even in the worst case, [American lives saved] would have been in the range of tens of thousands rather than hundreds of thousands.' The scholarly consensus now asserts that the war would have ended in a relatively short time even without the atomic bombs, that the alternative invasions of Japan would have been unlikely, and that Truman and his advisers were aware of these options. Another scholar, using the facts available at the time, argues the results of the unlikely worst case, If this 'worst-case scenario' had occurred—that is, if the atomic bomb had not worked or had not been used, and if Japan had somehow held out beyond November 1, 1945, and if the successful invasion of southern Kyushu had been carried out, and if the Russians had entered the war in August (as they did) and engaged the Japanese in Manchuria and Korea, and if at that point the Japanese had surrendered—then a reasonable estimate of American deaths almost surely would have been not more than 20,000 and probably less than 15,000 (5,000 for air and naval losses before the invasion, not more than 10,000 during the invasion of Kyushu, and an added allowance of 5,000 for unforeseen losses). (emphasis added) Nevertheless, while it is difficult to backwards project a counterfactual history that did not happen, the fact remains that, 'When Truman approved the order of July 24 to use atomic bombs, he had never received a high-level report suggesting half a million or even a quarter a million U.S. dead.' No US military planner between May 1945 and the period following the bombings would have put the number of American lives saved anywhere near that high. To put it succinctly, 'The myth of 500,000 [let alone millions of] American lives saved thus seems to have no basis in fact.' About the author: Joshua Mawhorter is assistant editor of Mises.org.

Trump’s Victory And The Coming Realignment In Europe – OpEd	By Alexander Brotman Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to spark a realignment in Europe when it comes to defense spending, transatlantic relations, and the future of the conflict and the Euro-Atlantic trajectory of Ukraine. Some NATO member states like Poland and the Baltic states are well positioned, having promoted European self-reliance and increased defense spending for some time, proving themselves as capable partners of both Republican and Democratic administrations. France and Germany are more vulnerable due to fractious internal politics and the collapse of Germany’s fragile coalition government just the day following the US election, with a likely Christian Democratic Union-led government emerging next year. For Europe, Trump’s re-election is a wake-up and a warning call, a signal that the Biden years may not have been a return to normal and that Trump is not an anomaly but representative of a deep-seated feature of US politics. However, NATO’s ‘brain death’ in the words of French President Macron, is far from assured, and while the future of Ukraine is undoubtedly more perilous than it would have been under a Harris administration, Kyiv’s defeat is far from certain. Ukraine may even welcome the unpredictability of the new president, as a recent article in The Economist argued, and while some domestic cabinet posts have sparked controversy, Trump’s picks of Keith Kellogg as special envoy to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, and Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser have been welcome developments. As former Zelensky aide Iuliia Mendel wrote in an op-ed for The Kyiv Post, this moment is also an opportunity for Ukraine to refocus, to recharge, and to recognize that a temporary ceasefire may be necessary. For Mendel, it is a moment for ‘consistency, commitment, and a clear-eyed understanding of the reality’ in Ukraine that calls for nuance and humility, a recognition that the worst headlines may come to pass. The Trump administration will have allies in Ukraine that it did not have previously, those who care deeply about the survival of the Ukrainian state and its people but not at any cost and who operate with a more malleable definition of victory. The Biden administration was rhetorically confident but strategically and militarily cautious on Ukraine. For Kyiv, there is an opportunity under Trump not to capitulate to Russia but to regroup, staying true to its values and identity as a proud European nation with immeasurable strengths to bring to the NATO alliance despite formal transatlantic membership being even further away. In Trump’s victory, the era of transatlanticist US presidents whose views are shaped by and wedded to the post-World War II international order has effectively ended. This does not mean future US presidents won’t view European security and European political issues as critical interests of the United States, but only so far as they are extensions of the national interest. President-elect Trump’s picks of Keith Kellogg and Marco Rubio are likely to favor a strong US presence in NATO while simultaneously advocating for European allies to spend more on their own defense. In December 2023, Congress approved legislation co-sponsored by Rubio and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) that prevents the president from withdrawing the US from NATO without Senate or Congressional approval. There remains broad bipartisan support for NATO in Congress, making it difficult, but not impossible, for Trump to attempt a US withdrawal. The reporting from the Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration’s peace proposal for Ukraine includes a 20-year halt to its NATO membership in exchange for freezing the current lines in the conflict may be a hard pill to swallow but it reflects the political and military realities on the ground. Writing in The National Interest last year, Kellogg countered the notion that Trump would abandon Ukraine, and instead advocated for lifting restrictions on military aid to Ukraine in order to force Putin to consider a peace settlement. This is the ‘escalate to de-escalate’ strategy of the incoming Trump administration that is less of a sophomoric negotiating tactic and more of an unconventional break from strategic orthodoxy that may just win over some prominent leaders in Ukraine. The creation or furtherance of a frozen conflict in Ukraine or any other corner of Europe is a gift to Vladimir Putin that should never be the primary goal of those seeking peace and stability in the region. However, at this stage it doesn’t signal appeasement so much as it reflects NATO’s broader failures in properly integrating and managing its relationship with Ukraine and other aspirant states like Georgia stretching back decades. This month’s European Political Community (EPC) meeting in Budapest provided a glimpse into the mood in Europe towards Trump’s return to power, as well as what is necessary for EU and NATO member states to build greater resilience. President Macron, who organized the EPC in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, asked whether Europeans are ready to defend the interests of Europeans, while including the usual plea for Europe ‘to believe in our sovereignty and strategic autonomy.’ European strategic autonomy has been an agenda item for Macron since he was first elected in 2017, and it remains a complicated idea meaning different things to different EU member states. For Macron, it ultimately means creating the conditions for Europe to act independently of the United States as a geopolitical actor on the world stage. It is something that will take on greater urgency in the second Trump administration, but Macron will not be on the political stage for that much longer and is increasingly seen as a lame-duck leader. It is hard to predict how Europe will look at the end of Trump’s second term in 2028. Leaders like Macron will have left the stage, Ukraine may still be fighting for its survival or be bound to neutrality, and other unforeseen conflicts will likely tear at the fabric of European solidarity. For now, Europe will prepare for unpredictably from both Washington and within its own ranks. President-elect Trump and forces closer to home will question not just Europe’s ability to be a geopolitically independent actor but also its very relevance and will to fight for its interests when under attack. Likewise, Macron’s vision of strategic autonomy is likely to clash with the visions of his political adversaries like France’s National Rally party and Hungary’s Orban. There are nationalistic and more protectionist streaks on both sides of the Atlantic, advocating for a Europe or America first approach, and hopefully meeting when those interests align. Just as Europe cannot afford to pull up the drawbridge, Washington cannot afford to construct more moats. Whether there is friction or fraternity between Washington and various European capitals, there is now the clear recognition that Trump is not an aberration and cannot be treated as such. For Europe, it is a moment of supreme clarity that should necessitate an era of supreme conviction.

The Sectarian Risk: Turkey’s Syrian Mission – OpEd	Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan must be delighted about what is unfolding in Syria, though it is a feeling bound to be tempered by swiftly changing circumstances. Iran’s Shia proxies have been weakened by relentless Israeli targeting and bombing. Russia’s eyes and resources are turned towards war in Ukraine. With reports that Syrian rebel groups are now fighting on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, the Assad regime looks frail, its leader either in hiding or evacuated. In the salad mix of jihadis, nationalists, and run of the mill mercenaries, Turkey’s hand looms large. It’s intervention in Syria’s conflict was motivated by two main goals: the containment, if not elimination of Kurdish militants in northern Syria, seen as indistinguishable from their PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) counterparts in Turkey itself, and creating conditions of stability or 'safe zones' that would enable a return of Syrian refugees when feasible. Since August 2016, Turkey has made three incursions seizing parts of Syria’s north, imposing an occupation using regular troops and auxiliary forces including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and a coalition of groups comprising former Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters. In 2018, the Military Police was established by both Turkish authorities and the Syrian Interim Government (SIG), a force ostensibly intended to protect the civilian population. Instead, this period of Turkish rule has been marked by brutality, repression and sheer neglect. In its February 2024 report, Human Rights Watch documented instances of abductions, arbitrary arrests, unlawful detentions (these include children), sexual violence and torture. The perpetrators spanned elements of the SNA, the Military Police, members of the Turkish Armed Forces, the Turkish National Intelligence Organisation (Milli İstihbarat Teşkilatı, MİT), and various military intelligence directorates. To this colourfully gruesome range of cruelties can be added the abuse of property rights, looting, pillaging, confiscation of property, extortion and the absence of any consistent system of restitution. The group enduring the heaviest burden of suffering are Kurdish residents, notably those that had received protection from the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) comprising the People’s Protection Unit (Yekineyen Parastina Gel, YPG), and the Women’s Protection Unit (Yekineyen Parastina Jin). These forces proved crucial in countering the Islamic State (ISIS) group. In October this year, Erdoğan reiterated the long held view that such Kurdish protective units were merely 'the Syrian branch of the PKK terror group, destined to be abandoned, left isolated.' Arabs and other groups seen as having links to the SDF and the Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria (AANES), have also been targets of Turkish-led ire. The SNA is no friend of the headline grabbing Islamist outfit, Hayat Tahrir-al Sham (HTS), the primary spear in the lighting operation against the Assad regime. HTS has marketed itself as a self-sufficient, modern, more considered group, less fire and brimstone from its al-Qaeda and al-Nusra iterations and supposedly more tolerant to other religions, sects and views. Its leader, Abu Mohammad Al-Jolani, has managed to receive praise and plaudits in the Western media for that change, despite his listing by the US State Department as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' worthy of a $10 million reward to anyone willing to offer information leading to his capture. Even on the progress of HTS, Turkish influence cannot be discounted, despite Ankara eschewing open support for the group. As Fuad Shahbazov, writing for the Stimson Center remarks, the recent advances of HTS 'would have been unthinkable without Turkey’s military and logistical backing, and provision of advanced weaponry.' It has also been suggested that Ankara gave a nod of approval to the offensive led by HTS after it failed to secure a rapprochement with Assad. Erdoğan’s statements on the advance show a slippery mind in operation. On December 6, he told reporters after Friday prayers that the target of the offensive was evidently Damascus. 'I would say we hope for this advance to continue without any issues.' But he also expressed the view that these advances were 'problematic' and 'not in a manner we desire'. While not elaborating on that point, it could be gleaned from the remarks that he is concerned about various 'terrorist organisations' operating in the rebel forces. The next day, the Turkish President decided to be lofty in his assessment as the rebels entered the suburbs of Homs. 'There is now a new reality in Syria, politically and diplomatically,' he declared in a speech delivered in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep. 'And Syria belongs to Syrians with all its ethnic, sectarian and religious elements.' In keeping with the views of other leaders responsible for intervening in the affairs of another state, Erdoğan spoke of Syrian independence as viable, the will of its people as inviolable. 'The people of Syria are the ones who will decide the future of their own country.' He hoped that the country would 'quickly regain the peace, stability, and tranquillity it has been longing for 13 years.' He went on to remark that 'responsible actors and all international organisations' should support the preservation of the state’s territorial integrity. The audacity of such statements does nothing to conceal the sectarian and ethnic dangers unfolding at the end of this Ankara-sponsored mission. The fall of Bashir al-Assad will imperil Shia communities and do even more harm to the Kurds, leaving the door open for Salafism. The rebel groups, only united by the common cause of overthrowing Assad, may well find battling each other hard to avoid. As for the territorial integrity Erdoğan speaks of, Turkish officialdom and policy will never wear it short of any number of guarantees Ankara is bound to extort on hefty terms. And as for refugees? Expect many more to gush out in desperation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F8-9T5C7JsAl	2024-12-07T20:21:01-08:00	
Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Right To Statehood Or Recipe For Ne...	By Dr Alon Ben-Meir Trump, who wants an end to the Israeli-Hamas war even before he reassumes the Presidency, must know that denying the Palestinian right to statehood and conceding further Palestinian land in the West Bank and Gaza to Israel is a recipe for the next horrific inferno that will overshadow even the present calamitous Israel-Hamas war Hamas’ horrific October 7 attack and Israel’s massive retaliatory war have fundamentally changed the dynamic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Returning to the status quo that existed before October 7 will be impossible. New political, psychological, and factual regional conditions have been created that cannot be ignored, as they directly impacted not only Israeli-Palestinian relations for a generation but also the regional stability fed by power dynamics and rivalries between the states in the area. Given these new regional dynamics, Trump will have to choose between paving the way toward the establishment of a Palestinian state or setting the stage for the next catastrophic conflagration that will dwarf the current Israeli-Hamas war. Trump and his team should carefully consider the following seven crucial changes in regional dynamics if he wants to prevent another catastrophic war and revive 'the deal of the century,' however remote it may seem at this particular juncture. Hamas’ Massacre and its Psychological Implications It is hard to overestimate the psychological ramifications of Hamas’ October 7 attack on the Israeli mindset as it brought to life images from the Holocaust. In many ways, it reaffirmed Netanyahu’s misleading two-decades-long public narrative and reinforced the pervasive Israeli public mindset that the Palestinians posed a perpetual threat to Israel’s national security. Thus, more than any time before, any effort made by the Trump team that could lead to a two-state solution will face vehement Israeli resistance. This can be mitigated once the Israelis come to terms with the fact that their ultimate national security rests on the establishment of a Palestinian state, firmly tied to comprehensive security arrangements to allay the ingrained psychological impediment among the Israelis. The Israeli War of Retaliation Although Israel has the right to defend itself, its war against Hamas was disproportionate even compared to the gruesome Hamas attack. By all accounts, the unprecedented destruction rained on Gaza and the death of over 43,000, nearly half of them women and children, only attest to the desire for revenge and retribution and disregard for innocent human lives. Not since Israel’s war of independence in 1948, and especially under the 57-year-long occupation, has the hatred, distrust and violence been intensified between the two sides; Israel’s relationship with the Palestinians has reached a new nadir. Ninety percent of all Palestinians were born under occupation, and the Israel-Hamas war only accelerated the rise of a new hopeless and despairing generation of Palestinian youth for whom jihad and martyrdom are not slogans. Their life mission will be dedicated to avenging what has befallen them, and the harsher measures Israel employs, the more intense and deadly their resistance will be until they realize their national aspiration. Mutual Realization that Neither can Destroy the Other After 14 months of a brutal war that exacted a horrific toll in blood and treasure, both sides have failed to achieve their stated objective. Even if Israel captures or kills every Hamas combatant, it cannot liquidate it as a national movement and as an idea. Hamas will survive any losses and terrorize Israel for as long as it takes, albeit knowing that Israel is a formidable military power, far beyond their reach to destroy now or at any time in the future. This mutual realization has changed the conflict’s dynamic. Though nearly decimated, Hamas largely achieved its goal. It has fundamentally shaken the status quo and made an unequivocal statement that the Palestinian cause will no longer be ignored. It has set the stage for a breakthrough in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict if Trump seizes the opportunity. The role of Saudi Arabia Before the eruption of the Israel-Hamas war, the US had been negotiating the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. At the time, the Saudis were willing to settle for a vague commitment by Israel ‘to make major progress toward a solution to the Palestinian conflict.’ But as the horror of the war in Gaza unfolded, the Saudis changed their position, mainly due to the public’s outcry about what the Palestinians have tragically endured. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) publicly stated, 'The Kingdom will not cease its tireless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and we affirm that the kingdom will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without one' [emphasis added]. It should be noted that such a statement from MBS is not political posturing. Saudi Arabia is the leader of Sunni Islam worldwide, making it difficult for MBS to renege and settle for a vague reference to the Palestinians’ right to statehood, making him feel obligated to play a central role toward that end. Jordan’s Growing Trepidation The implications of the Gaza war for Jordan are profound and multifaceted. The kingdom faces significant challenges in maintaining internal stability amid rising public anger towards Israel. Jordan must balance its historical commitments to the Palestinian cause and its peace treaty with Israel while managing complex regional dynamics. There are fears of a spillover of refugees from the West Bank and Gaza into Jordan, which can destabilize Jordan, especially if Israel annexes further Palestinian territories in the West Bank. Recently, the far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declared before a meeting of his Religious Zionism party that '2025 is the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' resurrecting the notion that 'Jordan is Palestine,' which terrifies the Kingdom. The ongoing conflicts could also increase militant activity and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, particularly among Jordanian youth. Moreover, regional dynamics involving Iran and other actors further complicate Jordan’s position, which compels the kingdom to navigate threats from Iranian proxies while managing its relationships with Israel, Western allies, and neighboring Arab states. Nothing would allay the Jordanian fears and prevent regional uproar but the creation of a Palestinian state. International Recognition of a Palestinian State One hundred forty-six countries have recognized the Palestinian state, which is a significant step because it legitimizes the Palestinians’ right to statehood and places Palestine on equal footing with other states. It allows countries to establish diplomatic relations and facilitate direct economic ties, sending a clear message to Israel about international support for Palestinian statehood. Of special significance is that three Western European countries, Ireland, Norway, and Spain, have recognized Palestine this year, which may encourage other European states to follow suit. There is no escaping the reality that the Palestinians have made significant inroads into the international arena in support of a Palestinian state. The Israeli Government The current Israeli government led by Netanyahu is unmatched as the most extremist right-wing government since Israel’s creation. It is bent on annexing most of the West Bank and reestablishing Israeli settlements in Gaza. Two of its most radical right-wing ministers, National Security Minister Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Smotrich have stated that the Palestinians, not Israel, are the occupiers of Jewish land. Smotrich recently said, 'The new Nazis need to pay a price through land that will be permanently taken from them, both in Gaza and in Judea and Samaria… we were just a step away from applying sovereignty over the settlements in Judea and Samaria, and now the time has come to do it.' Ben-Gvir and Smotrich were salivating to recall the 2019 statement of Mike Huckabee, Trump’s nominee for US Ambassador to Israel, that he believes Israel has the right to annex significant parts of the West Bank and added that there was no such thing as a settlement or even a Palestinian people. And Steven Witkoff, whom Trump appointed as his special envoy to the Middle East, is also a staunch supporter of Israel. For Netanyahu, these appointees’ positions align ideologically with his government’s policies. There is nothing more ominous for Israel if, indeed, the government implements such a plan that will shatter the Palestinians’ final glimmer of hope, as it will lead to horrific consequences unless Trump prevents it from happening. Trump Faces a Historic Opportunity Trump may well be in the best position to start a genuine Israeli-Palestinian peace process that will eventually lead to Palestinian statehood. Given his commitment to Israel’s security and well-being, he must not allow Israel to annex any more territory in the West Bank or resettle in Gaza, as this will only set the stage for the next horrific conflagration and throw the entire region into unprecedented turmoil. Being an ardent supporter of Israel, and due to the affinity that most Israelis hold towards him, Trump is in a much stronger position than many of his predecessors, not only to call for a two-state solution but act on it. During his first term in office, Trump put forward a peace deal that recognized Palestinian statehood, which was a sharp departure from past proposals; it did not call for the evacuation of Israeli settlements, which is supported by a vast majority of Israelis. Working toward Palestinian statehood would dramatically allay the Jordanians’ deep anxiety about their country’s stability, meet the Saudis’ demand to establish a Palestinian state as a prerequisite to the normalization of relations with Israel, give hope to the Palestinians that the day of their salvation is near, and temper extremism and anti-Israeli sentiments while depriving Iran and its 'axis of resistance' from exploiting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to advance their regional agendas. The biggest obstacle Trump will face is the current Israeli government, which has sworn to never allow the creation of a Palestinian state. They seem to have learned nothing from decades of occupation that has only intensified Palestinian militancy, culminating in Hamas’ savagery and Israel’s retaliatory war. Now, this messianic government wants to annex much of the West Bank, resettle in Gaza, and plunge Israel into interminable violence and destruction unseen before. Indeed, whereas Israel can prevail over any external enemy, the enemy from within is the current Israeli government, which must be dislodged before any agreement can be reached. For Trump to revive the 'deal of the century,' he will have to go over the head of Netanyahu and address the Israeli public directly and point out the stark reality that the Israelis have and continue to be oblivious to but must live with. He should emphasize that: Nearly seven million Palestinians are living in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel proper, which is equal to the number of Jews living in Israel and the West Bank. By what means and for how much longer, he must ask, can Israel dominate and oppress the Palestinians of an equivalent population with no endgame in sight? Ninety percent of all Palestinians were born under occupation; they will deprive Israel of a day of peace until they free themselves from the shackles of the occupation that has dehumanized them and robbed them of their dignity. Coexistence is not one of many options; it is the only option. The Israelis must choose to live in peace or maintain a state of constant hostilities while poisoning one generation after another to be consumed by hatred and disdain toward the Palestinians. Israel has lost much of its moral international standing and more tragically, it is losing its very reason for being. An increasing number of diaspora Jewry feel betrayed by the country they viewed as the sanctuary for any Jew who wants to live in peace and security. Conclusion It is impossible to overestimate the intractable issues between Israel and the Palestinians that must be addressed to reach a peace agreement. But however painful that might be, it will pale if compared to the alternative of continuing death and destruction that will destroy one generation after another. Trump faces a historic opportunity. He can lay the foundation for a Palestinian state or set the stage for the next catastrophic war. His appointment of an extraordinarily supportive team of Israel gives him the latitude and credibility to persuade the Israelis that only a two-state solution offers them peace and security, and his 'Deal of the Century' provides the framework to that end.

How Corruption Permeates Iran’s Ruling System – OpEd	For years, the fabric of the mullahs’ regime ruling Iran has been intertwined with corruption and plunder. Even regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei admitted during the anniversary of the anti-monarchical revolution in 2018: 'Corruption is like the mythical seven-headed dragon; when you cut off one head, the other six continue to move.' However, this dragon has not only persisted but has grown larger and more monstrous each year, continuing to steal the wealth of the people. The agents of the clerical regime themselves admit that 'corruption has struck at the roots of the system.' On September 1, 2016, the state-run Mardomsalari news website wrote, 'Not a day goes by without news of financial abuse, embezzlement, or massive bribery being heard. The figures have numbed the minds of the people, to the point where even mathematics cannot express them anymore.' The cancer of corruption has spread throughout the system. Even Mohammad Javad Hojjati Kermani, a close associate of Khamenei, admitted, 'The cancer of corruption has engulfed the entire system, ranging from moral decline and hypocrisy to economic corruption and internal conflicts' (Source: Ettelaat newspaper, August 19, 2019). However, the severity and depth of regime corruption from those years to the present day is incomparable. According to a report by the Transparency Lab on February 7, 2023, corruption in Iran’s ruling system is defined as 'the legal or illegal misuse of power for personal or factional interests, or to strengthen the power of the political structure.' The corruption dominating the structural and systemic relations of the regime has become so pervasive and deep-rooted that terms like 'under-the-table payment,' 'tea money,' 'kids’ share,' and 'sweetener,' or more bluntly, 'bribe,' are familiar to many Iranian citizens dealing with government offices. The main institutions and organizations that demand bribes from ordinary citizens include 'municipalities, the police force, courts, banks, the tax authority, brokers and intermediaries of organizations and high-ranking officials, customs offices, the tax department, real estate registration offices, civil registry offices, and banks. These entities have been at the forefront of those where administrative obstacles are easily removed through the payment of bribes, and they have contaminated other governmental agencies as well' (Source: Open Data, April 27, 2021). Economist Ahmad Alavi states: 'Systemic corruption in Iran still has many unknown dimensions that account for much of the imbalances in the Iranian economy, such as budgetary discrepancies, energy shortages, issues with pensions, and banking sector crises. What is observed and experienced as corruption is merely a small part, or the ‘tip of the iceberg,’ emerging from the sea of corruption' (Source: Iran-e Emrooz, November 24). According to Alavi, the regime operates based on a 'model of economic rentierism, where oil revenues and other key national resources are allocated not for sustainable development but to maintain the loyalty of officials, supporters of the Supreme Leader, and to strengthen power factions. This allocation also funds soft and hard repression and the export of the Supreme Leader’s ideological discourse. Institutions like the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), semi-private companies, and religious foundations dominate much of the economy, effectively eliminating transparency, accountability, and competition.' Not long ago, Ali Rabiei, the Minister of Labor during Hassan Rouhani’s presidency (2013-2021), revealed that a member of parliament had offered 500 billion rials in exchange for a managerial position in the Social Security Investment Company (Shasta). On November 25, Sazandegi news website quoted Rabiei as saying, 'Not a week goes by without receiving at least two confidential reports of corruption within the companies affiliated with the Ministry of Labor.' Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, speaker of Majlis (Parliament), also presented another example of government corruption: 'Between 25 to 30 million liters of fuel are smuggled out of the country daily. Make no mistake; this smuggling is organized, and the primary producers and major consumers are the first suppliers of this smuggling' (Source: Jahan-e Sanat news website, November 27). On November 27, a reporter at Rouydad 24 website wrote, 'At a meeting of media managers, I seized the opportunity to raise an issue I found critical: the problem of social anger. A powerful feeling told me that this anger poses dangerous consequences for the country, and action must be taken urgently to address it. During the session, I asked Mr. Ghalibaf, ‘What is your share and that of your allies and opponents in creating these conditions? The country is at the edge of a cliff, where even a single grain of sand slipping could lead to a collapse.''	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F0o5ujm5ZI0e	2024-12-07T20:17:55-08:00	
Uzbekistan: Demands To Reopen, Not Demolish, Church And Mosque – ...	By Mushfig Bayram Urgench Council of Churches Baptist Church and Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District Imam al-Bukhari Mosque are being simultaneously demolished. The Baptist Church is being demolished by the Bailiff's Department, and the Mosque by an unknown person or company with the full co-operation of the regime. By 5 December most of the roof, walls, and floors of the Baptist Church were destroyed, and most of the walls, roof, and dome of the Mosque were destroyed. Baptists and Muslims in both cities insist to Forum 18 that they want the demolitions stopped and their buildings returned, so they can use them to meet for worship. On 25 April 2024, two buildings under construction belonging to Urgench Council of Churches Baptists were ordered to be destroyed and were partially demolished. The demolition was halted after protests, but the Baptists were not permitted to repair the damage or complete the construction of the buildings. Regime officials stated, though, that they are 'determined to complete the demolition sooner or later'. This threat is now being carried out. On 4 December, Bailiffs came with police and demolition vehicles and equipment to destroy the buildings. By 5 December most of the roof, walls, and floors of the Baptist Church were destroyed. The regime is 'intent on tearing down the second building after finishing the destruction of the first building', Baptists said (see below). On 2 December, the person Baptists bought the land for their Church from received a letter from Dovron Aitov of Urgench Bailiffs Department that the Department will demolish the buildings, Baptists who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. None of the other owners of buildings on adjoining land bought from him are being threatened with demolition (see below). Local Baptists told Forum 18 that both the buildings, one of which was close to completion for use as a church, are one-storey buildings which are each about 270 square meters (2,900 square feet) in area. Local Baptists insist to Forum 18 that they want the demolition stopped and their buildings restored, so they can use them to meet for worship (see below). Neither Bailiff Aitov, nor Khorasm Regional Bailiffs Department, nor the Land Cadastre Department answered their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 5 and 6 December (see below). Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District's Muhammad Ismoil Mosque, known locally as the Imam al-Bukhari Mosque, is also being demolished at the same time as the Urgench Baptist Church. The building is being demolished by an unknown company or person with the full co-operation of the regime, Muslims who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Sometimes the Mosque had as many as 2,000 Muslims coming to worship before it was closed, local Muslims told Forum 18. The Mosque is a roughly 25 metre (27 yard) high brick building, which is about 900 meters (9,700 square feet) in area, local Muslims said. Demolition of the Mosque began on 27 November, witnesses told Forum 18. By 5 December almost half of the Mosque building - including most of the walls, roof, and dome - had been demolished. Local Muslims have insisted to Forum 18 that they want the demolition stopped and their Mosque restored, so they can use it to meet for worship (see below). The Imam al-Bukhari Mosque was opened in 1995 but forcibly closed by the regime in 2009. Police 'without giving any explanation came one day and told the Imam that the Mosque will be closed down.' One of the Muslims stated that 'we were not happy, but local police falsely told local residents that the Mosque will reopen soon.' Another Muslim told Forum 18 that 'we all were very unhappy our Mosque was closed down in 2009, and we made many official complaints to the authorities.' Local police visited the mahalla several times after the complaints to talk to residents. 'Each time they promised that it would reopen. Just be patient, they told us. But they were lying' (see below). Tashkent Administration in 2016 transferred the mosque and its land to a car wash company, which in 2022 sold it on to an unknown person or company. Demolition workers in December 2024 also refused to reveal the identity of the new owner to local residents, but said that a business centre will be built on the land (see below). The new owner also attempted to demolish the Mosque in 2023, but did not do this after local residents wrote many complaints to local prosecutors and the Prosecutor General's Office (see below). A human rights defender, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, linked the demolition of Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District Imam al-Bukhari Mosque to Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov's June 2024 statement threatening to confiscate mosques for business use. 'This could have encouraged the owner to demolish the Mosque now,' the human rights defender told Forum 18 on 5 December. Muslims, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, have told Forum 18 that they have observed that the demolition is being carried out with the full co-operation of the police (see below). No official answered their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 5 and 6 December. A wide range of religious communities continue to be blocked from using or repairing their own buildings, forcibly closed, gaining state registration, or having their grounds seized without compensation. Urgench Baptist Church's buildings being demolished On 25 April 2024, two buildings under construction belonging to Urgench Council of Churches Baptists were ordered to be destroyed and were partially demolished. The demolition was halted after protests, but they are not being permitted to repair the damage or complete the construction of the buildings, local Baptists told Forum 18 on 21 November. Regime officials stated, though, that they are 'determined to complete the demolition sooner or later'. This threat is now being carried out (see below). Local Baptists told Forum 18 that both the buildings, one of which was close to completion for use as a church, are one-storey buildings which are each about 270 square meters (2,900 square feet) in area. Khorezm Regional Administration officials, and Zafarbek Khojaniyazov of the Land Cadastre Department (who is responsible for dealing with complaints), did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 contacted them between 21 and 25 November. So Forum 18 was not able to ask them why they are refusing to give permission for the Baptists to repair the damage the regime has caused and complete the construction work. The Baptists bought a plot of land from local resident Atajan Kurbanov in Shakkasholikor village of Urgench District on the southern edge of the city's airport in early 2023. Kurbanov sold part of the land to the Baptists and the rest to other people. Many of the purchasers then constructed buildings on their newly-acquired land. Baptists bought the land and constructed the buildings with donations from fellow believers. 'We have all the legal papers that we can construct the buildings on the land,' local Baptist Konstantin Kim told Forum 18 in August 2024. Yet, on 2 December, Kurbanov received a letter from Dovron Aitov of Urgench Bailiffs Department that the Department will demolish the buildings, Baptists who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18 on 5 December. None of the other owners of buildings on adjoining land bought from Kurbanov are being threatened with demolition. On 4 December, Bailiffs came with police and demolition vehicles and equipment to destroy the building. By 5 December most of the roof, walls, and floors of the Baptist Church were destroyed. The regime is 'intent on tearing down the second building after finishing the destruction of the first building', Baptists added. Local Baptists insist to Forum 18 that they want the demolition stopped and their buildings restored, so they can use them to meet for worship. Neither Bailiff Aitov nor Khorezm Regional Bailiffs Department answered their phones whenever Forum 18 rang between 5 and 6 December. Khojaniyazov of the Land Cadastre Department (who is responsible for dealing with complaints) also did not answer his phone whenever Forum 18 called between 5 and 6 December. Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District's Imam al-Bukhari Mosque also being demolished Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District's Imam al-Bukhari Mosque, on the inner ring road to the west of the city centre, is being demolished by an unknown company or person with the full co-operation of the regime, Muslims who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Demolition of the Muhammad Ismoil Mosque, known locally as the Imam al-Bukhari Mosque, began on 27 November, witnesses told Forum 18. By 5 December almost half of the Mosque building including most of the walls, roof, and dome had been demolished. Local Muslims insist to Forum 18 that they want the demolition stopped and their Mosque restored, so they can use it to meet for worship. Mosque opened in 1995, forcibly closed in 2009 The Muhammad Ismoil (Imam al-Bukhari) Mosque was recognised by the state-controlled Religious Affairs Committee on 5 June 1995, and the Tashkent Justice Department registered the Mosque on 15 April 1999. The Religious Affairs Committee appointed an imam for the Mosque in 1995, Imam Muhammad Rakhmonov who was from the same mahalla (local district) as the Mosque. 'Respected elders of our mahalla spent their own money to buy the land in 1991 and paid for the construction of the Mosque,' local Muslims, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, told Forum 18 on 4 December 2024. They stated that sometimes the Mosque had as many as 2,000 Muslims coming to worship. The Mosque is a roughly 25 metre (27 yard) high L-shaped brick building, on a 900 square meters (9,700 square feet) site, local Muslims said. However, in 2009 the regime forcibly closed the Mosque. Police 'without giving any explanation came one day and told the Imam that the Mosque will be closed down'. One of the Muslims stated that 'we were not happy, but local police falsely told local residents that the Mosque will reopen soon.' Another Muslim told Forum 18 that 'we all were very unhappy our Mosque was closed down in 2009, and we made many official complaints to the authorities.' Local police visited the mahalla several times after the complaints to talk to residents. 'Each time they promised that it would reopen. Just be patient, they told us. But they were lying.' Transfer to car wash company, then sold on to unknown owner Tashkent Administration on 23 September 2016 transferred the mosque and its land to a car wash company. The owner of the company told Forum 18 on 4 December that in 2022 he sold the land and Mosque to another person. When Forum 18 asked the car wash company's owner how Tashkent Administration could give him the Mosque and its land, and who the person he sold it to is, he did not answer and put the phone down. Local residents told Forum 18 that they know of this 2022 sale, but do not know the identity of the new owner. Demolition workers in December 2024 also refused to reveal the identity of the new owner to local residents, but said that a business centre will be built on the land. The new owner also attempted to demolish the Mosque in 2023, but did not do this after local residents wrote many complaints to local prosecutors and the Prosecutor General's Office. In written 2023 replies (which Forum 18 has seen), both Tashkent Deputy Prosecutor, E. Inamjanov and City Prosecutor Erkin Yuldashev claimed that Tashkent Administration's decisions are lawful as no claims were made about the ownership of the land and building in due time. Both Prosecutors stated that Shaykhontohur Inter-District Civil Court on 14 February 2011 confiscated the land and the Mosque building for the state. Neither the Prosecutor General's Office, nor Tashkent Prosecutor's Office, answered their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 5 and 6 December 2024. Abdurakhim Kadyrov of the Religious Affairs Committee's section responsible for work with Mosques confirmed to Forum 18 on 29 November that the Mosque was registered until 2009, when its registration was revoked. He would not explain why the Committee has done nothing to help the Mosque or stop the demolition. 'Those decisions were made not by us but by Tashkent Administration. You need to talk to them,' he claimed. Neither Tashkent Administration nor Shaykhontohur District Administration answered their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 3 and 6 December. In another Tashkent place of worship demolition case, it was suggested confidentially to Forum 18 that corruption may have been a factor in a long-threatened demolition by a private company of Tashkent's Ashkenazi Synagogue. No official was willing to explain how a company could be handed property that belongs to a religious organisation whose ownership is recorded on the State Land Registry. The threat to the synagogue was only withdrawn in August 2020after the case attracted international attention. Corruption has long been endemic in the country, including in relation to freedom of religion or belief violations. Many are reluctant to discuss corruption as a factor in the human rights violations they experience, yet there appears to be a strong connection between human rights violations and corruption. Prime Minister orders mosques to be seized, demolished, handed over to business use On 24 June 2024, Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov ordered the seizure and possible demolition of more than 400 unregistered mosques and houses, built by residents but not registered with the Justice Ministry. Some of the buildings to be seized were to be given to entrepreneurs for commercial use. In mid-July, a State Security Service (SSS) secret police officer and an official of the local Administration's Religious Affairs Department came to Abu Zar Mosque in Yangiyul District of Tashkent Region. They said that as the Mosque is not functioning, it will be handed over for business use. A local Muslim linked the move to the Prime Minister's reported 24 June order that unregistered Mosques should be demolished or handed over for business use. Abu Zar Mosque, built with state permission, functioned from the 1990s. The regime closed the mosque in 2007 and it has not functioned since then, despite campaigns by local Muslims to reopen it. When Forum 18 in April pointed out to Jakhongir Azomkhanov, Tashkent Regional Administration's official overseeing freedom of religion or belief issues, that the Abu Zar Mosque was built by the mosque community who would like to pray every day in their own mosque, and that travel to other mosques can be difficult, Azomkhanov did not address those points. On 21 November he refused to speak to Forum 18 about the continued forced closure of the Mosque. Why is Imam al-Bukhari Mosque being demolished now? A human rights defender, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, linked the demolition of Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District Imam al-Bukhari Mosque to Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov's latest statement about confiscating mosques for business use. 'This could have encouraged the owner to demolish the Mosque now,' they told Forum 18 on 5 December. Muslims, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, told Forum 18 that they have observed that the demolition is being carried out with the full co-operation of the police. Prime Minister Aripov's Office did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 5 December and 6 December. Local Muslims have insist to Forum 18 that they want the demolition stopped and their Mosque restored, so they can use it to meet for worship.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F08AVxfHsWeX	2024-12-07T20:16:10-08:00	
Peace Dividend: 80 Years Of US-Saudi Relations – OpEd	By Jonathan Gornall On Feb. 14, 2025, it will be exactly 80 years since King Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia stepped aboard a US warship moored in the Suez Canal for a historic meeting with American President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Roosevelt had a great deal on his mind.In Europe, where Soviet troops were within 60 km of Berlin, the Second World War was drawing to its bloody conclusion, but in the Far East the conflict was a long way from ending.As he welcomed King Abdulaziz aboard the USS Quincy in Egypt’s Great Bitter Lake, Roosevelt knew that in five days’ time thousands of US Marines would die in a costly battle to seize the Pacific island of Iwo Jima.The storming of the island of Okinawa, the last battle before an anticipated invasion of the Japanese home islands, would follow on April 1. This would prove even more bloody, costing the lives of 100,000 American and Japanese soldiers.The president, who in 1942 had launched the top-secret Manhattan Project, was wrestling with an epoch-defining decision: whether to end the war by using the world’s first nuclear weapons.But in February 1945, Roosevelt, on his way back to the US from the Yalta conference of the soon-to-be-victorious Allies, made time to meet the man known in the West as Ibn Saud — the enigmatic leader who in 1932 had successfully united the tribes of Najd and Hijaz under the banner of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Roosevelt knew that, even as the Second World War was drawing to a close, in the wings a new world order was taking shape — and that Saudi Arabia was a nation that the US needed to befriend.The president did not have long to live — in two months’ time he would be dead. But the meeting with King Abdulaziz was the first step toward a close relationship between the two countries that has endured for the past eight decades.Eighty years is a mere blink of the eye of time — there are Saudis alive today who were alive when the president met the king. Yet in that time the Kingdom has developed beyond all recognition, and its influence on the world stage has grown exponentially.On the eve of a new year fraught with uncertainty, that influence is set to play a pivotal role in the thinking of key players, including the new US president-elect, as the Middle East seeks to turn its back on death and destruction and looks forward with hope to a future of peace and prosperity.It was not by chance that during his first presidency President Donald Trump’s first official overseas trip, in May 2017, was to Saudi Arabia. At the time the visit was portrayed in Western media as a departure from diplomatic norms, but in fact since 1974 no fewer than eight US presidents have followed Roosevelt eastward and walked on Saudi soil in recognition of the reality that the Kingdom is an influential locus of security and stability in an otherwise troubled and unstable region.It is not yet known where President-elect Trump’s travels will take him after his inauguration on Jan. 20. But what is clear is that his administration will be looking toward Saudi Arabia as a key partner in Trump’s declared intention to end the war in Palestine and Lebanon swiftly. The Americans are not alone in looking to Saudi Arabia as a vital partner in diplomacy and commerce, as the recent appearances of British Princess Beatrice at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh and, with her sister Princess Eugenie, at the World Economic Forum meeting in the city in April testify.The upcoming visit to the Kingdom of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is further evidence of the extent to which the polarity of the relationship between the two countries has reversed since the days when Britain rather highhandedly considered the Arabian Peninsula to be within its sphere of influence.Eighty years ago, Roosevelt saw that the postwar world would become increasingly dependent on the emerging oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states.But his meeting with King Abdulaziz in 1945 had a second purpose — to persuade the most influential leader on the Arabian Peninsula that, in the wake of the Nazi persecution of Europe’s Jews, Palestine should become a Jewish homeland.On this matter the king was adamant, and prescient.At their meeting, with his words recorded by an American translator, the Saudi ruler had told Roosevelt that 'amends should be made by the criminal, not by the innocent bystander.'What injury have Arabs done to the Jews of Europe?' he asked. 'It is the ‘Christian’ Germans who stole their homes and lives. Let the Germans pay.'King Abdulaziz felt so strongly that a great catastrophe was about to be unleashed on the Middle East that after their meeting he wrote to Roosevelt to press his case again.'To install Jews from every horizon in this sacred Muslim Arab country,' would be 'a calamitous and infamous miscarriage of justice,' he wrote in a letter dated April 30, 1945.The Jews, he predicted, 'will do wrong to the quiet and peaceful Arabs. The Heavens will split, the earth will be rent asunder, and the mountains will tremble at what the Jews claim in Palestine, both materially and spiritually.'Three years after the historic meeting on board the USS Quincy, on May 14, 1948, Zionist leader David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel, which was recognized by US President Harry S. Truman, Roosevelt’s successor, that same day.The tragic consequences of the Jewish colonial adventure, foretold by King Abdulaziz, are still with us.It can only be hoped that in 2025 the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia, begun 80 years ago and alive today in the affinity between Trump and a Saudi leadership committed to sovereignty for the Palestinian people, might yet yield the long overdue dividend of peace, prosperity, and justice for the Arabs of Palestine. • Jonathan Gornall is a British journalist, formerly with The Times, who has lived and worked in the Middle East and is now based in the UK.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F-lP07Co6xSm	2024-12-07T20:15:17-08:00	
A Nation’s Betrayal: The Unfolding Tragedy Of Hindus In Banglades...	The Hindu community of Bangladesh, once an integral and vibrant part of the region's cultural mosaic, is now enduring systemic oppression, targeted violence, and ever-deepening marginalization. Rooted in the land for centuries, this minority group has continuously faced challenges shaped by the tumultuous events of the 1947 partition, the liberation war of 1971, and the evolving political landscape of Bangladesh. Their story is one of profound sacrifice during key moments in history, particularly during the war for independence, juxtaposed with their relentless struggle for justice and equality in an increasingly exclusionary society. Created in 1947 as a Muslim-majority state during the partition of India, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) saw many Hindus migrate to India, yet a substantial number remained in East Pakistan, anchored by their deep cultural ties, economic investments, and hopes for peaceful coexistence. The Bengali Hindus shared a common language, history, and social fabric with their Muslim neighbors, which fostered optimism about a future based on pluralism. However, this hope would soon clash with reality as the Hindu community faced growing discrimination, economic dispossession, and rising communal violence, all set against the backdrop of a state increasingly defined by its Islamic identity. The 1971 war of independence marked a pivotal moment for the Bangladeshi Hindu community. Amidst brutal repression by the Pakistani military, Hindus were disproportionately targeted, branded as traitors, and subjected to horrific atrocities. The community played a crucial role in the independence struggle, contributing as freedom fighters, intellectuals, and resistance organizers. The Mukti Bahini, the guerrilla force leading the insurgency, included numerous Hindu combatants who laid down their lives for the nation's freedom. Yet, despite their significant contributions, the Hindus bore immense losses, with a disproportionate number of them falling victim to the three million civilian casualties during the war. Figures like Dhirendranath Datta, a celebrated leader and language advocate who was tortured and executed, serve as enduring symbols of the Hindu community’s sacrifices, yet their valor and suffering have often been overlooked in the post-independence narrative. The initial promise of a secular Bangladesh, championed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, offered hope to the Hindu minority. However, the assassination of Rahman in 1975 marked a drastic shift in the nation's political landscape. Under successive military regimes, Bangladesh drifted towards Islamist politics, with the secular framework of the early years gradually replaced by the formal declaration of Islam as the state religion, further marginalizing Hindus. Over the decades, Hindus have been subjected to recurrent communal violence—attacks on temples, homes, and businesses—especially in times of political instability. The 2021 Durga Puja attacks, among many others, underscored the persistent vulnerability of the community. Moreover, Hindus have faced systemic economic marginalization, including rampant land-grabbing, which has forced many to seek refuge in India or abroad. The demographic decline of Hindus in Bangladesh—from roughly 30% of the population at the time of Partition to a mere 8% today—underscores the magnitude of their ongoing struggles. Despite constitutional safeguards, Hindus remain conspicuously absent from political power and decision-making processes. Their contributions to Bangladesh's independence and subsequent development are frequently minimized or forgotten, while their continued persecution raises critical questions about the future of pluralism and human rights in the nation. This article seeks to illuminate the unyielding resilience and sacrifices of Bangladeshi Hindus, while calling attention to the urgent need for protective measures to safeguard their dignity, safety, and equal rights in a nation they helped shape. The Persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh The situation of Hindus in Bangladesh has deteriorated sharply in recent months, as they face systematic and widespread persecution. This minority community, once an integral part of the country’s rich cultural and religious tapestry, now endures heinous acts of violence, property confiscation, and destruction of religious sites. Thousands of Hindus have been killed in these attacks, with their homes and places of worship looted and destroyed. Women and children, particularly vulnerable, face grave abuse and exploitation, with little to no legal recourse or protection. This sustained persecution is largely driven by extremist factions within the country, and despite Bangladesh’s founding ideals of secularism, there has been a growing climate of impunity surrounding these violent acts. The rule of law has weakened considerably, as local authorities often turn a blind eye to the atrocities committed against the Hindu population. Furthermore, there is a lack of freedom of religion, with attacks on Hindu temples, rituals, and festivals becoming increasingly common. The targeted violence against Hindus is compounded by a series of discriminatory policies that marginalize this community socially, economically, and politically. Religious minorities have found themselves excluded from vital decision-making processes, and Hindu leaders and activists are often subjected to harassment and even death threats. These incidents are not isolated but part of a broader pattern of violence that has escalated with alarming regularity. The international community's response to the suffering of Hindus in Bangladesh has been largely inadequate. Despite reports from human rights organizations and diplomatic efforts by countries such as India, there is little pressure on the Bangladeshi government to address the issue effectively. This lack of intervention has left the Hindu population increasingly isolated, with no one to hear their cries for justice. The plight of Hindus in Bangladesh is a reminder of the fragility of religious freedom and the importance of safeguarding the rights of minority communities. Unless urgent measures are taken to restore the rule of law, protect religious freedoms, and hold perpetrators accountable, the situation for Hindus in Bangladesh will only continue to worsen, pushing this ancient community further into the margins of society. The recent attacks on the Hindu community in Bangladesh, including the arrest of prominent spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das, have highlighted an alarming escalation of religious persecution and societal unrest. Das, widely respected for his humanitarian work during the COVID-19 pandemic, was detained under baseless allegations, drawing attention to the increasing vulnerability of minorities in the country. His arrest is part of a broader trend where religious and political forces, particularly from Islamist factions, are targeting Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh. Adding to the injustice, two of his close aides—Radharaman Dass and Vaibhav—were attacked just last week. The violence did not stop there. Chinmoy Krishna Das's lawyer, who sought to defend him, was also targeted in a brutal assault. In a shocking move, the Bar Council of Bangladesh, an esteemed legal body, issued a warning to all lawyers, discouraging them from representing Das in the ongoing case. This escalation of violence against Das and his supporters is a clear signal of the deteriorating state of religious freedom and the rule of law in Bangladesh. The Rise of Islamist Extremism: Islamist factions, particularly the Jamaat-e-Islami, have been instrumental in fomenting religious and sectarian violence in Bangladesh. These groups are reportedly leveraging the current political and social chaos to further their agenda, which often includes targeting religious minorities, especially Hindus. The role of Islamist organizations in orchestrating such attacks cannot be understated. Their influence in the political and social spheres has emboldened them to engage in acts of violence, with the explicit aim of weakening the Hindu community's presence and participation in Bangladeshi society. Jamaat-e-Islami, along with other extremist groups, has long been accused of stoking hatred and intolerance toward religious minorities. Their rhetoric, which often vilifies non-Muslims, has gained traction, particularly in rural areas where law enforcement is less effective. These groups seek to create a society where religious minorities are marginalized and oppressed, further exacerbating the societal divisions. The International Community’s Role: The international community must take note of the worsening situation in Bangladesh. While the government of Bangladesh continues to insist on maintaining an image of tolerance, the reality on the ground paints a much darker picture. Human rights organizations have long documented the plight of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh, and the recent escalation of violence against figures like Chinmoy Krishna Das is a stark reminder that the situation is dire. Foreign governments, especially those with close ties to Bangladesh, should urge the authorities to take stronger actions to protect religious minorities and ensure that justice is served in cases like that of Das. Additionally, international legal bodies should press for an investigation into the attacks on religious leaders and their supporters, ensuring that perpetrators are held accountable. The Role of Bangladesh's Interim Government The violence against Hindus in Bangladesh has exposed significant complicity and inaction by the interim government, further aggravating the community's plight. Reports suggest that the violent mobs, often targeting Hindu communities, enjoyed tacit or overt support from elements within the government. This impunity has emboldened perpetrators, making the situation even more dire. Government Complicity and Security Forces' Inaction: Accounts from victims and eyewitnesses highlight that security forces, including police and army personnel, frequently stood as silent spectators during violent attacks on Hindu communities. For instance, during the spate of communal violence in 2021, there were numerous instances where the police failed to intervene as rioters torched homes, looted businesses, and desecrated temples. The lack of action by law enforcement authorities has fueled perceptions of state complicity. Specific examples include incidents where Hindu families were attacked in broad daylight, their cries for help ignored by nearby police officers. In many cases, police reportedly delayed filing complaints or refused to take action against known assailants, exacerbating the community's vulnerability. The dismissive stance of prominent Bangladeshi figures like Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus has further undermined efforts to address these issues. Yunus, while internationally celebrated, has publicly denied the severity of the violence against Hindus, framing it as exaggerated or inconsequential. This narrative diminishes the real suffering of victims and contributes to a culture of impunity. Impact of Violence on South Asia The targeted violence against Hindus in Bangladesh reverberates across South Asia, affecting the region's socio-political dynamics, interfaith harmony, and international relations. 1. Strain on Regional Stability: The ongoing violence contributes to instability within Bangladesh, undermining the country’s democratic framework and creating a climate of fear and division. This instability can spill over into neighboring countries, potentially escalating cross-border tensions. Communal violence often fuels extremist ideologies, providing fertile ground for militant groups that threaten the security of the entire region. 2. Exodus and Refugee Crisis: Persistent persecution has led to waves of Hindu migration from Bangladesh to India. This not only strains India’s resources but also impacts its domestic political landscape, as the influx of refugees often becomes a contentious issue in national and state-level politics. The refugee crisis could also challenge bilateral relations, with India pushing for accountability and solutions from Dhaka, thereby straining diplomatic ties. 3. Erosion of Interfaith Harmony: Communal violence in Bangladesh sends shockwaves through South Asia, where diverse communities coexist. Such incidents deepen mistrust among religious groups, making interfaith dialogue and reconciliation efforts more challenging. The violence can also incite retaliatory actions or communal tensions in other countries, further destabilizing the region. 4. Diplomatic Ramifications: The violence and the Bangladeshi government's inaction draw criticism from international communities, including India, the United States, and other global actors. This puts Bangladesh’s reputation as a secular and progressive nation at risk. India, as the region's largest democracy, faces pressure to act decisively, balancing its diplomatic approach with Bangladesh while advocating for the protection of minorities. 5. Impact on Regional Integration: The violence undermines regional integration efforts, such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), as trust among member states is eroded. The lack of decisive action by Bangladesh risks isolating it within the regional framework. Economic and cultural cooperation, vital for South Asia's collective growth, also suffers, as communal discord weakens people-to-people ties and trade partnerships. 6. Moral and Humanitarian Crisis: The persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh presents a moral crisis for South Asia, challenging the region's commitment to upholding human rights and protecting minority communities. The failure to address these issues reflects poorly on the region’s collective progress. The violence against Hindus in Bangladesh is not an isolated domestic issue; it is a regional challenge with far-reaching consequences. It demands collective action from South Asian nations to promote justice, peace, and the preservation of the region's pluralistic ethos. Bangladesh's Hindus: Hopes and Expectations The Hindu community in Bangladesh, besieged by relentless persecution, is at a crossroads, looking for viable options to safeguard their lives, dignity, and cultural identity. Their expectations span three crucial dimensions: from their own government, from the global community, and from India and its people. Each of these avenues offers potential solutions, but all require decisive action and sustained advocacy. Expectations from the Global Community; Bangladesh’s Hindus are increasingly looking to the global stage for advocacy and intervention. They expect international organizations, foreign governments, and human rights groups to: Raise Awareness: Amplify their plight through global media and forums like the United Nations, ensuring their voices are heard on a broader platform. Sanctions and Pressure: Impose diplomatic and economic pressures on the Bangladeshi government to enforce minority protection laws. Humanitarian Aid: Provide direct support to displaced or victimized Hindu families through NGOs and relief organizations. The global response so far, though supportive in rhetoric, has often lacked the urgency required to drive meaningful change. Expectations from India and Its People’ As a neighboring country with deep historical and cultural ties to Bangladesh, India holds a unique place in the hopes of the Bangladeshi Hindu community. They look to India for: Moral and Diplomatic Support: Sustained diplomatic pressure on the Bangladeshi government to address Hindu persecution, while maintaining bilateral relations. Facilitating Refuge: Providing safe haven and legal pathways for persecuted Hindus to seek asylum in India, as was done during the 1971 liberation war. Strengthening Advocacy: Ensuring the Hindu diaspora in India and abroad becomes vocal in advocating for the rights of their counterparts in Bangladesh. Cultural Preservation: Initiating cross-border cultural exchange programs to celebrate and preserve the heritage of Bangladeshi Hindus. Indian civil society has already demonstrated solidarity, but the community seeks more robust and consistent intervention to secure their future. A Cry for Justice and Equality; The options for Bangladesh's Hindus ultimately hinge on collective accountability and action. They need their government to prioritize justice, the global community to amplify their concerns, and India to serve as their steadfast ally. Without these interventions, their survival as a vibrant and thriving community remains precarious. The world must act decisively to protect not just a minority but an essential part of Bangladesh’s cultural and historical fabric. Conclusion The plight of Hindus in Bangladesh underscores a deep and ongoing crisis, one that is rooted in historical injustices and exacerbated by the failure of successive governments to uphold the principles of equality and justice. From the partition of 1947 to the violence of today, the Hindu community has borne the brunt of systematic marginalization, cultural erosion, and physical attacks. Despite their significant contributions to Bangladesh’s independence and development, Hindus find themselves in an increasingly precarious position. The journey forward is fraught with challenges, but it is not devoid of hope. The Bangladeshi government must take urgent and concrete steps to protect its Hindu citizens and preserve the nation's pluralistic identity. The global community must go beyond symbolic gestures, offering tangible support and applying meaningful pressure on Dhaka to act against perpetrators of communal violence. India, as a historical ally and a nation bound by shared cultural ties, has a moral responsibility to advocate for the rights and safety of Hindus in Bangladesh. The Hindu community’s resilience, contributions, and sacrifices are a testament to their unwavering commitment to the ideals of equality and coexistence. However, their survival and prosperity now depend on a united front—one that brings together national accountability, international advocacy, and cross-border solidarity. Protecting the Hindus of Bangladesh is not just a moral imperative but a crucial step toward building a more just, inclusive, and peaceful South Asia.

The Elitist Tyranny Of ‘Western Democracy’ Is Exposed And Crumbli...	The charade of Western democracy is rapidly unraveling as so-called leaders and their dutiful media show themselves to be brazenly unaccountable to citizens while pursuing elitist, criminal interests. Biden using presidential powers to pardon his drug-addict felonious son – after promising he wouldn’t. Western media claims that the upsurge in conflict in Syria is a 'civil war' and not due to NATO-backed terrorist proxies. Western support for genocide in Gaza and a fascist Israeli leader who is mass murdering his way to avoid court prosecution for years of corruption. Western support for a money-laundering NeoNazi regime in Kiev whose proxy war against Russia could spiral into nuclear annihilation. Western sponsoring of anti-government violence in Georgia after pro-EU groups lost an election there. The pro-West South Korean leader declaring police state powers to avoid prosecution for corruption. That’s just a quick sample of something more ample in the West’s decaying image. The visit to China this week by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock was another revealing fiasco. The obsessively anti-Russia Baerbock landed in Beijing not to prioritize improving trade relations with the European Union’s biggest global partner but rather to browbeat China with tedious allegations that it was helping Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. What’s more important? Getting along with China to bolster trade and jobs for millions of Germans and Europeans, or gratuitously grandstand over a wanton proxy war in Ukraine? Understandably, the Chinese authorities were not pleased by Baerbock’s insolence and gave her short shrift. She was snubbed by China’s foreign minister Wang Yi not affording a customary joint press conference after more than three hours of discussions. In a separate statement, China again rejected claims that it was aiding Russia militarily in Ukraine. So here we have Germany’s top diplomat who is soon out of a job because her coalition government has collapsed and is facing new elections – but she flies to Beijing on taxpayer money to aggravate relations with China, whose annual trade with the EU amounts to over $700 billion. At her solo press conference in Beijing, Baerbock doubled down in her arrogance, accusing China of jeopardizing peace and security in Europe because it supports Russia. She claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was dragging Asia into the war with Ukraine. The double-think is astounding. Germany, the European Union, NATO, and the United States have done everything to drag the whole world into a war because of its reckless proxy machinations in Ukraine against Russia. The utter failure of that gamble has cost European and American taxpayers a combined $200 billion and could frighteningly escalate into a nuclear conflagration. Baerbock turned reality on its head when she accused Russia of pulling Asia into the war in Ukraine. It is the United States, NATO, and European Atlanticist leaders who are expanding the proxy war to other regions, including the Middle East and Asia. Western so-called democracies and NATO are supporting the upsurge in violence in Syria by terrorist militias under the banner of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an internationally proscribed terror organization affiliated with Al Qaeda. Ukrainian military personnel and Turkey (which means NATO personnel) are reliably reported to be assisting the militants in Syria with drone technology. Evidently, the U.S.-led NATO proxy war in Ukraine is going badly as Russian forces steadily advance against the crumbling Kiev regime. Flaring up the dormant NATO proxy war in Syria is a desperate measure to divert Russian forces to assist its ally, President Bashar al-Assad. The lame-duck U.S. President Joe Biden is desperately throwing billions of dollars to prop up the Kiev regime before he leaves the White House next month. This is despite Americans voting him out of office partly because they are disgusted by his failed warmongering in Ukraine. This is the same president who this week pardoned his son’s criminal convictions and spared him from several years in jail. How much more evidence is needed to show that Western democracies have descended into oligarchies run by elitist politicians who consider themselves above the law and have nothing but contempt for representing ordinary citizens’ interests? The entire European Union has been captured by Atlanticist elites who have imposed policies that serve hegemonic Western interests and not the interests of ordinary citizens. That’s a definition of treason. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen are some of the other bought-and-paid-for politicians who embody the Atlanticist tyranny. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who is now NATO secretary-general (sinecures and pay-offs are us), and Polish Premier Donald Tusk are other examples. The feeble Danish, Finnish, Swedish and Baltic leaders are also part of the U.S. vassals club. Imbued with elitist ideology and deep-seated Russophobia, seduced by bribery, or coerced by the CIA blackmail, all these political prostitutes have been played to betray the interests of European citizens and to make life for the masses incredibly harsh. Russian energy has been cut off leaving European economies shattered. Germany is the most salient case in point where its vital auto industries are collapsing due to higher energy costs. Another absurd elitist puppet is Kaja Kallas, the former Estonian Premier, who is now the European Union’s foreign minister, taking over from that other Atlanticist tool, Josep Borrell. On her first day in office this week, Kallas visited Kiev to pledge more financial and military aid for the corrupt NeoNazi regime. That’s right. She goes to a NeoNazi regime whose expired president canceled elections, imprisons opposition politicians, censors critical, independent media, and forces military conscription on citizens who want the conflict with Russia to end. Don’t you think Kallas would have been better visiting the EU’s biggest trade partner, China, to repair relations? While in Kiev, Kallas coordinated with Germany’s Baerbock in Beijing by repeating baseless condemnation of China for its strategic partnership with Russia. Kallas accused China of prolonging the war in Ukraine simply by maintaining trade relations with Russia, buying Russian gas, and so on. This politician from a tiny Baltic state of less than 1.5 million people is now running the foreign policy of the EU whose total population is 450 million. Kallas, who is obsessed with the Russophobia typical of the Atlanticist elites, has threatened to impose higher trade tariffs on China over tenuous allegations of supporting Russia. The EU has already shot itself in both feet from slavishly following the U.S. imperialist agenda to 'strategically defeat' Russia. Now, these same elitist politicians want to compound their treasonous betrayal of European interests by destroying relations with China. However, the crass servility to an Atlanticist ideology of bankrupt democratic pretensions is rebounding with self-destruction. Western governments (in reality, regimes) and their discredited elitist charlatans are being run out of office due to growing popular disgust over lies and contradictions. Every Western state is being shaken to its core as more of its people see rank corruption and deception that for decades masqueraded as 'democracy'. Western ‘democracy’ is like a vampire. It sucked the blood of too many people for too many years – all with impunity under the cloak of being virtuous. But in the light of truth, it is decaying and crumbling.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F3AKPyzlb9lo	2024-12-07T20:12:31-08:00	
Trump Administration Energy And Climate Policy Imperatives – OpEd	Base policies on reality – not myths, models, misinformation and fearmongering Donald Trump and JD Vance have a mandate on energy, economic, immigration and other issues that won them 50% of popular, 58% of electoral and 82% of US county votes. On January 20 they will begin tackling the numerous problems bequeathed by the Biden-Harris Administration and Washington Deep State: illegal immigration of criminals, terrorists and opportunists; outrageous government spending by bloated federal agencies; wars and crises across the globe; and federal and state politicians and bureaucrats determined to slow or stymie their every move. Mr. Trump will let the DOGE out, to cut government waste. Pundits and political pros are offering advice across the board. My suggestions center on the 'climate crisis' and the destructive policies it has justified. * First and foremost, withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate straitjacket. Its terms and subsequent agreements require that the USA and other industrialized nations switch from fossil fuels to 'clean renewable' energy and de-modernize agricultural and other practices, to eliminate 'greenhouse gas' (GHG) emissions. That would bring blackouts, de-industrialization and job losses. It would also mean now-rich nations must pay developing countries $300 billion per year for climate damage 'compensation' and renewable energy financing. But China, India and other developing countries need not cut emissions and will continue using coal, oil and natural gas in ever-increasing quantities, to modernize, create vibrant economies and lift more people out of poverty. That would mean even zero fossil fuel use by Western nations would not reduce global atmospheric GHG levels at all. Better yet, send the Paris document to Congress for Article II Senate advice and two-thirds consent. President Obama's sly move of calling this accord a mere 'agreement' that required no Senate 'treaty' review cannot be countenanced. Paris was among the most far-reaching, impactful agreements in US history. It affects our energy, economy, jobs, living standards, healthcare, national security and more. It's a treaty and should be treated as such. * Equally important, eliminate the institutionalized junk science, assertions and fearmongering that fossil fuel use has caused an existential climate crisis for people and planet. Begin by reexamining the 2009 Obama Environmental Protection Agency 'Endangerment Finding' that carbon dioxide 'pollution' threatens the American people's health and welfare. Fossil fuels provide 80% of America's energy; raw materials for thousands of petrochemical products; and the foundation of our economy, health and welfare. Their emissions certainly contribute to the 0.04% CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, but this miracle molecule enables and spurs plant growth, thereby feeding the animal kingdom and making nearly all life possible. EPA's convoluted finding defied science and reality. It allowed the Obama and Biden Administrations to justify biased climate 'research,' anti-fossil fuel regulations, sprawling wind and solar installations, and the transformation of America's entire energy system and economy. The Endangerment Decision was likely the most 'major federal action' in US history, yet it has no real statutory basis. It clearly defies the Supreme Court's decisions in West Virginia v. EPA, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council and Loper Bright Enterprises, Inc., v. Raimondo. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin should direct the agency to formally and publicly reexamine the secretive process that EPA employed to ensure its 'endangerment' decision – with no contrarian science, evidence, questions or public hearings permitted to challenge its preordained edict. A fair, balanced, scientific review would demolish the faulty Finding and bring the agency into compliance with SCOTUS rulings. The President-elect's appointment of energy and environmental 'czars' and National Energy Council will build on those important steps, help restore reality and common sense to America's energy and climate policies, rein in other Biden-era regulations and executive actions, and advance Mr. Trump's promise of US energy dominance and economic resurgence. Other actions the new Administration and Congress should take include the following. * Utilize the Congressional Review Act to reverse eleventh-hour Biden-Harris regulatory sprees – such as its ban on further coal leasing in the Powder River Basin. * Open all US non-National-Park areas for no/low impact evaluation and exploration, to identify prospects warranting more detailed assessments for critically needed metals and minerals. Most of these public land areas were deliberately made off-limits to such evaluations by Congress, courts and the Deep State, making it impossible to weigh surface values against potential for world-class subsurface deposits. China's recent ban on exports of several vital metals and minerals underscores yet again why America must not rely on adversaries for raw materials critical for US defense, aerospace, battery, AI, wind, solar and other industries – especially when those materials could be found and developed in America, under the world's best pollution control and environmental protection rules, technologies and practices. * Reopen the Delaware-sized 'coastal plain' of Alaska's South-Carolina-sized Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing, exploration and drilling. Congressional legislation in 2017 explicitly allowed those activities, but President Biden unilaterally cancelled all leases and permits in 2023. * Require that applicants for climate change research and modeling grants demonstrate that their previous models and studies have been confirmed by actual temperature, drought and extreme weather data and evidence; and provide computer codes and analyses so that reviewers can view and evaluate their work. * Define 'sustainability' to reflect complete global life-cycle raw material requirements, mining and processing needs and impacts, energy required to produce raw materials and manufacture energy and other systems, and land, air and water pollution resulting from all those activities. This will ensure that wind, solar, battery, electric vehicle and other technologies are not classified as 'clean, renewable and sustainable' merely because they don't emit CO2 or pollution after they actually start operating. * End subsidies and fast-track permitting for wind and solar installations – especially offshore wind, where raw material requirements and costs are many times higher than for onshore turbines, and far more excessive than that for combined-cycle gas generators. * Require that wind and solar projects, and associated backup battery and transmission line projects, meet the same environmental review standards and requirements as required for oil, gas, coal and metals mining, and nuclear projects, regarding local, regional and global air and water pollution, land and habitat destruction, wildlife disturbance and loss, and post-project equipment removal and land reclamation. Even better, cancel the entire offshore wind program. Its electricity is weather-dependent and ultra-expensive, threatens wildlife and fisheries, and requires unjustifiable amounts of raw materials. * Expand and streamline programs to bring new nuclear power plants online, especially small modular reactors – to meet rapidly expanding needs for abundant, reliable, affordable electricity for data centers, artificial intelligence, and increasingly electrified households, technologies and industries. * Terminate Diversity Equity Inclusion, Environment Social Governance, and Environmental and Climate Justice programs, offices and funding. They only serve as twisted justifications for arbitrarily selecting preferred companies and communities that are often less qualified to serve public health and safety. There is much more to be done. But this is a solid beginning for reducing or eliminating needless, excessive and harmful pseudo-science, grants, policies, practices and regulations – and restoring government of, by and for the People.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F_lIg9aCxuBi	2024-12-07T20:11:06-08:00	
Chinese Aid Cannot Overcome Myanmar Junta’s Declining Finances An...	By Zachary Abuza Despite being bolstered by an unprecedented degree of Chinese diplomatic and material support, Myanmar’s military has had mixed results in the past few weeks, in the face of mounting economic and fiscal challenges. The State Administrative Council (SAC) - as the junta is officially called - has continued to suffer military setbacks that have economic implications of their own. With the capture of Kan Paik Ti, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has consolidated control of the entire border with China and stepped up their offensive in the mineral rich regions. The KIA announced that it would allow the resumption of rare-earth mining in the Pangwa-Chipwi region, now under its control. In Rakhine, the Arakan Army captured Toungup, which prevents overland supply to Kyaukphyu from the south. The Arakan Army have captured the military’s last posts in Ann town, home of the headquarters of the Western Military Command and a major pumping station for the oil and gas pipelines to China. Over 800 soldiers – mainly hastily trained conscripts – have surrendered in the recent campaign. The Arakan Army now controls 11 of 17 towns in Rakhine. While there has been considerable tension between the Arakan Army and the fractious Chin opposition forces in the past, there’s been an unprecedented degree of cooperation now. Local Chin Defense Forces and the Arakan Army have interrupted resupply convoys from Magwe into Ann, capturing at least 14 soldiers. Ceasefires in Shan state In northeastern Myanmar near the border with China, the Chinese stepped up their pressure on the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or MNDAA, and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, or TNLA. On Dec. 4, the MNDAA, which has been fighting for years for autonomy for the Kokang region, declared a ceasefire in its war against the military, the second insurgent force in days to cite pressure from China for its willingness to talk peace. The move followed the TNLA’s announcement that they would agree to talks with the junta. The regime’s counter offensive in northern Shan state continues to make little headway, and the battles have been pitched and casualties high. The regime continues to intentionally target civilians with air power. The opposition has suffered some setbacks in Karenni and in Magwe and Sagaing, where logistics troubles continue to impede their gains. Karen forces continue to opportunistically ambush junta forces. But the junta is facing its own resource challenges, and is desperate to reverse its losses ahead of Chinese-supported elections that are scheduled for 2025. But with only 40% of Myanmar’s territory under its full control, it’s hard to see how elections could serve as anything but a shambolic off-ramp for the generals. Despite the overall 12% contraction of the economy since the February 2021 coup d’etat, the junta’s defense expenditure has surged by 222%, from 1.746 trillion kyats in 2021 to 3.703 trillion kyats in 2022 to 5.635 trillion kyats (over US$2.7 billion) in 2023. The regime has not disclosed its defense budget for 2024 or 2025. Tight finances ahead At a recent meeting of the SAC’s Financial Commission, Gen. Soe Win acknowledged that Min Aung Hlaing had directed spending on security to take precedence over all other public spending, despite the fact that the military’s provision of these public goods and social services has withered in the past three years. A recent Radio Free Asia report found that the country is producing only 300MWs of electricity, a 25% decline since the coup, with many power generating facilities inoperable, or beyond the junta’s control. The country requires 540MW. Where the money for increased defense spending will come from, is anyone’s guess. Finances are tight for the junta, with foreign exchange in perpetually short supply. The regime’s currency controls remain in place, which has devastated the business community, forcing them to sell their foreign exchange at artificially low rates, prompting more companies to try to hide their assets abroad. The opposition’s control of four of the five official crossings with China has added to the financial pain, as border trade can be conducted in yuan and kyats, not dollars. That is the crux of the regime’s lobbying of China to pressure the TNLA and MNDAA, two members of the Three Brotherhood Alliance that had led offensives against the junta since October 2023, to stop their offensives. Foreign investment has fallen each year since the coup, from $1.64 billion in FY2022-23 to $661 million in FY2023-24. Now, more than three years in, investors have lost all confidence. The military government’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA), revealed that foreign investment in the first seven months of FY 2024-25 totaled only $226 million. DICA’s data, as reported in Myanmar-Now, shows that most of that investment went to existing projects and operations; only four of 33 this year are greenfield investors. Scaring up revenue The junta has been searching for new sources of revenue. The regime’s Minister of Energy, Ko Ko Lwin, held talks with the chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation in Beijing, where they discussed additional sales of oil and gas, and improbably increasing the capacity of Myanmar-China oil and gas pipelines. Min Aug Hlaing made a show of attending the Myanmar Gems Emporium in Naypyidaw on Nov. 18, 2024, which remains one of the few reliable income streams for the junta. The Irrawaddy noted that each year since the coup, the offered lots of jade have increased – from 1,955 in 2021, to 2,150 in 2022 and 4,025 in 2023. The TNLA has worked to deprive the junta of proceeds from the ruby trade in Mogoke. While it has allowed individual miners to continue, the TNLA has blocked all large-scale mechanized mining, which has been dominated by the military-owned Myanma Economic Holdings Limited. Short on manpower, the junta is doing everything it can to force overseas workers home to be conscripted. A new regulation puts the onus on manpower agencies to recall workers who have been conscripted. They have lobbied the Thai government to send the 2 million legal residents and upwards of 3 million undocumented Myanmar nationals home. Those that continue to work abroad are a cash cow for the junta. In September the SAC enacted a rule to force the expatriate workers to transfer 25% of their remittances through formal bank channels, where they must use the official exchange rate of 2,100 kyats to the dollar and 56 kyats to the baht. The black market rate is 3,400 kyats to the dollar and around 100 kyats per baht. Economic warfare The junta, however, is also waging its own economic warfare on the opposition. While the junta has not been able to retake Mogoke or Lashio, it is actively bombing the towns to disrupt economic activity. China’s border closures and internet and electricity outages of opposition-controlled crossings have put considerable financial pressure on the citizens in territories near the frontier controlled by ethnic armies. Now the junta has blocked the sale of petroleum to opposition-controlled regions. Fuel distribution is now legally banned to the entire Rakhine state, northern Shan State, Kachin with the exception of the state capital Myitkyina. Some 26 townships in Sagaing region, a township in Magwe, and two in Mandalay have suffered the same bans. As short on resources as the junta is, they still have advantages over the opposition. But saddled with corruption and plummeting morale, will it be enough? Zachary Abuza is a professor at the National War College in Washington and an adjunct at Georgetown University.

Romania Halts Presidential Election Run-Off Amid Russia Meddling ...	By Marian Chiriac In an unprecedent move, Romania’s top court on Friday ordered a re-run of the country’s presidential elections amid alleged manipulation of public opinion by a 'foreign state' in favour of independent, far-right candidate Calin Georgescu – the surprise winner of the first round of the polls last month. The Constitutional Court said it was annulling 'the entire electoral process concerning the election of the president of Romania' so far, as procedures for a free vote were not upheld. The government will set a new date for the elections, and the process will restart from the beginning, the court added. The move comes just two days before the second-round run-off between Georgescu and Elena Lasconi, leader of the centrist, pro-EU Save Romania Union party, was due to be held. Intense speculation had erupted this week followed declassification of documents by Romania’s security agency on Wednesday, which claimed that paid influencers had boosted TikTok accounts promoting Georgescu in the lead-up to the first round of presidential elections on November 24. The documents also revealed compromised login credentials for Romanian election websites and reported over 85,000 cyberattacks during the election. Romania’s intelligence agency stated that the scale, methods and coordination of the campaign strongly suggested involvement by a foreign state. On Thursday, the Prosecutor’s Office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice launched an investigation following indications of potential electoral crimes and money laundering. 'The investigation targeted indications regarding electoral crimes that would have influenced the voting process, through methods such as corrupting voters, including in the online environment, with the aim of determining them to vote for a certain candidate,' said a Prosecutor’s Office press release. Several civil society organisations then submitted notifications to the court requesting the annulment of the results from the first round of the presidential elections. Defying all predictions, populist, NATO-sceptic and Russia-friendly politician Georgescu won the first round – signalling that EU member state Romania had joined the growing trend towards the far-right in the region. He did most of his campaigning on TikTok, and was little covered by the media until his surprise win. Under the Romanian constitution, the president wields considerable power – including oversight of foreign and defence policy and responsibility for appointing the prime minister.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F0L8syqBlwK7	2024-12-07T20:08:28-08:00	
The Enemy Of Our Own: India’s Bangladesh Conundrum – OpEd	Bangladesh was an entity diverted from Pakistan, created by East-Pakistani Bengalis, and supported by India. As the youngest South Asian country, the history of Bangladesh can never erase the contribution of India, despite political variations. The famous 1971 war between India and Pakistan paved the creation of a country with exclusive Bengali-speaking people trying to grab self-determination against an oppressive regime. Since its establishment, India has been supporting indiscriminately, knowing that the boundary and water disputes are yet to be settled. Moreover, the most important concern for India, from the beginning, has been the peaceful existence of the Bangladeshi Hindus, the Indian Hindus partitioned in 1947 and formally settled in Bangladesh. This short article intends to highlight the issues raised recently after the fleeing of Bangladeshi President Shaikh Hasina and subsequent atrocities against Hindus. Following the agony of the common Bangladeshi citizens against the reservation system made by the Hasina government to extend support for the family members of the freedom fighters of Bangladesh, a widespread protest took the major streets of the country, showing dissent against the provision of reservation. Within a week, the protesters started attacking the Hindus, as usually happens in Bangladesh, where a sensitive political issue turns into communal extremism. In particular, many Hindu temples were and have been vandalised by the extremists, burning the assets and deities. In such an anarchical situation, the lives of innocent Hindus seem to be threatened by intolerance, as they are denied their religious practices and social security. Recently, many Hindu monks affiliated with ISKON were taken into custody without any judicious grounds. In the recent past, the newly appointed leader of the interim government of Bangladesh, Mohammad Yunus, urged the people to mitigate the communal violence. In contrast, the violence against Hindus is rising day by day without any urgency from the side of the interim government to produce a security environment for the Hindu minorities. In addition, a petition was filed before the Dhaka High Court challenging the existence of ISKON in Bangladesh as illegal and seeking the direction of the High Court for its complete abolition. Eventually, the court refused to pass a direction for the abolition of the ISKON and restored the minority rights of freedom to practise personal religious faith and protect the institutions. The current scenario suggests the urgency of self-retrospection in Bangladesh and emerging dynamics in India. Bangladesh and its population, except the top leaders, were and have never been so grateful to India, remembering the vitality of India's interference in creating a new state for Bengalis. Unlike Pakistan, Bangladesh dreamt of becoming a secular state with mutual harmony among the communities. Still, in every forum, the Bangladeshi population have a tendency to be pro-Pakistan, i.e. cricket, politics and development. As an elder brother, India has never failed to convince Bangladesh that the Bengali population should refrain from being indulged by anti-India forces. There are many instances of cooperation and confidence-building measures from the Indian side to establish stable and time-tested relations between the countries, ranging from financial aid and infrastructural development to regional balance of power and institutional mechanisms. Moreover, unlike China, which uses Pakistan as a buffer state against India, Bangladesh has been fortunate enough not to perform that function in favour of India. Geopolitically, Bangladesh would not be a buffer state against Pakistan because of its geographical detachment. This geopolitical argument reflects India's intention behind the creation of Bangladesh, which is neither a buffer state nor a trusted friend of India. Despite major disputes, India has been supporting Bangladesh for decades, knowing that the price of friendship is very high. India has also been facing illegal cross-border migration and arms circulation from the Bangladesh border, which imposes internal security threats. After 55 years, Indian policymakers and geopolitical analysts are supposed to interrogate the reality of Indo-Bangladesh relations referencing the present developments. As Dr Jaishankar, India’s external affairs minister, pointed out, the guiding principle of India’s foreign policy has been India’s national interest. Therefore, the question arises: what kind of interest does Bangladesh serve for India? Does India need to follow the principle of non-reciprocity for its neighbours? These questions have to be answered with Indian experiences in the context of Bangladesh. From a geopolitical perspective, Bangladesh serves no significant interest of India; rather, this country has been the second frontier for India to be dealt with. The problem of constant cross-border migration, drug trafficking, and armed movements has been pushing India to arrange the security apparatus, which seems to be a burden for India. On the one hand, India has a life-long belligerent neighbour, Pakistan; on the other, India, by herself, created a neighbour, Bangladesh. Comparatively, Pakistan has been the natural enemy, but Bangladesh has been India’s enemy of her own making. Coming to the second question, the principle of non-reciprocity would serve India's interests when the price of threats is less than the price of security. Afghanistan, for instance, receives non-reciprocal help from India, confirming that it would never hamper India’s security structure. Based on this argument, India's non-reciprocal involvement with Bangladesh would never help India achieve security. India’s Bangladesh has been a frontier of insecurity. By partitioning East Pakistan in 1971, India made its territorial boundary more volatile and fragile. India could have dealt with Pakistan with a single mindset, but today, India has doubled its security architecture to deal with Bangladesh. The identity of Bangladesh, as differentiated from Pakistan, has not only degraded its own existence as an independent state and failed to protect its own citizens but rather made India more insecure. In one way or another, the performance of Bangladesh towards its religious Hindu minorities has been the same as that of Pakistan. India should deal with such issues without lying on the fantasy of morality and ethics but with realism and pragmatism. Moreover, the international community and media should not backstep in criticising the atrocities against the Hindu minorities. This is probably the time for India and its policymakers to investigate India's achievements in creating Bangladesh. The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the Author.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F0FdwgyqTMbo	2024-12-07T20:06:58-08:00	
Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy: A Strategic Framework For Navigat...	We are in a tough world, and we need to be tough in our response. Competition is growing across the globe, and the Arctic is not immune. Many countries, including non-Arctic states, aspire for a greater role in Arctic affairs. The evolving security and political realities in the region mean we need a new approach to advance our national interests and to ensure a stable, prosperous and secure Arctic, especially for the Northerners and the Indigenous Peoples who call Arctic home.' -- Mélanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs In a landmark move, Canada has announced a comprehensive Arctic foreign policy aimed at addressing growing geopolitical challenges in the North. Released on December 6, 2024, by Global Affairs Canada, this policy underscores the importance of domestic and international cooperation to counter emerging foreign threats in the region. With a renewed focus on security, diplomacy, and environmental stewardship, the strategy reflects Canada's evolving role in the Arctic amid shifting global dynamics. The Arctic holds profound significance for Canada's national identity, economic well-being, and security. Encompassing 40% of the country's landmass and over 70% of its coastline, the Canadian Arctic is home to diverse communities, including Indigenous Peoples who have lived there for countless generations. Canada's new Arctic Foreign Policy (AFP) reflects a collaborative and inclusive approach, emphasizing northern Indigenous knowledge and priorities while strengthening Canada's leadership in the region. Dan Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, highlighted the importance of incorporating Indigenous voices, ensuring the policy is shaped by communities with deep-rooted ties to the Arctic. Natan Obed, President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, emphasized the shared goal of securing prosperity for Inuit Nunangat, representing 40% of Canada's land area and all Arctic coastlines, through co-development efforts like those at the Inuit Crown Partnership Committee. Lisa Qiluqqi Koperqualuk, President of Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada, stressed the necessity of removing barriers for Inuit across borders and upholding self-determination. Leaders of Arctic territories also recognized the policy's significance: Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai welcomed its role in fostering strategic collaboration, while Northwest Territories Premier R.J. Simpson linked Arctic sovereignty with investments in infrastructure and climate resilience. Nunavut Premier P.J. Akeeagok highlighted the territory's strategic role in advancing reconciliation, economic development, and sovereignty. Finally, Bill Erasmus, International Chair of the Arctic Athabaskan Council, lauded the policy's recognition of Indigenous autonomy, underscoring the importance of unity in achieving common objectives. Together, these perspectives underline the AFP's ambition to align regional needs with national and global priorities. The Arctic Foreign Policy (AFP) serves as a comprehensive framework for Canada's Arctic engagement, enhancing diplomatic presence and partnerships to meet current needs while remaining adaptable to future challenges. Building on the 2019 Arctic and Northern Policy Framework (ANPF), the AFP focuses on safeguarding sovereignty, advancing national interests, and fostering a stable, secure, and prosperous Arctic aligned with a shared regional vision. Structured around four pillars—asserting sovereignty, advancing pragmatic diplomacy, leading in Arctic governance and multilateral issues, and adopting an inclusive approach—the policy aims to strengthen the Arctic's resilience against emerging threats while prioritizing the needs of territorial governments, provinces, and Indigenous communities. A Changing Arctic Landscape The Arctic, long considered a region of peace and cooperation, is now a focal point for global tension. The policy highlights that the 'North American Arctic is no longer free from tension,' a situation exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This conflict has disrupted the foundations of international Arctic cooperation, bringing heightened attention to the region's strategic importance. Geopolitical instability has introduced new challenges, particularly as nations like Russia and China expand their military and economic interests in the Arctic. Joint military exercises conducted by the two powers in July 2024 demonstrate a growing alliance that underscores the urgency of Canada's response. While the risk of a direct military attack in the North American Arctic remains low, the region has become a critical geographic vector for advanced weapon systems, posing potential threats to North American and transatlantic security. Reviving the Arctic Ambassador Role A cornerstone of the new policy is the reinstatement of Canada's Arctic ambassador, a role eliminated in 2006 under the Harper government. This position will serve as a vital link in fostering international dialogue and advancing Canada's Arctic interests. The ambassador will engage with territorial governments, Indigenous communities, and global partners, ensuring that Canada's Arctic priorities are well-represented on the international stage. Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, expressed satisfaction with the policy, emphasizing that an ambassador can effectively convey Canada's sovereignty and its partnership with Inuit and other Indigenous peoples in the Arctic. The co-development of this position with Indigenous stakeholders marks a significant step toward inclusive governance. The last Arctic ambassador, Jack Anawak, played a crucial role in representing Canada's interests at circumpolar meetings and the Arctic Council. Reflecting on the past, Anawak described the ambassador as pivotal in maintaining positive relations among Arctic states. This renewed role is expected to build on that legacy, adapting to the contemporary challenges of the region. Expanding Diplomatic Presence As part of its Arctic foreign policy, Canada plans to establish new consulates in Nuuk, Greenland, and Anchorage, Alaska. These diplomatic outposts will enhance Canada's ability to engage directly with Arctic partners and strengthen ties with key stakeholders. The policy allocates $34.7 million over five years, with an additional $7 million in ongoing funding to support these initiatives. This funding will primarily cover the ambassador's role and the operation of the consulates, ensuring sustained engagement in the Arctic. Strengthening Indigenous Partnerships Central to Canada's Arctic policy is its commitment to working closely with Indigenous communities. By sharing information on foreign interference threats and involving Indigenous leaders in decision-making processes, the policy ensures a collaborative approach to Arctic governance. Indigenous stewardship is also highlighted in resolving boundary disputes and managing traditional waters. This collaborative approach aligns with Canada's broader goal of asserting sovereignty while respecting Indigenous rights and knowledge systems. Navigating Foreign Threats Canada faces a delicate balancing act in safeguarding its Arctic sovereignty while engaging with global powers. The policy emphasizes a national security lens for evaluating foreign research activities in the Arctic, particularly those with potential dual-use applications, such as China's research initiatives. China's interest in the Arctic, including its 'Polar Silk Road' concept, poses unique challenges. While Beijing frames its activities as scientific, Canada has expressed concerns over the dual-use nature of some projects, which could have both civilian and military implications. The Arctic foreign policy also outlines commitments to work with NATO allies and other like-minded states to counter these threats. Initiating Arctic-specific dialogue within NATO reflects Canada's recognition of the region's growing strategic importance. Climate Change and Security The Arctic is warming at four times the global average, with profound implications for ecosystems, infrastructure, and geopolitical stability. Canada's policy recognizes climate change as a 'threat multiplier,' creating opportunities for foreign adversaries to exploit changing environmental conditions. 'Climate change is increasing access to Arctic resources and shipping lanes, enticing nations to the region and heightening competition. This evolving environment creates new security challenges. Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy responds to these growing challenges with a focus on asserting our sovereignty in the North, while supporting prosperity for those living there. This new policy complements our defence policy, Our North, Strong and Free: A Renewed Vision for Canada's Defence, which will see us expand our presence in the North.' -- Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence Melting ice has opened new shipping routes, including the Northwest Passage, which Canada claims as internal waters. However, this claim is contested by the United States and other nations that view it as an international passageway. Canada maintains a 36-year-old agreement with the U.S. to notify each other of vessel movements through the passage, but rising global interest in Arctic shipping—particularly from China—has added complexity to this issue. The policy commits Canada to resolving boundary disputes through cooperation with Indigenous communities, ensuring that traditional knowledge informs decisions on stewardship and sovereignty. Balancing Sovereignty and Collaboration Canada's Arctic foreign policy reflects a nuanced approach to balancing sovereignty with international collaboration. While it does not propose new defense spending, it seeks to enhance coordination with allies and prioritize Arctic security within existing frameworks. This approach aligns with Canada's broader strategy of leveraging diplomacy and multilateralism to address emerging challenges. By fostering cooperation among Arctic states, Canada aims to preserve the region as a space for peace and sustainable development, even amid mounting geopolitical tensions. Conclusion Canada's Arctic foreign policy marks a pivotal moment in the nation's approach to the North. By reviving the Arctic ambassador role, expanding diplomatic presence, and fostering Indigenous partnerships, the policy lays a foundation for navigating the complex challenges of a changing Arctic. As the region becomes increasingly central to global security and environmental discussions, Canada's emphasis on collaboration and resilience will be crucial. This policy positions Canada to address emerging threats while promoting sustainable stewardship of its Arctic territories.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F395PP9A0Duc	2024-12-07T20:05:33-08:00	
Blind Spots That Prevent Me From Being A Leader – OpEd	Most living beings live in groups, be they carnivores, herbivores, or omnivores. Wolves live and hunt in packs, so do lions, sheep, goats, and even elephants live in herds (Couzin, 2003), and just like animals, Humans too live in groups, forming communities and societies. But unlike animals, humans differ significantly from one another largely on the basis of their personalities. Not all people think alike, and this would often create conflict due to divergent goals, contrasting objectives and methods, and for this reason, for almost every procedure we undertake, we require a leader, someone who makes the final decision, solve conflicts within the group, guide others, and make sure everyone follows the decision made. A leader is necessary for any group to work both effectively and efficiently, as a leader would be the unifying force that would compel the members of the group to work together in harmony towards a common shared goal. To influence others to work towards a common goal through any methods is called leadership (Raymond, 1992). However, even in leadership there is good and bad, as a good leader would see his group excel and grow, whilst the opposite would see the group break apart eventually, and the major difference between good and bad leaders comes from their blindspots, their recognition of these blindspots and their remedies to fix them. The blindspots to leadership can be any behavior (conscious or unconscious) that would damage the effectiveness and hinder the progress and success of their group (Karthikeyan, 2017; Jaworski, 2001). Some of the most common blindspots that seep into the leader’s behavior and make themselves evident are as follows: 1: Arrogance/Overconfidence: Having far too much confidence in your decisions, even when they’re risky or not perfect, is one of the main blind spots to leadership (Goleman, 1998). Too much confidence in your own ability and decision making often results in you brushing off any criticism (even constructive criticism), not listening to feedback, and not taking into account opinions of subordinates to get their perspective or help (Collins, 2021). 2: Micromanagement: Constantly being involved in almost every aspect of work that the subordinates are doing is called micromanagement. This form of constant supervision and interference in the activities of subordinates takes away significant portion of the subordinates freedom, and forces them to stick to rigorous methods that often smother their own abilities in which they excel, forcing them to conform to methods that the leader approves. Not only does micromanagement takes away operational freedom of subordinates, it also creates a lot of stress and tension, which inturn leads to high turnover rate (Collins, 2021; Northouse, 2021). 3: Confirmation Bias: Also known as 'Yesman ship' where the leader only surrounds himself with people who approve and praise his methods and decisions, and as a result, gets rid of all possible criticism and locks himself out of any constructive feedback that he would otherwise receive. This leads to the leader not being able to see any faults and issues in his plans, and becomes blind to all the red flags in his decisions and methods (Bazerman, 2011). 4: Production orientation: Focusing solely on the outcomes and achieving goals whilst completely ignoring employee wellbeing, and prioritizing objectives and deadlines at the expense of the employee’s mental and physical health will lead to employee disillusionment with the job and dissatisfaction, employee burnout, lowered morale and loyalty, and a high turnover rate (Yukl, 2013). 5: Tunnel vision: When you fixate on specific short term goals and objectives whilst avoiding or neglecting broader perspectives and associated risks, you may end up overlooking potential opportunities to capitalize on, or ignore red flags and warning signs, or fail to adapt to changing situations (Bazerman, 2011). 6: Favoritism: As a leader, you could also end up exhibiting favoritism, where you favor one or few employees over specific traits that they may have, such as belonging to the same region as you, having similar background, etc. even if their performance is more or less the same as all the other employees (Fletcher, 1999). This would end up promoting a sense of 'unfairness' as you would favor that employee more than others, and hence offer him more opportunities than others, considering him first for promotion, bonuses, etc. which would result in the rest of the employees growing resentful of both you and the favorite employee (Northouse, 2021; Goleman, 1998). 7: Fear of Delegation: Fear of losing power or control over the subordinates, or simply lack of trust in the subordinate’s capabilities often results in the leader not delegating his responsibilities and power with them, which often overburdens the leaders who end up failing to leverage the strengths of their team, leading to wasting talents and potential of their subordinates and causing frustrations within the group (Northouse, 2021). 8: Concessions: Making too many concessions or compromises with the subordinates simply to keep the peace and avoid conflict could result in undermining authority and position of the leader, as leaders who make too many compromises not only risk losing authority, but also lose the ability to make difficult decisions when necessary (Yukl, 2013). It is important to compromise once in a while to maintain collaboration, but making too many compromises is poison. an mirr9: Absence: The opposite of micromanagement is withdrawing from the activities of the subordinates and the group. Leaders who withdraw and are unavailable both physically and mentally for their team, and avoid taking responsibility during critical moments undermine the team trust, and the group ends up being left to their own devices, which not only disrupts the existing hierarchy, but creates many conflicts and turmoil within the group (Lee et al. 2018).

Syrian Rebels’ Advance Becomes Threat To Assad’s Rule	(EurActiv) -- Syrian rebels said they seized control of the southern city of Daraa on Saturday (7 December), the birthplace of a 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad and the fourth city his forces have lost in a week. Rebel sources said the military agreed to make an orderly withdrawal from Daraa under a deal giving army officials safe passage to the capital Damascus, about 100 km (60 miles) north. Social media videos showed rebels on motorcycles and others mingling with residents on the streets. People fired shots into the air at the city's main square in celebration, according to the videos. There was no immediate comment from the military or Assad's government, and Reuters could not independently verify the rebels' claim. With the fall of Daraa, Assad's forces have surrendered four important centres to the insurgents in a week. Daraa, which had a population of more than 100,000 before the civil war began 13 years ago, holds symbolic importance as the cradle of the uprising. It is the capital of a province of about 1 million people, bordering Jordan. Daraa's seizure followed the rebels' claim late on Friday that they had advanced to the edge of the central city of Homs, a key crossroads between the capital and the Mediterranean coast. Capturing Homs would cut off Damascus from the coastal stronghold of Assad's minority Alawite sect, and from a naval base and air base of his Russian allies there. 'Our forces have liberated the last village on the outskirts of the city of Homs and are now on its walls,' the Syrian faction leading the sweeping assault said on the Telegram messaging app. A coalition of rebel factions that include the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) made a last call on forces loyal to Assad's government in Homs to defect. Ahead of the rebel advance, thousands of people fled Homs towards the coastal regions of Latakia and Tartus, strongholds of the government, residents and witnesses said. Assad regime under threat A US-backed alliance led by Syrian Kurdish fighters captured Deir el-Zor, the government's main foothold in the vast eastern desert, on Friday, three Syrian sources told Reuters. The rebels seized Aleppo and Hama in the northwest and centre earlier in the lightning offensive that began on 27 November. In another ominous sign for Assad in the east, the Syrian Kurdish force said Islamic State - a jihadist group that imposed martial law under its harsh rule before its defeat by a US-led coalition in 2017 - had taken control of some areas in eastern Syria. Aron Lund, a fellow at think-tank Century Foundation, said Assad's government was 'fighting for their lives at this point'. It was possible the government could hold Homs, 'but given the speed at which things have moved so far, I wouldn't count on it', he said on Friday. Syrian state TV reported Russian-Syrian airstrikes targeting rebel headquarters in the countryside of Hama, Idlib and Aleppo killed at least 200 insurgents on Friday, citing the Russian Coordination Centre in Syria. A Syrian army source said Iran-backed Hezbollah forces were positioned to bolster government defences in and near Homs. Syrian state media reported dozens of rebels were killed in the Homs countryside on Friday in an operation by Syrian and Russian air forces, artillery, missiles and armoured vehicles. Capturing Homs would solidify a chain of powerful positions under the Islamic insurgents' control from Aleppo on the Turkish border in the north to Daraa on the Jordanian border to the south. Gaining Homs would also increase the rebels' chances of isolating the seat of Assad's regime in Damascus with the ability to block the route northwest from the capital to the sea. Rebels reenergised As the rebels pressed their offensive, Russia and Jordan on Friday urged their nationals to leave Syria. After years locked behind frozen front lines, rebel forces have burst out of their northwestern Idlib bastion to achieve the swiftest battlefield advance by either side since a street uprising against Assad mushroomed into civil war 13 years ago. Syria's conflict killed more than 305,000 people between 2011 and 2021, the United Nations Human Rights Office said in 2022. Assad regained control of most of Syria after key allies - Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah - came to his rescue. But all have recently been weakened and diverted by other crises, giving Sunni Muslim militants a window to fight back. Tehran, which has been focussed on tensions with arch-foe Israel since the Gaza war began last year, began to evacuate its military officials and personnel from Syria on Friday, a sign of Iran's inability to keep Assad in power, the New York Times reported, citing regional officials and three Iranian officials. The head of the main rebel faction HTS, Abu Mohammed Al-Golani, vowed in a separate interview with the New York Times published on Friday that the insurgents could end Assad's rule. 'This operation broke the enemy,' he said of the rebels’ lightning offensive.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F-JLQaPFxyaH	2024-12-07T20:01:29-08:00	
Syrian Rebels Drive Toward Homs, Damascus As Assad Regime Hangs I...	(RFE/RL) -- Syrian rebels led by Islamist militants were reported to be entering the central city of Homs on December 7 and closing in on Damascus suburbs as the country’s main allies -- Russia and Iran -- scrambled to protect the regime of authoritarian President Bashar al-Assad and their own assets in the country. Experts said the future of the Assad regime was hanging in the balance -- and that, if it fell, it would also represent a major geopolitical setback for the Kremlin which, along with Tehran, has bolstered the Syrian government through many years of civil war. Media reports said many residents of the capital were stocking up on supplies as thousands were attempting to leave the country through the border with Lebanon -- itself a war-torn nation in the increasingly chaotic Middle East. As fighting on the ground and rebel gains intensified, the foreign ministers of Russia, Iran, and Turkey held emergency talks in Doha, Qatar, on December 7 calling for an end to hostilities in the most serious challenge to Assad’s rule in years. The U.S. State Department told RFE/RL in a statement that 'we are closely monitoring the situation on the ground' in Syria. A spokesperson said that 'the United States, together with its partners and allies, urges protection of civilians including members of minority groups.' 'The time is now for negotiating an end to the Syrian conflict consistent with principals established in UN Security Council Resolution 2254. Constant refusal by the Assad regime to engage in this process led directly to the events we are now witnessing, ' the spokesperson added. The U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that 'Assad regime forces have collapsed and Assad’s backers do not appear willing to bolster the Syrian Arab Army by rapidly deploying additional forces.' Russia has multiple military sites in Syria, including an air base at Hmeimim and strategic naval facilities at Tartus, which are also used to support the Kremlin’s actions in Africa. The ISW said that Moscow had not yet begun to evacuate the base, 'but it remains unclear whether Russia will keep its vessels at the port as Syrian rebels continue to advance swiftly across regime-held territory.' The American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats blog said the Assad regime 'faces an existential threat given the widespread collapse of regime forces and lack of sufficient external backing to bolster these forces.' It added that 'Russia will face logistic challenges that will undermine its Africa operations if it loses its footprint in Syria,' Critical Threats wrote. Mark Katz, a professor emeritus at George Mason University who focuses on Russia and the Middle East, told RFE/RL that the Kremlin risks losing their air assets in Syria if it can’t agree with Turkey on the use of its airspace. 'In one sense, the Turkish government might be happy to grant permission as the more the Russian Air Force is out of Syria, the happier Ankara will be,' he said. 'Russia would also face difficulties relocating its warships because they would need Turkey's permission to get into the Black Sea. They would have to go through NATO waters,' he added. Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said the United States 'should have nothing to do' with the war in Syria, where a small contingent of U.S. forces remain deployed in some areas. 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,' he wrote on this Truth Social platform. 'THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' Fast-moving developments on the ground were difficult to confirm, but media outlets quoted witnesses as well as rebel and Syrian Army sources as saying militant fighters were continuing to make large gains on December 7 in their effort to topple Assad. Some reported signs of nervousness in Damascus, with shortages of critical supplies, although the government said Assad was at work as usual in the capital. Government forces and their Russian allies continued efforts to halt the continued rebel push toward Homs, which stands at an important intersection between the capital, Damascus, and Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus. Homs is 140 kilometers from the capital. Russia was reported to have intensified air strikes around Homs in an apparent attempt to stop the rebel advance, the Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya reported. The Syrian army was also reported to be sending reinforcements to Homs, according to Arabiya and Al-Jazeera. Witnesses and army sources told Reuters that some rebels had entered Homs as government forces dug in to defend the city of 775,000 people, although reports were impossible to confirm. Homs Province is Syria’s largest in size and borders Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan. The city is also home to one of Syria’s two state-run oil refineries. The AFP news agency quoted security sources as saying hundreds of Syrian government troops, some injured, had crossed the border into Iraq. The surprising rebel offensive was launched last week by a coalition of rebel groups lead by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) faction, which is considered a terrorist group by the United States, Britain, Canada, and the European Union. Besides HTS, the fighters include forces of an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Turkey has denied backing the offensive, though experts say insurgents would not have launched it without the country's consent. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said civilians were fleeing from Homs toward the Mediterranean coastal regions of Latakia and Tartus, strongholds of the government and the site of the Russian air and naval bases. Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declined to comment on the fate of the Russian bases, saying he 'wasn’t in the business of guessing.' The United Nations said on December 6 that almost 300,000 people in Syria had already been displaced since late November by the fighting, and that up to 1.5 million could be forced to flee as the rebels advance and inflict losses on Assad, as well as his allies in Russia and Iran. Assad has relied on Iran and Russia to remain in power since the conflict erupted in 2011. Following the meeting in Doha, Lavrov said -- referring to HTS rebels -- that it was 'inadmissible to allow terrorist groups' to take control of Syrian territory and that Russia would oppose them with all means possible. Since the rebels' seized control of Aleppo a week ago, they have moved on to capture other major cities with Assad’s forces providing little resistance.Besides capturing Aleppo in the north, Hama in the center, and Deir al-Zor in the east, rebels rose up in southern Suweida and Deraa, saying on December 6 they had taken control of the two cities and posting videos showing insurgent celebrations there. Taking Deraa and Suweida in the south could allow a concerted assault on the capital, Damascus, the seat of Assad's power, military sources said. Video posted online showed protesters in the Damascus suburb of Jaramana chanting and tearing down a statue of Assad’s father, Hafez al-Assad, who ruled Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000, when his son took power. HTS’s leader, Abu Mohammad al-Golani, told CNN in an exclusive interview on December 5 from Syria that Assad’s government was bound to fall, propped up only by Russia and Iran. 'The seeds of the regime’s defeat have always been within it,' he said. 'But the truth remains, this regime is dead.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32Fz2NcPWUnK_W	2024-12-07T20:00:17-08:00

Trade Corridor Wars: Escalating Competition Between China, Russia...	By Antonia Colibasanu (FPRI) -- Contemporary conflicts are increasingly orchestrated across multiple nations and domains, manifesting in many ways, from conventional ground engagements to strategic influence operations. The informal coalition of China, Iran, Russia, and most recently North Korea (CIRN) represents a counter-influence regional network, challenging the geopolitical and economic sway of the United States and the broader West. While North Korea has joined Russian forces in Ukraine and is mostly visible for its political and military posturings, China, Iran and Russia are closely working together on building a new trade and investment platform to support their political agenda. Although we are not yet living a full-scale global war, a global economic confrontation is underway, which could be a prelude to overt military hostilities. This paradigm shift arguably began in 2022, when Russia blocked Ukraine’s access to Black Sea trade routes, obstructing its critical export channels to the global market, a move that was met with Western sanctions. Over the past two years, the CIRN coalition (also referred to as CRINK, to include the full acronym for North Korea) has grown increasingly prominent, while trade and investment corridors have been strategically realigned by both Western and anti-Western blocs: reflecting a recalibration of global economic dependencies and a restructuring of the world’s economy. I prefer the acronym CIRN to describe the informal alliance among China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as it captures the partnership’s essential dynamics. North Korea’s involvement in support of Russia’s actions in Ukraine likely depended on China’s tacit approval—if nothing else, its troops would have relied on Chinese transport routes to reach Russia. Thus, this partnership is best understood as a China-Iran-Russia network, a strategic yet informal partnership focused on advancing each country’s interests while steadily countering Western influence, particularly across Eurasia. This informal coalition became especially evident in 2022 when Russia initiated the global economic confrontation by disrupting established trade routes. Since then, CIRN has actively explored alternative pathways for influence and trade, leveraging its position to challenge the West’s diminishing dominance on the global stage. The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have had two major consequences. The first is the increased strain and detrimental impact on marine transportation and logistics. Not only has the cost of international shipping and insurance risen, causing inflationary pressures, but there is also a potential that conflict would threaten the open and free sea lines, generating challenges and modifications to UN regulations. The second main impact of the two interconnected conflicts, considering their effects on the global economy, is the redefining of land trade routes since freight flows over old Eurasian routes have decreased dramatically since 2022. The Northern Corridor, or New Eurasian Land Bridge, has long functioned as the principal freight artery connecting Asia and Europe. This transcontinental railway system stretches from China through Kazakhstan, Russia, and Belarus, offering a cohesive infrastructure due to a unified track gauge and regulatory alignment under the auspices of the Organization for Cooperation of Railways. These harmonized technical standards and coordinated governance mechanisms have historically reinforced the corridor’s strategic dominance in Eurasian trade flows. But the Ukraine war resulted in sanctions and uncertainty, and transportation along the route decreased. In 2023, westbound shipping volumes along this route decreased by 51 percent compared to the previous year and eastbound volumes to China were 44 percent below 2022 levels. As a result, both the Southern Corridor (which begins in China, crosses Central Asia, Iran, and Turkey to reach the Mediterranean and Europe) and the Middle Corridor (which starts in China, crosses Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and the Black Sea) have emerged as critical trade routes between Europe and China, reshaping the global dynamics of transport and trade. While China has reallocated much of its commercial traffic, Russia has, since 2022, accelerated its investment into operationalizing the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), linking the Northern ports of Russia to the ports of Iran through the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. The INSTC is also a shorter and more cost-effective alternative to traditional routes like the Suez Canal. When considering the geography of these corridors, various observations may be made. First, Turkey seems to be a common denominator for the Middle Corridor and the Southern Corridor. Second, while one of the variants of the Middle Corridor does not include Turkey, instead relying on an open and free Black Sea, both the Middle and Southern Corridor are part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Third, Iran is at the crossroads of the Southern Corridor and the INSTC. Furthermore, given the rising coordination between CIRN’s members, Tehran sees a chance to collaborate with both Russia and China in constructing the North-South Corridor and expanding its participation in what China refers to as the Silk Belt and Road Initiative. After all, Iran has been looking to establish parallel trade networks and systems for years before 2022 because of its own economic problems coming from being sanctioned by the United States and some other Western states due to its nuclear program. In the summer of 2024, Moscow and Tehran were set to invest about $25 billion into developing internal waterways and railways to link Saint Petersburg to the ports of Chabahar and Bandar Abbas. Also this summer, Iran inaugurated its first freight train to China, as part of what it referred to as the China-Iran-Europe rail corridor. On its way to China, the Iranian train will pass via Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, being part of the Southern Corridor project. In this sense, Iran becomes a natural link in the CIRN informal alliance, providing a logistical foundation for informal coordination and allowing the counter-influence regional network to more effectively push back against the West. While this may be seen as a Russian reaction to Western sanctions and a means for China to continue cooperating with Russia for economic reasons, their investment in new trade and investment corridors has a long-term strategic goal. Making these pathways operational and successful means not only (literally) creating new methods to collaborate, but also making their own decoupling from the West simpler and, in the process, laying the groundwork for more formal multidimensional collaboration, which will encourage more actors to join them. The development of new trade corridors can be seen as a strategic step in advancing a broader global movement to counterbalance Western dominance. These discussions revolve around debates calling for non-alignment, a greater role for south-south cooperation and BRICS. Although BRICS has yet to deliver significant economic results, it has functioned effectively as a political magnet, attracting countries eager to explore potential economic benefits beyond the group’s political summits. Turkey, notably, has shown interest in joining BRICS since 2018, in a move that was meant to showcase the country’s growing regional power along with its multidimensional foreign policy approach. Most recently, in September 2024, reports emerged that Turkey had formally applied to join BRICS, with Russian officials confirming the application. However, Turkish officials have been ambiguous, stating that the process is ongoing without confirming a formal application, and as of November 2024, Turkey’s membership status remains uncertain, with no official confirmation of acceptance into the BRICS group. Turkey’s non-alignment with the West in sanctioning Russia and its posturing in the Black Sea as a key negotiator between Russia and the West on Ukraine has challenged its alliance with the West, even if it is a NATO member. At the same time, Turkey and China have grown closer as bilateral commerce and investment have developed and high-level visits have become more frequent in recent years. Moreover, the Chinese consortium comprising COSCO Pacific, China Merchants Holdings International, and CIC Capital acquired a 65 percent stake in Kumport in 2015, marking the most important Chinese investment in a Turkish Black Sea port—back then part of the Belt and Road Initiative and now effectively part of the Middle Corridor. Turkey’s strategic balancing act between Russia, China, and the West, along with its position along vital East-West trade routes, has significant implications for alternative corridors. Turkey’s role could strengthen these routes’ capacity to facilitate non-Western trade flows, aligning with CIRN’s broader objectives. Given its complex relationship with the United States, Turkey has long leveraged its ties with Russia—and now its expanding relationship with China—to bolster its strategic influence with Washington. Observing the US pivot away from Eurasia and the Middle East, which Ankara interprets as a weakening American presence in the region, Turkey sees the opportunity to use its ties with China and Russia not only for economic interests but also to ensure it remains aligned with the region’s strongest emerging powers. Turkey is not alone in the Black Sea region in welcoming Chinese investments aimed at enhancing trade corridors. In recent years, China has deepened its economic footprint in Georgia, prioritizing infrastructure and strategic projects with significant regional implications. In May 2024, a Chinese-led consortium secured the contract to develop the Anaklia deep-sea port on Georgia’s Black Sea coast: a project poised to bolster Georgia’s role in the Middle Corridor and China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Alongside this, Chinese firms have undertaken major infrastructure projects, such as constructing the Kvesheti-Kobi tunnel, the largest in Georgia, which further integrates the country into China’s growing trans-Eurasian trade network. These ventures underscore China’s strategic interest in positioning Georgia as a critical transit hub, in line with its broader goals of strengthening connectivity and influence across Eurasia. China’s strategy to expand its presence along Eurasian trade corridors hinges not only on constructing these routes but also on ensuring they are competitive and attractive to transporters. Assessing the competitiveness of these corridors—essential for understanding which routes are most viable for Asia-Europe transit—a July 2024 study evaluated various corridors based on current operational characteristics. The findings revealed that the Traditional Maritime Corridor leads in performance with a competitiveness index of 0.7203 (on a scale from 0 to 1). Following this are the Trans-Siberian Corridor at 0.4056, and then the Middle and Southern Corridors, with similar performance indices of 0.2864 and 0.2662, respectively. To counter China and the CIRN informal alliance in their bid to expand influence across Eurasia—and potentially reshape global trade dynamics through corridors like the North-South route, which Russia is developing and which links the East-West networks to global maritime pathways—the West must actively work to bolster its presence along these strategic routes. Achieving this would require not only increasing Western investments in these transit corridors, but also strategically prioritizing routes less vulnerable to CIRN influence. Investing in these corridors offers a strong return, not only because there is a clear business rationale for alternatives to the Northern Corridor—which is likely to remain under-utilized, given that even after the Ukraine war ends, Russia’s reintegration into European trade will face substantial challenges—but also because such investments enable the West to maintain influence in the rapidly evolving infrastructure landscape, ensuring a balanced role in shaping global economic and trade routes. From a geostrategic standpoint, China’s central role in all trade routes connecting Asia makes disrupting CIRN dependent on Western investment in alternative corridors that bypass Iran and limit reliance on Turkey. Turkey’s approach, balancing alliances and prioritizing immediate gains, has led it to align more closely with China and, at times, accommodate Russia, adding a layer of uncertainty. While Europe may tolerate this ambiguity, given its lower exposure to the impacts of a functional CIRN alliance on open global trade routes, the United States cannot afford such leniency. The United States relies on the smooth functioning of global maritime routes, which is one of its key geopolitical imperatives. Therefore, the United States needs to be aware and mitigate against any shift CIRN might introduce to current trade norms. The intersection between Russia’s North-South Corridor and the Middle and Southern Corridors, where China is expanding influence, poses a challenge not only for Eurasia but for the entire international trade system. Given China and Russia’s stated long-term goals to reduce Western influence in global markets, the design of these corridors highlights their intent to establish a foundation toward that objective. Though not intended for the short or medium term, should these new corridors establish rules that undermine the existing norms of open, free navigation—currently upheld by Western standards—the impact would reverberate across global trade. It is therefore likely that the West—both Europe and the United States—will explore ways to counter the influence projected by the CIRN alliance in Eurasia, including close examination of the development of current trade corridors. The Middle Corridor has two variants: one that reaches Europe via Turkey and the Mediterranean, and another that connects to Europe through the Black Sea, accessing Romanian and Bulgarian ports. Alongside the Southern Corridor, these routes can be grouped as Middle Corridor A and Middle Corridor B, with a comparison highlighting the regions and countries they traverse. This analysis shows that the most favorable East-West corridor for the West, in terms of control and minimal complications, is Middle Corridor B. This route stretches from China through Central Asia and the Caucasus, then across the Black Sea directly into Europe, offering a reliable pathway with reduced geopolitical risks. The trade corridor variant that bypasses both Iran and Turkey goes through the Black Sea, an area currently at risk of escalating conflict. Russia’s strategic aim to control Ukraine’s southern coast, underscored by increasing attacks on the port of Odesa in recent months, heightens the security concerns surrounding this route. While currently the Middle Corridor is slightly more competitive than the Southern Corridor considering the current operational status of multi-modal infrastructure, sustained Western support for investment could make it more feasible. At the same time, it may be that, through the process, and as the war in Ukraine ends in a favorable way to the West, the Black Sea is getting back to an open and free sea, considering the interest of allowing for trade passage. Western efforts to develop the Middle Corridor and promote an 'open Central Asia' that welcomes investment beyond Chinese and Russian influence are already showing results. The EU-Central Asia Strategy and US involvement in regional connectivity projects have contributed to Kazakhstan’s decision not to join BRICS in 2024, instead encouraging it to focus on its economic growth. Instead, the West’s emphasis on regional cooperation without explicit bloc politics aligns well with Kazakhstan’s independent foreign policy stance. Kazakhstan has expressed interest in the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, which funds infrastructure projects, reflecting its openness to Western-backed development. The development of Middle Corridor B—the route that reaches Europe via the Black Sea—could play a pivotal role in keeping the South Caucasus open to Western-backed growth, even amid its engagement with Russia and China. This potential rests on two factors. First, as long as Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan, remains receptive to collaborating with the West on infrastructure projects, the South Caucasus stands to benefit from this openness. Second, the expansion of Middle Corridor B aligns with the Western 'containment line' that spans from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and the Adriatic. This initiative, also known as the Three Seas Initiative, aims to enhance infrastructure for both economic and military purposes and has become increasingly important since the war in Ukraine has started. This strategic focus has already spurred substantial investment in key port facilities like Gdansk and Constanta, along with the development of a railway connection between them. Looking ahead, these efforts may also support transforming the Danube into a commercial corridor with dual-use potential for military logistics. Simultaneously, the Via Carpathia, a transnational highway network linking the Baltic Sea to the Aegean and Black Seas to strengthen north-south transport and regional trade, remains a high priority for the Three Seas Initiative. While many projects receive EU funding, they also attract significant private investment, sustaining the idea that return on investment is higher than most other classic infrastructure projects. The success of this vision rests on the West’s, particularly the US ability to grasp the challenge posed by the informal CIRN alliance of China, Iran, Russia, and the support from North Korea, and on its commitment to formulating effective counterstrategies. At its core, much will depend on whether the Black Sea remains an open and accessible maritime area. If the conflict in Ukraine escalates in the coming months and Russia secures more of Ukraine’s coastline, the Black Sea could take on a new strategic character, quite different from a scenario where Russia is forced to withdraw, allowing Ukraine to reclaim its exclusive economic zone there. In the first case, the CIRN alliance would gain not only territory but also a stronger influence over the definition of 'free and open' trade corridors—an outcome with potential repercussions for maritime trade not only in the region but worldwide.

Impediments In Global Quantum Technology Collaboration – Analysis	By Prateek Tripathi The quest to develop quantum technology (QT) has been picking up steam across the world. Given its cost-intensive and specialised nature, international collaboration has been and will continue to be a key factor in QT’s evolution. However, cooperation in the field has been limited by a variety of causes—export controls, intellectual property (IP) protection and supply chain constraints are the chief factors. Export controls Export control restrictions present a significant challenge to global collaboration and the seamless exchange of knowledge in QT, particularly those pertaining to the transfer of technology and hardware components. Nations around the world including the United States (US), China, the United Kingdom (UK), and multiple European Union (EU) member-states like France, Spain and the Netherlands have enacted export control regulations on QT. The primary reason for this stems from the potential military application of quantum communication and quantum sensors, which subjects exports to heightened government scrutiny and regulation. Quantum computing (QC) also raises security concerns because a large-scale quantum computer is capable of breaking current encryption protocols. China’s growing prowess in QT is also an added concern, particularly for the US, which has already been a victim of multiple Chinese cyber espionage operations. The prospect of China possessing a quantum computer is, therefore, a serious security concern for the US. In September 2024, the US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issued an interim final rule, expanding export control on emerging technologies such as QC, advanced semiconductor manufacturing, Gate All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAAFET) and additive manufacturing. With QC, the rule imposes export controls on quantum computers possessing 34 or more physical qubits at a specified error rate, which 'represents a high level of technological sophistication warranting national security, regional stability, and anti-terrorism controls.' Additionally, while deemed exports and reexports are mostly exempt from these controls, some restrictions do still apply. The UK, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Canada have also enacted almost identical export control regulations. Due to the military applications of quantum sensing, such as a quantum sensing-based Global Positioning System (GPS), the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) also presents a similar barrier for cross-border investments and collaboration, particularly with regard to technology transfer. While certain restrictions on the export of QT are certainly warranted from a security point-of-view, the export regulations enacted by most countries on QT thus far seem to be quite arbitrary. For instance, though large-scale quantum computers are certainly capable of breaking current encryption protocols, they require millions if not billions of physical qubits, which will likely take more than a decade to achieve. Thus, it is quite unclear why restrictions are currently being imposed on them. Intellectual property protection IP protection has also been a major hurdle in QT collaboration. This is displayed prominently in the US, where most developments in QT have been led by the private sector, which is particularly wary of IP protection. The situation has been exacerbated by certain Chinese initiatives like its 'Thousand Talents Plan,' wherein scientists from around the world were offered hefty salary hikes to entice them to bring their research to China. This led to scientists illicitly providing China with technology and research findings, leading to the US accusing the country of IP theft. The multifaceted and diverse nature of QT poses a challenge. Different technologies like QC, quantum communication, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum sensing require distinct IP provisions, thereby making harmonisation between them a problem. Coordinating IP rights across different nations is also a complex task due to variation in national laws and practices. Supply chain constraints Developing and manufacturing QT hardware often requires rare and exotic raw materials which are limited in supply. These include critical minerals like semiconductors and rare earth metals—silicon, germanium, cobalt, lithium and indium. This presents severe supply chain constraints since these minerals are found only in select locations around the world. Furthermore, China processes around 80 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. Each kind of QT also requires its own niche materials. For instance, quantum communication requires high-quality periodically poled nonlinear crystals such as KTP and LiNbO3, which are only produced in technologically advanced nations like China. It also requires components likesuperconducting nanowire single-photon detectors which are produced only in a handful of countries like Germany, Japan, the US and Russia. Superconducting qubit-based quantum computers similarly require certain specialised components which are only produced and assembled at specific locations. Quantum sensors employ the use of integrated photonics which utilise materials like nonlinear crystals and novel material wafers, which are, likewise, only produced by limited countries. Efforts to overcome challenges in QT collaboration Though the preceding issues do present a major obstacle to progress in QT, multiple initiatives have been undertaken to meet the challenge. The Quad has been successful in establishing a precedent in international collaboration on QT through initiatives such as the establishment of the Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group (2021), the Quad Investors Network (QUIN) (2023) and the Quantum Center of Excellence in Quantum Information Sciences (2023). Organisations such as the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C) in the US and the Quantum Ecosystems Technology Council of India (QETCI) are working actively to enhance international collaboration in QT. The US CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and the European Chips Act of 2023 have been implemented to strengthen semiconductor supply chains, which are also a critical element in the development of QT. The US-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) serves as a shining example of technology collaboration on multiple fronts including the setting up of semiconductor fabrication plants and extensive cooperation in QT. The future of QT collaboration QT lies at the intersection of vastly different disciplines like quantum theory, condensed matter physics and computer science engineering. This makes it particularly difficult to encourage and train talent in the field. Moreover, QT necessitates heavy investment due to the novel and niche nature of the technology it requires. Simultaneously, QT also presents a plethora of opportunities for the future of humanity, from enhancements in medicine, healthcare and agriculture, right up to unravelling the very fabric of the universe through simulations in quantum physics and chemistry. Therefore, the quest to develop QT is unanimously significant, regardless of national borders. However, due to the aforementioned impediments, it will be impractical for any country to pursue QT in isolation, making international collaboration an essential element to its development and propagation. This requires some changes in existing protocols and regulations. Harmonisation between export control regulations and IP laws across different nations will be key in this regard. Encouraging initiatives like the United States–India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) and the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act will also be essential in strengthening supply chains. Organisations like the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C) and the Quantum Ecosystems Technology Council of India (QETCI) will continue to be important in coordinating efforts across multiple nations. The establishment of similar entities would be extremely useful in diminishing some of the barriers. Encouraging joint research and development (R&D) and publications across multiple nations through initiatives like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), a grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the US initiated in 2007, would also be fruitful towards furthering collaboration. With the rapid progress in QT, this serves as a critical moment in time for its development. As technology evolves, so must the international norms and agreements regulating it. Though there have been attempts to reduce impediments in collaboration, they are by no means sufficient. Further effort in this direction will ensure that QT continues to grow at a desirable pace, thereby cementing its place as a valuable tool for humanity’s progress and well-being.

An Accidentalist’s Guide To Denying The Obvious – OpEd	There’s a peculiar comfort in believing that things simply happen by accident. That the powerful don’t conspire, that institutions don’t coordinate, that the crumbling pillars of society represent mere happenstance rather than design. I’ve come to call these people 'accidentalists' – those who find refuge in randomness, who dismiss patterns as paranoia. The Cost of Seeing Like the red pill in The Matrix, recognizing patterns changes everything. Many choose comfortable illusions over uncomfortable truths. As Hannah Arendt observed, 'The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction no longer exists.' For the professional class – academics, journalists, corporate managers – acknowledging these patterns means confronting their own complicity. Their success, their status, their sense of self – all are built on supporting rather than questioning power structures. The accidentalist mindset offers refuge from this self-examination. Better to dismiss than face one’s role in the machinery. The Death of Coincidence It requires impressive mental gymnastics to believe that those with power – who achieved it through careful planning and coordination – suddenly stop planning and coordinating once they obtain it. That they abandon the very tools that brought them success. That they become, somehow, passive observers of their own decline. When confronted with evidence of coordination – be it documented government censorship, institutional narrative control, or coordinated media campaigns – the accidentalist draws an arbitrary line. 'Well, that’s different,' they say. 'That’s not a conspiracy, that’s just…' And here they trail off, unable to articulate why some coordinated actions by the powerful count as conspiracies while others are merely business as usual. The Weaponization of Skepticism and Manufacturing Outcasts The term 'conspiracy theory' itself reveals institutional manipulation. The CIA’s 1967 dispatch (Document 1035-960) explicitly directed media assets to use this label to discredit Warren Commission critics. They transformed skepticism into pathology – making the very act of questioning power seem delusional. This weaponization of language worked brilliantly. Today, pattern recognition itself becomes suspect. In 2022, the New York Times published perhaps the most revealing example of instituem, make examples of them. The accidentalist never asks why questioning power triggers such coordinated attacks. Today’s Denials, Tomorrow’s Headlines Consider a revealing moment: In 2021, several of my friends eagerly recommended Dopesick, ('I think you would especially like this'), condemning the Sacklers’ manipulation of medicine for profit. Yet these same friends mocked me for questioning pharmaceutical companies today – despite their status as the most heavily criminally fined industry in human history. Those who recognized similar patterns were labeled ‘anti-vaxxers’ and ‘threats to public health.’ Scientists suggesting lab origins became ‘conspiracy theorists.’ The pattern repeats: identify skeptics, discredit them, make examples of them. Let’s examine three cases where 'conspiracy theories' transformed into acknowledged history: The Sugar Deception: In the 1960s, the sugar industry paid Harvard scientists to blame heart disease on fat instead of sugar. These industry-funded studies shaped dietary guidelines for decades, creating a massive public health crisis through 'low-fat' but sugar-laden foods. The accidentalist views this as an isolated historical incident rather than a template for corporate manipulation of science. The Tobacco Playbook: For decades, tobacco companies buried evidence linking smoking to cancer while funding research to create doubt. Their infamous internal memo stated, 'Doubt is our product.' The accidentalist sees this as a unique case rather than recognizing the same tactics in current corporate practices. The Vioxx Cover-up: Merck concealed evidence that their blockbuster drug caused heart attacks, leading to an estimated 60,000 deaths. Internal documents revealed executives strategizing to 'neutralize' critics. The accidentalist treats this as an aberration rather than standard operating procedure. The Pattern Repeats Consider the timing: A 342-page Patriot Act appeared weeks after 9/11. Operation Lock Step described pandemic measures in 2010. Event 201 simulated responses in October 2019 – the same day as the Wuhan Military Games. Months later, these exact measures were implemented globally. What are the odds? The patterns of control repeat at every scale: Globally: WHO/WEF coordination Nationally: Regulatory capture Corporate: Internal suppression of dissent Local: Community pressure to conform Power’s fingerprints are everywhere. Once you see them, they can’t be unseen. The Corporate Convergence Here’s where the accidentalist worldview truly fails: These weren’t separate conspiracies but a single system perfecting its methods. The tobacco giants that knowingly addicted millions didn’t disappear – they bought food companies (RJR Nabisco) and continued manipulating public health. Those same food conglomerates now merge with pharmaceutical corporations (Monsanto/Bayer), putting the same scientists who engineered addictive cigarettes and processed foods in charge of our medicine. These corporations don’t just share ownership – they share methods. The same tactics used to addict smokers were applied to processed foods. The same research manipulation that hid tobacco dangers now obscures pharmaceutical risks. The same media control that sold cigarettes as healthy now promotes untested medical interventions. The Reality Merchants Consider the current media response to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s nomination as HHS Secretary. The coordinated messaging is impossible to miss – talking heads across networks uniformly label him a 'conspiracy theorist' and 'danger to public health,' never addressing his actual positions. These are the same voices that championed destructive pandemic policies, now attempting to discredit someone who questioned their wisdom. Or examine Dr. Jay Bhattacharya – a Stanford professor whose expertise was unquestioned until he challenged lockdown policies. Despite eventual vindication, the institutional response was swift: coordinated media attacks, academic ostracism, and algorithmic suppression. The pattern is clear: expertise is respected only when it aligns with institutional interests. Engineering Compliance The template begins with manufactured scarcity and enforced dependency. But understanding the mechanics of fiat systems is just the beginning. The real revelation is recognizing how this architecture extends beyond money into every domain of human existence. Covid-19 didn’t create new systems of control – it revealed existing ones. The infrastructure for rights suspension, narrative enforcement, and dissent silencing was already in place. The 'Great Reset' wasn’t conceived in 2020. The surveillance architecture wasn’t built overnight. The ability to coordinate global policy, control information flow, and reshape human behavior wasn’t developed in response to a crisis – it was waiting for one. Moreover, the selective enforcement of truth reveals power’s preferences. Regardless of what one thinks about Alex Jones’ Sandy Hook statements, his $900 million fine stands in stark contrast to the total impunity enjoyed by the New York Times and other media outlets whose WMD lies led to hundreds of thousands of deaths. This reveals how power protects its own while punishing outsiders, even when institutional lies cause far greater harm. The Psychology of Disbelief 'That can’t be true' becomes the mind’s defense mechanism against pattern recognition. This isn’t natural skepticism – it’s programmed rejection (as detailed in 'How the Information Factory Evolved'). The larger the pattern, the stronger the denial. They’ve weaponized skepticism against itself, creating a population that reflexively defends authority while attacking any challenge to it. We’re watching the early stages of converging control systems, with clear signs of what’s coming: Digital IDs linked to health records CBDCs enabling programmable money Social credit systems disguised as ESG metrics Surveillance capitalism merging with state control Artificial scarcity through controlled supply chains These aren’t predictions – they’re systems actively being built and tested across the globe, from China’s social credit system to Nigeria’s CBDC rollout. Understanding the Impossible 'But how could they pull this off without anyone knowing?' the accidentalist asks. The answer is simple: compartmentalization. Like the Manhattan Project, most people in global institutions are unaware of the larger plan they’re working on. Even in tech companies, the Gmail team has no idea what YouTube’s content moderators or Google Earth’s mapping division are doing. Each department serves its function without seeing the whole. Professionals across academia, corporate America, and media unknowingly serve a broader agenda, often believing they’re working for noble causes. The truth isn’t hidden – it’s protected by its own audacity. As Marshall McLuhan observed, 'Only the small secrets need to be protected. The large ones are kept secret by public incredulity.' This explains why major revelations often hide in plain sight: the scale of coordinated deception exceeds what most people can psychologically accept as possible. Breaking the Spell The ultimate revelation isn’t how powerful they are – it’s how fragile their control really is. Their greatest strength – total integration – is also their greatest weakness. Complex systems have more failure points. The more systems are interconnected, the more a disruption in one area can cascade through the whole. The solution isn’t fighting their systems directly – it’s building parallel structures that make them irrelevant: Local food systems over global supply chains Peer-to-peer networks over controlled platforms Direct exchange over surveillance currency Natural immunity over subscription immunity Real communities over virtual spaces The Choice The question isn’t whether power conspires – it’s why we’re so resistant to seeing it. What comfort do we find in believing in accidents? What fear do we harbor of seeing design? Perhaps it’s simpler to believe in chaos than to confront order. Perhaps it’s easier to dismiss than to engage. Perhaps the accidentalist position isn’t about truth at all – it’s about maintaining the comfort of ignorance in a world that increasingly demands awareness. Because once you see the pattern, you can’t unsee it. Once you understand that power coordinates, plans, and conspires by its very nature, the only wacky conspiracy theory becomes believing it doesn’t. The awakening isn’t something that happens to us – it’s something we choose. And that choice, multiplied across millions of individuals, will determine whether humanity enters a new dark age or experiences its greatest renaissance. The question isn’t whether you see it. The question is: what will you do once you can’t unsee it?

Don’t Trust The Cabinet, Trust The Market – OpEd	To the surprise of many, Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election handedly. Even more are surprised by his rapid—and sometimes head-scratching—nominations ahead of taking office again. So far, he has appointed TV personality and physician Dr. Mehmet Oz to be the Center for Medicare and Medicate Services administrator, business woman and former professional wrestler Linda McMahon as secretary of the Department of Education, previous Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee as U.S. ambassador to Israel, and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Arguably, his most controversial nomination was selecting the controversial lawyer and politician Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (commonly shortened to RFK) to become the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Our next president has placed lofty expectations and given considerable authority to tackle pressing U.S. public health concerns. As RFK remarked, President Trump has given me three instructions…He wants the corruption and the conflicts out of the regulatory agencies. He wants to return the agencies to the gold standard, empirically-based, evidence-based, science and medicine that they were once famous for. And he wants to end the chronic disease epidemic with measurable impacts on a diminishment of chronic disease within two years. As part of this effort, President-elect Trump also nominated Johns Hopkins Professor Dr. Martin Makary to be FDA commissioner. In his new role, Dr. Markay will work closely with RFK and, 'properly evaluate harmful chemicals poisoning, the country’s food supply and drugs [and] to finally address the Childhood Chronic Disease Epidemic.' Are these gentlemen up for these daunting and complicated tasks? Unlikely. Under the previous Trump Administration, then President-Trump appointed the similarly controversial Dr. Scott Gottlieb to become FDA Commissioner. His tenure was short, and is mostly remembered for beginning the FDA’s 'war on vaping.' Years later, countless efforts to crackdown on vaping producers and granting the agency newfound powers to curb teen vaping have been a spectacular failure. After resigning, Dr. Gottlieb began working on the advisory board for Pfizer, embodying the 'revolving door' corruption Trump’s second administration hopes to eliminate. Can we expect Dr. Makary to be any more successful in addressing childhood chronic disease? President-elect Trump had similar issues with appointing HHS secretaries during his first term. He first picked Congressman and physician Dr. Thomas Price, who resigned less than a year after his nomination due to financial scandals. His second pick, Dr. Alex Azar, was in a constant feud with the President. Both publicly criticized each other, with Dr. Azar coming very close to losing his jobduring the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dishearteningly, both nominations were seen as reformers, hired to tackle pressing and longstanding problems within the U.S. healthcare industry. These missteps aside, there were several impressive and telling healthcare reforms made during the first Trump Administration. In 2018, national right-to-try legislation provided patients with terminal illnesses a way to bypass the FDA’s approval process to receive experimental treatment. Several states have since enacted an expanded version to help patients in dire medical circumstances. Emergency-use-authorizations were tremendously successful in providing quick and reliable treatment and testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The overlapping approvalphases used during Operation Warp Speed to bring a COVID-19 vaccine to market proved it is possible to produce pioneering medicine quickly. The vital lesson here is that these successes were provided by markets, not government appointees. In each case, significant deregulation resulted in greater patient access. In many cases, these reforms saved, improved, and prolonged lives. What else could you ask for? Donald Trump will be President again soon, and the shock and novelty of who he nominates for his cabinet will wear off. When it does, let’s hope they remember their greatest chance of success is to empower the market, not themselves.

Self-Described ‘Austrian’ Is New Leader Of UK Conservative Party:...	By George Pickering Following their overwhelming defeat in the July 2024 general election, Britain’s Conservative Party recently elected Kemi Badenoch as its newest leader, meaning that she would become Prime Minister if the Conservatives win the next general election. It would be an exaggeration to describe Badenoch as a completely unknown political figure, but as a relatively early-career politician—she is 44 years old, was first elected to Parliament in 2017, and has never held any of the Great Offices of State—thus, she will be unfamiliar to most people who don’t follow British politics closely. However, advocates of sound economics may have been hopeful to hear that she once described herself as an adherent of the 'Austrian school' of economics, and lists Thomas Sowell amongst her personal heroes. Admittedly, such lip service to free market ideas was once commonplace as an empty gesture from mediocre, center-right American politicians, but given the seeming decline of interest in liberty amongst right-wingers over the past decade, especially in the UK, Badenoch’s comments still stand out. So who is Kemi Badenoch, how deep does her interest in 'Austrian' economics go, and how hopeful should advocates of free markets feel about her assumption of the leadership of the Conservative Party? Olukemi Olufunto 'Kemi' Adegoke was born in south London in January 1980 to Nigerian parents who had traveled to the UK for her birth, which gave her birthright citizenship under the laws of the time. She was raised mostly in Nigeria, where she described herself as having had a 'middle class' upbringing, although some have argued that her family were part of 'the elite strata of Nigerian society': her father was a doctor who ran his own hospital, and her mother was a professor at the University of Lagos. She moved to the UK for the first time at the age of 16, and describes herself as a first-generation immigrant, despite having been born in Britain. She became interested in politics at university, where she felt an instinctive opposition to the 'stupid Lefty white kids' she encountered there, and joined the Conservative Party in 2005 in reaction to the third consecutive general election victory of Tony Blair’s Labour Party. At around the same time, she began to develop an interest in free market economists including Thomas Sowell, whom she has repeatedly quoted and cited as one of her personal heroes, and the Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek. As she later recalled in a 2017 interview: So the bit of me, the amateur economist who was just getting going, reading Road to Serfdom and stuff, that’s what I was doing when I was 25, 26, 27. And that was what was laying the foundation in its own way. So I’m very much probably an Austrian school supply-sider, free-marketeer, more than anything. Between 2005 and 2015, she became gradually more involved with Conservative politics, running unsuccessfully for Parliament in 2010, and for the London Assembly in 2012, while working in the financial sector. Interestingly, during her 2010 campaign she was asked, 'What was the last issue that made you shout at the TV?', to which she surprised the interviewer by answering, 'I hate identity politics'; this was long before that issue was catapulted into the mainstream of political discourse by the rise of 2010s pop feminism, Black Lives Matter, and the 2016 US Presidential election, and before the term 'woke' or even the antediluvian 'social justice warrior' entered common use. In 2012 she married banker and Conservative councilor Hamish Badenoch and, by mid-decade, her political career had begun to take off: she became a member of the London Assembly in 2015, and became digital director of the prominent center-right magazine The Spectator in the same year. She apparently failed to make a good impression on her colleagues during this period, who described her as 'rude,' 'inefficient,' 'aloof,' 'lacking in substance' politically, and more focused on moving up in her political career than on fulfilling the duties of those jobs. When she was finally elected to Parliament as Conservative MP for Saffron Walden in the 2017 general election, she occupied a number of minor government posts before putting herself forward in the July-September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election (the first of two such elections that year). She finished fourth in a field of eleven candidates, placing higher than a number of more prominent and experienced party figures. She was then appointed Secretary of State for International Trade in September 2022, Minister for Women and Equalities in October 2022, and Secretary of State for Business and Trade from February 2023. Given the expectation that MPs and especially members of the government vote with the party line, her voting record offers few insights into her own political or economic beliefs. She has voted against the majority of her own party only three times, including one occasion when she opposed making permanent certain temporary covid measures which had permitted women to self-administer early medical abortion pills at home without first having visited a doctor, despite the fact that Badenoch describes herself as 'very, very pro-choice.' Her tenures in the aforementioned government positions also provide few hints as to any economic principles she may have. Most notably, she angered members of her own party by altering a law which had promised to automatically repeal every EU law which had been retained after Brexit unless the government was able to review at least 4,000 such laws by the end of 2023. Badenoch lowered this threshold to 600 pieces of legislation to be reviewed, justifying this decision by saying, 'It is not the bonfire of regulations—we are not arsonists. I’m certainly not an arsonist. I’m a Conservative.' Aside from this, and a minor scandal in which she was accused of trying to improve the appearance of government finances before the 2024 election by delaying compensation payments to postal workers who had been wrongly accused of stealing due to an IT error, her time in government was largely unremarkable. Between her unsuccessful 2022 leadership bid and her recent ascent to the top of the electorally-humbled Conservative party, most news articles about her focused on her status as a rising star in on the British right, her prickly personality and public disputes with various figures within and outside her party, and her outspoken anti-woke stances on various culture war issues. Indeed, it seems probable that her admiration for Thomas Sowell could stem just as much from his trenchant opposition to affirmative action and other aspects of left-wing race ideology as from any of his economic views. However, even the anti-woke posture, which figured so heavily in Badenoch’s leadership campaign, only appears to go so deep: she recently criticized Prime Minister Kier Starmer for trying to 'mansplain' to her. Although Badenoch has frequently cited Sowell as one of her influences, she does not appear to have publicly commented on his views any more deeply than simply expressing her liking for his most famous book, Basic Economics, and quoting a number of his broad epigrams ('there are no solutions, only trade-offs,' 'if you want to help people, tell them the truth,' etc.) Likewise, it’s hard to find any examples of Badenoch having commented on Hayek other than her acknowledgement that she has read his most famous book, The Road to Serfdom. Non-British readers who might be tempted to be impressed by Badenoch’s acknowledgement of Hayek should remember that Margaret Thatcher’s well-known admiration of Hayek elevated him to the status of 'the one free market economist everybody has heard of' in Britain, in a similar way to how Milton Friedman’s frequent television appearances and association with the Reagan administration afforded him a quasi-celebrity status in the US. While Badenoch’s acknowledgement of free market economists is certainly welcome—and sets her apart from the majority of pragmatic, non-ideological Conservative MPs—it still falls far short of the deep appreciation of Austrian economics evinced by prior British political figures, notably Steve Baker, who sadly lost his seat in Parliament in the 2024 general election, and whose personal website contains recommendations and detailed reviews of economic and political works by the likes of Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, Jésus Huerta de Soto, Roger Garrison, and many others. Indeed, it is difficult to shake the sense that Badenoch’s name-drops of Hayek, Sowell, and others exhibit a shallow 'Conservatism 101' quality which combined with her anti-woke stances to increase her appeal in the recent leadership election, which commentators widely expected to favor a candidate on the right of the party. Alongside Hayek and Sowell, Badenoch has also drawn attention to her admiration of Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and the philosopher Roger Scruton; all decidedly-safe choices unlikely to ruffle any center-right feathers. In this regard, it is difficult to disagree with an insightful recent article for The New Statesman by William Atkinson, appropriately entitled 'Kemi Badenoch is no philosopher-queen.' Atkinson argues that Badenoch’s 'Conservative Book Club' recommendations—and the older generation of Tory grandees who giddily took these as evidence that she is the next Thatcher—are unlikely to impress a younger generation of British right-wingers deeply frustrated by the lack of gains made after 14 years of centrist Conservative government. For these young conservatives who grew up in the information age and had already absorbed the ideas of Hayek and Sowell through books, podcasts, and YouTube videos in their teens, the shallow repetition of center-right truisms by Badenoch and her ilk seems hopelessly naive and insufficient in the face of the crises currently facing Britain and many other 'Western' mixed economy states. It might be tempting to see Badenoch’s acknowledgement of Hayek as a small victory for those who care about free markets—better than nothing—even if we acknowledge the seeming shallowness of her understanding and her apparent lack of difference in action from other contemporary British Conservatives. But if advocates of Austrian economics allow our ideas to continue being associated with the same moderate, center-right politicians who have consistently failed to increase the liberty and prosperity of their subjects, we should not be surprised when the younger generation begins to see free market ideas as just so many impotent, out-of-touch platitudes, nor when they begin to place their hopes in thinkers decidedly less liberal than Hayek.

Japan’s Economic Security Measures Are Immense But Ineffective – ...	By Ayaka Hiraki On 19 August 2024, major Japanese retailer Seven & i Holdings announced that it had received a buyout proposal from Alimentation Couche-Tard, a leading Canadian retail chain. If approved, this acquisition would create the largest convenience store operator in the world. Then in September 2024, Japan’s Ministry of Finance declared that Seven & i Holdings operates in a ‘core sector’ under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act. This designation requires foreign acquirers to submit prior notification for any acquisition and undergo a national security screening to identify risks and vulnerabilities, which could result in the termination of the deal or further requirements posed toward the foreign investor. While these regulatory measures may complicate acquisitions, they also highlight Japan’s growing focus on economic security and the evolution of its regulatory framework. Japan’s foreign investment regulations have undergone significant changes. Under the revised Act, implemented in May 2020, foreign investors acquiring over one per cent of the shares in listed companies in designated sectors must submit prior notification and undergo the screening process. In December 2022, as part of the Economic Security Promotion Act, Japan introduced the concept of ‘critical products’, which are seen as essential for public welfare and the domestic economy, such as machine tools, industrial robots and semiconductors. Industries related to these products are subject to investment screening. These developments show that the government has expanded its conceptualisation of the economic security challenges related to incoming foreign direct investment. While previously it focused on direct risks, such as the erosion of defence industrial bases or military applications of technology, it has begun to include indirect risks, such as data leaks and economic vulnerabilities, in its screening process. But while the targets of inward direct investment screening have expanded to include a diverse array of firms, such as retailers and technology companies, the methods of investment screening have not been modernised to suit the new reality. Japan’s approach emphasises strict entry regulations through prior notification requirements. These case-by-case reviews often introduce uncertainties for foreign investors, potentially discouraging direct investments that are aimed at global expansion through the Japanese market. At the same time, Japan’s efforts to monitor the evolving risks of foreign ownership are very limited once investments are completed. For example, when Tencent, a major Chinese technology company, invested in Rakuten, a Japanese e-commerce and financial platform, the Japanese government imposed conditions to prevent Tencent from accessing confidential data. While Japan, in coordination with the United States, monitored this investment due to concerns over potential data leaks to China, the effectiveness of this monitoring and its ability to prevent unauthorised data access remain unclear. A further challenge arises from the fact that in complex shareholding structures, a privately-owned company headquartered in a jurisdiction that is not a noted economic security risk to Japan may be influenced through ownership stakes. These could be held by sovereign wealth funds and strategic partnerships with third country State Owned Enterprises, or have significant business interests in jurisdictions where such risks may be present. Future changes in ownership and exposure to third party influence may alter the economic security implications of foreign acquisitions deemed acceptable at the time of their completion. This highlights the need for robust post-transaction risk management. Both the United States and the European Union have adopted measures to enhance the effectiveness of investment regulations. In the United States, authorities have the power to mandate divestitures if national security risks are identified post-investment. Similarly, the European Union introduced foreign subsidy regulations in 2023, requiring transparency in subsidies and funding sources for transactions involving state-owned enterprises to ensure fairness and competitive integrity. These measures aim to address economic and security concerns and protect domestic markets more effectively by balancing pre- and post-transaction security considerations. But Japan’s implementation of screening and its monitoring activities have often been limited to ad hoc responses. While all of these screening approaches present significant hurdles and unpredictability to foreign investors, Japan’s current system is less effective in facing the changing nature of economic security challenges. Japan would benefit from improving the effectiveness and transparency of its investment regulations. Clearer screening criteria, along with more accessible guidance and examples, may comfort foreign investors. There would also be benefits to revisiting post-transaction monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. A ‘narrow scope, high walls’ approach could be effective. This strategy would focus on military–civilian dual-use technologies and competitive sectors critical to Japan’s economic growth, ensuring stringent monitoring of these areas while encouraging investment in less critical sectors. In addition to robust entry screening, continuous monitoring could deter investments with improper motives and enable timely interventions when necessary. Such measures would minimise economic security risks while fostering a healthy investment environment that supports Japan’s global competitiveness.

Erdogan’s Idlib Shock Shadows ‘Kursk’ – OpEd	‘Doomsters’ is an occasional Russian expression used to categorise commentators that only see the ‘dark side to events’ (a vice quite prevalent during the Soviet era). Marat Khairullin, a highly respected Russian military analyst, says, 'Today, a network of mercenary war bloggers has begun another round of moaning – this time about Syria, where apparently everything is lost for Russia'. 'Many see the events in Syria (and some add Georgia to the mix) as attempts to open additional fronts against our country. Perhaps that’s true. But in that case, it’s more appropriate to draw direct parallels with the reckless attack on Kursk, which left the Ukrainian armed forces in an almost hopeless position'. Khairullin views the activation of this jihadist insurgency in Syria as a similarly ‘desperate’ act. The background is that the Syria-Russia-Iran coalition had – thorough the Astana negotiations – 'cornered the remaining Syrian terrorists into a 6,000 sq. km enclave. Without delving into the details, it was a process reminiscent of the [Ukrainian] Minsk Agreements—both sides were utterly exhausted and thus agreed to a ceasefire. Importantly, all sides understood this was only a temporary truce; the contradictions were so profound that no one expected the conflict to end'. Aleppo fell quickly these past days, as 'one division of the Syrian National Army outright defected to the Islamists (read: Americans)'. The defection was a set up. Northern Aleppo was occupied by the Syrian National Army, fully controlled, armed and funded by Turkey, which dominates northern Aleppo. The key, Khairullin says, is this crucial point: The land is flat criss-crossed by few roads: ' … whomsoever controls the airspace controls the country. Last year, Russia formed a new aerial unit called the Special Air Corps, reportedly tailored for overseas operations. It consists of four aviation regiments, including a regiment of Su-35s. Currently, just two Su-35s are overseeing the entirety of Syria’s territory. Imagine the impact when 24 such aircraft are deployed. And Russia is fully capable of such a deployment'. The second crucial point is that 'Iran and Russia have drawn closer. At the start of the Syrian war, relations between the two were decidedly ‘neutral-hostile’. By late 2024 however, we now see a very strong alliance. Israel and the U.S., by violating the peace agreements through this Turkish insurrection, have provoked a renewed Iranian presence in Syria: Iran has begun to expand beyond its bases, redeploying additional forces into the country. This gives Assad and his allies a direct pretext to expel the American and Turkish proxies from Aleppo and Idlib. This isn’t speculation — it’s straightforward arithmetic'. Syria, however, is a key component to the Israeli-American plan to remake the Middle East. Syria is both the supply-line for Hizbullah, as well as a hub of resistance to Israel’s 'Greater Israel Project'. Now that the permanent ‘Anglo’ Security State unreservedly is backing Israel’s ambition to assert regional hegemony, the West has okayed Erdogan’s jihadist insurrection against President Assad. The aim is to split Iran from its allies, weaken Assad and to prepare for the putative Iran overthrow. Reportedly, the Turkish initiative was hurriedly brought forward, to fit with Israel’s ceasefire plan. Khairullin’s point is that this Syria ‘ploy’ is akin to Ukraine’s 'reckless attack on Kursk', which diverted Ukrainian élite forces from the beleaguered Contact Line, and then marooned these forces in an almost hopeless position in Kursk. Instead of weakening Moscow (as intended), ‘Kursk’ inverted NATO’s original objective – by becoming opportunity to eradicate a major portion of Ukraine’s élite forces. In Idlib, the Islamists (HTS), writes Khairullin, 'had gained dominance – imposing a strict Wahhabi regime and infiltrating the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. Both groups are patchwork organizations, with various factions fighting over money, border crossings, drugs, and smuggling. Essentially, it’s a cauldron—not very combat-effective but highly greedy'. 'Our Aerospace Forces obliterated all command centres (bunkers) of Tahrir al-Sham …and there is a strong likelihood that the entire leadership of the group has been decapitated', notes Khairullin. The Syrian Army’s main forces are advancing toward Aleppo; meanwhile, the Russian Air Force is bombing relentlessly; its Navy held a large drill off the Syria cost on 3 December with test launches of hypersonic and Kalibr cruise missiles; and Wagner and the Iraqi Hash’ad forces (Iraqi PM forces that are now part of the Iraqi army) are grouping on the ground in support of the Syrian Army. Israeli Intelligence Chief’s lately have begun to scent problems with this ‘clever initiative’ that dovetails so exactly with Israel’s pause in the Lebanon fighting; With the supply route from Syria cut, Israel then – in theory – would be in a position to commence ‘Part Two’ of its attempted onslaught on Hizbullah. But wait … Israeli Channel 12 reports the possibility that events in Syria are creating threats against Israel 'where Israel would be required to act'. Shades of ‘Kursk’ – rather than Hizbullah being weakened, Israel adds to its military commitments? Erdogan too, may have wrong-footed himself with this gamble. He has infuriated Moscow and Tehran, and is being flailed at home for siding with the U.S. and America against the Palestinians. Further, he has drawn no Arab support (apart from a Qatari studied ambivalence). Yes, Erdogan has cards to play in the relationship with Putin (control of naval access to the Black Sea, tourism and energy), but Russia is an ascendant great power and can afford to play some hardball in negotiations with a weakened Erdogan. Iran also has cards to play: ‘You, Erdogan, equipped the jihadists with Ukrainian drones; We can deliver the same to the Kurdish Workers Party’. In the background is the bellicose language emerging from Team Trump, some of whom take harshly aggressive and hardline positions. These Israel-Firster and hawkish appointees by Trump likely emit their bluster as much to project an image of Trumpist strength to the American public, as to project a substantive project. Trump is known for waving a big stick – and when he has played that tune for a little while, he slips in from behind, to complete a deal. So we have had (from Trump): 'If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East'. In the ‘Middle East’? To whom exactly is this addressed? And what does it suggest? (No mention of the thousands of Palestinian detainees and prisoners held by Israel)? Sounds more like Trump has sipped at the Israeli Kool-Aid: ‘All problems derive from Iran’; Israel is the innocent adrift a sea of regional malignity. Trump’s disciples believe Trump will impose his will to achieve ‘quiet’ in the Middle East – and impose on Putin an end to the Ukraine War. They are convinced Trump can ‘cut a deal’ in the form of an offer to Putin that he cannot refuse. (For, ‘the current ‘owners of the world’ are never going to let China/Russia just waltz in, form BRICS and assume the position of World Hegemon’). It is a return to the old formula of Zbig Brzezenski: Promise Putin normalisation with U.S. (and Europe) and full sanctions relief, and pull Russia back into the western sphere – severed from a besieged China and Iran (with BRICS scattered to the wind under threat of sanctions). It fails, however, to take account of how much the world has transitioned in the intervening years since ‘Trump One’. Bluster simply doesn’t carry the effect it used to: America isn’t what it was; nor is it obeyed as it once was. Does Trump understand this accelerating global metamorphosis (as Will Schryver puts it), that 'the only deal to be made with Russia is that of agreeing to the terms Russia dictates': 'That’s what happens in the real world when you win a big war. And make no mistake, in this war, the Ukrainians have been slaughtered, the U.S./NATO has been humiliated, and the Russians are emerging from it indisputably triumphant, and more powerful on the world stage than they have been since the peak of Soviet strength decades ago'. In other words, ‘big stick; quick deal’ may not answer to the new world of today. Putin, in response to a questioner at Astana on 29 November, repeated an earlier warning: 'Let me underscore the key point: the essence of our proposal [on Ukraine, given at the Russian Foreign Ministry] is not a temporary truce or ceasefire, as the West might prefer – to allow the Kiev regime to recover, rearm, and prepare for a new offensive. I repeat: we are not discussing freezing the conflict, but its definitive resolution'. What Putin is saying – very politely – to the West is that: You still ‘don’t get it’. To seek a deal on Ukraine is to treat the symptom and to ignore a cure. The West has its policy back-to-front, in other words. Putin is clear: A definitive solution would be to delineate the frontier between Atlanticist security ‘interest’ and the security interests of the ‘World Island’ (in Mackinder’s terminology): i.e. to settle the security architecture between the ‘Heartland and the Rim-land’. Once that is done, Ukraine falls naturally into its place. It’s at the end of the agenda, not first. One highly-regarded foreign policy sage, Professor Sergei Karaganov, explains (original only in Russian): 'Our [Russian] goal is to facilitate the U.S.’s incipient retreat, as peaceably as possible, from the position of global hegemon (which it can no longer afford) to the position of a normal great power. And to expel Europe from being any international actor. Let it stew in its own juices …The conclusion is obvious. We must end the current phase of direct military conflict with the West, but not the broader confrontation with it. Trump will offer to ease pressure on Russia (which he cannot guarantee) in exchange for Russia refraining from a close alliance with China. The Trump administration will propose a deal, alternating threats with promises … but the U.S. already understands that it cannot win. America will remain an unreliable partner for the foreseeable future. Fundamental normalization of our relations with the U.S. should not be expected in the coming decade. Trump’s hands are tied by the Russophobia fanned by liberals for years. The inertia of the Cold War is still quite strong, and so are anti-Russian feelings among most Trumpists'. 'The foremost goal of the current war should be the decisive defeat in Ukraine of Europe’s rising revanchism. This is a war to ward off World War III and to prevent the restoration of the Western yoke. The initial negotiating position is obvious, it has been stated and should not be changed: NATO’s return to its 1997 borders. Beyond that, various options are possible. Naturally, Trump will try to up the ante. So, we should act pre-emptively', Professor Karaganov advises. Recall too, that Trump is, at heart, a sworn disciple of the cult of American primacy; American greatness. 'He will act accordingly … The Russians will dictate the terms of surrender in this [Ukraine] war because their strength affords them that privilege, and there is nothing the U.S. and its impotent European vassals can do to alter that reality. That said, a decisive strategic defeat is going to be a very bitter pill to swallow for this second Trump administration. Hopefully they won’t opt to set the world on fire in a fit of humiliated madness'.

How Republics Succeed, Falter, And Fail – OpEd	The United States today faces inherent challenges that have weakened the republic, making lessons from the Roman Republic even more necessary to avoid greater political instability. The U.S. enjoys many strengths that give it an edge over other republics, such as a decentralized and innovative economy that draws global talent and unmatched military strength. Yet the Roman Republic, which had its own comparative advantages, ultimately fell to autocratic rule, and the U.S. faces a similar fate if it fails to protect institutional integrity and unchecked power continues to grow. Reform is crucial to the continuity of republican governance, yet history shows it is often compromised by entrenched power. Political dysfunction and the growing influence of corporate interests threaten to undermine the foundational principles of the U.S., posing a risk to its long-term stability. From its inception, the United States has struggled to address its internal contradictions in ensuring fair treatment for its inhabitants. Autocratic tendencies also emerged early, with second President John Adams's Alien and Sedition Acts targeting political dissent, immigrants, and free speech. Abraham Lincoln later expanded executive power during the Civil War, bypassing Congress to preserve the Union and abolish slavery, the most contentious and significant political question since the country's founding. Despite such departures from Constitutional procedure—sometimes for good reasons—the system's checks and balances ultimately resisted later executive overreach, like FDR's failed Court-Packing plan. Individual political challenges to republican systems are concerning, but the erosion of republican culture also leads to irreversible shifts in the political framework. Political bribery, unchecked imperialism, and government serving corporate interests over citizens combine to steadily capture the system. A select group of actors has crafted a continuous, increasingly scripted cultural-political spectacle, contributing to civic decline. As a result, the public has reduced active participation in governance in exchange for the passive right to cheer or criticize from the sidelines. The fall of the Roman Republic, which endured for centuries before giving way to tyrants and emperors, offers useful context—lessons on not only what values to uphold but also on how reform attempts can backfire. Half-hearted efforts to fix inequality and instability often strained the system, pushing it closer to dysfunction and leading it to autocracy. Understanding Republican Rome's successes and failures offers lessons for addressing today's challenges. A balanced republican political system encourages elites to compromise, build consensus, and compete for public approval, qualities the early Roman Republic struggled to develop after its establishment in 509 BC. The Senate, dominated by the patrician aristocracy, functioned as an advisory body in theory, but in practice, it exercised significant control over finances, foreign policy, and much of the legislative process. Nonetheless, there was strong competition among patrician families for the two annual consulship positions. These roles, filled through the cursus honorum (course of honor), ensured that two capable leaders rose to the position in an established hierarchy, and shared short-term executive authority, limiting any concentration of power. Consuls often entered the Senate or assumed other political positions after their terms, where they could be prosecuted for misconduct. This rotation and accountability meant leaders' interests lay in the smooth running of the state, rather than amassing personal prestige for their role or for past glories. The design of Roman statues also supported this culture, celebrating the civic virtue of individuals over personal achievements. Statues portrayed aging and imperfections, in deliberate contrast to the idealized perfection of Greek art. The Republic also barred actors from government, viewing their imitation of life as deceptive and unworthy of public office. Like other effective republican city-states, Republican Rome thrived on political engagement, though participation was uneven. The Republic'sseasonal political process, shaped by agricultural cycles, military campaigns, and religious festivals, advantaged wealthy landowners who could afford to leave their estates for politics, perpetuating uneven and inconsistent efforts to address problems. Political advancement in turn often hinged on military successes, making military campaigns common and sometimes pursued for personal ambition rather than strategic necessity. Yet this seasonal structure still created predictable opportunities for many citizens to travel to Rome to participate in political affairs, ensuring concentrated and focused decision-making during key periods. It also provided ways to reduce the power imbalance between the patricians and plebeians, or commoners. The Conflict of the Orders (5th to 3rd centuries BC) brought about significant gains for plebeians. Mass strikes disrupted Rome's economy and soldiers refused to fight, forcing reforms such as the creation of another legislative assembly, the Concilium Plebis, alongside theComita Tributa. Additionally, after 451 BC, legal safeguards via the Twelve Tables and the establishment of the Tribunes of the Plebs—two annually elected magistrates with executive power to protect plebeian interests—were also won. During the 4th century BC, plebeians gained greater social mobility, including the right to intermarry with patricians, opening access to the consulship, Senate, and positions of religious authority. After 338 BC, the Latin Rights extended certain privileges to non-Roman communities in Italy, such as intermarriage and participation in commerce. While full citizenship came gradually, these measures integrated new populations while preserving the identity of Roman citizens. Despite the Republic's growing wealth and territories, inequality remained rife. Plebeians were the backbone of the army and bore the brunt of imperial expansion but reaped few rewards. Longer military service in support of campaigns left them unable to tend to their farms, indebting many. Patricians often capitalized on this by purchasing their lands, while the use of enslaved labor from conquests diminished plebeians' bargaining power as essential workers. Many moved to Rome, swelling the urban poor. Earlier republics, including Rome, had periodically erased debts and eased slavery to reset economic balances, but such measures waned in the Late Republic. Expansion also strained governance, as new territories were home to communities who had fewer rights than Roman citizens and paid heavily in taxes, further exposing the Republic's systemic inequities. Policies aimed at addressing inequality often ended up exacerbating it. The Lex Claudia (218 BC), for instance, barred senators and their sons from owning large commercial ships to prevent them from dominating Rome's expanding maritime trade. But this mostly benefited wealthy plebeians and other elites who could afford their own fleets, widening economic disparities. Richer plebeians also disproportionately benefited from privileges like access to higher office, enabling only some to join the senatorial elite. Meanwhile, the equestrian order emerged as a distinct wealthy class rooted in Rome's cavalry. Though largely lacking formal political power, members enjoyed elevated benefits and economic strength that deepened Rome's social stratification. Many new elites became populist reformers, or populares ('for the people') who were opposed to the senatorial elite, known as optimates ('best men'). Distinctions between the two groups were not always strict—the popularesincluded both new aristocratic elites and sidelined senatorial factions seeking to reclaim influence lost to dominant optimates. The motivations of populares-aligned politicians ranged from genuine reform to self-serving opportunism, and they used plebeian support to shift the power dynamic in their favor. Alliances were fluid, showing how Roman politics often prioritized status and influence over rigid ideology. Elite infighting further motivated the plebeians to demand greater equality by leveraging their numbers and citizenship powers. Political gridlock became more frequent, and violence escalated. Prominent pro-plebeian leaders like Tiberius Gracchus (133 BC), Gaius Gracchus (121 BC), and Publius Clodius Pulcher (52 BC) were assassinated, alongside many of their supporters. In this way, Roman politics devolved into a zero-sum struggle where the defeated often faced death. The use of violence and intimidation to damage plebeian interests, coupled with ongoing inequality, made them more inclined to break with political customs and precedents when it suited their cause. Power was increasingly extended in executive positions, with populares-aligned Gaius Marius holding seven consulships, and citizen soldiers showing increasing loyalty to individual commanders rather than the state. Marius's eventual defeat by patrician-allied Lucius Cornelius Sulla led to a dramatic overcorrection. During his dictatorship (82–79 BC), Sulla's constitution aimed to curb instability by empowering the old aristocracy and Senate, severely weakening the tribunes, and restricting the powers of citizenship. The emboldened aristocracy did little to address underlying economic inequality. Ambitious figures like Pompey, through military power, and Marcus Licinius Crassus, through immense wealth, exploited these tensions to consolidate power and play kingmaker. Sulla's reforms ultimately collapsed under Julius Caesar, whose plebeian-friendly policies bypassed the Senate by leveraging popular assemblies, exposing the new fragility of Rome's legal system. The growing glorification of individual leaders reached a turning point when Caesar became the first living Roman to appear on a coin, a stark departure from tradition. After being declared dictator for life, his assassination by senators angered the public and triggered a power struggle and civil war. This ultimately led to the rise of Caesar's adopted heir, Octavian, who centralized authority in 27 BC and later became known as Augustus. A facade of republican governance was maintained, but many Romans, associating it with chaos and instability, willingly traded their political rights to escape oligarchic rule, violence, and uncertainty. When rumors spread of Octavian relinquishing his special powers, public sentiment opposed the idea. With the establishment of the Roman Empire, an urban proletariat dependent on state-sponsored food distribution and entertained by spectacles like gladiator games became increasingly pacified under the strategy of 'bread and circuses,' solidifying the new order. A reshuffling of the nobility, suppression of opposition, and unchecked territorial expansion fueled instability in Republican Rome. However, persistent inequality remained the Republic's core weakness for its 500-year existence, coupled with flawed attempts to address it. These pose lessons for the U.S. today. Inequality remains a core challenge in the U.S. Once marked by strong social mobility, at least for white residents, ithas declined since the 1940s, initially due to the end of the post-war boom but now reflecting deeper systemic flaws. Compared to the EU, U.S. social welfare lags, while policies like corporate bailouts underscore how citizens bear the debt burden while large corporations profit from government intervention and lucrative contracts. A culture of consumerism encourages U.S. citizens to take on debt, mirroring the problems of the Roman Republic, instead of building a more efficient economic system. Though there are notable similarities between Republican Rome's challenges and those faced by the U.S., the latter faces its own unique set of issues. In Rome, the wealthy were directly involved in political life, using their influence to shape decisions. In contrast, U.S. elites exert control through representatives, who, while not typically from the uppermost of the wealthy social classes, are incentivized to serve their interests. This indirect control reduces the accountability of the elite, as their influence is masked by the modern U.S. political structure and hidden from public view. Though corrupt or inefficient politicians can be removed or prosecuted, those truly pulling the strings remain largely untouched, allowing the pay-to-play political system to continue unabated. Rome's political processes grew opaque and less respected, a trend increasingly seen in contested U.S. elections in recent decades. While skepticism arose among Democrats after George W. Bush's controversial victory in 2000 and Trump's 2016 win, these doubts remained within institutional boundaries. However, election denial escalated dramatically with Trump's response to Joe Biden's 2020 victory, and the ensuing 2021 insurrection marked a major challenge to the peaceful transfer of power and trust in electoral integrity. Restoring trust in the process requires clear rules on voting, role assignment, and transparency in procedures. Laws crafted through open processes rather than private deals are crucial, allowing citizens to view the electoral process and governance as fair, smooth, and rooted in mutual understanding. However, the dangers of unrelenting public political engagement have become more pronounced. Modern technology enables 24/7 politicization, and constant campaigning distracts from governance and risks citizen burnout. Public apathy allows organized elites to dominate politics, and,according to legal scholar Ganesh Sitaraman, expanding the electorate can even amplify factional power since only well-resourced groups can effectively mobilize and strategize. The U.S. judiciary remains distinct in its reliance on common law, a system shared by a few English-speaking countries, allowing adaptability through evolving precedents as new cases are brought forward. The use of juries places foundational responsibility on citizens' moral and legal judgment, ensuring public participation. However, this system is increasingly vulnerable to politicization, as judicial appointments and voting processes for judges and other judicial/law enforcement positions risk undermining impartiality and fairness. The Founding Fathers meanwhile opposed political parties, fearing factionalism would fracture national unity. Today, the two major parties and their supporters increasingly treat politics as a sports rivalry, prioritizing spectacle over policy debate. Both parties leverage entertainment for engagement—Ronald Reagan became the first actor-president in 1981, followed by entertainer Trump in 2017, while Democrats have consistently relied on the power of celebrity to attract voters. This reliance on high-profile public figures allows citizens to disengage, as these amplified individuals are granted tacit approval to shape policy—even when they lack the expertise to do so—reducing the public's role in democratic governance to passive spectatorship. Violent rhetoric undermines the culture of compromise essential to republics. While Trump is commonly associated with this trend in the U.S. (and remains its most persistent voice), Democrats have also contributed. Political violence, once largely directed at major figures in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s,now increasingly threatens local officials as well. Comments about the existential danger posed by political opponents have been consistently undercut by post-election embraces. President Obamawelcomed Trump to the White House after the latter's election victory in 2016, just as Biden did in 2024, while Trump also softened his tone toward them after victories. These radical shifts in messaging reveal the performative nature of politicians' language and weaken the credibility of political discourse. A healthy republic resorts to war as a last option, relying on public support and deliberation. Yet although Congress holds the constitutional authority to declare war, it has not done so since 1941. Instead, executive war powers have expanded through the abuse of emergency provisions, sidelining public influence in decisions of war and peace. Numerous presidents have labeled major recent wars like Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan as mistakes, eroding trust in leadership to responsibly conduct war. The Trump administration now faces the challenge of addressing immigration and undocumented populations. Past policies like Reagan's Amnesty Bill and Obama's executive action for so-called Dreamers caused friction and had far-reaching political consequences. Immigration was a central issue in the 2024 election, with Trump likely to enjoy strong support for a crackdown on undocumented people. Solutions, however, must go beyond piecemeal fixes or mass deportations, which risk violating human rights and republican ideals. Similarly, less draconian approaches, such as those pursued under Biden, also fail to resolve the core issues of immigration reform and enforcement. Rome offers a cautionary tale: patricians and plebeians showed rare unity in the Late Republic when they united against Gracchus after he pledged to extend citizenship rights to other populations. The issue demonstrates the need to widen responsibility. The U.S. economy benefits from labor tied to undocumented populations, and the root causes of migration, includingdecades of U.S. intervention in Latin America, must also be acknowledged. The U.S. was originally founded as a republican league of states but quickly recognized the need for national unity to ensure defense and economic unity. Over time, the growing centralization of authority in Washington eroded the balance of this system and led to fears of ever-expanding executive power, particularly over matters of war. This consolidation of power enabled a more assertive and interventionist foreign policy, allowing the federal government to project power globally. Yet U.S. states retain significant rights, functioning in a federated system with distributed powers that allow states to experiment with their own agendas. The areas in which they can do so include health care reforms, voting rights, and working together to counterbalance federal authority. American citizens also benefit from strong protections enshrined in the Bill of Rights, which, despite historical flaws in terms of racial and gender equity, established safeguards against government overreach. However, a hesitance to fully leverage these rights remains, partly due to ignorance. Rights intended to benefit all citizens, such as the right to bear arms, or judicially determined issues like access to abortion, frequently evolve into sources of contention, framed as victories for one side rather than universal benefits. This risks turning benefits into partisan battlegrounds, undermining their broader societal purpose. Many rights Americans enjoy were secured not by courts interpreting the Constitution but through legislative action driven by social movements, showing that the true source of rights lies within the collective efforts of citizens and lawmakers. U.S. presidents have been generally unable to radically alter the nation's political system, though the Jacksonian era proves there are exceptions. Andrew Jackson's presidency (1829–1837), as well as the years immediately before and after, solidified the two-party system, expanded the use of veto power, and centralized executive authority, reshaping the role of the presidency. Jackson, a populist, challenged corrupt elites and the political establishment but also aggravated tensions between the federal and state governments. Democratic participation was broadened, but it was limited to white men, and resulted in officeholders being replaced with people loyal to individuals, with support for the continuity of slavery and the ethnic cleansing of Native Americans. Concentrating authority away from the executive in a few oversight bodies or enlarged bureaucracy can also backfire, often encouraging corruption rather than transparency. For example, legislative reforms for campaign finance in the 1970s, intended to increase transparency, inadvertently fueled an increase in lobbying, attack ads, and exploitation of the electoral process. This shift, intended to curb corporate influence, instead deepened it, allowing corporations and interest groups to find new ways to wield power. The Founding Fathers, while focused on preventing tyranny through checks and balances, could not foresee the enormous role that corporate interests would play in shaping political outcomes, creating a system where legal monetary contributions increasingly dictate policy. The U.S. faces a major struggle in adapting its republican system to the realities of the 21st century. While executive power has been pivotal in addressing monumental issues, such as the abolition of slavery, it also carries a risk of abuse. Efforts to forcefully reform republics from the top down, like those seen in Rome, often impose rigid systems that fail to meet society's evolving needs. On the other hand, an over-reliance on populist people power without the necessary safeguards can lead to impulsive decisions and destabilized governance. Rejecting populism does not equate to diminishing civic engagement; rather, it calls for more sophisticated participation for constructive political processes. U.S. citizens retain significant power, including the right to gather, protest, and exercise free speech and association. Realizing the full potential of these rights and their responsible use requires a deeper understanding of the political system and a commitment to responsible use. This can be achieved by learning from other countries that cultivate republican values through education and habits from a young age, supported by public funding, and promoting political legitimacy through transparency and participation. Ignoring the need to address the decline in civic culture and public understanding of the system of government will further weaken the foundation of democratic practices. Reforming the U.S. republic is essential, but institutions like the Bipartisan Policy Center, despite their efforts to bridge divides, have been criticized for being compromised by corporate interests, which exposes the system's vulnerability to such interference. Over time, bipartisanship has become entrenched as a long-term alignment in support of big-money interests and an imperialist foreign policy, sidelining efforts for systemic change and diverging sharply from the best aspects of the early U.S. vision. Contrastingly, the current discourse around reform is often filtered through partisan lenses, populism, or authoritarian impulses, with many advocating for quick fixes rather than substantive solutions. Meaningful reform, however, will be a slow and contentious process, and progress will remain elusive without addressing the root causes of major problems and accepting a collective responsibility to solve them.

Breaking Latin America’s Cycle Of Low Growth And Violence – Analy...	Violent crime and insecurity have a disproportionate impact on Latin America and the Caribbean, with severe consequences for socioeconomic development. Despite representing just 8% of the world’s population, the region accounts for nearly one-third of global homicides. This as well as other alarming statistics highlight the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address the far-reaching effects of crime and violence. New research by the IDB and IMF highlights how crime, insecurity and low growth reinforce each other in a vicious cycle that stifles investment, reduces tourism, and accelerates emigration. Macroeconomic instability—recessions, inflation spikes, and rising inequality—is associated with increased violence. Easily available firearms and organized crime amplify these effects, undermining institutions and the rule of law. Quantifying the Costs of Crime A recent IDB paper quantifies the direct losses, estimating that crime and violence cost the region 3.4 percent of GDP annually. These costs stem from productivity losses due to lives lost, injuries, and imprisonment; private-sector expenditures on security; and public spending on police, justice, and prisons. This is equivalent to 80 percent of the region’s public education budgets and double its social assistance spending. But the impact of crime doesn’t end there. It discourages investment, reduces tourism, and drives emigration, further weakening economic resilience and constraining the region’s future growth. IMF research reveals that crime hampers innovation and reduces firm productivity, compounding economic stagnation over time. Leveraging geo-localized data on nightlights, the study finds that halving homicide rates in violent municipalities could increase their economic output by up to 30 percent. At the regional level, as shown in last year’s IMF research, reducing homicide rates to the global average could boost Latin America and the Caribbean’s annual GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points. Conversely, macroeconomic instability often fuels spikes in violence: a recession in LAC is associated with a 6 percent increase in homicides the following year, while inflation spikes above 10 percent are linked to a 10 percent rise in homicides the year after. Growing inequality further exacerbates the link between economic stagnation and crime. How can policymakers help break the cycle? Breaking this vicious circle requires a deeper understanding of its root causes and impacts. Rigorous research and better data are essential for designing public policies that effectively reduce crime. Institutions like the IDB and IMF can generate evidence, monitor crime dynamics, advise member countries, and facilitate discussions. As the topic has become macro critical in the region, the institutions brought together experts and policymakers in a joint conference a few weeks back. First, sound economic policy plays a preventive role. Stability, low inflation, robust social safety nets, and opportunities that reduce inequality and expand access to education and employment are critical to breaking the cycle of violence and stagnation. Financial authorities are also uniquely positioned to weaken criminal networks by addressing illicit markets, curtailing financial flows, and tackling money laundering—cutting off resources that sustain organized crime. Second, because the impact of crime extends far beyond direct economic costs, economic policymakers must adopt a broader role by targeting high-risk groups, improving crime monitoring, and enhancing interagency coordination. Effective interventions can deliver transformative results. With IMF support, Jamaica implemented reforms that protected public investment and social spending while successfully halving debt between 2012 and 2022. Community-based interventions supported by the IDB reduced gang violence in 68% of affected neighborhoods. In Rosario province, Argentina implemented a comprehensive strategy to combat crime, including territorial control of high-risk neighborhoods by the Federal Police, stricter prison systems for high-profile offenders, and collective prosecution of criminal groups under new legislation like the anti-mafia law. These efforts, alongside progress on a juvenile penal code to deter drug traffickers from recruiting minors, have led to 65% reduction homicides in 11 months. In Honduras, strategic security reforms contributed to a 14% decline in the homicide rate and an 8% increase in public confidence in law enforcement. Policymakers must prioritize using resources effectively, given the scope of the challenge. Public spending on security in the region is already high—around 1.9 percent of GDP, or 7.4 percent of total public expenditure—and may be even greater where the military and subnational governments are involved. Finance ministers and fiscal authorities need a full understanding of these costs, covering police, courts, prisons, and related institutions, to ensure funds are allocated efficiently to areas with the highest impact. They also need to monitor them in the same way they surveil other large spending tickets, evaluating their impact and pressing for results. Transnational Crime Demands Regional Cooperation Tackling crime solely at the national level isn’t sufficient. Criminal groups operate across borders, making isolated responses ineffective and fragmented. To address this shared challenge, countries must collaborate more closely to develop stronger, more coordinated solutions. Recognizing the transnational nature of crime, the IDB’s Alliance for Security, Justice, and Development seeks to unite governments, civil society, and private-sector actors. This alliance not only aims to strengthen institutions and enhance cooperation but also supports public policies and mobilizes resources to implement evidence-based solutions that effectively combat organized crime and violence. Regional collaboration is crucial for disrupting the sophisticated, interconnected networks of organized crime that undermine the rule of law and economic stability. By fostering unified efforts, institutions like the IMF and IDB alongside governments and civil society, have a critical role to play in this effort. With people's lives on the line, the true impact of these efforts must be felt on the ground—by creating safer streets, restoring hope in communities, and offering individuals a real chance to thrive economically in a future free from violence.

Why Is Trump Warning BRICS Nations Against De-Dollarization With ...	In a significant and provocative statement, President-elect Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to the BRICS nations—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—regarding their ambitions to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar in global trade. This warning comes in the form of a threat to impose a staggering 100% tariff on goods from these countries if they pursue de-dollarization initiatives. As the BRICS bloc expands its membership and seeks to establish alternative currency frameworks, Trump's declaration underscores a significant clash in the international economic landscape. The Context of De-Dollarization De-dollarization refers to the process by which countries seek to diminish their dependence on the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency and medium of exchange. This movement has gained momentum in recent years, particularly among emerging economies that perceive the dominance of the dollar as a tool for American economic hegemony. The BRICS nations have been at the forefront of this initiative, exploring ways to facilitate trade in local currencies and even considering the establishment of a shared currency. The impetus for de-dollarization has been fueled by various factors, including geopolitical tensions and economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. The most notable example is the sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, which prompted many nations to reconsider their reliance on the dollar for international transactions. The BRICS nations have discussed these issues extensively at their summits, aiming to create a more balanced global financial system that does not rely solely on U.S. financial mechanisms. Trump's Position and Threats In a recent post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump articulated his firm stance against any attempts by BRICS countries to move away from the dollar. He stated, 'The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER.' He demanded commitments from these nations not to create or endorse any alternative currency that could rival the U.S. dollar. Trump's threats are not merely rhetorical; they reflect a broader strategy aimed at safeguarding U.S. economic interests. By imposing tariffs that could double the cost of imports from BRICS nations, he aims to deter these countries from pursuing de-dollarization efforts. This approach aligns with Trump's long-standing belief that maintaining the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency is crucial for American economic stability. Implications for Global Trade The potential implementation of 100% tariffs on BRICS countries would have significant ramifications for global trade dynamics. The U.S. economy is deeply intertwined with many BRICS nations; for instance, trade between the U.S. and China reached approximately $690.6 billion in 2022, comprising about $536.8 billion in imports from China and $153.8 billion in exports to China. Meanwhile, trade with India was around $191.8 billion in 2021, and it is expected to have increased in 2022, reflecting the growing economic ties between the two countries. A sudden increase in tariffs could lead to retaliatory measures from these countries, escalating trade tensions and potentially destabilizing global markets. Moreover, such a move could accelerate efforts among BRICS nations to establish alternative trading systems that bypass U.S. financial controls altogether. Countries like China and Russia have already begun developing their own payment systems—such as China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) and Russia's System for Transfers of Financial Messages (SPFS)—to facilitate trade without relying on SWIFT or other Western-controlled financial networks. The Geopolitical Landscape Trump's threats come at a time when BRICS is expanding its membership, welcoming new entrants such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Ethiopia in 2024. This expansion signifies a shift towards greater economic cooperation among non-Western nations, challenging the traditional dominance of Western powers in global finance. The geopolitical implications are profound; as emerging economies band together under the BRICS umbrella, they are seeking to assert their influence on global economic policies and reduce their vulnerability to Western sanctions and economic pressures. Trump's warning may serve as a catalyst for these countries to accelerate their de-dollarization efforts as they strive for greater economic autonomy. Economic Consequences for the U.S. While Trump's aggressive stance may resonate with his base and appeal to nationalist sentiments, it also risks alienating key trading partners and could have unintended consequences for the U.S. economy itself. The imposition of high tariffs could lead to increased prices for American consumers and businesses reliant on imports from BRICS nations. Additionally, if countries like China and India successfully establish alternative trading mechanisms that reduce their reliance on the dollar, it could undermine American economic power in the long run. The dollar's status as the world's primary reserve currency has afforded the U.S. significant advantages, including lower borrowing costs and greater influence over global financial systems. The Future of Global Currencies As we look ahead, several questions arise regarding the future of global currencies in light of Trump's threats against BRICS nations: Will BRICS countries continue their push for de-dollarization despite potential U.S. tariffs? Given their collective economic power and shared interests in reducing dependence on Western financial systems, it is likely that they will persist in exploring alternatives. How will other countries respond to Trump's threats? Nations outside of BRICS may also reconsider their reliance on the dollar if they perceive that U.S. economic policies are increasingly unilateral or punitive. What strategies will Trump employ if he faces resistance from BRICS? Beyond tariffs, potential measures could include export controls or accusations of currency manipulation against countries engaging in trade outside of dollar-denominated transactions. Trump's warning to BRICS nations encapsulates a broader struggle over control of global finance and trade dynamics. As emerging economies seek greater independence from U.S.-centric systems through de-dollarization efforts, they are likely to face significant pushback from an administration determined to maintain its economic hegemony. The evolving relationship between Trump's America and an increasingly assertive BRICS bloc will shape not only international trade policies but also geopolitical alliances in an era marked by shifting power dynamics. As both sides navigate this complex landscape, it remains crucial for policymakers worldwide to consider the long-term implications of their choices on global stability and economic cooperation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5mNJ3VIbb4xz	2024-12-06T16:37:20-08:00	
Time For Truthful Narratives On Immigration – OpEd	The 'migrant crisis' was manufactured and is the fault of both Trump and Biden. We need to understand that the U.S. needs immigrants more than immigrants need the U.S. A quiet panic has broken out within immigrant communities across the United States ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025. Mixed-status families are expecting to be separated, DACA recipients foresee their status being revoked, those with Temporary Protected Status are pessimistic about the program remaining valid, and asylum seekers fear the worst. Indeed, if Project 2025's anti-immigrant agenda is fully enacted, the horrors of family separation that the nation witnessed in 2018 under Trump's first term will pale in comparison to what's coming. And yet, Trump might claim that this time, he's merely following the public's desires. The prevailing story of the 2024 presidential election is that voters were so fed up with immigration upending their lives that they picked a leader who promised to do something about it. Headlines such as this New York Times piece on Election Day claimed, 'Voters Were Fed Up Over Immigration. They Voted for Trump.' Indeed, polls showed likely voters ranking immigration as either the top issue, or second only to the economy. What has gone unsaid about public discontent over immigration and Trump's coming assault on immigrant rights is that the Biden administration paved the way for it, manufacturing a 'migrant crisis' and volleying it right into Trump's hands so he could lob it all the way to the White House. What's needed are not just better policies but a rewriting of the narratives about immigration and immigrants so that vulnerable human beings are no longer political scapegoats every four years. Gallup polls show that national anxiety over immigration significantly increased over the four years that Joe Biden was president. The fraction of Americans wanting lower levels of immigration had been slightly decreasing for years, landing at around 30 percent. In 2020 that number began rising, and by 2024, it had jumped to 55 percent. It's tempting to conclude that this trend is merely a matter of perception, the result of successful propaganda, of Trump's constant drumbeat that Biden opened the floodgates at the border, rolling out the welcome mat for millions of people with no papers. Indeed, far too many people hold false views of immigrants in the U.S., from assuming they are more prone to committing violent crimes—not true—to the idea that they are stealing jobs from native-born Americans and longtime residents—also not true. The adoption of such falsehoods is clearly Trump's doing. However, there are plenty of credible reports across the country, in small-town America and in urban centers, that demonstrate a real struggle with absorbing tens of thousands of newly resettled people from foreign nations. Such dynamics reinforced the notion that immigration is out of control and gave credence to Trump's lies about immigrants. What's going unsaid is that migrants from nonwhite nations in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia are being deliberately dumped into towns and cities with no plan for orderly absorption and assimilation—in direct contrast to how well the Biden administration welcomed Ukrainian refugees. A February 2024 in-depth report by Jerusalem Demsas in the Atlantic is one of the few analyses that explored what happened and why. 'Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine brought a separate influx of displaced people into U.S. cities that quietly assimilated most of them,' explained Demsas. The numbers of Ukrainian refugees and nonwhite immigrants in many towns and cities have been comparable, but the ways in which they were resettled have sometimes been starkly different. Based on interviews with mayors and municipal leaders, Demsas realized there were 'two major differences in federal policy' that explained the contrast. One policy difference was that Ukrainian refugees were allowed to work as soon as they arrived in the U.S., while subsequent waves of migrants were prohibited from working and then demonized for using government aid. The other difference was that the Biden administration carefully coordinated Ukrainian arrivals with local officials to ensure their proper assimilation. And it chose not to do so with groups arriving from across the Southern border. This meant that those local leaders who could politicize migrants did so by pointing to the chaos their presence seemed to provoke and by adopting policies that deliberately worsened the optics of immigration. 'To call this moment a 'migrant crisis' is to let elected federal officials off the hook,' concluded Demsas. If the federal government had treated nonwhite Latin American, Caribbean, African, and Asian migrants the same way it treated Ukrainian refugees, voters would likely not have been as swayed by Trump's lies as they were. A similar scenario played out with asylum seekers at the border. Rather than allowing those seeking asylum to make their case in an orderly way, the first Trump administration tried to break the entire system, creating chaos in order to blame asylees. Joe Biden's administration blithely allowed the restrictions to remain in place, breaking his campaign promise. The reality is that the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S. increased by only 800,000 people between 2019 and 2022 and remains below 2007 levels. In a nation of 335 million people, this is less than a quarter of a percent of the population. How can such a tiny fraction of people be the source of so many problems as Trump claims? Americans are not anti-immigrant. In fact, they are pro-immigration. A new Pew Research poll released on November 22, 2024, finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are happy to have undocumented immigrants remain in the nation with legal protections provided certain conditions are met, such as security checks and lawful employment. The reason it appears as though Americans are anti-immigrant is because they're being told that hordes of people are breaking the rules, sidestepping order, and forcing their way in to cause chaos, commit crimes, and steal jobs. This is both Trump's fault, and Biden's. Migration is a large-scale phenomenon of vulnerable populations fleeing war, poverty, persecution, climate change, and more. When given accessible procedures to enter another nation legally, migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers will do everything possible to follow the rules. Because, why not? Why would they deliberately jeopardize their own long-term security when given the chance? It turns out, the system has been deliberately broken in order to manufacture a crisis and help gutless politicians claim they are being 'tough on immigration.' The U.S. desperately needs immigrant workers. This is true not only in low-wage industries but in such highly skilled fields as medicine where immigrants are disproportionately represented. For example, the Migration Policy Institute found that '[w]hile immigrants represent 14 percent of the Illinois population, they make up 37 percent of its physicians and 19 percent of its registered nurses.' There is a nationwide shortage of medical workers—physicians, nurses, technicians, and home health aides—a gap that could be filled by skilled new immigrants. As the U.S.'s elder population continues to live longer, needing more care, and as the national birth rate falls, immigrants have stepped in to provide care and pay taxes to fund services they aren't even allowed to access. Indeed, many nations in the Global South are struggling with the 'brain drain' of their most talented workers leaving to work in the U.S. and other Western nations. The stories we are telling about immigrants are fueling misplaced panic in the U.S. We cannot rely on Trump to fix what he sought to break. In the coming months and years, the devastation the incoming president will wreak on vulnerable populations will test our collective morality. What's needed before the next election are truthful narratives about immigrants, including the fact that the migrant crisis has been manufactured and the legal immigration system deliberately broken for political gain, forcing most people into untenable situations. Most importantly, we need to be clear that our nation needs immigrants just as, if not more than, immigrants need the U.S. About the author: Sonali Kolhatkar is an award-winning multimedia journalist.

Berlin Conference: Colonial Legacy Continues 140 Years Later – Op...	From 15 November 1884 until 26 February 1885, the Berlin West Africa Conference was held in Germany where numerous European states convened to carve up the continent based upon their own economic interests. By Abayomi Azikiwe Commonly known as the Berlin Conference, the gathering marked the consolidation of European imperialist rule on the African continent which lasted formally for more than a century. One artistic expression which emanated from the gathering was a portrayal of King Leopold II carving up a giant cake which represented the African continent. Africa had already garnered enormous wealth for several European and North American states through the Atlantic Slave Trade and the establishment of colonies in Western Hemisphere. Portugal was one of the earliest colonizers and enslavers in Africa and maintained a presence from the 15th through the 20th centuries. Spain and Portugal, the pioneers of European slave and colonial structures, were later overshadowed by the Dutch, British, French and the United States. The abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade and eventually involuntary servitude in the Western feudal and burgeoning capitalist states did not usher in a renewed and more inclusive form of bourgeois democracy. Colonialism was a logical outcome of the slave system. As industrial production provided an enhanced rational methodology for the exploitation of labor, the colonial system with its reliance on land seizures, population displacement, forced taxation, cash crop production and mining reaped far greater profits for the ruling class. African enslavement was resisted internally from its early phase between the 15th and 18th centuries until its eventual demise in the 19th century. The successful slave rebellion which transformed into a revolutionary movement in Haiti between 1791-1804 signaled the rise of widespread resistance to human bondage. In the U.S. notable rebellions such as on the Louisiana German Coast of 1811; Denmark Vessey in Charleston, South Carolina during 1822; Nat Turner and his comrades in South Hampton County, Virginia in 1831; John Brown at Harper’s Ferry in Virginia in 1859; and the 200,000 Africans who joined the Union army in the Civil War were motivated by the desire to eliminate their enslavement. Interestingly enough it would be the territories initially colonized by Spain and Portugal which would be the last countries to abolish slavery in the late 1880s in Cuba and Brazil. However, despite the legal abolition of involuntary servitude, colonialism, racism and economic exploitation would continue. Codifying Colonial Exploitation The Berlin Conference was designed to utilize the knowledge acquired by the European explorers who traveled throughout areas of the African continent to assess their capacity for the domination of land and labor along with the extraction of its riches. Henry Morton Stanley, who was born in Wales and later immigrated to the U.S. where he served in both the Confederate and Union armies during the Civil War, was recruited by King Leopold II to map out areas of Central Africa for the exploitation of the land and its people. These imperialist designs on Central Africa by the Belgian monarchy conflicted with that of France which had deployed its own explorer, Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, who proceeded to challenge Leopold II for his claim to the area. The connection between the exploration and mapping of Central and other regions of Africa, and the pursuit of profits was made clear in Leopold II’s instructions to Stanley when he said: 'It is not about Belgian colonies. It is about establishing a new state that is as large as possible and about its governance. It should be clear that in this project there can be no question of granting the Negroes the slightest form of political power. That would be ridiculous. The whites, who lead the posts, have all the power.' Consequently, the purpose of the Berlin Conference was to resolve these differences so that the total colonization of Africa could move forward rapidly. The entire process of colonization was an extremely violent affair. Between 1876 and 1908 in Congo, estimates are that 8-10 million Africans died due to the horrendous treatment from the Belgian ruling class. During this initial period the territory was run exclusively by the monarchy. After 1908 the Congo came under Belgian colonial rule where it remained until 1960. One source said of the 1884-85 Berlin meeting that: 'The conference, proposed by Portugal in pursuance of its special claim to control of the Congo estuary, was necessitated by the jealousy and suspicion with which the great European powers viewed one another’s attempts at colonial expansion in Africa. The general act of the Conference of Berlin declared the Congo River basin to be neutral (a fact that in no way deterred the Allies from extending the war into that area in World War I); guaranteed freedom for trade and shipping for all states in the basin; forbade slave trading; and rejected Portugal’s claims to the Congo River estuary—thereby making possible the founding of the independent Congo Free State, to which Great Britain, France, and Germany had already agreed in principle.' Nonetheless, this conference was not able to prevent violent disputes over the future of Africa and the world. The European imperialists in Congo and many other regions of Africa utilized repressive measures which were reminiscent of the period of enslavement where forced labor, coercion, detentions, exile, beatings and killings were routine. During the first decade of the 20th century, the German colonialists carried out genocidal onslaughts in South-West Africa (now Namibia) during 1904-1907 when 60-80 percent of the African population was wiped out. During the same time period in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) in East Africa, the German conquerors killed thousands of people between 1905-1907. These acts of genocide by Germany were in response to resistance wars launched by the Africans in Namibia and Tanzania when they rose up against the national oppression and economic exploitation inflicted by imperialism. World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945) grew out of contradictions within the imperialist system. After 1945, the U.S. emerged as the undisputed dominant political and economic power in the capitalist world. The only real challenges to imperialism emerged from the socialist camp and the national liberation movements. Legacy of the Berlin Conference Colonialism remains in its various forms throughout the world. France has been exposed for its ongoing colonial project when recent rebellions have erupted in New Caledonia and Martinique. On the African continent, France relinquished most of its classical colonies and has exerted its influence through neocolonial structures which involve disadvantageous economic arrangements and the presence of military forces which guard the interests of Paris. In the early 1960s, the French government conducted nuclear weapons testing in the Sahara irrespective of the protests from the Ghana government under President Kwame Nkrumah. In recent years, the Sahel region of West Africa has been a flashpoint for anti-imperialist movements which have rejected French, U.S. and NATO military involvement. In Niger, where some of the largest deposits of uranium in the world exist, the long-term contract between the Committee to Safeguard the Homeland (CNSP) government for uranium extraction has been cancelled by the new administration. Reuters in a December 4 report pointed out: 'French nuclear firm Orano says the military authorities in Niger have taken control of its uranium mining operations in the West African country. After seizing power in a coup in July last year, Niger’s military rulers said they would revamp rules regulating the mining of raw materials by foreign companies. In June, they withdrew Orano’s permit to exploit one of the world’s largest uranium deposits. Orano then suspended production. This marks another escalation in the unravelling relationship between France and Niger, following the expulsion of French troops from its former colony.' These political shifts in the Alliance of Sahal States (AES) portend much for the future of imperialism in Africa and other geopolitical regions. African states were founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) which recently condemned the Israeli airstrikes on the Islamic Republic of Iran. The African Union (AU) 55 member-states are participants in the Group of 77 Plus China which represents approximately 80 percent of the world’s population. The Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa Plus (BRICS) countries are seriously discussing de-dollarization and the building of a New Development Bank (NDB). With the statements made by the incoming U.S. administration of former President Donald Trump threatening large-scale tariffs not only against the leading trading partners of Washington which are Mexico and Canada, such measures are being weaponized as well against the BRICS countries seeking to break free from the dollar. These conflicting interests will intensify aggravating tensions over the direction of the world economic system. These divergent objectives will foster broader alliances among the peoples of the Global South and their counterparts among the working class and nationally oppressed within the imperialist states.

FIFA’s Cooked Findings: Saudi Arabia’s World Cup Bid – OpEd	FIFA has done it again. With its usual sparkle of inventive interpretation, amoral reasoning, and snappy bravura, the world football federation has deemed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia fit for hosting the largest sporting event on the sporting calendar – not counting the Olympics. The FIFA Men’s World Cup will be hosted, yet again, in a desert country, where football is a most recent thing but cunning opportunism not. There are certainly many things going the way of Saudi Arabia, which submitted its official bid to host the tournament in July this year. For one thing, hosting such gargantuan events is crushingly costly to country, city and populace. Such discouragement tends to thin the field of contenders. (Saudi Arabia was the sole bidder for the 2034 tournament.) The country has also engaged in a sporting strategy that currently involves more than 900 sponsorship deals, one-third of which can be linked back to the country’s US$925 billion sovereign wealth fund. Football, in particular, has seen enormous investment from the Kingdom, be it through sponsorships, partnerships or investments. These measures are vital parts of the Kingdom’s 'Vision 2030' program. A report by the publicly funded Danish sports ethics institute Play the Game notes a degree of sophistication and versatility on the part of the Kingdom’s sporting leaders. 'Unlike many of their counterparts in global sports, Saudi sports leaders hold multiple roles that combine leadership in the sports sector with high-ranking positions within the state apparatus, granting them unparalleled political and financial authority.' These figures are chameleon in nature, simultaneously holding positions in the sporting field, vital ministries, state-owned enterprises, and the sovereign wealth fund itself. The authors of the report identify Yasir Al-Rumayyan as an example, a figure who occupies the position of governor of the Public Investment Fund and chairman of the state-owned oil and gas giant Aramco, in addition to being directly involved in sports. Doing so permits a seamless 'transition between acting as a sports leader, financial heavyweight, or a state representative, depending on the context.' Given the Kingdom’s extensive cultivation and fostering football, FIFA’s assessment of the bid was never going to be too harsh. Besides, football’s main governing body has its own partnership with Aramco, which was announced in April this year. 'This partnership,' stated FIFA President Gianni Infantino, 'will assist FIFA to successfully deliver its flagship tournaments over the next four years and, as is the case with all our commercial agreements, enable us to provide enhanced support to our 211 FIFA member associations across the globe.' Infantino went on to note Aramco’s 'strong record of supporting world-class events' while also taking an interest in 'developing grassroots sports initiatives.' The announcement did not impress over a hundred international women footballers who signed an open letter to the FIFA president decrying the Kingdom’s elaborate sportswashing exercise. 'Saudi authorities have been spending billions in sports sponsorship to distract from the regime’s brutal human rights reputation, but its treatment of women speaks for itself.' These included the imprisonment of Salma al-Shebab, Manal al-Gafiri, Fatima al-Shawarbi, Sukaynah al-Aithan and Nourah al-Qahtani. The letter also went on to lacerate the Saudi authorities for trampling 'not only on the rights of women, but on the freedom of all other citizens too. Imagine LGBTQ+ players, many of whom are heroes of our sport, being expected to promote Saudi Aramco during the 2027 [Women’s] World Cup, the national oil company of a regime that criminalises the relationships that they are in and the values they stand for?' These were merely rumblings to FIFA, whose assessment was almost embarrassingly glowing, coming in at 4.2 out of 5. The risk assessment for human rights was graded as 'medium'. The Saudi Gazette cooed with satisfaction at an evaluation that was 'the highest in the tournament’s history.' In its assessment, FIFA claimed to have 'consulted various sources, including the bidder’s human rights strategy, the mandated context assessment, as well as direct commitments from the host country and host cities, together with all contractual hosting documents, all of which notably contain provisions relating to respecting human rights in connection with the competition'. The governing body pushed the familiar and erroneous argument that the sport had 'good potential' to engender reforms and 'contribute to positive human rights outcomes'. Riyadh had also shown a 'good commitment to sustainability' though FIFA had to accept that the climate posed an 'elevated risk'. Many of the findings were reached on the basis of a report entitled 'Independent Context Assessment Prepared for the Saudi Arabian Football Federation in relation to the FIFA World Cup 2034'. (The term 'independent' in most reports suggests the contrary.) The assessments were always going to be favourably cooked. For one, it was authored by the Saudi arm of the Clifford Chance law firm. The report also failed to consider a range of relevant international human rights instruments given that the Kingdom had either not ratified them or because the Saudi Football Federation did not deem them relevant to the assessment. No mention, then, of freedom of expression, association and assembly, let alone discrimination against LGBTQI+ communities, the right to freedom of religion or certain labour rights such as trade union membership. Human rights groups have been busy trying to shift the focus back to the Kingdom’s spotty resume. In a October 28 statement, 11 organisations including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Football Supporters Europe, labour organisations, Gulf human rights groups and a Saudi Arabian diaspora group warned that a poor human rights record had worsened 'under the de facto rule of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has presided over a soaring number of mass executions, torture, enforced disappearance, severe restrictions on free expression, repression of women’s rights under the male guardianship system, LGBTI+ discrimination, and the killing of hundreds of migrants at the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border.' The Kafala (labour sponsorship) system, along with the prohibition of trade unions, continued to result in the exploitation of migrant workers. Not all has been smooth on the matter of endorsing FIFA’s decision, at least at the level of various football organisations whose approval is also sought. But even there, Saudi sporting strategy has been in evidence to ensure a lack of dissent. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC), for instance, was hardly going to disagree with the choice, given Riyadh’s embrace of the AFC as a global partner between 2021 and 2024, a relationship that was renewed in July 2024 for a further five years. At this writing, the Football Association remains uncertain on whether an official endorsement will be forthcoming. While the BBC has been told that FA officials are troubled by the human rights dimension, there is also a concern that accusations of hypocrisy will follow should the organisation then participate in the tournament. No one, it seems, wants to miss out on the party. And the Saudi authorities know this all too well.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5jdsBh3dql-L	2024-12-06T16:25:08-08:00	
Russia’s Invasion Of Ukraine And Its Impact On Nuclear Proliferat...	By Luke Coffey Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has led to numerous unintended global consequences. Among these are heightened concerns about food insecurity, especially in vulnerable regions, and an acute energy crisis in Europe, which is only now being addressed through a complete restructuring of the continent’s energy imports. Economic uncertainty and inflation have surged, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. However, one consequence that has escaped widespread discussion is the impact on efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. To understand this issue, it is essential to examine the recent history of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, 15 newly independent states emerged, three of which —Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus — found themselves in possession of sizable numbers of Soviet nuclear weapons. While Kazakhstan and Belarus quickly transferred control of their nuclear arsenals to Moscow, Ukraine’s situation was different. At the time, Ukraine unexpectedly became the world’s third-largest nuclear power. This triggered an internal debate about the country’s nuclear future. On the one hand, many of these weapons were nearing the end of their operational life, and Ukraine lacked the resources to modernize and maintain them. On the other hand, there was significant support for retaining a nuclear deterrent to ensure the nation’s security and defense. Ultimately, after significant international pressure, Ukraine agreed to relinquish all its inherited nuclear weapons in exchange for substantial economic support and security guarantees from Russia, the US and the UK. This agreement culminated in the signing of the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances on Dec. 5, 1994. This week marks the 30th anniversary of the agreement. According to the memorandum, Russia, the UK and the US agreed to 'reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defense or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.' However, as time went on, the Budapest Memorandum became fraught with ambiguities. It meant different things to different parties. Since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainians have accused their Western partners of failing to honor the memorandum’s security guarantees. From the US perspective, the Budapest Memorandum was a memorandum — not a legally binding treaty. For the US, obligations under such agreements require Senate ratification to carry the force of law. While the US and UK argue that it is Russia, not them, that has violated the memorandum, this distinction remains a sore point for Ukraine. This week, during a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha held up the country’s original copy of the Budapest Memorandum, as a symbolic reminder to the world of the commitments made three decades ago. In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, three significant consequences for global nuclear nonproliferation efforts have emerged. First, no country currently in possession of nuclear weapons — or close to developing them — will willingly give them up. Ukraine’s experience has underscored the risks of disarmament. Had Ukraine retained even a limited nuclear deterrent, it is unlikely that Russia would have invaded in 2014 or 2022. This lesson will not be lost on other countries. States with nuclear ambitions will be emboldened to develop and maintain their arsenals, making global nuclear disarmament a distant goal. Secondly, the war in Ukraine has inadvertently strengthened the nuclear capabilities of Iran and North Korea. Facing unexpected setbacks in its campaign, Russia has relied on material and manpower support from these allies. North Korea, for example, has provided Russia with artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Recent reports even suggest North Korea has sent thousands of soldiers to fight alongside Russian forces. This support has not come without a price. It is widely suspected that Russia has offered nuclear or missile technology in exchange. Speaking in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned that 'there’s every reason to believe that nuclear and missile technology is flowing into North Korea.' Finally, the possibility of Ukraine pursuing a nuclear weapons program cannot be dismissed. With trust in the Budapest Memorandum shattered and the prospect of NATO membership — and its accompanying security guarantees — still remote, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hinted that Ukraine may have no choice but to reconsider its nuclear options. While there is no evidence that Ukraine is actively pursuing nuclear weapons, experts agree that the country has the technical expertise and resources to do so in the future. It would be a tragic irony if the Budapest Memorandum, designed to reduce the number of nuclear-armed states, ended up accelerating nuclear proliferation. The memorandum highlights how partial solutions to complex security problems can lead to unintended and far-reaching consequences. As President Donald Trump prepares to enter the Oval Office next year, he has expressed a desire to negotiate a settlement between Russia and Ukraine. Any such deal must include robust and enforceable security guarantees for Kyiv. Ukraine, understandably skeptical of diplomatic assurances, will demand more than cleverly worded agreements with little practical enforcement. Historians may one day look back on the Budapest Memorandum and the subsequent war as the moment the global nonproliferation regime began to unravel. Without credible commitments and enforcement mechanisms, efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons may prove futile, leaving the world a far more dangerous place. In this context, the lessons of the Budapest Memorandum should serve as a cautionary tale. Only comprehensive and enforceable security agreements can prevent the next crisis of trust — and proliferation—from happening in the future. Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Reports Detail Forced Youth Conscription In Ethiopia	Tedla Hirigo, 17, worked as a street vendor in Adama city in Ethiopia’s Oromia region on November 11 when police detained him. 'When I visited the station in the evening, officers told me that he would be sent to a military training camp unless I paid 30,000 birr for his release,' Tedla’s mother told Ethiopian newspaper The Addis Standard. She said Tedla was her family’s primary source of income. 'He was raised without a father, and we don’t have the financial means to pay such a large sum.' Multiple sources report that the federal government is forcibly conscripting people to bolster its military strength for the intensifying Amhara region conflict. 'Youths are being rounded up and sent to military camps in many places in Addis Ababa,' Meseret Media reported on October 28. 'Our sources told us that after they take these children who do heavy work to the police station, they keep them in prison for some time and then take them to the military camp.' Another source told The Addis Standard on condition of anonymity that authorities in Fital town and surrounding villages announced an effort to have young people voluntarily enlist for military training. The resident said that no one volunteered, and 'government forces, in collaboration with local administrators, began rounding up individuals.' The Standard reported similar stories in Sheger city, which surrounds the federal capital, and of the detention of more than 20 Oromians who were threatened with military conscription at the Setema district police station in the western Jimma zone, several hundred kilometers southwest of Addis Ababa. In a November 15 statement, the Oromia regional government refuted allegations that security forces are abducting people for ransom, describing them as 'unfounded propaganda' and 'defamation.' The Amhara region conflict has escalated significantly since the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) launched an offensive that it called a 'final operation' against an Amhara militia known as Fano. An additional 40,000 troops reportedly were deployed. Calls for peace have 'fallen on deaf ears,' ENDF spokesperson Col. Getnet Adane said on October 1, according to Voice of America. 'The only language they understand is force,' he said. 'From now on we will talk to them in that language. For peace to prevail they need to be met with force. They have to be targeted, hit.' Members of Ethiopia’s security forces have been implicated in kidnapping and extortion cases, according to a late September report by the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission. 'It is being done in broad daylight, especially in Sheger city,' an Oromia government source told Meseret Media. On the same day that the ENDF announced its military offensive, human rights group Amnesty International accused the army of conducting 'mass arbitrary detentions' in the Amhara region. Tigere Chagutah, the organization’s regional director for East and Southern Africa, alleged that hundreds have been held, including members of the academic community, in major towns across the Amhara region since September 28. 'The Ethiopian army and police’s ongoing campaign of arbitrary mass detentions in Amhara region is yet more evidence of the government’s total disregard for the rule of law,' he said in a statement. 'Eyewitnesses have stated that authorities came with a ‘list’ and failed to obtain arrest and search warrants before detaining hundreds of civilians across the region. Those detained have largely not been brought before a court of law within 48 hours, as required by the country’s national laws and constitution.' Amnesty International urged Ethiopian authorities to halt the use of arbitrary arrests and detentions as tools of repression. 'Immediately end these arbitrary arrests, press charges against those detained for internationally recognized crimes and follow due process, or release them without further delay,' the group said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5knurwHCmMdU	2024-12-06T16:17:58-08:00	
Putin Says Oreshnik Missile System Will Be Deployed In Belarus	(RFE/RL) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that Oreshnik missile systems, recently combat-tested in a strike on Ukraine, will be deployed in Belarus simultaneously with their introduction into the Russian Strategic Missile Forces (RVSN). Speaking on December 6 after a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Russia-Belarus Union State in Minsk, Putin said that the Oreshnik systems could be stationed in Belarus as soon as the second half of 2025. The statement opens a new phase in the military strategy and development of relations between Russia and Belarus. The decision underscores a further deepening of military integration between the two countries and underlines Russia's increasing military footprint in Eastern Europe. Russia launched an Oreshnik ballistic missile against Ukraine on November 21 in a strike targeting the city of Dnipro. Putin said at the time it was part of Moscow's response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil with U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems, known as ATACMS, and British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. Putin said the Oreshnik system would have highly accurate, long-range missiles that could pierce advanced missile defense systems. The specific technical details of the Oreshnik remain classified, but it is reportedly designed to increase the survivability and effectiveness of Russia's nuclear arsenal, particularly in the context of evolving global security challenges. Belarus, a close ally of Russia, has been part of a broader geopolitical and military partnership, formally enshrined through the Union State agreement signed in the 1990s. Over the years, this alliance has been deepening, especially after 2014, following the annexation of Crimea and the subsequent deterioration of relations between Russia and the West, especially over Moscow's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which started in February 2022. For Russia, the placement of advanced missile systems in Belarus indicates its willingness to develop military capabilities close to NATO's eastern flank. Belarus's proximity to NATO member states, particularly Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, makes it a very strategic location for Russia's missile deployments. Aside from missile deployments, Russia and Belarus are performing joint military exercises and integrating their air defense systems and defense coordination strategies. In general, the coordination shows a continuously intensifying comprehensive military integration, which many analysts suggest would take the relationship one step further to a fully political-military union in the framework of the Union State. To Belarus, the alliance with Russia is an influential factor in its security strategy, particularly when tensions have risen between Belarus and the West. Belarus's authoritarian ruler, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, has long relied on Russian support, both political and military, as a guarantor of his regime's stability.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5h2gyrfXWndR	2024-12-06T16:14:10-08:00	
South Korea’s Yoon Faces Impeachment As Key Conservative Turns Ag...	By William Gallo The head of South Korea's ruling People Power Party has announced support for suspending the duties of President Yoon Suk Yeol – a stunning, last-minute move to abandon his fellow conservative leader that analysts say greatly increases the chances of Yoon's impeachment over his failed attempt at martial law. At a party meeting on Friday, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon called for the 'swift suspension' of Yoon's duties, citing 'newly revealed facts' that suggest Yoon had attempted to use intelligence agencies to arrest prominent lawmakers, accusing them of being 'anti-state forces.' 'President Yoon has not acknowledged that the illegal martial law was a mistake. If President Yoon continues to carry out his duties, there is a significant risk of a recurrence of such extreme actions … which could pose a great threat to the Republic of Korea and its people,' Han said, using South Korea’s formal name. Yoon, frustrated for months by what he saw as opposition attempts to obstruct his governance, declared martial law late Tuesday, claiming it was necessary to 'crush anti-state forces' and 'protect constitutional order.' Within hours, South Korean lawmakers overturned the decree, after fighting their way through police and military personnel who had been sent to the National Assembly Building. The opposition, which holds a majority in the National Assembly, plans to vote on Yoon's impeachment late Saturday. Tensions building Adding to the urgency, South Korean media on Friday reported unconfirmed rumors that a second attempt at martial law was being planned, though the reports were quickly denied by the military. In a live-streamed interview on YouTube, Kwak Jong-geun, the head of South Korea’s special warfare command, said he would not enforce a second martial law decree, should he receive such orders. Kwak also said that during the first short-lived martial law, he refused orders to clear lawmakers from the National Assembly, viewing such a move as illegal. South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense later suspended Kwak and two other senior military commanders who were involved in the first martial law declaration, according to the Yonhap news agency. At the country’s legislature, tensions were briefly high on Friday, amid rumors that Yoon was set to visit and meet with lawmakers in an attempt to find a path forward that does not involve impeachment. In preparation for Yoon’s rumored visit, hundreds of opposition lawmakers and officials gathered at the entrance, warning Yoon to stay away. Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Min-seok told a public gathering that his party had informed the presidential office that Yoon would not be allowed to enter the grounds. Yoon’s office later said that he had no plans to visit. PPP leader a key figure South Korean police on Thursday announced they have opened an investigation into charges that Yoon and other senior leaders committed treason related to the events of Tuesday night. On Friday, South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo reported that Yoon ordered South Korea’s spy agency to arrest Han, the conservative party leader who had once been a close ally and colleague of Yoon during their earlier careers as prosecutors. Han, who had previously served as Yoon’s justice minister, has played a key role in the political drama unfolding this week. Immediately after Yoon declared martial law, Han opposed the effort, and 18 members of his conservative party voted to overturn the decree. However, on Thursday Han and his fellow conservatives began to rally around Yoon, saying they would oppose the impeachment, which they claimed would paralyze the country. Han changed his stance again on Friday, saying he had obtained 'credible evidence' that Yoon was trying to arrest senior lawmakers. 'I firmly believe that now is the time to think solely about the nation and its citizens,' he said. Constitutional court uncertainty To succeed, at least eight members of the PPP must support the impeachment motion. So far, only two conservatives have publicly said they will vote to impeach Yoon. But after Han’s reversal, many observers say it now appears likely that the impeachment will pass. If Yoon is impeached, he would be immediately suspended while the Constitutional Court deliberates on whether to remove him from office, a process that could take weeks or even months.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5maXoVfxaADz	2024-12-06T16:10:50-08:00	
Romania: Presidential Elections Cancelled By Constitutional Court	By Charles Szumski (EurActiv) -- Romania's Constitutional Court has annulled the country's presidential elections, including the first round and the upcoming runoff initially scheduled for Sunday (8 December) between far-right candidate Călin Georgescu and liberal Elena Lasconi. The unanimous decision announced on Friday (6 December) voids the entire electoral process, citing irregularities that require a complete restart. A new election date will be set by the government following the decision's publication in the Official Gazette. 'In accordance with Article 146(f) of the Constitution, the entire electoral process for electing the President of Romania is annulled,' stated the court's official communiqué. The cancellation comes amid legal disputes over the elections' fairness, with various petitions submitted to the court before the runoff. Călin Georgescu, a far-right candidate with pro-Russian sympathies, has faced allegations that his candidacy benefitted from disinformation campaigns and coordinated promotion on TikTok during the first round of the presidential elections. Romanian authorities have called for an investigation into the platform's role in amplifying his message, raising concerns about foreign interference and social media's influence on democratic processes. The government now has up to 90 days to organize new elections, with speculation suggesting they could take place in February or March. 'This moves the process back to the very beginning', Siegfried Muresan from the conservative PNL party (EPP) told Euractiv. 'It will be up to the candidates to decide if they submit candidacies and the authorities will be looking into whether those can be validated. 'Certainly authorities will make sure that foreign interference is tackled', he added. Meanwhile, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis’ term, set to expire on December 21, will likely be extended due to the state of necessity created by this unprecedented situation. The ruling has ignited debate about the role of the Constitutional Court in validating elections. Critics, including former Constitutional Court Judge Petre Lăzăroiu, argue that the court's role is to validate results based on clear evidence, not suspicions. 'Decisions must be based on clear, undeniable proof, not speculation,' emphasized Augustin Zegrean, another former court president on TVR Romania. With the electoral process now back to square one, Romania faces uncertainty as it prepares to reorganize its presidential race under intense legal and public scrutiny. *Nicholas Wallace contributed reporting.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5sLHTWZQzrvG	2024-12-06T16:07:29-08:00	
Myanmar: Kokang Rebels Execute 6 After Public Trials In Shan Stat...	Ethnic Kokang rebels in northern Myanmar have executed six people following a public trial in front of hundreds of people that was filmed and posted on social media, including murder, the group confirmed Friday. The six were among 14 individuals tried on Thursday by the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or MNDAA, which had been fighting the junta since a military coup in early 2021, until agreeing to a ceasefire earlier this week. In the video, which appeared to be professionally produced -- including a militaristic soundtrack and drone shots -- the convicted individuals in blue jumpsuits are held by guards as authorities in uniforms read out their crimes in Mandarin Chinese, the Kokang’s main language. As the crimes are read out, MNDAA soldiers draw red X’s over signs displaying their names and that they were convicted criminals. One of the accused, a woman, was convicted of murdering her husband, sources close to the MNDAA said via their social media accounts. The other male suspects were charged with the murder of a female driver, the killing of a friend, and plotting to kill the owners of a construction and natural gas company. Eight other individuals, accused of other crimes, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 to 20 years. The event took place Thursday in northern Shan state’s Laukkai township. On Friday, the MNDAA’s Kokang Information Network confirmed that the group had executed the six in a post to its social media page. The video concludes with the six being paraded around the township in the back of pickup trucks as they are driven to what appears to be an execution site, before being led off by soldiers. 'After the public trial, police officers from the judicial branch escorted the criminals, who had been sentenced according to the law, through the streets for a public display,' the post said. 'Then, the convicts were brought to the execution ground to be executed.' It was not immediately clear how the six were executed. Attempts by RFA to contact MNDAA officials for comment on the sentences went unanswered Friday. The MNDAA has executed individuals it convicted of crimes in staged trials before. In April, another similar video showed several convicted people being publicly condemned for crimes, including three to death. On May 2, 2023, the MNDAA executed four individuals for their involvement in murders, robberies, and 25 kidnappings in northern Shan’s Lashio township. ‘No way consistent’ Legal experts have expressed concerns over the MNDAA’s actions, noting that the practice of public executions, which occurred during Myanmar’s British colonial era, has long been abolished. RFA spoke with a lawyer who noted that the Kokang, who speak Mandarin Chinese and share ethnic characteristics with their northern neighbors, 'follow the Chinese legal system, as they are subordinate to China and must adhere to its directives.' The lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous due to security concerns, said that denying the six an appeal of their conviction and publicly executing them, 'is in no way consistent with or acceptable under Myanmar’s current legal system.' 'In Myanmar, there are only two ways the death penalty can be carried out: if a civilian court issues a death sentence, the execution takes place in prison, while if a military court issues a death sentence, it is carried out by prison authorities within the prison, or by relevant military commanders,' he said. 'There is no provision in our laws that mandates public executions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5mqHR2pT8OjE	2024-12-06T16:05:40-08:00	
Houman A. Sadri: A Passion for International Politics And Central...	Dr. Houman A. Sadri, a man of high integrity, dedicated to the study of international politics and development, has distinguished himself as an outstanding administrator and promoter of public diplomacy in many professional settings. As the director of the Information and Policy Analysis Center (IPAC), Dr. Houman Sadri has interacted with organizations including for-profit, non-profit as well as governmental agencies. He is a proven leader with valuable people skills. He excels at motivating, managing, and interacting with individuals from diverse cultural, racial, and religious backgrounds. Dr. Sadri has served as a project manager for several local and national corporations with international aspirations and further promoted their presence abroad. I have known Dr. Sadri during my participation at the annual meeting of The Florida Political Science Association (2024) where he demonstrated high levels of organizational skills and a deep knowledge on American political system and International Affairs. His knowledge on International Politics is admirable and profound, young scholars can find many useful information through his writings and research. Dr. Sadri earned a Ph.D. from the University of Virginia and a fellowship at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University. He is the author of several books and numerous articles. He is a frequent presenter and keynote speaker at professional and community meetings both in the United States and abroad. His rare ability to combine academic and real-world experience make Dr. Sadri a public speaker of high demand. His wealth of experience in International Development and international security have earned him an unparalleled reputation and prestigious awards. As an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Central Florida, Houman Sadri, Ph.D., received a medal dedicated to the 20th Anniversary of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan. On August 4, 2016, the Embassy of Kazakhstan awarded Dr. Sadri with the medal in recognition of his important contribution to the promotion of Kazakhstan’s model of peace and harmony, and for his indispensable role to foster friendly relations between the two nations. According to Ambassador Kairat Ermekuly Umarov, this award reflects and recognizes the constant hard work that Dr. Houman Sadri has demonstrated towards strengthening the bilateral cooperation between Kazakhstan and the United States of America. In his impressive professional career, Dr. Sadri has also harnessed his leadership ability by serving as coordinator of the United Nations Association at UCF, leading the team to victory each year at regional, national, and even international competitions. Additionally, Dr. Sadri has introduced a course on Central Asia at UCF and has published a book about the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan. According to Dr. Sadri: 'Kazakhstan is a middle state trying not only to mediate conflicts and seek compromising positions in different conflicts but also expanding its influence in the Central Asian region as well as in global affairs.' During his meeting with Ambassador Kairat Umarov, Dr. Sadri spoke on the importance of the Kazakhstan model of interethnic accord and advocated for the international community to learn more about this phenomenon. The Assembly of People of Kazakhstan plays an important role in the formation of a unique model of social unity. Its main goal is to implement the national policy, ensure social and political stability in Kazakhstan and increase the efficiency of cooperation between state institutions and civil society in the field of interethnic relations. Furthermore Dr. Sadri has emerged as a prominent voice of Kazakhstan’s institutions in the international arena, and his valuable contributions have shed light on the interethnic dialogue and tolerance that has taken place throughout the Central Asian nation. Today the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan contributes not only to strengthening interethnic accord and tolerance in the country, but also assists the government in combating extremism and radicalism. In this context Dr. Sadri has conducted extensive research and published various papers about the relations between the European Union and Kazakhstan. In one of his publications he states: 'The European Union is Kazakhstan’s most important trade and investment partner, accounting for half of Kazakhstan’s foreign trade turnover and attracted foreign capital in the economy. Since Kazakhstan’s independence, the EU has been one of its leading political and economic partners, but in December 2015 they strengthened their ties, signing the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA). This is the first such agreement signed by the EU with a partner in Central Asia.' Dr. Sadri’s research in European Union’s Commercial Policies and trade priorities with Central Asia, have placed him among the very few U. S. Scholars that are exclusively focused on the economic and trade partnerships that have recently flourished between EU and Kazakhstan, a highly important country in the geopolitics of Eurasia.

Political Crisis In Georgia: What Are The Scenarios For The Count...	For several days now, tens of thousands of Georgians have been taking to the streets to demand new parliamentary elections and to denounce the government's decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union. It is therefore necessary to explore possible scenarios for the future of this small Caucasus country in the grip of a serious political crisis. The protests are growing in intensity. For the second week, tens of thousands of people have been demonstrating daily to protest the government's decision to halt the EU accession process until 2028 and call for new elections. In major Georgian cities such as Tbilisi, Batumi, Rustavi, Gori or Zugdidi, and even in more peaceful places such as Khashuri or Lagodekhi, impressive crowds gather every evening to express their anger against the Georgian Dream Party, which has been in power since 2012. Accused by its opponents of pro-Russian authoritarianism and of having 'stolen' the October 26 parliamentary elections, the party is at the center of the protests. The movement goes beyond the streets. Hundreds of officials from the foreign, defense, and education ministries, as well as judges, have issued joint statements of protest. More than a hundred schools and universities have closed their doors. Some 160 Georgian diplomats denounced the unconstitutional decision to halt the EU accession process, and key Georgian ambassadors resigned, including to the United States, the Netherlands, and Lithuania. In the face of these protests, the authorities intensified their repression. In Tbilisi, police used water cannons, tear gas, and even rubber bullets. The Interior Ministry reported more than 220 arrests, and dozens of demonstrators, journalists, and police officers were injured - a toll that continues to rise each night. Escalating repression The ruling party appears ready to adopt an intransigent stance, ignoring calls for new elections by protesters and pro-European President Salome Zurabishvili. The latter, who has openly broken with the government, has limited prerogatives but has declared her intention to remain in office until a president is elected by a 'legitimate' parliament. Recent scenes of repression provide a worrying glimpse into this situation. A prolonged crackdown threatens not only to further discredit the government on the international stage, but also to accelerate the country's democratic backsliding. The country is on the brink of political implosion, and the situation is only getting worse. The demonstrations could intensify and lead to political repression, distancing Georgia from its democratic values by failing to respect the opposition. It is now clear that the protest movement is not abating. In fact, it is growing in intensity. Faced with this pressure, the government may be tempted to step up repression. Without intervention from the international community, the crisis will be settled on the streets, with its share of violence and repression. The 'Authoritarian' status quo could continue If the protests eventually subside without major violence, the pro-Russian Georgian Dream party could maintain its grip on the institutions. The upcoming presidential election on December 14, which now consists of a parliamentary vote rather than a popular election, could mark a turning point. With the majority it enjoys, billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream should easily elect a pro-Russian president and consolidate its power. Unfortunately, President Zurabishvili will not have the means to oppose a government that firmly controls the presidency and parliament. The popular opposition would lack the leverage to influence the situation, especially if the EU and NATO remain passive. The situation could then resemble an authoritarian takeover. On December 1, the government again rejected any negotiations with the opposition, and Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze assured that there would be 'no revolution' in Georgia. New elections under international pressure Another possible outcome is international mediation. Following the adoption of the 'foreign influence' law last spring, Washington imposed financial sanctions and visa restrictions on dozens of Georgian officials and canceled joint military exercises. Brussels, for its part, suspended accession negotiations. Targeted sanctions against Georgian officials, such as those imposed on December 1 by Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia for 'human rights violations' during the current pro-EU demonstrations in Tbilisi, could prove decisive. Europe has important levers of influence at its disposal, notably in the form of visa requirements and funding for infrastructure vital to Georgia's economy and society. Increased international pressure could force Tbilisi to reverse its decision and hold elections under the supervision of a new electoral administration. However, such a scenario would require Georgian Dream to agree to limit its hold on institutions, which remains doubtful. A new revolution The current situation could also lead to a popular revolution similar to the Rose Revolution of 2003, which led to the ouster of President Eduard Shevardnadze, a former Soviet minister during Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika era. Protesters could draw inspiration from this peaceful popular movement against the autocratic excesses of the ruling power. On the other hand, a revolution similar to Maidan in Ukraine in 2014 seems less likely. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has drawn a parallel between the current situation in Georgia and the events of Maidan, which led to the overthrow of then pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. In the aftermath, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and provided military support to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. When the Russians invoke Maidan, it's to instill fear. They want to demonstrate that the pursuit of democracy inevitably leads to bloodshed and subsequent wars. Their message to the Georgians is clear: if you want democracy, be prepared to suffer the consequences. Finally, a Belarus-style scenario cannot be ruled out. As in the 'slipper revolution' of 2020, Georgia could slide into a brutal crackdown on peaceful protests: mass arrests, systematic violence, institutional lockdowns, and border controls. The Georgian authorities may be tempted to emulate the violent methods of Alexander Lukashenko's regime in order to avoid being overthrown. It is difficult to predict the outcome of the current situation. Georgia is at a crossroads where everything could tip over into a peaceful revolution or a cycle of violence. How determined and responsive the demonstrators and the authorities are will determine everything.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdfJVeDPSIdrL14x1bwtfM-	2024-12-05T17:25:38-08:00	
Emmanuel Macron’s Embarrassing Hour Of Reckoning – OpEd	By Peter Isackson and Atul Singh The political temperature in France has been rising for more than a decade. It has now reached boiling point. President Emmanuel Macron’s latest attempt to form a government compatible with his self-assured 'jupitérien' vision has produced, as many expected, a resounding failure. Macron’s many failures have been a recurring pattern since les gilets jaunes ('yellow vests') movement erupted in France starting the winter of 2018. Only the pandemic stopped the movement from weakening the president further. Now, all presidential authority has evaporated thanks to a full-blown constitutional crisis. What is going on? Many of our readers have been following the US elections and have not paid France as much attention. So, let us lay out the bare bones of France’s crisis. In June, Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement national (RN) emerged as the largest party in the French elections for the European Parliament. In response, Macron called a snap parliamentary election to break the far-right fever gripping the country. In the first round of parliamentary elections, RN got 33.21% of the votes, beating Nouveau Front populaire (NFP) and Ensemble, which got 28.21% and 21.28%, respectively. In the second round, the left coalition NFP and Macron’s centrist grouping Ensemble combined to push the far-right RN into third place. NFP unexpectedly ended up with 180 out of 577 seats in the National Assembly. Ensemble managed to come in second and retain 159 seats. RN increased its numbers to 142 seats but was no longer the leading party in parliament. In this hung parliament, no one party could form a government, and the French hosted the Paris Olympics whilst in political limbo. After the Olympic summer, Macron appointed Michel Barnier prime minister on September 5. This was a rather surprising choice. Les Républicains (The Republicans), the traditional center-right party, got 5.41% of the votes and won 39 seats. Barnier was not among those elected to the National Assembly. In fact, in the lead-up to the 2022 presidential election, Barnier ran as a primary candidate for his party but was eliminated in the first round, getting only 23.9% of the vote. Like almost all French politicians, Barnier graduated from one of France’s elitist grandes écoles, the highly selective institutions that train the crème de la crème of France. Though not a household name, he is a highly competent public servant who held many important positionsin Paris and Brussels. Like Macron, he is very much part of the French elite that governs the country and plays a big role in the EU. It is also now a highly discredited and increasingly despised elite. Barnier tried to pass a long overdue budget but met strong opposition in parliament. Eventually, he used an executive order, Article 49.3, to pass the budget on December 2. Two days later, France’s far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together to vote a no-confidence motion through. RN required a permanent consultative role in budget planning, increased spending in areas benefiting French citizens directly and opposed Barnie’s tax increases. Both RN and NFP opposed austerity measures, while NFP supported higher taxes on the wealthy. Their contrasting but complementary populist themes made inevitable their convergent choice to vote out Barnier. Now, France is about to enter 2025 with no government and no budget. Three points are of note after the no-confidence vote: As per the constitution, Barnier now has to resign. Macron cannot call yet another election until June because the constitution sets out a 12-month waiting period after a snap election. Macron is unlikely to find anyone acceptable to a majority of legislators in the National Assembly to succeed Barnier as prime minister. Barnier was trying to improve France’s fiscal position by cutting the deficit from 6.1% to 5.0% of the GDP. France is growing by barely 1.0% a year and its GDP is now 110% of the GDP. Therefore, Barnier proposed €40 billion ($42 billion) in spending cuts and €20 billion ($21 billion) in tax hikes. Neither the NFP nor the RN found Barnier’s proposals acceptable. His effort to push through this budget through an executive order, overriding democratic process, led to his fall. These are interesting times for France. Yesterday, the country experienced its first successful no-confidence vote since Georges Pompidou’s government fell in 1962. At that time, none other than Charles de Gaulle was president. He had inaugurated the Fifth Republic in 1958 and had immense political authority. Macron is literally and metaphorically a midget by comparison and his Sancho Panza Barnier has achieved the dubious distinction of becoming the shortest-serving prime minister in the Fifth Republic. In the past, French political parties went through protracted bouts of arm-wrestling to agree upon a budget. With the implosion of the traditional center-right and center-left parties and the drift to populist anti-establishment positions, France’s legislators are now unable to arrive at a compromise. Instead, they are engaging in a bruising brawl. Fists are flying and not only has Barnier been knocked down but also the French political system is on the floor. On Sunday, Le Monde published a long, detailed article full of fascinating quotes from diverse members of the political class, both friendly and unfriendly to Macron. It bore the title: 'Since the dissolution, the slow twilight of Emmanuel Macron.' Many are wondering whether he intends, in the words of Dylan Thomas, to 'go gentle into that good night' or 'rage, rage against the dying light.' This is not the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic that a president has felt endangered. Far more spectacular were the events in 1968 — celebrated in France as mai soixante-huit — when the world and the French population wondered whether they weren’t witnessing a second revolution à la 1789. Students armed with anti-authoritarian slogans such as 'It’s forbidden to forbid' or, more poetically, 'Sous les pavés, la plage' ('under the paving-stones the beach') dug up these very paving-stones and threw them at the riot police. An estimated 500,000 people took to the streets and de Gaulle fled the Élysée Palace. A year later, the grand old general resigned but the Fifth Republic survived. History is rhyming but not repeating itself The difference between then and now is twofold. First, de Gaulle had immense stature as the leader of the French Resistance during World War II. Even though the war hero secretly fled to West Germany during the most fraught days of the unrest, he still commanded authority in much of the country. Upon his return to France, de Gaulle gave a resounding speech and called for a snap election. About 800,000 supporters of various ages marched through Paris and Gaullists won 353 of 486 seats while the Socialist and Communists managed only 57 and 34 respectively. Second, France has now entered the brave new world where traditional politics of the left and right is dead and buried six feet under. In 1968, the Gaullists and the left offered two clear visions for France. Both had seasoned professionals and well-structured political parties. At the same time, there was a solid centrist bloc that could work with both sides of the political divide. Voters had a clear choice between the left and the right and, thanks to de Gaulle’s actions, the disorder of May became the new order of June. The crusty old general succeeded in saving the constitution because he literally embodied it. In 1958, he had created the Fifth Republic after the collapse of the postwar Fourth Republic. Yet when he called for a constitutional referendum a year later, de Gaulle lost and duly resigned. Pompidou, his Gaullist prime minister, took over and the Fifth Republic endured. Macron has consistently taken inspiration from de Gaulle. But to paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen in his 1988 vice-presidential debate with Dan Quayle, the appropriate response to the current president’s hubris would be: 'Manu, you are not le Grand Charles.' The essayist Alain Minc, quoted in the Le Monde article, offered the most credible explanation of Macron’s personality in a discussion he claims to have had with Nicolas Sarkozy. Apparently, Minc told Sarkozy, 'You’re egocentric. He [Macron] is a narcissist. Egocentrics need others. Narcissus is alone.' Note that a friend of the two authors who was a classmate of Macron at Sciences Po called Macron a pervers narcissique(pervert narcissist). Even though Macron managed to cobble together a disparate group of followers and call them a party — initially, La République en Marcheand later Renaissance — he has never succeeded. Monsieur Jupiter fails to understand that, by their very nature, political parties include a number of disparate interests who somehow combine to work together on multiple levels of policy and organization. All successful parties have some mechanism to make collective decisions. In 2018, Fox News reporter Chris Wallace asked Macron what he liked most about being president, Macron replied that he likes making decisions. Note not solving problems, not negotiating complex issues, not even governing. Making decisions. Macron then defended himself against the accusation of being authoritarian, arguing that being 'aware of all the consequences of your decisions and thinking that you have to stick to your decisions to deliver when it’s for the good of your country is not the same as being authoritarian or arrogant.' Some credit Macron for being a political genius but forget that he benefited from spectacular good fortune in 2017. The blocs on the left and the right had lost their sense of direction. They had failed to produce political personalities whom the French saw leaders. Then, Macron was a young unknown. He was a recent addition to the then president François Hollande’s administration. Mostly as a result of Hollande’s political amateurism, he rose from the technocratic ranks to become finance minister. In the past, this important post was usually reserved for political personalities. That honor ennobled Macron in the eyes of the public and at the same time inebriated him. Hollande’s performance as president weakened the Socialist Party and Macron cannily played the card of continuity while betraying the party of his benefactor. Elected in 2012, Hollande was the first president in the history of the Fifth Republic to visibly lack the force of personality and political muscle the French associate with the office of president. De Gaulle, François Mitterand and Jacques Chirac — each with his contrasting style — successfully embodied the image of Fifth Republic president. Sarkozy, despite his two discrediting epithets 'bling-bling' and 'Sarko l’Américain' (Sarko the American), thrived, at least for a while. He lived on his previously constructed image as a 'tough guy' when he was Chirac’s minister of the interior. Note that Sarkozy’s American reputation helped him initially. Even though the French constantly criticize Americans, they secretly admire everything American. This includes bling-bling and celebrity culture. Yet this appeal has its limits. Sarkozy ended up as a one-term wonder because they do not appreciate bling-bling in their leaders. Hence, the tough guy lost the 2012 election to Hollande, who had promised to be 'normal.' In 2017, Macron promised a chimeric return to a Gaullist past but the callow president lacked judgment, experience and substance. Macron survived a flurry of punches in the first seven years of his reign as jupitérien president for a very simple reason. His opponent in the final round of the 2017 and 2022 elections was the 'unrepublican' Marine Le Pen. The notion of 'republican' for the traditional political class has long been applied to anyone who fits into the traditional mold of a politician belonging to a party not too extreme to deserve banishment from polite company. Marine’s father, Jean-Marie, was the portrait of someone who was existentially unacceptable. It has long been noted that the unifier of the left, François Mitterand, was the first to exploit the idea of using Jean-Marie as the ideal foil to create havoc on the right. It was a successful strategy but it proved risky in the long run. When Jean-Marie became a spent force, his daughter Marine took center stage as a softer and subtler version of her father. It wasn’t exactly King Lear and Cordelia, and there was far less drama to it. But a dose of cultural conflict between the two gave Marine the credibility Jean-Marie never had. All this drama, from de Gaulle to Macron and Le Pen, has ended up producing the constitutional crisis playing out today. The founders of the Fifth Republic — de Gaulle and his cronies — crafted a document designed to avoid what is now unfolding before our eyes. They created a parliamentary system dominated by the spectre of presidential authority. The French presidency has a monarchic tinge to it because it was designed to prevent the instability that often afflicts parliamentary regimes of which we have seen two examples recently in Europe. Post-Brexit UK proved so unstable that Conservatives devoured their own prime ministers. In Germany, the traffic light coalition of Socialists, Liberals and Greens has just collapsed. Ironically, the Fifth Republic that set out to avoid parliamentary instability might itself be able to collapse. In some ways, the current situation is very French and a product of a political culture that developed as a result of the French Revolution in 1789. France has been politically unstable since that fateful day when a group of rebellious citizens stormed the Bastille. Unlike the US with its quasi-religious faith in its 1787 constitution that many still see as sacred writ, France has been through several successive constitutions. Each time, the French rewrote the basic rules of the state. France has experienced the First Republic, the First Empire, the Restoration, the liberal monarchy, the Second Republic, the Second Empire, the Third Republic, the Vichy regime, the Fourth Republic and then the Fifth Republic. Hence, the French do not see the Fifth Republic as magical, mystical, spiritual or even literary. To their eyes, it does not deserve immortality. The traditional political establishment, and Macron above all, disagree. The rise and fall of Macron and the Fifth Republic As noted above, the Fifth Republic was a stable two-bloc system for decades. However, the last 16 years destabilized the reigning equilibrium. Like many other first world countries, France was unable to deal with the 2007-08 global financial crisis. Sarkozy, 'l’Américain,' elected in 2007, as the global crisis was developing, took the right in an Atlanticist direction, alienating the proud nationalists who had inherited de Gaulle’s stubborn embrace of national autonomy and resistance to the US. Hollande, inspired by the examples of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, succeeded Sarkozy and dreamt — in the age of high tech and Silicon Valley prestige — of running a rational, technocratic regime. He failed to serve the middle or working classes and his party came to be perceived as champagne or caviar socialists. Clinton and Blair’s Third Way tried to reconcile centre-right and centre-left politics by synthesizing economically liberal and socially democratic policies but ended up leaving the working class behind. The British Labour Party has only returned to power this year after 14 years of political wilderness. In the US, Democrats under Kamala Harris have just been defeated roundly by Donald Trump. Her defeat is much worse than Hillary Clinton’s who had the consolation of winning the popular vote. By 2016, Hollande’s champagne socialism had made him unpopular with voters. Unlike Sarkozy, he did not stand for reelection. In the ensuing primary, Benoît Hamon triumphed. He was the most traditionally working class but, by now, Hollande’s Socialist Party was dominated by centrists. They rallied behind Macron who emerged as a third party candidate. At that time, most people did not give Macron much of a chance. François Fillon, a former prime minister, was the frontrunner who was expected to waltz to victory. He possessed all the traits of a traditional leader. He was the establishment figure of the center-right but an embezzlement scandal involving his wife torpedoed his prospects. This miraculous break in the clouds allowed Macron to emerge as a fresh young face promising a break from the past. Hamon and Fillon fell by the wayside and Macron and Le Pen squared off for the second round of the 2017 presidential election. Her party’s sulfurous, unrepublican reputation paved the way for Macron’s victory. In 2022, he again won because his opponent was Le Pen and because the Covid pandemic gave him a break from les gilets jaunes. In the snap elections this year, his party only came third. The voters have sent him a clear message: 'You may be president for another three years, but we no longer trust you to govern.' As stated earlier, Macron managed to win two elections but he has failed to create a real political party. It has no truly political or even ideological identity. Ensemble is little more than a coterie of lukewarm loyalists bound for the advancement of their political careers to a talented but narcissistic leader. This leader has chosen technocrats with no political stature as his prime ministers. Édouard Philippe, Jean Castex, Élisabeth Borne, Gabriel Attal and now Barnier are not exactly household names in France. Macron clings to the fantasy that the weaker his prime ministers the stronger he will be, which has clearly backfired and led to an eminently avoidable crisis. The constitution obliges Macron to find a new prime minister. The next elections cannot be held until July. Yet there is no personality on the left or in the center with enough authority to who can win the confidence even of a ragtag majority in a fragmented parliament. The urgent issue today, a day after the vote of no confidence, is to confirm a budget for 2025. But with no government to push a budget through, uncertainty reigns. With Trump waiting in the wings to take charge of the West Wing, uncertainty will only amplify. He is threatening 10-20% tariffs on European imports. So, France faces a risk of lower export earnings from the US market. It along with other European countries also faces the added risk of Chinese dumping because the Trump administration is planning to hit China with massive tariffs. The Russia-Ukraine War and the Middle East also cast a dark shadow on France. With no budget yet in either France or Germany, Europe can no longer back Ukraine. In any case, Trump has clearly signaled that he will be following a very different policy to Joe Biden in Ukraine. After tying himself closely to Biden, Macron will have to sing a different tune. Lebanon and Syria are former French colonies. They are in trouble and could end up in bigger trouble soon. This will cause Macron headaches. In a nutshell though, the lack of a government and a budget poses grave risks for the economy. Fair Observer’s Editor-at-Large Alex Gloy points out that yields on French ten-year bonds have surpassed those on their Greek counterparts and the country’s credit rating could be downgraded soon. Bankruptcies have been soaring and the French stock market performance has severely lagged those of other countries. Since the peak in 2007, the French stock market index CAC-40 is up a mere 18% while the German Dax has increased by 148% and the US S&P 500 by 286%. Furthermore, like Germany, France has been hit hard by soaring energy prices, high inflation and rising interest rates after the Russia-Ukraine War started in February 2022. There is no political consensus as to how to pay for current and future spending. Like many times in the past, France is now in a full-blown political and economic crisis. Macron’s jupitérien reign is ending in an unmitigated disaster and the Fifth Republic might not survive for too long.

Ukraine Military Situation: Russian Military Continues To Press O...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. The United States Will Equip Ukraine with Antipersonnel Land Mines The Biden administration has decided to send a $725 million military assistance package to Ukraine. This presidential drawdown authority package will include anti-drone systems, 105mm- and 155mm-class artillery rounds, anti-tank systems, interceptors for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), rockets for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), nonpersistent antipersonnel land mines, and other assets to help Ukraine sustain the fight. The land mine package will likely include 155mm area denial artillery munitions (ADAMs), Modular Pack Mine Systems (MOPMS), and M136 Volcano vehicle-launched scatterable mine systems. These weapons will allow Ukrainian combat formations to rapidly deploy land mines across sizable contested areas. This will significantly enhance their defensive capabilities and deter Russian offensives. Open-source intelligence suggests that mines have played a significant role in helping the Ukrainian military fend off Russian assaults. Given the infantry-centric character of the war and the favorable force-on-force and force-to-terrain ratios that Russia enjoys, antipersonnel mines could give Kyiv an additional lethal capability. The possibility that North Korea could combat deploy additional troops to Russia, discussed during Russian Minister of Defense Andrei Belousov’s recent visit to Pyongyang, renders Ukraine’s need for antipersonnel mines even more urgent. 2. The Ukrainian Drone Program Sets Ambitious Goals for 2025 Ukraine’s progress in robotic systems continues to provide hope for Kyiv and lessons in emerging and disruptive technologies for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In an interview with Reuters, Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, indicated that Ukraine plans to boost its production of unmanned ground vehicles in 2025 to augment its land warfare capabilities. This year Ukrainian defense companies have produced around 1.3 million drones, mainly of the first-person-view (FPV) variety. Fedorov indicated to Reuters that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has set a production goal of 30,000 strategic deep-strike drones to hit targets deep inside Russia. Fedorov also stated that the Ukrainian military will start to field autonomous drones with high-end artificial intelligence features next year. Fedorov’s remarks came as both Ukraine and Russia intensified their tactical drone warfare efforts. Recently, both belligerents have increased their use of FPV drones connected to fiber-optic cables to defeat electronic warfarecountermeasures. These systems’ apparent success will likely prompt both Kyiv and Moscow to manufacture more of them in the coming months. Drone-on-drone warfare has also been on the rise as Ukrainian FPVs target some of Russia’s most important robotic assets, including its Lancet kamikaze drones. Should Ukraine field larger quantities of autonomous solutions, as Fedorov suggested it will, drone-on-drone engagements could rise considerably in 2025. 3. Battlefield Assessment Following Russia’s capture of the Ukrainian city of Vuhledar, the Kremlin has focused its offensive maneuver warfare efforts on the town of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian defenses in the area, often enveloped and flanked by Russian units, have struggled to hold territory. The Russian military has also been squeezing the logistics routes to the town for some time, depriving Ukrainian troops of key supplies. Kurakhove has also seen rapid Russian advances, and Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold the line. While Ukraine’s 71st Brigade has been spotted using drone warfare assets to disrupt an armored column there, tactical achievements like this may not be sufficient to prevent the town’s fall. While the Russian offensive made incremental territorial gains near Pokrovsk, the Ukrainian military made progress at the tactical level in Chasiv Yar. Ukraine has also defended the area around the Oskil River near Kupiansk to prevent Russian forces from conducting river-crossing operations there. In the Russian region of Kursk, the Kremlin’s forces have been on an offensive footing for months. As a result, Ukraine has lost roughly 40 percent of the territory it secured at the outset of its raid into Russia. In contrast to the small, infantry-based clashes that have characterized other fronts, Russian forces in Kursk have centered their operations around mechanized warfare. This strategy has saddled Russia’s heavy armor with mounting losses from Ukrainian artillery systems, mines, and drones. The Russian military also continued to launch large volumes of Iranian Shahed drones at Ukraine’s population centers and energy infrastructure, as it has in previous winters. Ukraine will need more robust air defenses to weather these assaults in the freezing months ahead.

The Philosophy Of Provisionality – OpEd	Everything we do as humans is provisional. Because of time’s eroding power, everything is revisable. There is a reason for the word ‘decision’ being a part of our language. Not accidentally, the term derives from the Latin for ‘cut;’ in other words, when we decide something, we make a volitional ‘cut’ of sorts in the sequence of events, or in the reasoning concerning such events, that precede the decision – a concrete reminder that human beings are not equipped with an algorithmic device that enables them to know with absolute certainty what course of action to pursue. Every decision, therefore, represents an acknowledgment that we have to act with incomplete, provisional knowledge, and by implication, that more information and more comprehension could lead to a different decision. Philosophers have known this for centuries, even if their philosophies sometimes give the opposite impression. Nietzsche – who was himself a thinker of provisionality, as evinced in his exhortation, to overcome the ‘spirit of revenge’ against time’s irreversible passage – did Socrates an injustice when he used his name as shorthand for the excessive rationalism of Western culture. Rather than ‘Socratism,’ he should have used the term ‘Platonism,’ provided he meant the reception of Plato’s work, and not the Greek master’s work ‘itself’ – even if, unavoidably, the latter is ‘itself’ only available to us after centuries of translations. After all, anyone who has read Plato’s texts carefully – even in translation – and not only through the eyes of his countless commentators, soon recognises the distance that separates what may be called the two ‘faces’ of Plato. There is the metaphysical, idealist Plato, and there is the ‘poetically reflective’ Plato whose writings (perhaps unexpectedly) reveal what one might call his nuanced awareness of the ineradicable provisionality of even the ostensibly strictest distinctions. It is difficult to say which one of these has given rise to a never-ending series of ‘footnotes’ among Western philosophers since his time, according to Alfred N. Whitehead, who noted of Plato’s writings that the ‘wealth of general ideas scattered through them’ comprise a ‘an inexhaustible mine of suggestion,’ but I would opt for the second one. In the Phaedrus Plato shows that he knew, for instance, that a 'pharmakon' is both poison and remedy, that language is simultaneously a rhetorical instrument of persuasion and the arena where struggles for truth are enacted; both the soil where poetic powers germinate and metaphysical armour for the protection of mortal bodies. Poets and dithyrambic music do not belong in the ideal republic, according to him, but paradoxically the poet in Plato is harnessed for the sensorily evocative linguistic embodiment of the epistemic inferiority of the senses, as the myth of the cave in the Republic demonstrates, accompanied by his simultaneous claim that the truth represented by the sun shining outside the cave transcends the perspectival limitations of the senses. Do these paradoxes not reflect Plato’s awareness of the provisionality of his metaphysical bulwark against human uncertainty and finitude, embodied in the supratemporal, archetypal Forms, in which all existing things participate, however imperfectly? The clearest indication that Plato knew about the ineradicably provisional status of human life lies in his depiction of his teacher, Socrates, who did not write anything himself, as the archetypal philosopher of provisionality – unambiguously captured in Socrates’s famous ‘docta ignorantia’ (learned ignorance), that the only thing humans know with certainty is ‘how little they know.’ Despite these signs in Plato’s work, that he was quite conscious of the limitations to human knowledge (further demonstrated in his notion of the paradoxical, errant causality of the Khôra in his Timaeus, which simultaneously is and is not in space), what the philosophical tradition has sought to emphasise is Plato’s own strenuous attempt, in his metaphysical doctrine of the archetypal Forms, to provide supra-sensible protection against the inescapable erosion of human knowledge by time – for this is what is ultimately indexed in an awareness of provisionality. These considerations – which could be extended significantly – make a mockery of the idea that there is a fail-safe research methodology (with its accompanying methods), that would guarantee the time-resistant validity of human knowledge, instead of acknowledging that, despite our very best efforts at securing precise, unassailable knowledge, it is nonetheless always already infected with the eroding germ of time. This is the sobering insight gained from one of Jacques Derrida’s most exemplary poststructuralist essays in Writing and Difference, namely ‘Structure, sign and play in the discourse of the human sciences,’ where (following Claude Lévi-Strauss) he distinguishes between the image of the ‘bricoleur’ (tinkerer, handyman, Jack-of-all-trades) and the ‘engineer.’ The former avails him – or herself of any tool or material at hand to construct or ‘fix’ things in order to restore them to working condition, while the engineer insists on fail-safe instruments and working materials to guarantee exactitude of measurement and time-resistant functioning of the products of their design and work. Needless to stress, these two types function as metaphors for distinct ways of approaching the world around us – some people think like the ‘engineer;’ others like the ‘bricoleur.’ Contrary to the standard reading of this essay by Derrida (where this is but one of the stages of his complex argument), which erroneously attributes to him a kind of postmodernist privileging of the bricoleur over the engineer, he states explicitly that humans are in no position to choose between these two paradigmatic figures of knowledge – inescapably we have to choose both. What does this mean? Simply that while we have the epistemic duty to emulate the engineer, we also have to face the sobering thought that, our best efforts at constructing unassailable knowledge notwithstanding, our knowledge systems – even in its most ‘tried and tested’ form, namely the sciences – cannot evade the ruinous effects of time, or history. This is amply demonstrated with regard to the history of physics in Thomas Kuhn’sThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), although Kuhn’s thesis, articulated in the book, has many rationalistic detractors, who cannot bear the thought of science being equally subject to temporal constraints as any other form of human knowledge. Such champions of epistemic absolutism need only remind themselves of the exemplarily Socratic admission of the leader of one of the two teams at CERN’s Giant Hadron Collider that worked on the attempt to confirm the ‘existence’ of the ‘Higgs boson’ (or so-called ‘God-particle’) – an Italian woman physicist named Fabiola Gianotti – that the confirmation of its ‘probable’ existence, far from representing the summation of ‘complete’ knowledge in the realm of physics, merely means that the work of understanding the physical universe is only beginning. Socrates all over again, and from a natural scientist. How is this possible? What she was referring to is the fact that physicists now face the daunting prospect of probing the nature of dark energy and dark matter which, they claim, together comprise the largest part of the physical universe, and of which physics knows hardly anything except its percentile extent. And who knows how many revisions will be made regarding the ‘standard model’ of physics in the course of unravelling the structure, nature, and functioning of these two ‘dark’ entities – if they can be called ‘entities’ at all? Another confirmation of the provisionality of human knowledge. This, incidentally, is also related to Jacques Lacan’s notorious (but understandable) claim that the structure of human knowledge is ‘paranoiac,’ by which he evidently meant that we are deluded into believing that human knowledge systems are far more enduringly unassailable than they actually are – a Lacanian claim that resonates with the insights of the redoubtable English novelist, John Fowles, in his novel, The Magus. Returning to Plato’s oft-ignored wisdom concerning provisionality, it is not difficult to establish a connection between him and Lacan, who was a very thorough reader of Plato, for instance of the latter’s Symposium – perhaps the most important of his dialogues on love. Just as Plato shows with admirable insight that, what makes one into a lover – and indirectly also a philosopher – is the fact that the beloved, insofar as she or he remains a beloved, instead of a possessed, always has to be ‘just out of reach’ of the lover. We are lovers, or philosophers, to the extent that we ‘desire’ our beloved, or in the case of the philosopher (and the same goes for the scientist), knowledge, neither of which we could ever totally ‘possess.’ What this suggests, of course, is that the lover or philosopher never quite reaches fulfillment of their desire – should you ‘attain’ the desired beloved, or knowledge, your desire would evaporate, because there would be no need for it any longer. Desire is a function of absence or lack. This makes a lot of sense – provisionally, at least. If human beings were to be able, at last – which, by and large, they are not – to accept and embrace their own finitude and temporality, they would realise that all things human in the domain of culture and the arts, science, and even philosophy, are provisional, in the strict sense of being subject to revision, ‘correction,’ modification, or amplification. Many of the difficulties faced by people in the world today derive from their futile, hubristic attempt, to be ‘engineers’ in the sense of perfecting knowledge through science and technology, ignoring Derrida’s counsel, that we are also, finally, mere bricoleurs, or tinkerers, jacks of all trades. Hardly ever before in human history has the futility of believing that one can overcome the ineluctable limitations on human endeavours been more amply demonstrated than during the past five years. What the international cabal of neo-fascists at the World Economic Forum (a misnomer if ever there was one) had regarded as a foregone conclusion, namely, to ‘condition’ people into accepting the proto-totalitarian regime they tried to impose through Covid lockdowns, social distancing, masking, and eventually by mandating, as far as possible, the deadly Covid pseudo-vaccines, has turned out, in retrospect, to have been merely provisional. This is no reason for complacency on our part, however, as most of the awake tribe know. Their implicit belief in their quasi-divine powers guarantees that they will try again.

Central Asia Is Partnering With The World On Its Own Terms – Anal...	By Mehmet Fatih Oztarsu In 2024, Central Asia emerged as a key player on the global stage. Central Asia has become a battleground for intensifying competition, particularly between Russia and China. As 2025 approaches, the Central Asian republics are increasingly focusing on economic diversification, sustainable partnerships and policies that uphold national autonomy while benefiting from foreign investment and cooperation. Central Asia has evolved from being a mere arena for the power plays of other nations to a region that asserts its autonomy. As the region emerges as a middle power, Central Asian republics have made substantial contributions to global affairs, particularly in the realms of energy, transportation and conflict mediation. The region has established robust partnerships, gaining influence in the critical minerals sector. The developments of 2024 will continue with increasing intensity and shape bilateral and multilateral relations in 2025. This year witnessed Russia and China intensify their engagement towards Central Asia. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan in 2024. As expected, these high-level meetings emphasised the importance of maintaining strong ties and seeking solutions to international sanctions on Russia. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visits to Kazakhstan and Tajikistan signalled that China’s influence in the region remains robust. Xi Jinping called on Shanghai Cooperation Organisation member states to protect the ‘Shanghai Spirit’ against all threats. During the year, numerous countries sought to strengthen their ties with the Central Asian republics, particularly in the areas of critical minerals and the Middle Corridor. The European Union is seeking to prevent Central Asia from falling under China’s financial influence. In addition to the EU Global Gateway project, periodic meetings are being held to establish an integrated connectivity system linking Central Asia to the West. The United States is also intensively focusing on Central Asia’s critical minerals to reduce the region’s dependence on China. The United Kingdom and Germany have developed a new Central Asia policy, particularly in light of the Russia–Ukraine war and growing concerns about China’s influence in the region. Then UK foreign secretary David Cameron’s extensive April 2024 visit heralded the start of a ‘new era’. During his visit, agreements were made to enhance cooperation in energy, economy and education, alongside plans for a ‘5+1 platform’. The UK government also released Countries at Crossroads: UK Engagement in Central Asia, which stated that relations would be shaped strategically to counter competition from Russia and China. For the UK, Central Asia must be safeguarded against the threats posed by Russia and China. Regional states are opposed to this paternalistic approach. In September 2024, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited the region for the second Germany– Central Asia Summit. Similar to the United Kingdom, the German government characterised the visit as ‘breathing new life into relations’. Scholz emphasised that the Russia–Ukraine war has created a new geopolitical reality and highlighted the increasing importance of Central Asia. Two key outcomes emerged from this visit — the support of the Central Asian states for the Global Gateway project through Germany and the potential for Germany to deport Afghan criminals to Afghanistan via Uzbekistan. Despite these positive developments, Germany’s stance toward the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and its critical view of the Central Asian republics’ relations with the Taliban continue to pose challenges. The June 2024 visit of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol carried a different significance compared to the visits of European leaders. Embracing a traditional and robust policy framework for Central Asia, South Korea has deepened its relations in the region through the ‘K-Silk Road Initiative’ announced by President Yoon. South Korea has avoided rhetoric that could escalate tensions and has instead adopted a win-win approach, focusing on partnership-based resource diplomacy, a move welcomed by Central Asia. Turkiye, another country that places great importance on the region, has taken a historic step by adopting the Common Turkic Alphabet. Engaging in substantial efforts within the Organization of Turkic States, the country continues to pursue closer cooperation with the Central Asian republics, sharing deep historical and cultural ties. By moving away from the Cyrillic alphabet to a common Latin script for Turkic languages, they aim to enhance communication between Turkic states. Additionally, Turkiye has mandated the use of the term ‘Turkistan’ instead of ‘Central Asia’ in school curricula. Central Asia will play an increasingly important role in the international arena, influenced by China’s expanding economic presence, Russia’s geopolitical initiatives and key projects like the Middle Corridor which are essential for regional connectivity and the critical minerals sector. But the European Union’s influence may be affected by its pattern of periodic engagement and disengagement in the region. This inconsistent approach could limit its ability to build sustained partnerships and maintain influence, especially compared to consistently involved players like China and Turkiye. Central Asian republics are expected to attach importance to multilateral relations and organisational formations under the ‘C5+’ format. Within this concept, relations with all countries of the world will be developed and new organisational initiatives will emerge. The region is no longer the backyard of any single superpower. In this era, where the goal is mutually beneficial partnerships among equals, Western countries are expected to contribute to projects as reliable partners rather than taking on a ‘protective’ role. Criticising Central Asian states or pressuring them to change policies on sensitive issues like Afghanistan without considering regional realities is unlikely to be received positively. Efforts to diminish Russian and Chinese influence are also unlikely to yield the desired results as they are viewed by the Central Asian republics as short-term political manoeuvres lacking a foundation of trust.

Trump Takes Aim At BRICS (And The Global Economy) – OpEd	Donald Trump, a man who never shied from bold declarations, has once again turned the global stage into a theater of economic brinkmanship. His target: the BRICS coalition, a bloc of emerging powers that includes China, Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa (and now Iran, the UAE, Ethiopia, and Egypt as well). With more than 30 countries showing interest, BRICS is steadily challenging the traditional economic order. Trump, in his signature style, announced on Truth Social that BRICS nations could face 100 percent tariffs should they dare to establish a unified currency or undermine the U.S. dollar. 'The idea that BRICS countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER,' he declared, a warning laced with the defiance that defined his presidency. Such rhetoric, pointed and pugnacious, reveals the deep unease in Washington as this coalition’s economic clout grows. Although the notion of a BRICS currency is tantalizing, it faces formidable obstacles: economic disparities, political tensions, and the challenge of aligning diverse national interests. Yet, the use by BRICS of alternative financial systems to sidestep Western sanctions—particularly for Russia and Iran—signals a shift that could chip away at the dollar’s dominance. Trump’s ultimatum underscores the stakes, but its efficacy remains uncertain. Will it herald a decisive policy shift or is it just more bluster? One thing is clear: the world watches as the economic landscape shifts, with the United States standing at a crossroads between strength and isolation. The consequences of this clash could echo for years to come. Donald Trump is back to wielding the blunt instrument of economic coercion, and this time, it’s aimed squarely at BRICS. His threat to levy 100% tariffs against BRICS member if they pursue a unified currency or seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar comes just days after he proposed steep tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China to take effect on his first day in office. He has billed his threats against neighboring countries as an answer to the 'crime and drugs' crossing the border and a bid to curb illegal immigration. Trump’s ultimatum to both the BRICS and key trading partners fits a pattern: the economic ultimatum as a tool of power, wielded with a blend of bravado and nationalism. Critics predict a backlash—higher prices for consumers, strained trade deals, and possible rifts with long-standing allies. Yet Trump remains undeterred, believing that aggressive moves, draped in populist rhetoric, are the antidote to the perceived erosion of American sovereignty. Whether this strategy will be a defining moment or a prelude to deeper economic strife is the question of the hour. Trump’s approach, a blend of coercion and protectionist fervor, echoes the 'America First' mantra that propelled him to office. Yet beneath the bombast lies a complex economic calculus with potentially far-reaching consequences. The National Retail Federation (NRF) recently painted a stark picture of the fallout: American consumers could lose $78 billion in annual purchasing power. The implications of such a shift are anything but abstract. Everyday essentials—clothing, toys, appliances, even suitcases for a long-overdue vacation—would become more expensive, a burden felt in the pockets of nearly all consumers. Tariffs, as any economist will tell you, are not impenetrable barriers but shifting weights. Although importers may initially bear the brunt, these costs are rarely kept within the corporate realm. They inevitably cascade down, manifesting as higher prices at the cash register. Experts also warn that retaliatory measures could hurt industries far beyond those Trump claims to defend, leaving American workers more vulnerable. Trump’s claim that tariffs target foreign exporters overlooks the nuanced reality of global trade. Some manufacturers might absorb the costs or shift production to avoid tariffs, but many importers, caught in the middle, pass on these expenses to consumers. For all of Trump’s talk of economic toughness, American consumers, once again, may find themselves at the center of the storm. Tariffs, as Donald Trump well knows, deliver a message—defiance, recalibration—but they are blunt instruments, echoing the populist call for fairness at a steep cost. These tariff policies obscure deeper issues at home. The decline of U.S. manufacturing stems not just from foreign competition but from decades of neglect: an inability to modernize the workforce and respond to global changes. Blaming external forces may score points but solves nothing. The decline of U.S. manufacturing reflects a failure to invest in workforce training, innovation, and adaptability in a world that grows ever more interconnected. While blaming external forces might yield short-term political gains, it falls short of meaningful reform. To rebuild its manufacturing base, the United States must move away from such shortsighted maneuvers and embrace strategies focused on genuine, long-term renewal.

Regime Change In Iran Key To Solving Middle East Crisis – OpEd	A recent conference organized by the French Parliamentary Committee for a Democratic Iran discussed the role of Iran’s ruling religious fascism as the epicenter of the Middle East crisis and a threat to regional peace. Conference speakers described the Iranian Resistance’s solution as the key to achieving peace and stability in the region. André Chassaigne, French MP and President of the GDR group in the French National Assembly and chairman of the conference, warned how the Iranian regime, through its destabilizing actions, has become one of the greatest threats to Middle Eastern peace and global security, including Europe’s security. He urged France to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization and impose stricter sanctions. Philippe Gosselin, vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, stressed that the Iranian regime not only brutally suppresses its people but also fuels regional instability by financing militias and promoting extremist ideologies. 'This regime’s repression and destabilizing actions are incompatible with regional and global peace,' he said. Gosselin said that massive public protests and organized resistance activities in Iran indicate the deep desire of the people for justice, freedom, and democracy. 'Thousands of Resistance Units are spreading the culture of revolt, proving that the Iranian people refuse to accept this theocracy,' he said. Jean-François Legaret, President of the Middle East Studies Foundation (FEMO) and former Mayor of Paris 1st arrondissement, called the overthrow of the regime by the people and organized resistance the key to opening up Iran and the region. He highlighted that across Iran, PMOI Resistance Units are being formed by young people, and the regime, due to the breadth and penetration of these networks in Iranian cities and provinces, cannot eliminate them. 'The regime is weakened and decaying, but it fears not foreign interventions—it fears the Iranian people’s uprising and the establishment of a republican Iran,' he said. Jean-Pierre Brard, former French MP and member of the Parliamentary Committee for a Democratic Iran, highlighted the Iranian people’s disdain for both monarchy and clerical rule and opportunistic profiteers who have not paid any price in the struggle. 'Let us not be naive. Some behind the scenes are working for an alternative that would merely replace one tyranny with another,' he said and reiterated his support for the Ten-Point Plan of Maryam Rajavi, which symbolizes the desires of the struggles of the Iranian people for freedom and democracy. During her speech at the conference, Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), said, ' I stand before you today to affirm that it is possible to put an end to the mullahs’ terrorism and warmongering. The solution lies in the overthrow of this regime by the Iranian people and their Resistance. This goal is within reach.' Mrs. Rajavi added, 'On five occasions over the past 15 years, the majority of French parliamentarians have expressed their support for the Iranian Resistance. 'Alongside thousands of other parliamentarians worldwide, they have emphasized that disregarding the Resistance constitutes a significant political blunder. Yet, unlike the elected representatives of the European people, official policies have taken a different path. 'Regrettably, granting impunity to this regime of execution and massacre has resulted in approximately 850 executions in Iran since the beginning of the year.' Mrs. Rajavi stressed that the NCRI, which is the longest-standing Iranian opposition coalition, does not seek to seize power but rather to restore it to its rightful owners: the people of Iran. Its platform lays out a clear path to establish a Constituent Assembly, conduct a referendum for the constitution of a republic and transfer the power to the people through free and fair elections. 'With a viable alternative present, there will be no room for chaos. Millions of Iranians living abroad will return to Iran, bringing their expertise and resources to contribute to the nation’s reconstruction,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdfJVeDPSIdrDFdhqVCIq6J	2024-12-05T17:12:35-08:00	
Cavosuglu: Armenia Should Respond Positively To Azerbaijan’s Prop...	Former Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu believes Armenia should respond positively to Azerbaijan's proposals for peace in the region., Azerbaijani media report. Cavosuglu made the remarks in his speech at an Azerbaijan-hosted conference on the 'right' to return of Azerbaijanis to Armenia. 'We could turn the South Caucasus into the region of peace,' said the former Foreign Minister who is currently a member of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. In the Second Karabakh War launched by Azerbaijan, the Turkish armed forces supported Azerbaijan militarily, also by transferring terrorist mercenaries from Libya and Syria to fight against Karabakh. In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched another offensive, forcibly displacing the entire indigenous Armenian population of Karabakh, having starved the population for months before that. In a recent report, Freedom House and partners found that Azerbaijani authorities waged a deliberate campaign to empty Nagorno-Karabakh of its ethnic Armenian population.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdfJVeDPSIdrGogoS9DTmbc	2024-12-05T17:09:36-08:00	
Uzbekistan Signs Agreements On Nuclear Cooperation	As a one-day international conference on nuclear energy takes place, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev announced that the country is to work with the International Atomic Energy Agency to expand cooperation on nuclear energy development. Uzbekistan's national atomic agency Uzatom and World Nuclear Association have signed a memorandum of understanding to promote bilateral cooperation. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi and Mirziyoyev met ahead of the one-day Prospects for the Use of Nuclear Energy for Peaceful Purposes in Sustainable Development of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Member States conference on 5 December in Samarkand. Uzbekistan has been a member of the IAEA for 30 years and has implemented more than 40 joint projects with the agency's technical assistance. Five such projects are currently under way, according to a statement from the Uzbek presidency. Priorities for cooperation noted during the meeting included improving competence and potential of national agencies, preparing high-skilled personnel, and prospective projects in nuclear energy, agriculture, water use, healthcare and ecology in the framework of IAEA programmes, culminating in an agreement on adopting a joint roadmap on 'expanding multidimensional cooperation in peaceful atom development', the presidency said. According to World Nuclear Association information, Uzbekistan - which has considerable mineral deposits - is the world’s fifth-ranking uranium supplier. The country's generation is dominated by natural gas, which accounted for some 88% of its generation mix in 2021, and it also imports electricity from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Demand is expected to double by 2030. Uzbekistan signed an agreement with Russia for the construction of two large-scale VVER pressurised water reactors in 2017, but infrastructure work has recently begun for the construction of a six-unit small modular reactor nuclear power plant to be built in the Jizzakh region, based on the 55 MW RITM-200N pressurised water reactor. This would be the first export order for the Russian design: the first land-based version is currently being built in Yakutia in Russia's Arctic North. Rosatom Director General Alexei Likhachev said earlier this year in a TV interview that proposals for building a large nuclear power plant of around 2.5 GW in Uzbekistan still stand. In an address to the conference, Mirziyoyev said ensuring reliable, safe, cost-effective and ecologically friendly energy sources was one of the top priorities in the large-scale reforms carried out in 'New Uzbekistan'. 'We have established a National Agency to strengthen the regulatory and legal framework in this sector, adopted a Law on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy, a long-term Concept of Nuclear Power Development, and a strategy aimed at strengthening human resources in the field. We have introduced a system of training highly skilled specialists for the industry,' he said. 'There is no doubt that the introduction of advanced nuclear power technologies will give a powerful impetus to the development of our country, create opportunities for new scientific and technical developments, and transitioning to an innovative economy.' Bilateral cooperation The Memorandum of Understanding between Uzatom and World Nuclear Association signed during the conference sets out a range of activities in which cooperation may be pursued, including exchanging nuclear-related information, collaborating to bring together key decision-makers of countries developing nuclear energy, and raising awareness of each other's activities and objectives, among other things. Uzatom's mission is to develop and implement state policies for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Uzbekistan, including constructing and operating nuclear power facilities, advancing atomic science, ensuring safety, and promoting non-proliferation. World Nuclear Association is an international organisation representing the global nuclear industry, covering enterprises working throughout the entire nuclear fuel cycle in all continents.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdfJVeDPSIdrLzYoWJ9HXPv	2024-12-05T17:03:42-08:00	
Long-Term Investment Is Essential To Addressing Protracted Food C...	By Emilie Chazelle and Alain Leroy Food systems are critical for building peace, resilience and food security. However, in contexts affected by conflict, food systems face formidable challenges, including the disruption of agricultural production due to violence, the displacement of farmers, and collateral or deliberate damage to farmland and essential infrastructure such as roads, markets and storage facilities. The combination of risks linked to political instability and conflict, weak governance, economic instability, limited local capacity, exposure to shocks and climate hazards, and poor infrastructure often undermines and deters long-term private and public investment in food systems in the very places where they are most needed. On average, only 3 per cent of official development assistance goes to food-related sectors in fragile settings, compared with 32 per cent of humanitarian assistance. This reflects the widespread perception that food is predominantly a humanitarian issue, even in contexts of protracted fragility. According to the Food Systems Dashboard, food systems comprise ‘all the people, institutions, places, and activities that play a part in growing, processing, transporting, selling, marketing, and, ultimately, eating food’ and are ‘critical for ensuring food and nutrition security, people’s livelihoods, and environmental sustainability’. To reduce food crises sustainably, aid actors across the humanitarian, development and peace (HDP) nexus must identify new ways of addressing the risks associated with food systems in fragile settings, through their programming and investments. Recent examples from Yemen, the Sahel and the Horn of Africa show that, with the right approach, substantial progress can be made in some of the most challenging and fragile contexts. Inclusive partnerships are crucial to ensure sustained improvements In fragile settings, partnerships between government, international aid actors and local civil society organizations across the HDP nexus can foster trust and cooperation. Nurturing inclusive and equitable partnerships is a prerequisite for developing food systems that are resilient to shocks and stressors. In Yemen, the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement facilitated multistakeholder dialogues on food systems and nutrition, resulting in a nationwide Multisectoral Nutrition Action Plan. The dialogues took place across conflict lines, involving stakeholders from areas controlled by the Presidential Leadership Council and areas controlled by the Houthi, along with the United Nations, non-governmental organizations, civil society and donors. As this uniquely inclusive process focused on a technical issue—food systems and nutrition—it helped to bridge the political divide between fragmented national institutions by building on pre-conflict technical networks and promoting a shared understanding of nutrition issues across Yemen. Affected communities must be at the heart of decision making Investing in food systems requires a deep understanding of local power dynamics as well as strategies and capacities to respond to food crises in fragile contexts. This is essential to learning from and building on the sustainable and equitable elements of local food systems while ensuring that investments contribute to addressing drivers of food insecurity, such as conflict. Over the past decade, the World Food Programme (WFP) Integrated Resilience Programme in the Sahel has been implemented within territorial units that are defined based on socio-economic and agro-ecological dimensions rather than humanitarian need assessments alone. The rehabilitation of natural assets and preservation of natural resources have been valuable entry points for the programme. This is because land degradation has been a significant amplifier of shocks in Sahelian countries such as Niger, where 80 per cent of livelihoods depend on rainfed subsistence agriculture. Land rehabilitation has been complemented with activities such as building community infrastructure, promoting education, improving nutrition and health, and creating jobs for women and young people. The design of these activities involved inclusive participatory planning, which put affected communities at the heart of decision-making processes. This ensured that programmes were culturally sensitive, practical and context-specific in order to build trust and collaboration. Although improving social cohesion was not an explicit goal of the programme, addressing competition over natural resources—particularly between farmers and herders—through dialogue and negotiation, promoted harmony and cooperation between communities. The programme created local opportunities for youth and reduced men’s seasonal outmigration, contributing to community resilience and stability. As a result, these communities became less reliant on humanitarian aid, with some communities no longer requiring assistance during the lean season. Overcoming risk aversion—adaptive financing for food system transformation Investing in agriculture and broader food systems is an inherently risky business. Weather, climate, diseases, natural disasters, and market and environmental shocks are among the many types of risk that can co-occur and reinforce each other, making investment in food systems an unattractive proposition, even in advanced economies. Although, as noted above, investment in food systems in fragile settings remains predominantly humanitarian, some development actors are identifying new ways of working to adapt to highly volatile contexts, facing multiple concurrent risks. In Sudan, the African Development Bank (AfDB) collaborates with the WFP on an emergency project to boost wheat production and reduce import dependency. Despite the outbreak of civil war in 2023, shortly after the project began, the project has managed to adapt and keep going, with positive results. The civil war has disrupted agricultural activity, resulting in 25.6 million people, nearly 51 per cent of the population, experiencing acute hunger according to the latest estimate. The AfDB’s emphasis, therefore, is on supporting Sudan in bolstering its capacity to meet domestic food demand, even under conditions of active conflict. Development partners who can implement emergency projects in a conflict setting are brought on board to help more effective delivery. During the 2023–24 agricultural season, the project distributed climate-adapted wheat seeds and fertilizers to over 170 000 smallholder farmers in both conflict-affected states, including Gezira and White Nile, and more stable northern and eastern states such as Kassala, Northern and River Nile. The project improved food security, producing 645 000 tonnes of wheat in 2024, and played a vital role in crisis response for internally displaced persons (who represented over 30 per cent of beneficiaries in Northern State). The project builds on the success of earlier transformative wheat production initiatives, showcasing how long-term development interventions can address immediate emergency and humanitarian needs while fostering resilience for the future. It has also demonstrated the AfDB’s flexibility and commitment to support investments over a period longer than the one- to two-year humanitarian financing usually deployed in active conflict contexts. Food systems for long-term stability and development National ownership, multistakeholder engagement, and integrated approaches that combine development, humanitarian and peacebuilding efforts are vital to transforming food systems in fragile contexts. Carefully designed and inclusive methodologies and approaches ensure that interventions are contextually relevant, are locally owned and build on local capacity, fostering stakeholders’ trust and engagement. A paradigm shift is needed to meet the ambition of ending hunger by 2030. Building resilient food systems that withstand shocks and stressors is paramount to sustainably preventing or reducing humanitarian needs and protracted food crises. This shift requires a long-term commitment from development technical and financial partners to stay and deliver in fragile settings, jointly with humanitarian actors, and adopt conflict-sensitive programming to promote peace and social cohesion. By leveraging learning from emerging innovative and adaptive approaches to investment in fragile and volatile settings, actors across the HDP nexus can sustainably improve the resilience, peace outcomes and food security of the communities that are most in need. Resilient food systems are at the heart of these new approaches and the key to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals, leaving no one behind.

Aid Under Fire: Humanitarian Crisis In Post-Coup Myanmar – Analys...	By Naw Seng The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar following the 2021 military coup highlights the devastating intersection of political conflict, environmental vulnerability, and systemic governance failures. Key Takeaways: Myanmar’s humanitarian crisis stems from the combined impacts of conflict-driven displacement, climate change, and political instability, leaving millions without shelter, food, or healthcare. Military restrictions on NGOs and civil society obstruct humanitarian efforts, while bureaucratic barriers and security risks worsen access issues. Strong collaboration with local networks is essential to ensure aid delivery to vulnerable populations. Economic collapse and rising food prices have caused severe food insecurity, leaving millions without adequate nutrition. Addressing this crisis demands integrated food security programs, agricultural rehabilitation, and governance reforms to address its root causes. This analysis examines the multifaceted challenges that have exacerbated the crisis, focusing on displacement, climate change, restricted access to aid, and food insecurity, providing insight into the complex dynamics at play. Conflict and Displacement The political turmoil following the 2021 military coup caused massive internal displacement. Due to political unrest, humanitarian crises, and environmental degradation, an estimated 18.6 million people in Myanmar—primarily women and girls—need immediate assistance. Combined with climate change-related disasters, millions were left without shelter, food, or medical services, making Myanmar one of the most challenging places for humanitarian access. In addition to the 2.6 million people displaced by the ongoing conflict, the poverty line has doubled since 2021. Only 45% of Myanmar’s 2023 humanitarian response plan has been funded, leaving nearly 2 million without essential assistance. Armed conflicts between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and different ethnic groups caused further displacement, triggered by the coup’s violent suppression of protests. Over a million people have been impacted by climate change-related disasters, worsening the crisis by destroying infrastructure and causing severe flooding from typhoons and monsoon rains. Insecurity, damaged infrastructure, and restricted access due to ongoing conflict present significant challenges for humanitarian organizations attempting to reach displaced populations. Additionally, political instability complicates the distribution of essential services like food, housing, and healthcare. The socioeconomic ramifications of displacement are extensive. Prolonged instability disrupts education, erodes human capital, and weakens community structures, posing long-term risks to Myanmar’s development. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach that balances immediate humanitarian needs with investments in sustainable recovery. Climate Change Effects Myanmar remains highly vulnerable to climate change, intensifying the frequency and severity of climate change-related disasters like cyclones and flooding. These challenges significantly impact Myanmar’s economy, society, and environment. The growing frequency and intensity of climate change-related disasters like flooding and cyclones underscore the pressing need to address climate change’s root causes and effects. Geographical vulnerabilities further worsen its impacts, particularly in the most affected regions. Local communities and livelihoods face serious risks, especially in rural and coastal areas with heavy dependence on agriculture and natural resources. Disasters exacerbated by climate change impact public health, water resources, and food security, presenting interrelated problems that demand comprehensive solutions. Adaptive strategies adopted by the government and local communities aim to build resilience against climate change. These strategies, alongside international support, are vital for mitigating its effects. Meanwhile, deforestation and environmental degradation emphasize the importance of sustainable practices to reduce vulnerabilities to climate change and climate change-related disasters. Myanmar’s inability to address the root causes of climate vulnerability reflects broader governance challenges. Limited institutional capacity, lack of enforcement of environmental regulations, and weak coordination with international actors hinder efforts to build resilience against climate change. Scaling up climate adaptation strategies and integrating them with disaster risk reduction initiatives is essential to mitigate the impact on vulnerable populations. Restricted Access The military’s restrictions on international NGOs and local civil society organizations severely hinder aid delivery, particularly in conflict-affected areas like Kachin, Karen, Rakhine, and Shan States. Aid organizations face significant bureaucratic hurdles, including navigating military checkpoints and, in some places, being forced to cease operations entirely. Given the military's history of killing and detentioning aid workers, their safety is a significant concern. The stakes for international organizations attempting to deal with the situation are raised, and the environment for humanitarian operations becomes hostile. The breakdown of Myanmar’s healthcare system after the coup has worsened health conditions in disaster-affected regions. Restricted access to medical services, disrupted supply chains, and the lack of clean water have made communities more vulnerable to preventable diseases like malaria. Climate change-related disasters such as floods and landslides have damaged healthcare facilities and impeded transportation, complicating access to care further. Many local organizations struggle to meet international donors' financial and operational requirements. New local organizations often need more documentation and policies to apply for grants, which delays their ability to secure funding. Additionally, the overall funding for humanitarian efforts in Myanmar needs to be expanded, further complicating the situation. Many activists face threats in the restricted environment where civil society organizations operate, forcing them to operate underground. Moreover, the international aid efforts to support Myanmar's civil society could be improved by the need for tailored assistance and flexible funding mechanisms to address the country's unique challenges. Despite these challenges, local organizations are crucial in reaching displaced communities and finding innovative ways to help. International health organizations continue to support crisis responses, partnering with local health initiatives and delivering emergency medical assistance. Volunteers and medical professionals have stepped up to address urgent medical needs, providing care and distributing essential supplies under challenging conditions. To improve aid effectiveness, international stakeholders must prioritize negotiations with authorities to facilitate access and address bureaucratic barriers. Strengthening the capacity of local civil society organizations and enhancing community-led initiatives are also critical strategies to overcome restricted access and ensure aid reaches those in need. Food Insecurity The combination of economic breakdown, conflict, and climate-change-related disasters has pushed millions into severe food insecurity. Farmers have lost crops due to floods and conflict, while rising food prices have made access to proper nutrition increasingly tricky. In conflict-affected regions, displacement, disrupted supply chains and destroyed agricultural infrastructure have significantly reduced food availability. Flooding, drought, and conflict-related restrictions on field access have caused farmers to lose crops, lowering yields and harvests. Areas like Kachin, Karen, and Shan States have experienced substantial disruptions in agricultural activity, worsening food insecurity. Rising food prices have further compounded the crisis, leaving many families unable to afford a nutritious diet. Traditional food supply chains have been disrupted, forcing reliance on less reliable alternatives. Initiatives such as food distribution programs, agricultural support, and livelihood restoration efforts are being implemented to address the crisis. Despite military restrictions and ongoing conflict, international organizations continue to support Myanmar’s food security efforts through funding, technical assistance, and humanitarian aid. The food crisis threatens Myanmar’s long-term economic recovery and social stability, necessitating sustained global support. Integrating agricultural rehabilitation programs with conflict resolution efforts is essential to address food insecurity effectively. These measures should include re-establishing supply chains, investing in resilient farming practices, and promoting food access through community-driven distribution systems. Conclusion Myanmar’s post-coup humanitarian crisis reveals the devastating interplay between conflict, climate change, and systemic vulnerabilities. The challenges of displacement, restricted access, food insecurity, and climate-induced disasters require urgent and coordinated international efforts. Strategic partnerships between international organizations, local actors, and regional bodies are crucial for shaping long-term solutions. Beyond immediate humanitarian relief, addressing structural issues such as governance, environmental degradation, and economic instability is imperative to ensure sustainable recovery and resilience in Myanmar.

US National Debt Passes New Grim Milestone – OpEd	One week before Thanksgiving, the U.S. government’s total public debt outstanding surpassed $36 trillion for the first time ever. Just 118 days earlier, the politicians and bureaucrats running the U.S. government breached the $35 trillion mark for the national debt. That was 204 days after they managed to top $34 trillion. The U.S. government passed each of these grim fiscal milestones during 2024. What makes that a dubious achievement is that the U.S. government has collected a record amount of tax revenue in 2024. The federal government’s tax collections beat the previous recordset in 2022 when the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic boosted the Treasury’s coffers. Unlike 2020 or 2021, there is no national emergency in 2024, like a pandemic, to cause the national debt to rise so fast. Yet, in 2024, the politicians and bureaucrats running the U.S. government are borrowing to fund their spending as if there was an emergency. How fast is the U.S. government borrowing money? The chart below shows how fast the national debt increased per day to surpass each of its last $30 trillion worth of trillion-dollar milestones. The data comes from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Debt to the Penny resource, which has daily national debt figures going back to April 1, 1993. This data shows how extraordinary the period containing the coronavirus pandemic was. However, the important thing to recognize is that the pandemic surge in debt ended. The daily national debt growth rate went back to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. By the time President Biden signed legislation officially ending the national emergency to respond to the pandemic on April 11, 2023, the pandemic had been effectively over for months. But instead of staying low, the daily growth rate of the national debt surged after that date to levels not seen outside of fiscal crises or national emergencies. The politicians and bureaucrats running the federal government got a taste of what it was like to spend without restraint, and they didn’t give it up. In 2024, it took them 322 days to run the national debt up by $2 trillion. It is clear the politicians and bureaucrats running the federal government aren’t paying any attention to the national debt milestones they’re passing. How soon will it be before they blow past the $37 trillion milestone?

Slash Military Spending: ‘Defense’ Budgets Are Bigger Than Ever B...	By Ryan McMaken It should go without saying that asking generals and other Pentagon bureaucrats about defense spending is like asking your barber if you need a haircut. They are hardly disinterested observers. So, it’s not surprising at all that the usual pentagon uniformed technocrats, after failing their audit for the seventh time in a row, remain unrepentant. Last month, after failing to provide documentation showing the Pentagon actually knows what it does with its money, the DoD engaged in the song and dance we have come to expect. For example, the Pentagon’s CFO Michael McCord announced that in spite of its abysmal performance in its audit, the Department 'has turned a corner in its understanding of the depth and breadth of its challenges.' 'I think we’re making progress,' he added. That’s swell, but it’s unclear that this 'progress' amounts to much given that last year, the Pentagon admitted it can’t account for 63% of nearly $4 trillion in assets. The Pentagon has never passed an audit since the agency became legally obligated to carry them out in 2018. Not that any of this matters in terms of any real consequences for the privileged class of parasite tax-eaters that are high ranking military officers and their corporate cronies at places like Boeing. Military spending just keeps growing to new historic highs every few years, even in inflation-adjusted dollars. Moreover, the dollars that go to the DoD directly are just part of the spending on so-called 'defense.' The Pentagon effectively shares its functions with two other federal agencies, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA, after all, is just an agency tasked with spending the deferred costs of previous military operations. That is, the VA delivers the benefits to veterans who were promised ongoing compensation—in the form of healthcare and other benefits—for military 'service.' Without VA benefits, the Pentagon would never be able to recruit the troops it needs for its next round of foreign policy debacles. Thus, any true accounting for military budgets has to account for the long-term personnel costs that become apparent in VA spending. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security contains numerous agencies related to nuclear war, biowarfare, the Coast Guard, and more. Source: Office of Management and Budget. When we look at these three agencies combined, the spending is astronomical. In 2024, the Department of Defense’s budget is still fourteen percent higher than it was at the height of Reagan’s Cold War buildup. After nearly 25 years of nearly continuous war, however, the costs of veteran’s benefits have soared, meaning that the total combined costs of military and defense spending are now 60 percent above their old Cold War peak. None of this, by the way, takes into account the immense contribution to the national debt made by defense spending. In the 2024 fiscal year, the US paid $884 billion in interest payments on the debt. It’s safe to say that federal interest payments would be hundreds of billions of dollars lower were it not for military and defense spending. The cost of various failed military occupations contributes much to this endless gravy train for the military, but much of the waste now comes in the form of technology spending. This spending on newer and more expensive toys for government agencies often amounts to little more than corporate welfare. The F-35, for example, is the quintessential example. William Hartung writes: If carried to completion, the F-35 will be the most expensive weapons program in history, at a cost of $1.7 trillion over its lifetime. Yet 23 years into the program, the F-35 still has major flaws in its software and hardware — over 800 unresolved defects according to one Pentagon analysis. And it spends inordinate amounts of time out of action for maintenance. Versions of the plane for the Air Force, Navy, and Marines were designed to carry out multiple functions — aerial dogfights, bombing targets on the ground, close air support for troops, landing on both airstrips on land and the decks of aircraft carriers — and it does none of them particularly well. For his part, [Elon] Musk has referred to the F-35 as 'jack of all trades, master of none' and 'the worst military value for money in history.' His critique is right on target. It is long past time to cut the F-35 program short in favor of cheaper, more reliable alternatives. In other words, that’s $1.7 trillion down the drain in terms of actual defense. But it sure has made many of the Pentagon’s 500,000 'private' contractors rich. Hartung has also noted that the Pentagon’s tech spending—i.e., corporate welfare—has now begun flowing in every larger quantities to Silicon Valley. The alliance between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon has substantially grown in recent years. Parasite 'capitalists' like Peter Thiel are among the biggest beneficiaries. For example, Thiel’s Palantir, an AI platform designed to help the CIA spy on Americans, has seen big gains in its stock price following another infusion of more than $400 million in the third quarter alone. Taxpayer dollars accounted for 56 percent of Palantir’s revenue during the period, while actual private-sector revenues disappointed. Silicon Valley is increasingly fueled by government contracts, and defense spending is a growing part of this. It remains to be seen what any of this has to do with actually effective deterrence, diplomacy, or defense. But, it does help build a corps of corporate welfare-queen lobbyists who will fight tooth and nail to prevent any meaningful cuts to defense spending. Unfortunately, there will be no meaningful progress made on bringing the federal government’s runaway spending under control without substantial cuts to military spending. Much of the 'discretionary' spending that can be cut in the appropriations process is found in the military and defense budgets. Elderly voters, of course, will throw a fit if anyone mentions cutting their favorite welfare programs, Social Security and Medicare. Moreover, that spending is 'non-discretionary' meaning Congress must pass new laws changing spending formulas on top of the appropriations process. That should all be done, of course, but it also means we might as well start with cuts to defense spending. There is plenty of fat to trim. American taxpayers still spend generously to maintain more than 165,000 US troops overseas, many in countries that are wealthy allies who can easily afford their own military defense. As reported by Statista this week According to data from the Defense Manpower Data Center, South Korea has the third highest number of active U.S. troops deployed of any country outside of the contiguous U.S., at over 23,000 personnel. It follows only after Japan (52,852) and Germany (34,894). As of June 2024, there are 165,830 active personnel overseas, rising to 1,294,191 active personnel when including those in the U.S. Meanwhile, in spite of the Pentagon’s gargantuan budgets, dirt-poor Houthi rebels have effectively sent Red-Sea shipping into chaos. Yet, Americans have been told for 200-plus years that the US Navy keeps the 'high seas' open for shipping. This is not money well spent. If so-called fiscal hawks were serious about cutting federal spending, they’d be advocating for hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts to the military and defense budgets. At the very least, spending must be returned to its old Cold War peak with a cut of more than $470 billion right off the top. Most of that should come out of the Pentagon budget since cuts to the VA would rightly be portrayed as a ghoulish attempt by Pentagon brass to preserve their own salaries and toys at the expense of ordinary veterans. Even these 'huge' cuts wouldn’t abolish even half of the $2-trillion-plus deficits that the US will be facing each year in coming years. But, we all know that, until a significant change in the public’s ideology about federal spending takes place, we will not see any real cuts to federal spending, military or otherwise. The American public still largely views federal deficits and debt as free money, so there are few calls for any real cuts. This is reflected in public opinion surveys that show Americans still want to see more spending pretty much everywhere. Nor will there be any top-down reforms. Contrary to the beloved beltway myth that 'personnel is policy,' policy actually stems from public opinion, and the regime will never push anything more than the most milquetoast reforms until the public demands otherwise. Those who think otherwise are lost in the throes of 'cope' and wishful thinking. This administration will not spend political capital on any sizable cuts to any program given that there is no public demand for any such thing. It doesn’t matter that Trump’s newest Secretary of Whatever wrote an op-ed ten years ago calling for big budget cuts. That’s simply not going to translate into anything meaningful in the year 2024. Rather, what is really going to happen is the US will continue downward in its debt spiral, racking up ever larger deficits. Yields on Treasuries will gradually rise as the federal government floods the markets with ever more debt. Interest will on the debt will rise ever higher, siphoning off more and more resources from present spending to pay off the deficits of long-ago failed wars and welfare programs. Meanwhile, the central bank will attempt to keep yields under control by being the 'buyer of last resort' and mopping up the excess Treasuries. That will manifest as price inflation as the central bank must create new money to pay for all those bonds. Then, it will be 'rinse and repeat' as inflation and debt mounts, and federal spending continues unabated, funneling ever larger dollar amounts to Silicon Valley billionaires and fat-cat weapons makers. Only after the debt- and inflation-fueled destruction of the middle class becomes undeniable will the public finally lose faith in the idea that ever more government spending makes the people better off. Only then will we see the bottom-up demands for change that are badly needed right now. That, of course, is the good-case scenario. If we do our job as free-market activists, a growing share of the public will see the destruction wrought by our debt spiral, and real reform will come sooner than later. Without free-market activists, on the other hand, there may be no end in sight at all. In the bad-case scenario, the public rejects markets and laissez-faire entirely, and simply concludes that the only way out is total central planning and soviet-style socialism. The time for fight for radical change toward laissez-faire is right now.

Bitcoin Storms Above $100,000 As Bets On Trump Fuel Crypto Euphor...	(EurActiv) -- Bitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday (5 December), a milestone hailed even by sceptics as a coming-of-age for cryptocurrencies as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement cryptos' place in financial markets. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record just shy of $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple alone is worth about $3.7 trillion. Bitcoin's march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of 'decentralised finance' in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump's sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress. Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday's Asian morning, it was soon above $103,000 on its way to an all-time high of $103,619, a surge of about 6% on the day. It was last fetching $101,933 . 'We're witnessing a paradigm shift,' said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital. 'Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.' Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the 'crypto capital of the planet' and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. 'We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after 5 November, US investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,' said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund. On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to 'develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms,' and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. 'Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,' said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith. 'We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation.' A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council. Part of the landscape Bitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns. Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed. Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally. US-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election. 'Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money,' said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. 'Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalised,' he said. 'If you fast forward a number of years on trading floors you'll have a sales and trading desk... which will sit alongside FX and rates and commodities.' It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock's ETF in November. Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and exchange operator Coinbase each up around 65% in November. Software firm Microstrategy , which has repeatedly raised funds to buy bitcoin and held an aggregate of about 402,100 bitcoins as of 1 December, has gained 542% this year. Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. 'Who can prohibit it?' The cryptocurrency industry has been criticised for its massive energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, and the underlying technology is yet to deliver a major revolution in the way money moves around the globe. Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: 'Who can prohibit it? No one.' And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience. 'As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the financial landscape,' said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney. 'I find it very hard to value it ... it's anyone's guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdfJVeDPSIdrIuDkM6vvIW0	2024-12-05T16:40:45-08:00	
The Real Intention Of Trump’s Tariff Policy – Analysis	By Wei Hongxu On November 26, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump stated on his social media platform that on his first day in office, he would impose a 10% tariff on all goods imported from China. Additionally, he would impose new tariffs of up to 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico. This statement further reinforced his commitment to fulfilling his campaign promises. As expected, this announcement triggered market fluctuations. The dollar strengthened, while the Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, and Mexican peso all depreciated. Notably, the offshore yuan fell to around 7.26, returning to its low point from July. Trump's decision to announce his tariff policies before taking office came sooner than many had anticipated, catching the market somewhat off guard. As his presidency will only last four years, this means that Trump's ability to implement policies will be more time-constrained than in his first term. Hence, he is likely to adopt a fast-paced approach to push forward his campaign promises, making full use of his time in office. On one hand, this reflects his determination to deliver on his campaign pledges; on the other hand, it also lays the groundwork for the Republican Party to secure future voter support. The urgency also signals his awareness of the challenges involved in pushing his policies through. Regarding the reason for imposing additional tariffs, Trump stated that China has not taken sufficient measures to stop illegal drugs from entering the U.S. through Mexico. He said, 'Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America'. Additionally, Trump explained that the new tariff plan aims to pressure Mexico and Canada to take stronger measures to enhance border security and combat the export of fentanyl to the U.S. He emphasized that both countries have the right and ability to easily resolve these long-standing issues, and that they will face significant consequences for inaction before they take steps to address them. These reasons reflect, on one hand, Trump's urgent approach to addressing domestic issues such as drugs and illegal immigration. On the other hand, they indirectly reveal his 'transactional' attitude toward tariffs. For Trump, tariffs seem more like a tool or weapon rather than a solution to the U.S. trade imbalance. As predicted by ANBOUND's founder Kung Chan, Trump is unlikely to follow through on his campaign promise of a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. The actual tariff rates are expected to be much lower, depending on the outcome of negotiations between China and the U.S. The actual tariff rate could be significantly lower, depending on the outcome of negotiations and interactions between the two countries. Therefore, the proposed 10% tariff on Chinese goods may not be the final figure, but rather the starting point of a new round of trade negotiations, with room for further adjustments. At the same time, Trump's tariff threats, as he mentioned during his campaign, are not only directed at China but also aimed at the two neighboring countries, Canada and Mexico, with an even higher tariff rate of 25%. This has equally surprised the market. If implemented, this policy would mark a significant shift in the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) and indicate that Trump intends to overturn the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) signed during his first term. It also reflects Trump's broader isolationist stance on the international stage. In addition to pressuring Canada and Mexico on issues like immigration and drugs, the new tariffs are intended to encourage the return of manufacturing to the U.S. and promote American reindustrialization. This reflects Trump's 'America First' policy agenda. During his campaign, Trump accused Mexico, China, Canada, and the European Union of taking advantage of the U.S. in past trade relationships, which indirectly undermines the USMCA. In fact, Mexico, with its low labor costs and geographic proximity to the U.S., has attracted significant investment from automakers and become a key player in North America's automotive supply chain. As a beneficiary of the first round of the U.S.-China trade war, Mexico's trade surplus with the U.S. has been expanding year by year. Currently, Mexico has become the U.S.'s largest trading partner and the second-largest source of its trade deficit. This is in direct contrast to Trump's aim of reducing the trade deficit, promoting the return of manufacturing, and revitalizing the Rust Belt. Trump had previously suggested the possibility of singling out Mexico's auto industry, imposing a 100% tariff on its exports to the U.S. Therefore, Trump's focus on Mexico also reflects his intention to address Chinese companies bypassing tariffs by entering the U.S. market via other countries, as well as his goal of pressuring American automakers to bring production back to the U.S. This highlights the complexity of the 'trade war' between the U.S. and China. It is not only a matter for the two countries but also involves emerging markets like Southeast Asia and Mexico, which have become alternative routes for Chinese companies to access the U.S. market while avoiding trade war risks. In fact, by imposing a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on China, Trump effectively raises the tariff on the U.S.'s top three trading partners to a similar level of 28%-29%. For Chinese companies, rerouting through other markets to enter the U.S. becomes less meaningful. This may reflect Trump's 'equal treatment' approach to trade issues. From this perspective, Trump's tariff policies still have the ultimate goal of reducing the trade deficit. Trump's tariff policy certainly signals that his 'America First' approach is fundamentally different from the Biden administration's 'Small Yard, High Fence' strategy of 'decoupling'. This may be more advantageous for China. However, despite Trump's efforts to fulfill his campaign promises and gain the trust of American voters, it seems unlikely that he will be able to achieve his goal of reindustrialization through a global restructuring of trade and supply chains. After all, following decades of deindustrialization, the cost structure and environmental foundations of U.S. manufacturing have undergone significant changes. Even if Trump were to impose tariffs on all imported goods, achieving full reindustrialization would still be a formidable challenge. Similarly, as the market expects, the weaponization of his trade policy will have direct effects on both the U.S. dollar and inflation within the country. Changes in the domestic situation in the U.S. will likely impact the pace and intensity of Trump's tariff-driven negotiations. These actions are currently having a tangible impact on international capital markets, particularly the Chinese yuan, which has been continuously depreciating since Trump's election victory. After the announcement of a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, the offshore yuan exchange rate fell to 7.26, returning to the level seen in July of this year. Of course, Trump's current stance on tariffs, i.e., 10%, has a relatively mild effect on the yuan. However, the larger the tariff increase in the future, the more severe the impact on the exchange rate will be. Bank of America previously forecast that if the new U.S. administration imposes a 40% tariff on Chinese goods, the yuan could fall to 7.6 per dollar in the first half of next year. If the tariff were increased to 60%, the yuan might depreciate to 8 per dollar. Although exchange rate fluctuations will affect the valuation of China's capital markets, the current 10% tariff seems to have a limited impact on the Chinese market. Ultimately, China's capital markets will still be largely determined by the country's own economic development. In any case, the 10% tariff on China is likely just the beginning of a new round of 'trade war'. Compared to Biden's 'Small Yard, High Fence' strategy, this new trade war will be more direct and broader in scope, targeting not just China but all countries. It will likely persist for a long time and drive the U.S. market toward greater independence. This signals that the future competition between China and the U.S. will remain a prolonged process, one in which both sides will suffer. The outcome will largely depend on the internal stability and development of each country's economy. For China, responding to this new round of trade conflict will require more than just weaponizing tariffs. The focus should be on addressing the instability in domestic demand, resolving internal contradictions, and strengthening the internal circulation to overcome challenges in external trade. Final analysis conclusion: Before taking office, Trump publicly stated that he would impose tariffs on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico to address internal issues such as drugs and illegal immigration. This reflects Trump's commitment to implementing his campaign promises and advancing his 'isolationist' policy agenda, signaling that he views tariffs as a 'bargaining chip. This move to initiate tariff negotiations can be seen as a warning for the start of a new round of 'trade war', a process that will likely be a long-term strategic struggle.

The Bidens And Burisma: President’s Pardon Stretches Back To Son’...	By Todd Prince (RFE/RL) -- U.S. President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden days before his scheduled sentencing on gun-possession and tax-related charges, despite having repeatedly said he would not do so. The sweeping pardon announced on December 1 exonerates Hunter Biden, 54, from any crime he may have committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024. That period includes Hunter Biden's controversial stint as a board member of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, a role that was a touchstone for Republican criticism of Joe Biden and was at the heart of the first of two impeachments of Donald Trump, the former president who will return to the White House in January. Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma in May 2014, less than three months after Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was pushed from power and fled to Russia in the culmination of the massive, monthslong Euromaidan protests over official corruption and his decision to scrap plans for a trade agreement with the European Union and pursue closer ties with Moscow. Hunter Biden's business partner, Devon Archer, had joined a month earlier, when the U.K. froze a Burisma bank account holding $23 million amid suspicion of money laundering. At the time, Joe Biden was the U.S. vice president and President Barack Obama's point man for Ukraine, which was battling Russian and Russian-backed forces in a war fomented by Moscow in the eastern Donbas region following Yanukovych's departure. Russia had also seized control of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. Burisma's owner, Mykola Zlochevskiy, a former environment and natural resources minister, was under investigation for corruption, accused of having used his position to acquire lucrative gas fields. Hunter Biden had no background in the energy industry, sparking speculation he was hired to provide political cover for Burisma and its owner. The United States and its allies were in the process of placing sanctions on former officials in Yanukovych's government who were believed to have enriched themselves. Hunter Biden was paid as much as $50,000 a month, a large amount by U.S. standards. Board members of Apple and Meta, two of the biggest companies in the world, were receiving on average about $30,000 a month at the time. Biden said he never spoke with his son about his work, including Burisma. In 2016, Biden threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine if the government did not dismiss its prosecutor-general, who was widely considered to be hindering corruption investigations. Ahead of the 2020 election, Republicans cast that threat as an attempt by Biden to hinder an investigation into Burisma, without providing any evidence. Overall, Republicans accused Democrat Joe Biden of peddling influence overseas and his son of violating the U.S Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which requires individuals lobbying the U.S. government on the behalf of a foreign state to register with the Justice Department. Hunter Biden served on the Burisma board until April 2019, when his father announced he would challenge then-President Trump in the 2020 election. Trump soon began targeting Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine, and the issue roiled U.S.-Ukrainian relations just as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy took office after his election in April 2019. During a phone call that July, Trump asked Zelenskiy to look into the Bidens' activities in Ukraine. The call led to accusations that Trump had conditioned the release of nearly $400 million in military aid on an investigation into the Bidens, and Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate acquitted Trump on both charges in February 2020. Joe Biden defeated Trump in the November 2020 presidential election, but Trump beat Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 vote last month and will take office again on January 20. The controversy surrounding Burisma was an unfortunate development for Ukraine, serving only to reinforce its image in the United States as a corrupt state, Oleksandr Krayev, an analyst at Ukrainian Prism, a Kyiv-based think tank, told RFE/RL. 'Ukraine was secondary to Hunter Biden's story, [but] we looked like a small corrupt state where evil companies and golden youth launder their money,' Krayev said. U.S. presidents frequently pardon a number of nonviolent criminals or commute their sentences shortly before leaving office. But Biden's broad pardon of his son has fueled criticism from Republicans and rankled some supporters who say he is undermining Americans' faith in the judicial system. It has also been criticized in foreign countries, including Ukraine, given the emphasis the United States has placed on the importance of an independent judiciary free of intervention. 'This example is disappointing. Practice what you preach,' Daria Kalenyuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center in Kyiv, told RFE/RL. 'Such actions provide Russia and other authoritarian regimes with additional opportunities for propaganda. This is especially harmful in the context of war, when Russia is actively trying to discredit Western democracies and their values.' Hunter Biden had been due to be sentenced on December 12 and 16 in two separate cases. In June, he was found guilty of lying about his drug addiction on a government form required to obtain firearms. Then, in September, he pleaded guilty to falsifying his tax returns and paying his taxes late. While he faced more than a decade in prison, as a first-time, nonviolent offender, he was likely to serve a few years at most and might have avoided prison altogether, legal experts say. In announcing the pardon, Biden accused his Republican opponents of targeting him and his son and expressed concern that this would continue after Trump takes office. 'No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son,' Biden said in a statement. Whether the incoming Trump administration will seek to pursue an investigation related to Burisma is unclear. Trump said last year that he will name a special counsel to probe the Biden family, though he gave no details about who might be investigated on what possible charges. The pardon does not prevent the Trump administration from pursuing an investigation, but Hunter Biden could ask a court to dismiss any charges, pointing to his broad clemency, experts say.

Brazil: Poverty And Extreme Poverty Reach Lowest Level Since 2012	By Bruno de Freitas Moura Brazil concluded 2023 with the lowest poverty and extreme poverty levels recorded since the Synthesis of Social Indicators survey began in 2012, conducted by the government´s statistics agency IBGE. However, despite this improvement, data released on Wednesday (Dec. 4) reveal that 58.9 million people still live in poverty, with 9.5 million in extreme poverty. The study focuses on monetary poverty, defined as a family lacking sufficient income to ensure its well-being. To establish the poverty thresholds, IBGE applied the World Bank's criteria: $2.15 per person per day for extreme poverty and $6.85 per person per day for general poverty. In 2023, the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty fell to 4.4 percent, down from 6.6 percent in 2012 and 5.9 percent in 2022. Between the last two years of the survey, 3.1 million people moved out of extreme poverty, gaining access to an income of at least $2.15 per day. The proportion of the population living in poverty, defined as earning less than $6.85 per day, dropped to 27.4 percent in 2023, compared to 34.7 percent in 2012 and 31.6 percent in 2022. Between 2022 and 2023, 8.7 million people moved out of poverty. Employment and income IBGE researcher Bruno Mandelli Perez attributes the reductions in poverty and extreme poverty to two key factors: improved employment opportunities and social benefits, including income transfer programs targeting socially vulnerable families, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. 'Both the labor market and social program benefits play a key role in reducing poverty. However, the labor market has a greater impact on poverty reduction, while social program benefits are more significant in addressing extreme poverty,' he explains. 'The increase in the average value of the benefits granted...certainly had an impact on maintaining the trajectory of reducing poverty and extreme poverty in 2023,' the Synthesis of Social Indicators points out. Women, black, and young individuals IBGE highlights that women, black individuals, and young people are the most affected by poverty and extreme poverty. The proportion of men in poverty is 26.3 percent, compared to 28.4 percent for women. For extreme poverty, the figures are 4.3 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively. By race, 17.7 percent of white individuals live in poverty. This proportion nearly doubles among brown individuals, reaching 35.5 percent, and stands at 30.8 percent among black individuals. When examining extreme poverty, 2.6 percent of white individuals fall below this threshold, compared to 6 percent of brown individuals and 4.7 percent of black individuals. When analyzed by age group, the youth population shows poverty rates exceeding the national average of 27.4 percent. Among individuals aged 15 and under, the rate is 44.8 percent, while for those between 15 and 29 years old, it stands at 29.9 percent. Researcher Bruno Perez highlights that poverty and extreme poverty rates are lower among individuals aged 60 and older, at 11.3 percent and 2 percent, respectively. 'This group is generally covered by pension benefits, with incomes linked to the minimum wage,' he explains. Social benefits The Synthesis of Social Indicators provides data that shows the importance of social benefits for the poorest population. In 2023, employment income was the main source of household earnings, accounting for BRL 74.20 out of every BRL 100. Among families with the lowest incomes—those earning up to a quarter of the minimum wage per person—social benefits constituted the majority of their income. For every BRL 100, BRL 57.10 came from benefits, exceeding the BRL 34.60 derived from work. When the survey started in 2012, social benefits made up only 23.5 percent of the household income of the poorest families. A decade later, this proportion has increased to 42.2 percent. 'Among households with the lowest income, those earning up to a quarter of the minimum wage, the share of income from work is decreasing, while the share from social program benefits is increasing,' Perez points out. The researcher presented a simulation showing the impact of income transfer programs on poverty and extreme poverty. Without these programs, extreme poverty would rise from 4.4 to 11.2 percent, and poverty would increase from 27.4 to 32.4 percent. Inequality In 2023, the Gini index, which measures income inequality, stood at 0.518, the same as in 2022 and the lowest recorded since 2012. The Gini index ranges from 0 to 1, with values closer to zero indicating lower inequality. The highest level of inequality in the series occurred in 2018, with a score of 0.545. According to IBGE, without income transfer programs, the 2023 Gini index would have been 0.555.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdfJVeDPSIdrBuMFkiHKqM3	2024-12-05T16:06:27-08:00	
UNHCR Hits Record USD 1.5 Billion In Early Funding To Support Ref...	As humanitarian emergencies in the Middle East and Africa keep escalating—including in Gaza, Lebanon, Sudan and most recently in Syria—there was a glimmer of hope to millions starved of food and deprived of shelter and medication in war zones. According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), donor governments 'pledged a record US$ 1.143 billion (on December 3) to provide protection, life-saving assistance and solutions to millions of people uprooted by the increasing number of conflicts across the world.' This was a show of support for the work of the UN Refugee Agency, and its partners ahead of 2025. Along with a commitment of $355 million from UNHCR’s private sector National Partners, the total amount announced was $1.5 billion, covering 15 per cent of anticipated needs for the year. 'These resources will allow UNHCR to start the year with greater confidence and continue its work, a lifeline to many forcibly displaced people, delivering aid in emergencies, providing protection and humanitarian assistance, and seeking longer-term solutions', the refugee agency said. The United States led the pledges with $200 million, followed by Denmark and Sweden, with notable increases announced by the Netherlands and Germany. Several countries showed new or strengthened early support this year, including Armenia, Bulgaria and Lithuania. The governments of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia and Ireland showed once again their strong support by pledging flexible funding, which enables UNHCR to quickly deliver aid in new emergencies and to respond to underfunded situations, the agency said. Governments attending UNHCR’s pledging conference also guaranteed $283 million in funding for 2026 and beyond. This is crucial to the planning and stability of UNHCR’s long-term programmes aimed at fostering lasting solutions. 'We live in a world ravaged by brutal and seemingly endless conflicts that tear lives apart and send people on a desperate flight for safety,' said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 'The robust support shown today to refugees and other forcibly displaced people resonates as a much-needed message of solidarity and humanity. The pledges made are a commitment to save lives, restore dignity and bring hope to millions of people forced to flee,' he noted. In 2024, the five largest donors contributing to UNHCR’s work were the United States of America, Germany, the European Union, Sweden and France. UNHCR also acknowledges the support of its five largest government donors of unearmarked funding—Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands—as well as of National Partners providing such flexible funding, which the Agency allocates where it is needed the most, especially in emergencies and underfunded crises. Meanwhile, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that a new Israeli evacuation order was issued December 2 in Khan Younis Governorate, impacting more than 2,000 people. This directive—which is the fourth such evacuation order for this area since July – covers about 3 square kilometres. OCHA stresses once again that repeated evacuation orders—which are now in effect for about 80 per cent of the Gaza Strip—leave civilians exposed to the dangers of hostilities and deprived of access to essential services. For nearly two months, North Gaza governorate has been under a tightening siege, leaving between 65,000 and 75,000 people without regular access to food, water, electricity or reliable health care, as mass casualty incidents continue. 'Our humanitarian partners report that the entire population of Gaza needs humanitarian assistance, including more than 58,000 people with disabilities who face further challenges in accessing food there' OCHA said. In the South, some people are skipping meals and searching through trash to find food —or resorting to desperate measures, including early marriage or child labour. Despite the catastrophic situation, OCHA warns that humanitarian access continues to be obstructed. In November, out of 578 planned aid movements across Gaza that require coordination with Israeli authorities, 41 per cent were facilitated. More than a third were denied outright, and the rest were either impeded or cancelled due to security and logistical challenges. Once again, OCHA underscores that civilians must be able to receive the humanitarian assistance they need. Whether they move or whether they stay, they must have assistance and they must be protected—and those who flee must be allowed to return as soon as circumstances allow. Meanwhile, the growing new humanitarian crisis In Syria has taken a turn for the worse. Angelita Caredda, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s (NRC) Middle East and North Africa Regional Director, said: 'The recent escalation in Syria threatens to drag the country back into the darkest days of this near 14-year conflict'. 'Civilian casualties are rising because of shelling and airstrikes, and thousands of families have been displaced. We call on all parties to adhere to international law in their conduct of hostilities'. 'The humanitarian situation has significantly deteriorated in recent days. In Aleppo, NRC teams report food shortages as bakeries and shops shut down. Damage to water networks has also reduced domestic water supplies. With almost 17 million people already in need of humanitarian aid and thousands recently displaced from Lebanon, Syrians have had to grapple with desperate economic conditions. An open conflict would further erode their ability to provide for their families.' 'The needs are immense; people who arrive at the shelters tell us they had left home fearing for their lives and brought nothing to shield them from the winter cold. NRC is providing limited critical services for people displaced by the recent events and stands ready to scale up our response. We call for guarantees to ensure the safety of our aid colleagues and the people we serve. Funding for humanitarian aid must be urgently pledged by donors. The latest violent events must not be allowed to descend into another deadly chapter in this decade of suffering. Syrians have endured years of displacement, pain and loss, and they long for peace and for a better, safer future for their children.' According to the NRC: Thousands have fled their homes over the past few days, with over 6,000 families arriving in Damascus (OCHA); at least 16.7 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Syria (HRP); and over 3,000 Lebanese people crossed into Syria since the ceasefire in Lebanon	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdfJVeDPSIdrE3LW3k80xfV	2024-12-05T16:03:42-08:00	
Former Kosovo Guerrilla Officer Claims ‘Victory’ As War Crime Inv...	By Xhorxhina Bami Sokol Bashota, a former member of the General Staff of the Kosovo Liberation Army, KLA, welcomed a halt to Kosovo Specialist Prosecutor’s Office investigations into him after he finished a week of testimony in the war crimes trial of former Kosovo President Hashim Thaci and three others in The Hague on Thursday. Bashota, also a former mayor of Kline/Klina and a former MP for the opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo, PDK, recalled that the Hague-based Specialist Prosecutor’s Office started questioning him in 2019. 'After five years of investigations, on November 19, 2024, I was officially notified that all the investigations against me have been halted,' Bashota wrote on Facebook after he finished his testimony. 'The suspension of the investigations against me is not only my victory but also a triumph of the purity of the war of the Kosovo Liberation Army,' he added. During his testimony, which started on November 28, 2024, Bashota told the court that even after the KLA was structured and the General Staff was formed, the KLA’s Operational Zones elected their own commanders and had much control over their areas. 'After the structuring, the General Staff only confirmed their names as zone commanders,' Bashota told the court. The defence in the Thaci trial is seeking to prove that the KLA did not have a rigid command structure like a normal army, and so the defendants were not responsible for crimes were committed by lower-ranking fighters. According to Bashota, before the General Staff was formed, another structure operated, of which Thaci was not a member. Bashota told the court that former KLA commander Bislim Zyrapi and other career military officers decided to start structuring the KLA because groups were operating separately and without 'control'. But he said problems with fighters on the ground continued nonetheless, and one such case was the July 1998 attack on Rahovec/Orohovac. The indictment against Thaci and three others claims that, 'in mid-July 1998, KLA units attacked Rahovec/Orahovac and its surrounding villages, during which Serb civilians were abducted and later detained, mistreated, and killed.' But Bashota told the court that the Operational Zones, not the General Staff, decided on the attack on Rahovec/Orohovac. 'It was a very big mistake,' he said. 'We were not prepared to enter and attack a place where civilians reside because of the high scale of risk to the citizens, and we did not dare to take such a decision in urban areas,' he added. 'It had its own consequences. We had big losses there and it was a miscoordination of the soldiers in that area,' he continued. Thaci and three other defendants, Jakup Krasniqi, Rexhep Selimi and Kadri Veseli, are accused of having individual and command responsibility for crimes committed against prisoners held at KLA detention facilities in Kosovo and Albania, including 102 murders. The crimes were allegedly committed between at least March 1998 and September 1999, during and just after the war in Kosovo. The defendants have pleaded not guilty. The Specialist Chambers are part of Kosovo’s judicial system but are located in The Hague and staffed by internationals, established under pressure from the country’s Western allies who believed Kosovo’s own justice system was not robust enough to try KLA cases and protect witnesses from intimidation. However, many Kosovo Albanians believe the court is ethnically biased and denigrates the KLA’s just war against Serbian repression.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdfJVeDPSIdrOGrDcjRcqKI	2024-12-05T15:58:58-08:00	
Implantable Sensors Unlock Ability To Continuously Monitor Inflam...	Proteins are the building blocks of life, and changes in protein levels can indicate improving health or impending illness, including signs of inflammation. While protein levels can be measured in periodic blood or urine tests, it has been an uphill challenge to figure out how to continuously monitor protein levels in the human body in real time. Now, a team of bioengineers at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago, supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Northwestern University present a major milestone in that effort: sensors implanted under the skin that track protein changes in living animals as those changes occur. In proof-of-concept tests, described December 5, 2024 in Science, the novel technology accurately and sensitively measured protein biomarkers of inflammation in diabetic rats. The work is a significant step toward a deeper understanding of inflammation, one of the most complex and important phenomena in the human body. An estimated 50% of all deaths are attributed to inflammation-related diseases, including cancer and heart disease. The new technology lays the foundation for future tools to monitor, track, and someday even prevent inflammation in individuals. Such ability could radically change the treatment of inflammation-related illnesses, similar to how continuous glucose monitors revolutionized the treatment of diabetes by improving patient outcomes and lowering overall healthcare costs. 'This is a completely new capability – to be able to watch inflammation in real time,' said senior author Shana Kelley, president of CZ Biohub Chicago and professor of chemistry and bioengineering at Northwestern University. 'We hope one day this technology will benefit many people and provide a means to prevent advanced disease.' Shake it off When CZ Biohub Chicago launched in 2023, the team set a goal of embedding bioelectronic sensors into tissues to monitor inflammation. To do that, the team first needed a way to measure levels of protein cytokines, chemical messengers produced by the immune system that bind to cells to induce inflammation. But there was a problem. While numerous sensors exist to continuously detect small molecules, such as glucose or electrolytes, sensors for proteins – which are larger and more complex than small molecules – have proven to be more challenging. To detect proteins in biological fluids, scientists rely on molecules or proteins that strongly attach to proteins to pull them out of fluid. That Velcro-like attachment, however, is so strong that the receptors hold on for more than 20 hours, making it impossible to measure real-time fluctuations in protein levels. 'We recognized this fundamental obstacle, and developed the idea that maybe we can shake the proteins right off of the sensors,' said Kelley. 'And the first time we tried it, it worked beautifully.' The team developed nanoscale sensors that look like rows of bulbous pendulums, each consisting of a cord of DNA with a larger piece of DNA on the end to bind a desired protein. Those sticky pendulums 'catch' target proteins, then shake back and forth to fling those proteins off and catch others within a minute. Next, the team engineered an implantable microdevice with the sensors embedded inside a thin microneedle, the width of three human hairs, similar to microneedles inside continuous glucose monitors used by people with diabetes to track blood glucose. The scientists implanted the device into the skin of rats with diabetes. Diabetes and inflammation are tightly linked, with many of the complications of diabetes caused by inflammation. The sensors successfully measured concentration changes of two cytokine proteins, markers of inflammation, in the fluid just under the skin of the rats. When the rats fasted and blood glucose levels were under control, the sensors detected the levels of the cytokines drifting down. Conversely, when the rats were injected with a substance that agitates the immune system, the sensors recorded inflammatory cytokine levels rapidly shooting up. ‘The sky’s the limit’ Currently, Kelley and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago team are using the sensors to study inflammation in rats under diverse conditions, and incorporating the sensors into a variety of tissue models of inflammation. By embedding tissues with thousands of sensors and sampling probes, the Biohub’s collaborative team of scientists, engineers, technologists, and physicians are working toward monitoring the activity of immune cells in real time, aiming to find ways to steer the immune system away from the 'tipping points' that lead to inflammatory disorders. The ultimate goal is to find a way to use this technology for human health tracking. If researchers can more deeply understand and monitor inflammation in the human body in real-time, they may be able to intervene, and even prevent, inflammation-related diseases in the future, dramatically transforming healthcare and saving lives. 'Like continuous glucose monitoring opened up the ability to monitor patients with diabetes in real time, this has the same potential to allow us to monitor, and even prevent, many diseases,' says Kelley. 'With inflammation, the sky's the limit with what you could do for your health by keeping a handle on it.' The work represents a significant step forward in CZ Biohub Chicago’s mission to build technology to make precise, molecular-level measurements of biological processes within human tissues. These initial results are a direct result of the CZ Biohub Network’s collaborative model for scientific research. CZ Biohub Chicago is one of four institutes in the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Network.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfR9y544E2ryruPn9HdMqb3	2024-12-05T15:15:18-08:00	
Mangroves Save $855 Billion In Flood Protection Globally	Mangroves have been shown to provide $855 billion in flood protection services worldwide, according to a new study from the Center for Coastal Climate Resilience at UC Santa Cruz. The research, conducted by project co-lead, Pelayo Menendez and center director, Michael W. Beck, is featured in the World Bank's 2024 edition of The Changing Wealth of Nations. The study, titled Building Coastal Resilience with Mangroves: The Contribution of Natural Flood Defenses to the Changing Wealth of Nations, highlights the essential role mangroves play in protecting coastal communities from floods, storm surges, and erosion, offering significant benefits to both people and national economies. As climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of storms, the need for effective coastal defenses has become increasingly urgent. Traditionally, governments have turned to hard infrastructure like seawalls and levees to guard against floods. However, the center’s study reveals that natural ecosystems—particularly mangroves—can be equally, if not more, effective as coastal defenses, while providing additional environmental benefits. Mangroves were first included as coastal protection assets by the World Bank in the 2021 edition of The Changing Wealth of Nations. This new research expands upon that earlier work by incorporating updated global data from 2020, offering a clearer picture of mangroves' protective value over time. Using advanced flood risk models, Menendez and Beck analyzed mangrove forests in 121 countries, covering 700,000 kilometers of subtropical coastlines. The study finds that the value of mangroves for flood-risk reduction is rising dramatically, in large part because of increasing populations, wealth and storms on coastlines around the world. From 1996 to 2010, the value of mangroves for flood-risk reduction increased by $130 billion, and from 2010 to 2020, mangrove long-term benefits rose by an additional $502 billion. Despite some declines in mangrove cover—driven by factors such as shrimp farming and coastal development—their value as flood buffers grew as more people and infrastructure came to rely on their protection. 'The results are clear: Mangroves play a critical role in reducing flood risks and should be viewed as valuable natural assets,' Menendez said. 'They offer cost-effective protection to coastal communities and support national wealth by preserving lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure.' The research goes beyond the environmental importance of mangroves, underscoring their economic value as natural capital assets. The $855 billion figure represents the present value of mangroves' flood protection services, i.e., the benefits of this natural infrastructure over the next 100 years. The countries benefiting most from these services every year include China, Vietnam, Australia, the United States, and India. The study also shows that while mangrove loss continued from 2010 to 2020, the rate of decline slowed significantly to just 0.66 percent. In that same period, the protective benefits provided by mangroves grew even faster than the overall flood risk. This marks a turning point, with mangroves protecting 61 percent more people and safeguarding 109 percent more capital assets from floods in 2020 compared to a decade earlier. Countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, China, and Cameroon benefited most from these gains, with mangroves protecting hundreds of thousands of people each year. On the other hand, countries such as Malaysia, Myanmar, and Taiwan saw a decline in mangrove benefits, highlighting the need for increased conservation efforts in these regions. The findings come at a critical time as countries around the world search for sustainable solutions to rising climate risks. Mangroves offer a natural, cost-effective solution to flood protection, making them an essential component of any climate-adaptation strategy. As governments and policymakers look to the future, the study provides a compelling case for investing in the conservation and restoration of mangroves. 'Protecting and restoring mangroves isn’t just good for the environment—it’s a smart economic choice,' Beck said. 'These ecosystems provide invaluable services that help build resilience against the growing threats of climate change.' The Center for Coastal Climate Resilience has also released these results and data as part of the Coastal Resilience Explorer decision-support tool.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfR9y544E2rypQEiKOodWDP	2024-12-05T15:13:11-08:00	
Scientists ‘Turn Up The Heat’ On Understanding Coffee Wilt Diseas...	Scientists, including those from Imperial College London, University of Oxford and CABI, have ‘turned up the heat’ on how repeated outbreaks of coffee wilt disease threatened arabica and robusta varieties of our favourite daily coffee brew. The scientists, who present their findings in the journal PLoS Biology, say the fungal pathogen Fusarium xylarioides continues to pose a significant threat to coffee production and incomes across sub-Saharan Africa. Their work supports earlier findings, based on DNA markers and crossing experiments which suggested that F. xylarioides is a species complex containing distinct, host-specific populations. The scientists confirm the presence of genetically differentiated lineages with different host-specificity for arabica and robusta coffee and show that the fungal pathogen F. xylarioides repeatedly took up 'horizontally transferred' segments of DNA from a related fungal Fusarium taxa which contributed to successive outbreaks of the disease. Primary source of income for more than 12 million households Coffee is a primary source of income for more than 12 million households in Africa and contributes a significant proportion of tax revenue in a number of these countries, with Ethiopia, for example, recording an export value of $762.8m annually. Yet repeated outbreaks of coffee wilt disease have continued to decimate coffee production in east and central Africa since the 1920s, affecting yields and farmer incomes. As part of this study, the scientists compared the genomes of 13 historical strains of F. xylarioides spanning six decades from CABI’s Culture Collection, to identify the evolutionary process behind these repeated outbreaks of coffee wilt disease. Dr Matthew Ryan, Senior Research Lead, Biological Resources at CABI and a co-author of the paper, co-supervised lead author of the research, Dr Lily Peck, of Imperial College London, together with Professor Tim Barraclough from the University of Oxford. Crucial to understand genetic structure and evolutionary potential Dr Peck said, 'To improve the disease management of fungal pathogens such as Fusarium xylarioides, it is crucial to understand their genetic structure and evolutionary potential. 'We found that F. xylarioides comprised at least four distinct lineages: one host-specific to arabica, one to robusta and two historic lineages isolated from various coffee species. 'The presence/absence of large genomic regions across these lineages showed that horizontal transfers of effector genes, namely genes that are important in establishing successful infection, contributed to establishing host specificity.' Dr Peck also said that multiple transfers into F. xylarioides populations matched different parts of the Fusarium oxysporum mobile pathogenicity chromosome and were enriched in effector genes and transposons. Transposons, also known as 'jumping genes,' are DNA sequences that can move around in genomes. They are found in many organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, humans, mice, fruit flies and frogs. Shown by transcriptomics to be highly expressed during infection Effector genes and other carbohydrate-active enzymes important in the breakdown of plant cell walls were shown by transcriptomics to be highly expressed during infection of arabica coffee by the pathogenic arabica strains. Professor Barraclough said, 'Widespread sharing of specific transposons between F. xylarioides and F. oxysporum, and the correspondence of a putative horizontally transferred region to a Starship (recently identified large mobile elements which are involved in fungal horizontal gene transfers), reinforce the inference of horizontal transfers and suggest that mobile elements were involved. 'Our results support the hypothesis that horizontal gene transfers contributed to the repeated emergence of coffee wilt disease.' Potentially lucrative export of various coffee varieties Dr Ryan said the research findings potentially show what is happening more widely in relation to fungi and gives scientists the potential to further build on Dr Peck’s study in the future. 'The fact that horizontal gene transfers between two different species of Fusariumcontributed to the repeated emergence of coffee wilt disease is a key mechanism to understand what is happening more widely in fungi – to what extent, we just do not know,' he said. The scientists suggest that horizontal transfer could have occurred in a ‘shared niche,’ as both F. xylarioides and F. oxysporum are soil-borne pathogens and have been isolated from the roots and wood of coffee wilt-diseased trees in Ethiopia and central Africa, and from the roots of a banana tree in central Africa. They add that knowledge of horizontal transfer mechanisms and putative donor taxa might help to design future intercropping strategies that minimize the risk of transfer of effector genes between closely related Fusarium taxa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfR9y544E2rygDt-aQZLHcE	2024-12-05T15:11:52-08:00	
Exploring Promise And Perils Of AI For Scientific Community – Boo...	In late 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot able to generate conversational answers and analyses, as well as images, in response to user questions and prompts. This generative AI was built with computational procedures, such as large language models, that train on vast bodies of human-created and curated data, including scientific literature. Since then, the worry that AI may someday outsmart humans has grown more widespread. In a new collection of essays, leading experts provide a historical perspective on and an ethical approach to emerging AI technologies; an overview of AI frameworks and principles; and an assessment of AI’s current advances, hurdles, and potential. Realizing the Promise and Minimizing the Perils of AI for Science and the Scientific Community (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2024) contains contributions from experts in behavioral and social sciences, ethics, biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and computer science, as well as leaders in higher education, law, governance, and science publishing and communication. Their essays remind us that, even as our understandings of emerging technologies and their implications evolve, science’s commitment to core norms and values must remain steadfast. The volume’s conclusion advocates for following principles of human accountability and responsibility when using artificial intelligence in research, including transparent disclosure and attribution; verification and documentation of AI-generated data and analysis; a focus on ethics and equity; and continuous oversight and public engagement. The editors The volume’s essays emerged from retreats organized in 2023-24 by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, The Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands, and the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Its editors are: Kathleen Hall Jamieson is the Elizabeth Ware Packard Professor of Communication and Director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.William Kearney is the Executive Director of the Office of News and Public Information and Editor of Issues in Science and Technology at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in Washington, D.C.Anne-Marie Mazza is the Senior Director of the Committee on Science, Technology, and Law and Senior Advisor of the Policy and Global Affairs Division at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in Washington, D.C. Challenges of the AI age In the book’s concluding chapter, 'Safeguarding the Norms and Values of Science in the Age of Generative AI,' Jamieson and National Academy of Sciences President Marcia K. McNutt call on the scientific community to ensure that the norms of science, including accountability and the transparency that makes replicability possible, are honored in the development of AI. They argue that AI poses special challenges to these norms through complications such as the 'transformations that AI portends, the pace with which its capacities are evolving, and the opacity of its systems.' For example, they note that most data-intensive AI applications are 'essentially opaque, ‘black-box’ systems,' making it challenging to determine accountability. '… Governments around the globe have instituted structures to monitor and oversee the development of generative AI,' McNutt and Jamieson write. 'It is both appropriate and necessary that the scientific community and the disciplines within it to do the same.'

Political Clans In Central Asia: Drivers Of Governance And Confli...	Tribes and clans are fundamental to the social and political identity of the Central Asian populace. The region, encompassing Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan, has long been a stronghold of intricate clan-based networks, each with a deep historical legacy. These informal groups are more than sociocultural units; they wield significant influence over political and economic structures. Central Asia’s political framework exhibits a vertical hierarchy of identity: individuals identify first with their tribe, then with a broader tribal federation, subsequently with a clan (an extended family or lineage group), and finally with their region or homeland. Historically, clans have played a pivotal role in state-building, acting as both stabilizing forces and agents of disruption. Despite efforts by conquerors such as Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, and even Stalin, no power has fully dismantled this intricate clan system. Stalin’s deliberate creation of Soviet-designed nations—Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Turkmen, Uzbek, and Tajik—was intended to replace tribal loyalties with national identities. However, with the Soviet Union's collapse, these republics found themselves as states lacking cohesive nationhood. Theoretical Perspectives on Clan Politics Marxist theory posits that clan structures in Central Asia are rooted in economic exploitation. During the Soviet era, elite clans monopolized the profits of cotton production, relegating non-elite clans to labor-intensive roles, creating a quasi-feudal hierarchy. Elite theorists like Vilfredo Pareto and Gaetano Mosca argue that societies are governed by a small group of elites. In Central Asia, this translates into dominant clans controlling political and economic resources, while non-elite clans maintain stability through kinship ties. This mutual dependency ensures the persistence of clan networks, even under modern state frameworks. Dominant Clans in the Five Central Asian Republics Kazakhstan: Kazakh clans, or Zhuz (hordes), are divided into three main groups—Senior, Middle, and Junior Zhuz. The Senior Zhuz (Uly Zhuz), exemplified by the Alimuly clan, holds historical prominence. Clan dynamics became evident during the January 2022 unrest, where inter-clan rivalries, particularly within the ruling elite, exacerbated tensions. Uzbekistan: Uzbek clans are predominantly region-based. Major clans include the Samarkand, Tashkent, and Ferghana clans, along with sub-clans such as the Kungrats and Barlas. The Samarkand clan’s influence, especially under Islam Karimov’s presidency, dominated national politics. Despite Karimov’s efforts to centralize power, regional clan rivalries persisted, undermining his authority and complicating policy implementation. Tajikistan: Tajikistan’s clans are distinguished by geography and professional orientation. For instance, the Bonokhonova clan represents the elite Tajik intelligentsia, while the Kulyab clan has historically engaged in crime and illicit trade. The Pamiri Tajiks, a minority group, are known for their Islamic intellectual contributions, and the Khodzhent Tajiks have dominated education. During the Tajik Civil War (1992–1997), these divisions fueled conflict, with each clan mobilizing militias to secure resources and political leverage. Kyrgyzstan: Kyrgyz clans are split into two factions: the Northern (Sol) and Southern (Ichkilik) wings. Northern clans like Buguu and Sarybagysh have historically held political sway, producing leaders like Askar Akayev. The Southern Adygine clan, while numerically smaller, maintains significant influence in southern Kyrgyzstan, often challenging northern dominance. Turkmenistan: Turkmen clans are regionally delineated, with the Teke clan dominating the south, the Yomut in the southwest, the Khorezm in the north, and the Ersari in the east. Sub-clans like Akhal and Mary have been implicated in drug trafficking, a lucrative enterprise in the region. Saparmurat Niyazov, or 'Turkmenbashi,' strategically balanced these clan interests to maintain his authoritarian regime. Clans: Mechanisms of Influence Clans significantly shape the political systems of Central Asian countries in multiple ways, primarily due to their pervasive influence on governance, power dynamics, and resource allocation. Below are some key mechanisms through which clans impact the political framework: 1. Patronage and Elite Networks Clans in Central Asia often function as patronage systems, where political leaders secure loyalty and support by distributing resources and privileges within their clan networks. These networks influence appointments in government, control of state enterprises, and access to economic opportunities. For example in Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev's long tenure as president was bolstered by the support of his inner clan circle, which monopolized key industries and institutions. In Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov consolidated power by marginalizing opposition clans and favoring his Samarkand-Tashkent faction. 2. Inter-Clan Rivalries and Political Instability Competition among clans often destabilizes the political system, as rival groups vie for dominance and access to state resources. This rivalry can escalate into violent conflicts, especially in weaker states with poor governance structures. The Tajikistan Civil War (1992–1997) exemplifies how inter-clan disputes, such as those between the Kulyab, Pamir, and Khujand clans, can lead to prolonged instability and conflict. The recent unrest in Kazakhstan (2022), partly attributed to clan competition, underscores how unresolved rivalries can fuel protests and political crises. 3. Influence on Policy-Making Clan-based allegiances shape policy decisions, often prioritizing the interests of dominant clans over national objectives. Leaders frequently tailor economic, social, and administrative policies to benefit their clan members. In Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Niyazov (Turkmenbashi) used energy wealth to appease influential clans while ensuring their continued allegiance to his authoritarian regime. In Kyrgyzstan, clan influence has affected electoral outcomes and governance, with leaders like Askar Akayev relying on clan support to navigate the country’s pluralistic yet clan-driven political landscape. 4. Control Over Regional and Local Governance Clans often dominate local and regional governance structures, acting as intermediaries between the central government and the population. They manage resource distribution, dispute resolution, and law enforcement at a local level, sometimes bypassing state mechanisms. In Uzbekistan, clans based in regions like Ferghana, Samarkand, and Khorezm maintain significant control over local governance and resource allocation. 5. Electioneering and Electoral Dynamics Elections in Central Asia are frequently influenced by clan affiliations rather than political ideologies or party platforms. Clan leaders mobilize their networks to secure votes, ensuring their representation in government. In Kyrgyzstan, presidential elections often see clan-backed candidates leveraging their networks to outmaneuver rivals, undermining the principles of fair competition. 6. Informal Economy and Corruption Clans play a central role in informal economic activities, which often intersect with political corruption. By leveraging their kinship ties, clan networks control lucrative industries, including energy, cotton, and transportation, thereby influencing national economies. In Tajikistan, cotton production has long been controlled by elite clans, which divert state resources for their benefit, creating a dual economy that prioritizes clan wealth over national development. 7. Resistance to Institutionalization Clan politics often impede the development of strong, independent institutions. The reliance on clan networks undermines the rule of law, weakens state institutions, and discourages merit-based governance. In Turkmenistan, the personalization of governance under Niyazov, supported by clan alliances, hindered institutional reforms and perpetuated autocratic rule. 8. Peace building and Conflict Resolution While clans are a source of conflict, they also play a role in mediating disputes and restoring stability. Clan leaders often broker agreements during crises, leveraging their influence to de-escalate tensions. The peace agreement in Tajikistan after the civil war allocated 30% of government power to opposition factions, demonstrating the role of clan networks in stabilizing post-conflict societies. The role of clans in Central Asia is a double-edged sword. While they provide social cohesion and local governance, their influence often undermines democratic principles, perpetuates corruption, and fuels instability. Any attempt to modernize the political systems of Central Asian countries must address the entrenched power of clans, balancing their historical significance with the need for institutional reform and good governance. Clan Politics: Soviet Legacy and Beyond Soviet Era Suppression: Under Stalin, clans were tightly controlled to prevent them from undermining the centralized Soviet state. However, the imposition of communist ideology often failed to erase clan identities. Clans adapted, using their networks to exploit state resources. For example, in Uzbekistan, clans siphoned off profits from the lucrative cotton industry, despite the Soviet Union’s punitive measures against corruption. Post-Soviet Revival: The disintegration of the USSR in 1991 marked a resurgence of clan influence. Leaders like Islam Karimov in Uzbekistan and Emomali Rahmon in Tajikistan relied on clan networks to consolidate power. Rahmon, for instance, leveraged his Kulyabi clan to suppress opposition and stabilize his regime after the Tajik Civil War. Central Asian Tribes VS Tribes of the other World The working of Central Asian clans differs from clan structures in other parts of the world in terms of historical context, socio-political integration, and their impact on governance. These differences are shaped by the unique historical, cultural, and geopolitical environments of Central Asia compared to regions such as the Middle East, Africa, or Europe. Below are key distinctions with relevant examples: 1. Historical Evolution and Socio-Political Role Central Asia: Clans in Central Asia are deeply rooted in nomadic traditions and kinship-based social organization. Their influence was formalized during the Soviet era, as clan leaders were co-opted into state structures to maintain order. After independence, they re-emerged as dominant players in post-Soviet politics, filling the vacuum left by weak state institutions. In Uzbekistan, the Ferghana, Samarkand, and Tashkent clans became central players in shaping the nation's politics after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Other Regions: In the Middle East, clan dynamics are often tied to tribalism and sectarian identities, which have persisted for centuries without formal integration into colonial or modern state systems. Tribal loyalty often competes with national identity. In Iraq, the al-Dulaimi and al-Jiburi tribes exert influence over both Sunni and Shia factions, often bypassing formal state structures. In Africa, clans are rooted in pre-colonial tribal systems and are more fragmented due to colonial boundaries. Clan conflicts often intersect with ethnic divisions. In Somalia, the Darod and Hawiye clans dominate the political landscape, with frequent inter-clan violence disrupting state-building efforts. 2. Integration with State Institutions Central Asia: Central Asian clans are intertwined with formal political and economic structures, where leaders use clan loyalties to consolidate power. Unlike other regions, clans here often operate within state apparatuses rather than outside them. In Tajikistan, President Emomali Rahmon relies on his Kulyab clan to dominate political appointments and resource allocation. Other Regions: In the Middle East, clans often function outside the formal state system, acting as intermediaries in local disputes and resisting centralized governance. In Jordan, Bedouin tribes such as the Bani Sakhr are significant but operate largely as parallel power structures, influencing governance informally. In Sub-Saharan Africa, clans often operate as traditional authorities parallel to state institutions, particularly in rural areas. In Nigeria, clan and ethnic affiliations influence local politics and are often sources of contention during elections. 3. Impact on Governance and Corruption Central Asia: Clans in Central Asia institutionalize corruption through patronage systems that control economic resources and state industries. Their influence often reinforces authoritarianism, where leaders maintain clan loyalty to suppress dissent. In Kazakhstan, the Nazarbayev family's dominance was reinforced by clan alliances, controlling strategic sectors like oil and gas. Other Regions: In the Middle East, clan-based governance often manifests as a form of informal mediation, but it rarely becomes institutionalized in state corruption mechanisms. In Yemen, tribal leaders negotiate with the government for development projects and arms supplies, but without full state integration. In Africa, clans are less likely to dominate national-level governance but play a significant role in local corruption and resource competition. In Somalia, competition among clans over international aid and natural resources exacerbates corruption and weakens state-building efforts. 4. Role in Conflict and Stability Central Asia: In Central Asia, inter-clan rivalries are primarily political rather than ethnic or religious. They revolve around control of state power and resources, often using the state apparatus as a battleground. In Kyrgyzstan, the 2010 conflict between northern and southern clans significantly shaped the country’s political transition. Other Regions: In the Middle East and Africa, clan rivalries are often intertwined with ethnic, sectarian, or ideological divides, leading to protracted violence. In Syria, the al-Assad regime leverages support from the Alawite clan to dominate Sunni-majority regions. In South Sudan, clashes between the Dinka and Nuer clans have led to a civil war that continues to destabilize the region. 5. Economic Control and Resource Allocation Central Asia: Central Asian clans dominate strategic industries, such as energy, agriculture, and transport, often turning them into clan-controlled monopolies. This direct control of key sectors is less pronounced in other regions. In Turkmenistan, clan affiliations dictate control over lucrative gas exports, with the dominant clan benefiting disproportionately. Other Regions: In the Middle East, clans typically manage resources at a local level rather than monopolizing national industries. In Libya, clans influence oil production, but control is fragmented due to a lack of centralized authority. In Africa, clan-based resource control often fuels local conflicts rather than integrating into national economies. In Kenya, ethnic and clan-based disputes over land and water resources frequently lead to violence. While clans in Central Asia share similarities with those in other regions, their integration into state structures, dominance over strategic industries, and influence on national-level politics make their role unique. Unlike regions where clans operate as external or informal power brokers, Central Asian clans have effectively become part of the state machinery, shaping governance, stability, and development in ways distinct from clan systems in Africa or the Middle East. Case Studies: Clan Politics in Action Uzbekistan: Islam Karimov’s authoritarian regime marginalized opposition clans to prevent unrest. However, his measures, such as currency demonetization, disproportionately affected rival clans, creating economic disparities. Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s tenure has seen similar patterns, with reforms like new electoral laws often favoring dominant clan networks. Tajikistan: The civil war of the 1990s exemplified the dangers of unchecked clan rivalries. Emomali Rahmon’s eventual consolidation of power relied on strategic concessions to opposition factions, including allocating 30% of government positions to rival clans. His 'salad bowl' strategy of governance, blending economic centralization with targeted disarmament, brought relative stability but entrenched clan politics. Kyrgyzstan: Despite its democratic aspirations, Kyrgyzstan remains heavily influenced by clan networks. Akayev’s presidency was supported by northern clans, but his downfall in the 2005 Tulip Revolution revealed the fragility of clan-based pacts when broader public demands for reform emerged. Clans remain a cornerstone of Central Asia’s sociopolitical landscape, bridging the gap between traditional kinship systems and contemporary state structures. Their influence is both a source of resilience and a barrier to democratic development. As the region grapples with economic challenges, political reforms, and external pressures, the role of clans will continue to shape its trajectory, underscoring their enduring relevance in Central Asian politics.

West Philippine Sea Flashpoint, Minilaterelism And Trump 2.0: Geo...	In March 27, 2024, China Coast Guard ship 4103 suffered holes in its hull above waterline after its collision with the Philippine Coast Guard's (PCG) Japanese-made Parola-class 44-meter long, 320 ton multirole response cutter BRP Cabra (MRRV-4409). This was followed by a series of coercive acts by China against Filipino fishermen and a serious threat to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Philippines – an overt portrayal of the deteriorating diplomatic and political relationship between the two countries. To recall, China Coast Guard (CCG) and Chinese Maritime Militia (CMM) vessels made an aggressive interference during the humanitarian Rotation and Reprovisioning (RoRe) mission to BRP Sierra Madre (LS57) at Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal. On June 17, 2024 (Monday) at 5:59 AM, CCG and CMM vessels used dangerous maneuvers, including ramming and towing against supply boats of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). These coercive and aggressive actions during the RoRe mission, an example of which is where a CCG personnel was caught on camera while threatening to injure an AFP soldier with pickaxe, resulted in severe damage to AFP vessels, including their communication and navigation equipment. An addition to this was when Chinese maritime forces injured eight Philippine Navy (PN) soldiers, one of whom suffered a serious injury, and seized their guns in a violent encounter. The seriously injured PN fighter, who formed part of the elite Naval Special Operations Group (NAVSOG), reportedly lost one of his fingers when the forward portion of the CCG rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB) went on top of the Filipino watercraft . Considering the weight and speed of the CCG RHIB when it collided with the Filipino watercraft, the force of the impact caused the troops to lose their balance and mobility. Worth noting is the fact that the assaults by the CCG against Philippine vessels were committed by either water cannon and/or ramming the watercraft. Even extending to the point whereby it was alleged that in addition to the use of water cannons, there were suspected militia vessels accompanying the CCG that used a long-range acoustic device that could impair hearing and cause 'severe temporary discomfort and incapacitation.' Another instance to remember prior to the June 17 West Philippine Sea (WPS) incident was threatening maneuvers and obstruction when four (4) CCG ships and six (6) Chinese maritime militia boats fired water cannons at PCG vessel BRP Bagacay and Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessel BRP Bankaw in Bajo de Masinloc during a resupply mission and maritime patrol operation. A string of recent stand-offs at Sabina Shoal have sparked calls for the Philippines to urgently rethink its South China Sea strategy – though opinions are divided over its best course of action. When Manila deployed the BRP Teresa Magbanua to Sabina Shoal more than four months ago, it was claimed that such were innocent movement on the part of the Philippines in securing maritime security to which China contest otherwise. Sabina Shoal or known to the Philippines as Escoda Shoal is located some 146km west of the Palawan Island and lies within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines and around 1,200km from the nearest major Chinese land mass, Hainan. Highlighting the event which transpired last August 11, two (2) Chinese Air Force aircraft dropped flares in the path of a Philippine Air Force plane while the latter was on a routine patrol over the Bajo de Masinloc, which is within the Philippines' EEZ, putting the lives of the Filipino soldiers at risk. In terms of capacity and capability of China, on August 14, the Philippine Navy (PN) stated that the number of Chinese military vessels in the WPS had nearly tripled compared to a count conducted earlier that month. Both instances only prove China's overarching expansionist ambitions toward the WPS remains undeterred in all fronts. These acts by the People's Republic of China (PRC) are inconsistent with international law and are the latest in repeated threats to the status quo in the South China Sea, directly threatening regional peace and stability. By impeding necessary provisions from reaching the Filipino service members stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, the PRC has also undertaken unwarranted interference in lawful Philippine maritime operations. On a high note, the President's visit to the Western Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in Palawan last June 23 paved way to narratives and policy direction. After his talk to the troops, especially to the members of the WESCOM who conducted the RORE mission to Ayungin Shoal last June 17, the President gave his commitment and resolve to support the dedicated and courageous men and women in the Armed Forces in their fight to defend Philippine territory. Strongly mentioned in his speech dated June 24 was, '(h)istory itself can tell that we have never, never in the Philippines yielded to any foreign power. We owe to our forefathers the duty to keep the freedoms that they fought, bled and died for, and that they presently enjoy. With this, the Philippines has been on strong stance in numerous instances echoing the nations' will of not giving up an inch, not even a millimeter of its territory to any foreign power. Looking into the lens of Indo-Pacific Security and Philippine Strategic Policy This strategic policy intent was guided by over-all geopolitical alignment of the Philippines in Indo-Pacific Security and ASEAN partnerships. On one occasion, Secretary of National Defense Atty. Gilbert Teodoro said that what ensued in the Ayungin is not a misunderstanding or an accident. It is a deliberate act of the Chinese officialdom to prevent Philippines from completing the resupply mission. He said, 'After our visit to our troops in Palawan yesterday, where the President personally talked to the troops involved in the RORE we have now come to a conclusion that it was not a misunderstanding or an accident. We are not downplaying the incident. It was an aggressive and illegal use of force. We, however, continue to find peaceful solutions to this issue. As pointed out by the President, 'we are not in the business to instigate wars. The Philippines is a responsible state. We will continue to exercise our freedoms and rights in support of our national interest, in accordance with international law.' The United States of America, on one hand, categorically said that US policy on the WPS has not changed and will continue to support Philippines, being one of its long standing ally, through the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). As of the present, President Bongbong Marcos gave the green light for the acquisition of Multi-Role Fighters according to AFP Chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. during today's First-semester command conference in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City. He reiterated that there was no decision yet as to what multi-role fighter to obtain or the numbers to procure. Another Rep. Raul 'Boboy' C. Tupas led a dialogue on May 20, 2024 on an alleged Gentleman's Agreement. Former Executive Secretary Salvador C. Medialdea, former Secretary of National Defense and now Chairperson of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) Delfin N. Lorenzana, and former National Security Adviser Hermogenes C. Esperon, Jr. were called last legislative inquiry about a thorough Investigation in aid of legislation on the reported Gentlemen's Agreement between former President Rodrigo R. Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Said officials all denied the existence of an alleged 'Gentleman's Agreement' but shared some information on the interactions between former President Rodrigo R. Duterte and People's Republic of China President Xi Jinping. Former ES Medialdea clarified that the 'status quo' practiced by the Duterte administration stemmed from the previous agreement entered by former Secretary of National Defense Voltaire Gazmin and an official from the Chinese embassy to supply only food and water to the troops in BRP Sierra Madre located in Ayungin Shoal. Note that a gentleman's agreement (e.g., executive agreement) is allowed under international law and does not require any formalities, however, its validity depends on its contents which must not be contrary to the Constitution of any state. Nonetheless, if there was an agreement, it was rescinded by current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. US, Japan, and Philippines Trilateral Defense Formula Meanwhile, prior to Trilateral Summit between US, Japan, and Philippines – as three Indo-Pacific maritime democracies last April, there was a call among agencies for a political dialogue to tackle Senate Bill No. 654 proposed by Senator Francis 'Tol' N. Tolentino or the Philippine Navy Archipelagic Defense Act that seeks to establish Philippine Navy forward operating bases. Director Jose Harry M. Barber of the Policy and Development and Planning Service (PDPS) of the Office of the Civil Defense (OCD) impressed something well-grounded during the last hearing on some Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) concerns last March 5, 2024. He manifested the agency's full support of the passage of subject bills and acknowledged the proposed bills' significance particularly at the local level through nature-based solution and cost-effective initiative. Following this, the Department of National Defense (DND) and other security sector member agencies became busy for the trilateral summit recently conducted. As a backgrounder, on April 10, 2024, US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio held an important bilateral summit which resulted in a historic agreement that upgraded these countries longstanding defense alliance by including and strengthening the following, to wit: 1. Establishment of a US-Japan Alliance Joint Command and Control Structure that will allow seamless integration of operations and capabilities between US forces in Japan and the Japan Self Defense Force (JSDF), allowing for greater inter-operability and planning during contingency and peacetime situations; 2. Japan together with the US and Australia would work on upgrading and integrating their defense communications and air defense networks to counter air and missile threats; 3. Japan would work together with US and Australia in joint development and manufacture of future weapon and defense systems; 4. Japanese shipyards will be participating in maintenance and repair of US naval ships in the region; 5. Japan and the US will establish a working group for cooperation on fighter pilot training, including development and use of AI and advanced simulators, and co-development and co-production of jet trainers; and 6. The US committed to start the training pipeline and ship modifications for Japan to acquire operational capability of the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) system, and cooperation in the development of the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program to counter high-end, regional hypersonic threats. The United States has also reiterated its unwavering commitment to the defense of Japan under Article V of the US-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation (their version of Mutual Defense Treaty) as well as confirming the inclusion of Senkaku Islands in the treaty coverage, as well as using the US' full range of capabilities including nuclear capabilities. Although not yet an actual commitment, the US together with its AUKUS partners Australia and the United Kingdom are considering including Japan in the AUKUS Pillar II program which aims to developed advanced defense capabilities. Now, these developments will definitely affect the security landscape of the region especially as Japan has started to make changes in the interpretation of its pacifist Constitution, as well as increase its defense spending to 2% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and making it the 3rd largest defense spender in the world in a few years. Way Ahead and Strategic Policy Direction as a Nation As way forward, the United States Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Tim Kaine (D-VA), members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on April 10, 2024 introduced the Philippines Enhanced Resilience Act of 2024 (PERA Act), a bill to strengthen and modernize the U.S.-Philippines alliance through significantly increased U.S. security assistance. The bipartisan legislation follows increased aggression by PRC in the South China Sea and comes as the United States, Japan, and the Philippines hold a leaders-level summit in Washington, D.C., on April 11, 2024. If approved as a law, the Philippines Enhanced Resilience Act of 2024 will authorize $500 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grant assistance to the Philippines annually for each of fiscal years 2025 through 2029—a total of $2.5 billion over five fiscal years. That is more than enough to allow the Philippine Air Force (PAF) to procure a squadron of F-16 Block 70 Vipers, and if the Philippine Government can find more funding, such can be added to allow the DND to procure between thirty-six (36) to forty-two (42) Vipers over the next five (5) years by bulk buying and make use of economies of scale. In this regard, the challenge lies on the re-election of President Donald Trump. How will the Philippines assess and navigate its defense posturing and national security stake with the reinstallation of Trump Administration vis-à-vis Marcos Administration? Will the US be actively joining the QUAD for China's containment or will it be more lax to re-emphasize its Making America Great Again (MAGA) political banner from domestic to external actors towards multilateral scale? Or US will be more focused on its minilateral political alignment i.e. a more US-centric and lesser stance in Middle-East policy such as the withdrawal of military enforcement in Iraq during its stint? Things like these need to be answered from both parties before this year ends as Ukraine-Russia War has been scaling up with North Korean intervention at the inception of new Russian strategic warfare, as well the continued tension between China and Taiwan in East Asian plethora; something that ASEAN and the Indo-Pacific Security member-states need to re-examine whether to navigate on various existing and prospective bilateral or multilateral mechanisms in the region. Also, to meet the challenges of the times, the DND is pursuing a new Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept (CADC) which aims to broaden the strategic depth of the AFP in protecting its forces within the country's legal boundaries. Long term plans and development of capabilities aligned with CADC, the AFP can preserve the interests and patrimony of the Filipino people. Further, the Philippines will continue its rotation and resupply missions on a regular basis for the welfare of Filipino troops in the BRP Sierra Madre - being a matter of utmost importance. To assure the security of Philippine troops and the citizenry, a stronger and more assertive stance on an international platform is crucial and must be prioritized over the desire of having China be held accountable for its legal ramifications and violations. Diplomatic and political security / defense cooperation efforts must be intensified to garner international support and recognition of our sovereign rights in the WPS. As a nation in the verge of security pandemonium, may we not forget to call out China's acts of aggressive militarization and dangerous tactical operation in order for Filipinos to show more commitment in devising peaceful and diplomatic solutions while at the same time pushing for strategic educational reforms that aims not only to educate but that the same time train the citizenry to be physically and intellectually prepared when the Nation calls for aid. The mandatory Reserve Officer's Training Corps (ROTC) with well-templated Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), if passed, will be the enabling legislation that will signify this call to action. At this juncture, diplomatic channels must remain to be utilized in addressing this pressing issue in accordance with international law. Furthermore, there must be an increased funding for the welfare and training of our troops stationed in the WPS. Filipino troops must be equipped and prepared to handle any aggressive maneuvers by foreign forces. Moreover, the Congress' support for the approval of budget allocations aimed at enhancing maritime defense capabilities if approved and implemented will be a huge step forward towards asserting our strategic geopolitical stance in the WPS. And lastly, genuine and in good faith recognition and support for the families of those affected by those past incidents are also vital. These are not trivial matters that the Philippines and even the ASEAN region can easily ignore, and so - to engage more with international partners in ensuring regional stability and security in the region amidst enmeshed geopolitical balancing act or recalibrated steps as another call to action for the Philippine policy direction to consider in the coming days. *Ideas and/or views expressed here are entirely independent and not in any form represent author's organization and affiliation.

Shadow Of Democratic Deficit In South Korea: Yoon Suk Yeol’s Mart...	President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea imposed martial law on 3rd December, 2024, which has severely shocked the people and democratic institutions of the country and sparked serious debates and concerns about how fragile its hard-won democracy is. The proclamation, which was presented as a step to defend 'liberal democracy' against purported anti-state forces, actually revealed governance flaws and how the governance institutions infested by the democratic deficits. Widespread protests and political unrest were sparked by the abrupt suspension of political activities, press freedoms, and public criticism, which brought back memories of country’s authoritarian past. The effects of Yoon's unimagined decision, looking at how his out-of-the-ordinary action has shattered public trust, caused market instability, and raised concerns about the rule of law in a country that has long been a symbol of democracy in East Asia. Martial Law South Korea is governed as a presidential democracy under the 1987 Constitution, which replaced the prior parliamentary and semi-presidential systems. Yoon Suk Yeol, a member of the conservative People Power Party and former prosecutor general, took office as President of South Korea following his victory in the 2022 presidential election. His administration has had low approval ratings, going as low as 17%, with a November 2024 survey showing 58% of the population would want to see Yoon either resign or be impeached. In the April 2024 legislative election, the opposition kept its grip but still lacked sufficient numbers to impeach the president. Yoon boycotted the opening of the National Assembly even though it is customary for the president to deliver a speech at the event. On December 3, 2024, President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea announced the imposition of martial law during a live address that was transmitted on YTN television. He charged the Democratic Party with harboring sympathies for North Korea and engaging in what he termed 'anti-state activities,' categorizing the party as an anti-national organization collaborating with foreign communist entities to undermine the nation. The directive encompassed a ban on all political activities, which included the National Assembly, as well as a suspension of press freedoms. The declaration of martial law faced opposition from incumbent and opposition party such as Democratic Party and Yoon's People Power Party, leading to subsequent protests. At approximately 1:01 A.M., the members of parliament assembled in the National Assembly and reached a unanimous decision to lift martial law, with a vote tally of 190–0, notwithstanding efforts by security forces to obstruct the voting process. Shortly thereafter, Yoon withdrew martial law following a Cabinet meeting convened at 4:30 A.M. on December 4, resulting in the disbandment of the Martial Law. Following the lifting of martial law, the opposition announced its intention to initiate impeachment proceedings against Yoon should he fail to resign from his position. This was the first time martial law had been declared in South Korea since the 1980 military coup d'état after the assassination of President Park Chung Hee in October 26, 1979, and the first since democratization in 1987. Members of the National Assembly are not given parliamentary immunity from prosecution and can be arrested if caught committing a crime. On 3 December 2024, Army General Park An-su issued a decree on martial law in South Korea to protect liberal democracy from anti-state forces and ensure public safety. The decree prohibited all political activities, including those of the National Assembly, local councils, political parties, and associations, rallies, and demonstrations. It also prohibited acts that deny or attempt to overthrow the free democratic system, the dissemination of fake news, manipulation of public opinion, and false propaganda. All media houses and publications were subject to the control of Martial Law. Strikes, work stoppages, and rallies that incite social chaos were prohibited. Trainee doctors and other medical personnel who were on strike or left their worksites were asked to return to their work places within 48 hours and work faithfully. Those who violate the order will face punishment in accordance with the Martial Law Act. Violators of the proclamation may be arrested, detained, and searched without a warrant in accordance with Article 9 of the Martial Law Act (Special Measures Authority of the Martial Law Commander) and will be punished in accordance with Article 14 of the Martial Law Act (Penalties). Multilateral Responses The declaration and subsequent revocation of martial law by President Yoon Suk Yeol prompted extensive responses across the political, judicial, and public domains in South Korea. Within his own the People Power Party, the other leaders assembled to discuss on the potential expulsion of Yoon from the party. Concurrently, there were calls for the dismissal of Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, following the confirmation of his proposal regarding the declaration of martial law. On December 4, the Prime Minister under Yoon convened a meeting with the remaining aides of the President and party leaders to discuss the repercussions stemming from the announcement of martial law. Dissent emerged within the government and ruling party. Ryu Hyuk, who serves as the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice and has a background as a former prosecutor, tendered his resignation in protest upon his arrival at the ministry for a meeting concerning martial law, which was convened by Justice Minister Park Sung-jae. Parliament Floor Leader Choo Kyung-ho asserted that he was not informed regarding the martial law order, indicating that his awareness of the situation was solely derived from media reports. Immediately, the opposition party -the Democratic Party made its intentions clear to commence impeachment proceedings on December 5 should Yoon fail to resign. In the aftermath of the revocation of martial law, opposition leaders escalated their discussions regarding the impeachment process, characterizing the incident as a significant violation of democratic principles. The judiciary has also intervened, as the Supreme Court has initiated an investigation into the legality of Yoon's declaration. The court underscored several procedural infractions, notably the President's omission to inform both the cabinet and the National Assembly as mandated by the martial law protocol. The responses from the public were markedly fervent. On December 4, a significant number of aides to Yoon tendered their resignations collectively as a reaction to the martial law. Observers and commentators, including political analysts, characterized the episode as a self-coup intended to consolidate power. A consortium comprising 1,466 Catholic priests, under the leadership of Archbishop Simon Ok Hyun-jin of the Gwangju Archdiocese along with four additional bishops, has formally issued a call for the resignation of Yoon. Leading newspapers in South Korea issued a unified denunciation of the declaration of martial law, characterizing it as unlawful and drawing parallels to the violent coups that occurred in the 1980s. A notable increase in dissent has been observed, as numerous South Korean celebrities have articulated their vehement disapproval of Yoon's actions. Martial law not only instigated a political crisis but also revealed significant divisions within his administration, elicited intense criticism from opposition parties and judicial entities, and incited a broad public outcry. The incident has intensified demands for accountability, with impeachment proceedings and legal challenges prominently positioned within the context of Yoon's presidency. The announcement of martial law was met with surprise and panic among the South Korean public due to its abruptness. The value of the won (official currency) fell to 1,444 per U.S. dollar, its lowest value in 25 months, and later recovered to around 1,420. The iShares MSCI South Korea ETF decreased by 5%, Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF declined by 4.4%, and Matthews Korea Active ETF fell 4.5%. Imposition of Martial Law Justified? Articles 76 and 77 of the South Korean Constitution grant the president the authority to impose martial law in certain situations and to declare an emergency. In times of crisis, such as internal unrest, external threats, natural disasters, or economic emergencies, Article 76 gives the President the authority to make financial and economic decisions or issue directives that have legal legitimacy. These authorities are firmly circumscribed to circumstances in which calling a meeting of the National Assembly is not feasible and if prompt action is required to preserve public order or national security. The National Assembly must be notified as soon as possible, and its consent must be sought. The measures immediately lose their effect if approval is denied, and any laws that are repealed or altered return to their original form. Emphasis is placed on transparency, mandating that the President promptly announce such events to the public. In situations of war, armed insurrection, or other crises where the activation of the military is required to preserve public safety and order, the President may declare martial law under Article 77. Martial law can be classified as either preventive, which has a more constrained reach, or extraordinary, which permits limits on the freedoms of assembly, the press, and speech while extending executive and judicial authorities. In terms of procedure, the National Assembly has the right to request the lifting of martial rule by a majority vote, which the President must abide by. The President must also notify the National Assembly as soon as martial law is declared. The declaration of martial law by President Yoon Suk Yeol on December 3, 2024, raises serious concerns over whether these constitutional powers may be justified. Yoon accused the opposition Democratic Party of colluding with North Korea and threatening national security, citing risks from their purported 'anti-state activities.' Severe measures including restricting press freedom, outlawing political activity, and allowing arrests without a warrant were also part of the declaration. According to Article 77 of the constitution, martial law can only be imposed in cases of national emergency that are comparable to war or armed insurrection. Yoon's threats, however, fall short of this criterion. Despite their seriousness, the claims of political protest and anti-state activities do not amount to war or military combat. Additionally, it seems that the Constitution's procedural protections have been disregarded. According to reports, the President violated the need for prompt notification and legislative oversight by failing to notify the National Assembly and attempting to stifle its operations. Martial law's necessity and appropriateness in this situation are likewise debatable. Without the need for such measures, the opposition's actions that were used as reason might have been handled through the current judicial system. In addition to undermining democratic norms, declaring martial law to quell political protest seems more like a ploy to consolidate power than a valid response to a national emergency. The unanimous decision by the National Assembly to end martial law further demonstrates widespread opposition to the action, supporting the argument that the declaration was unnecessary. Yoon's imposition of martial law is in violation of Articles 76 and 77 of the constitution. A misuse of executive authority is highlighted by the disproportionate exercise of power, procedural errors, and the absence of a true national emergency. Although the National Assembly and the judiciary, two of South Korea's democratic institutions, have moved quickly to offset this overreach, the incident emphasizes how crucial it is to protect constitutional principles in order to stop future abuses of this kind. Conclusion The declaration of martial law by President Yoon Suk Yeol in South Korea constitutes a significant threat to democratic principles, lacking justification in light of the prevailing circumstances. This unprecedented action not only undermines the foundational principles of democratic governance but also exposes a concerning fragility within the political institutions of South Korea. The sudden cessation of political activities and the curtailment of press freedoms, alongside a blatant disregard for constitutional protocols, elicits profound concerns regarding the potential entrenchment of authoritarianism. Such actions pose a significant threat to the democratic values that South Korea has diligently sought to maintain, underscoring the pressing necessity for vigilance and accountability to protect against potential future abuses of power.

Fragility In The Chinese System – Analysis	Despite astounding economic success, Chinese system is riddled with corruption despite the Chinese president Xi Jinping has used the whips frequently but deterrence has not helped to correct the system. The latest in this narrative is that the defence minister of the country Dong Jun is reportedly being investigated for corruption. Dong is the third consecutive incumbent or former defence chief to be probed over alleged corruption. The alleged corruption-related scandal is a development that could undermine the efforts to maintain military-to-military communications between the US and China just months before US President-elect Donald Trump take office. The report in the Financial Times on the alleged corruption in a wide-ranging scandal that has hit the top echelons of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has embarrassed the administration of Xi Jinping. Dong has been defence minister since December 2023, following the firing of his predecessor, Li Shangfu, over alleged corruption after just seven months in the position. Both Dong and Li were appointed by Xi Jinping. Li himself had replaced Wei Fenghe, who was also probed for graft after retiring. Subsequent reports said that some senior military official, not the defence minister, was suspended and was under investigation for serious violation of discipline. It was further clarified that the suspended officer Admiral Miao Hua served on the ruling central military commission, China’s highest level military command body and was stationed in the coastal province of Fujian when President Xi Jinping worked there as a local official. China’s military has undergone a sweeping anti-graft purge since 2023 with at least nine PLA generals removed from national legislative body. In Dong’s case, a Defence spokesman clarified that the news of Dong being sidelined in an investigation were 'sheer fabrication' spread by rumour mongers with evil motivations. Even Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning was quoted as saying it was just 'chasing shadows'. However, the mystery continues. Be that as it may be, the post of defence minister is largely symbolic under Chinese system. Dong does not oversee combat forces. The position is widely seen as an important face representing Beijing’s diplomatic and military policy to the outside world. Irrespective of the veracity of Dong’s case, he refused to meet US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of a recent meeting of Asian defence chiefs in Laos. The Defence Ministry in Beijing cited concerns over US weapons sales to democratic Taiwan, which Taiwan claims as a renegade province. Xi Jinping has set a 2027 deadline to invade Taiwan to integrate the democratic island into the mainland. Given the fissures in the defence establishment at home, that aspiration must remain a will-o-the-wisp for now. Earlier, Austin had met with Dong in May 2023 during the Shangri-La Dialogue forum in Singapore. Understandably, Austin described the decision not to meet Dong again in Laos as 'unfortunate'. Beijing however stuck to its position on the arms sales issue, which Washington blamed Beijing to be 'solely responsible'. Interestingly, the news of the graft probe on Dong came less than two weeks after Xi met US President Joe Biden at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Peru, where both leaders welcomed the resumption of the military-to-military communications and reaffirmed to keep the channels open. Beijing is understandably worried that President-elect Trump has already nominated a number of China hawks for key Cabinet posts. In order to prevent a deterioration of bilateral tie with the US, Xi Jinping has gone overboard by announcing that he is ready to work with the Trump administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences. Earlier, corruption issues surfaced within the Chinese military’s Rocket Force, which oversees the country’s land-based missile and nuclear arsenals, and the powerful Central Military Commission’s (CMC’s) Equipment Development Department (EDD), which develops and acquires key military technology. Because of the sensitivity of the defence issues and with a view to keep tight control of the system, Xi Jinping has removed in the past two years a number of key figures in the Rocket Force and linked to the EDD and installed more loyal officials and quash corruption inside the service and department. Dong, who was an admiral in the country’s navy, was considered an outsider and unlikely to be tainted by the scandals that had plagued the Rocket Force and EDD. But there were some hidden untruths. During a major Communist Party meeting earlier in 2024, Dong was not promoted to the CMC, the six-member body that oversees China’s military, prompting observers to question his ability to hold onto the post. The country’s defense chief has traditionally been a member of both the CMC, which is headed by Xi, and the State Council, China’s Cabinet-level executive body. Dong was not a member of the State Council, either. Xi Jinping has been ruthless in stemming corruption and punishing those who found guilty or suspected to be guilty. In 2022, Xi fired Foreign Minister Qin Gang, whom he had appointed to the position, following reports of an extramarital affair with a Chinese woman in the US. Yet corruption continues. This demonstrates the fragility in the authoritarian system with command control. Xi may be slipping grip on the reins of administration. While the reported probe against Dong is being interpreted as another spectacular failure of Beijing’s internal vetting processes, the news nevertheless embarrasses Xi Jinping. Xi is unlikely to loosen his grip and more head could roll if found out. The big question is, can Xi Jinping take control of the rein and deal with China’s future aspirations amid an unpredictable impending Trump administration?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgPEKlDDg-hCioGVfn5rsF	2024-12-05T09:35:13-08:00	
Guterres Calls For ‘Serious Dialogue’ To End Surging Violence In ...	The UN Secretary-General appealed on Thursday for an end to the fighting in Syria, where a recent escalation raises the risk of further division in the ongoing civil war. António Guterres held a stakeout outside the Security Council chamber to address the 'grave and dramatic developments' that are unfolding. 'I just spoke with President Erdoğan of Türkiye to discuss the latest,' he said. 'I emphasized the urgent need for immediate humanitarian access to all civilians in need – and a return to the UN-facilitated political process to end the bloodshed. All parties are obligated under international law to protect civilians.' ‘Chronic collective failure’ Mr. Guterres said this latest offensive was launched into Government-controlled areas by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham – sanctioned by the Council as a terrorist group along with a broad range of other armed opposition groups. It has led to significant shifts in the frontlines, and tens of thousands of civilians are at risk in a region already on fire. 'We are seeing the bitter fruits of a chronic collective failure of previous de-escalation arrangements to produce a genuine nationwide ceasefire or a serious political process to implement Security Council resolutions,' he said, adding 'these must change.' The Secretary-General stated that after 14 years of conflict, it is high time for all parties to engage seriously with his Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, to finally chart a new, inclusive and comprehensive approach to resolving the crisis in line with Security Council resolution 2254(2015). 'It’s time for serious dialogue,' he stated. 'In other words, restoring Syria’s sovereignty, unity, independence, and territorial integrity – and meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.' End the suffering He noted that Syria is a crossroads of civilization and said it was painful to see its progressive fragmentation. Mr. Guterres recalled his long tenure as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, where he witnessed the immense generosity of the Syrian people, who opened their hearts and homes to countless refugees from Iraq. 'It breaks my heart to see their suffering grow – along with the threats to regional, and indeed, international security,' he said. 'I once again urge all those with influence to do their part for the long-suffering people of Syria.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgPEKlDDg-hAmV6dTO2IcY	2024-12-05T09:33:35-08:00	
Responding To Reich, Part 5: A Free Market Is A Fair Market – OpE...	By Patrick Carroll Reich’s fifth economic 'myth' that he sets out to debunk is the assertion that 'the market is fair.' What makes this video interesting—and confusing—is that Reich is a bit slippery with his language. The result is another thoroughly debunked straw man. Reich’s argument is devastating, but not for the position that free market proponents actually hold on this topic. Since Reich doesn’t do a great job of explaining our position, it’s worth taking a moment to briefly spell it out before diving into his analysis. One of the arguments that is commonly advanced in favor of the free market is that it is a much fairer system than interventionism. What we mean by this is that the free market creates a level playing field, free of any special tax exemptions, subsidies, tariffs, regulations, or other legislative interferences that give some competitors an artificial advantage over others. In a free market, you succeed as a business solely by being better able to satisfy consumers than your competitors. When there is government intervention, however, players can often outcompete their competitors, not by delivering a better product for a lower price, but by successfully lobbying the government to give them an exclusive advantage. For example, if your competition has to pay an extra 20 percent tax, perhaps because they happen to be based in a foreign country, that is clearly giving you an unfair advantage, and if you win, it’s not necessarily because you were better able to satisfy consumers. If the tax were removed—that is, if a free market were allowed to prevail—that would restore fairness, and any subsequent winner can be said to have won solely on merit. To be honest, it’s hard to imagine how this position could possibly be wrong. Is there any situation where giving someone a head start is fairer than making everyone start at the same line? Likewise, is there any situation in which the government privileging some competitors over others is fairer than the government staying out of it? The question answers itself. And yet, Reich is convinced that this truism is deeply flawed. Let’s see how he makes his case. The Free Market or the Existing Market? Reich opens the video as follows: Here’s a real whopper: 'The market doesn’t play favorites!' Bunk. Many of the most vocal proponents of the so-called 'free market' have for years been actively reorganizing the market for their own benefit. They don’t want us to notice what’s happened over the last half century, as big money has corrupted our politics. Reich goes on to list a number of examples to illustrate his point. He mentions campaign donation limits being weakened or repealed, antitrust laws being 'virtually abandoned,' right-to-work laws hurting unions, bank bailouts helping the rich while encouraging risk, corporate bankruptcy allowing companies to get out of labor contracts, the carried interest 'loophole' helping hedge fund and private equity managers, and lower trade barriers causing America to lose manufacturing jobs despite receiving the benefit of cheaper goods. He concludes by stressing the positive feedback loop that he sees policies like these creating: It’s been a vicious cycle. Each change in laws has ratcheted wealth and power upward, making it easier for the wealthy and powerful to gain further legal changes that ratchet even more wealth and power upward. The issues with Reich’s commentary start with the very first line. He presents our position as being that 'the market doesn’t play favorites,' but this is a bit imprecise. Did he mean our position is that the free market doesn’t play favorites, or that the existing market doesn’t play favorites? His next line makes it seem like he meant the existing market. Consider the two options in context: 'The [free] market doesn’t play favorites!' Bunk. Many of the most vocal proponents of the so-called 'free market' have for years been actively reorganizing the market for their own benefit. 'The [existing] market doesn’t play favorites!' Bunk. Many of the most vocal proponents of the so-called 'free market' have for years been actively reorganizing the market for their own benefit. It seems clear to me that the second one is what’s intended. 'It’s a load of baloney that the existing market doesn’t play favorites,' he’s saying. 'Look at all the reorganization going on for the benefit of specific groups.' Reich is, of course, correct. It is a load of baloney to suggest that the existing market doesn’t play favorites. But the idea that the existing market is fair is not our position! Our position is that the freemarket is fair. Thus, pointing out that existing markets are being unfairly reorganized doesn’t debunk our position in the slightest. If anything, it’s making our point. Reich is using a rhetorical sleight of hand here. No one who says that 'the market doesn’t play favorites' has the current, rigged market in mind when they say that. They mean the market as opposed to the government. It is universally understood that in this context we mean that the freemarket doesn’t play favorites. Thus, for Reich to present the assertion 'The market doesn’t play favorites' and immediately shoot it down with 'Actually the existing market is very rigged' is simply not addressing the actual point being made. Two Kinds of Fairness Unfortunately, the confusing rhetoric doesn’t stop there. So far, we’ve been working under the assumption that 'actively reorganizing the market' is referring to government interference in the market. This felt intuitive, not only because 'actively reorganizing' has the connotation of 'interfering with an otherwise self-organizing process,' but also because Reich seems to be making a point about hypocrisy. 'All these rich people are championing the free market with their words while actively reorganizing it with their actions,' Reich comes across as saying. And it’s only hypocrisy if 'actively reorganizing' is the opposite of the free market. And yet, while we are led to believe that 'actively reorganizing' means 'interfering with the free market,' the examples Reich lists of this 'active reorganizing' somehow include both pro- and anti-free market measures! Relaxing antitrust laws and lowering trade barriers (we will concede for the sake of argument that these are happening), for instance, are examples of freeing up the market, not of 'actively reorganizing' it. So Reich is effectively saying: 'These free market proponents are such hypocrites. They praise the free market with their words, but they champion government interference in practice. For example, they try to get the government out of mergers and acquisitions, and to have it play less of a role in international trade.' What? I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. After all, we’ve already seen in Part 2 that Reich doesn’t have a clear understanding of the distinction between rules that obstruct the market and rules that don’t. But maybe—for the sake of argument—maybe Reich’s list isn’t meant to provide examples of 'actively reorganizing' the market. Maybe it’s just meant to provide examples of unfairness. That is the topic of the video, after all. If so, this is still a curious list. Bank bailouts are absolutely unfair. The carried interest 'loophole,' okay, maybe. But how are lower trade barriers unfair? The key to solving this puzzle is to realize that Reich is using a completely different definition of 'fairness' than free market proponents. He doesn’t have in mind whether some companies have special tax or regulatory privileges that give them an edge over their competition. His concept of fairness revolves around helping the poor by taking aim at the rich. In Reich’s worldview, the rich already have a massive advantage over the poor in the game of life. Thus, a 'fair' market is one that checks the ability of the rich to 'exploit' the poor. In other words, 'fairness' is when we do left-wing politics. His examples are all over the place from the perspective of fair competition, but they are perfectly consistent from the leftist perspective of helping David fight Goliath. Sometimes helping the little guy (in their view) means taking the free market perspective, as with eliminating bank bailouts or corporate subsidies. But other times it means taking the anti-free market perspective, such as with antitrust laws. Reich doesn’t particularly care what a free market proponent would think about these ideas. He cares whether the policy seems(!) to empower the rich or the poor. To illustrate how these two definitions of fairness line up, we can create a 2×2 matrix and place various government interventions in the appropriate categories, as follows: As we can see, the fair-competition concept of unfairness sometimes overlaps with the left-wing concept of unfairness (bottom left), but there are also many policies where the two diverge (top left). The right side is of course blank, because there is no such thing as a competitively fair government intervention. All interventions in the market (including both taxes and regulations) create distortions that lead to competitive advantages and disadvantages for various companies. Exposing the Straw Man Taking the argument as a whole, there are essentially two equivocations going on. There is the equivocation regarding 'the market' (the free market or the existing market?), and there is the equivocation regarding 'fairness' (fair competition or the left’s concept of fairness?). To expose Reich’s straw man, we simply need to spell out the four distinct claims that can be attached to the phrase 'The market is fair.' My opinion on the veracity of each claim is placed in parentheses: The free market has fair competition. (True) The free market exhibits the left’s concept of fairness. (Bunk) The existing market has fair competition. (Bunk) The existing market exhibits the left’s concept of fairness. (Bunk) Reich does a brilliant job of refuting Claim 4. With example after example, he demonstrates that the existing market comes nowhere near the left’s concept of fairness. The only problem is, that’s not the claim free market proponents are making when we say 'The market is fair.' We are making Claim 1. And Reich doesn’t even address Claim 1, let alone debunk it. Fairness Isn’t Everything Before wrapping up, a couple of additional points are worth addressing. First, it might seem to some that the argument here is in tension with the point made in Part 3, which defended 'the unfairness of capitalism.' But there’s no contradiction here, because these are two different senses of the word fair. Capitalism is certainly unfair in the sense that people sometimes get what they haven’t earned, but it is completely fair in the sense that it is free of government interventions that cause the market to be rigged. Another point worth touching on is how fair competition shows up in policy discussions. Often, proponents of tariffs will complain that foreign countries are subsidizing their producers, enabling them to charge extra-low prices. A tariff, it is argued, is needed to correct for this unfairness, to 'level the playing field' as it were. Hence, proponents of tariffs can often be found advocating for 'fair competition' or 'fair trade,' terms that are basically just euphemisms for restricted trade. Now, the people making this argument are completely correct that when a foreign company subsidizes an industry, that is not a free market and thus not an entirely fair, level playing field. But it doesn’t necessarily follow that leveling the playing field should be the most important factor in trade policy. There are things more important than fairness! Anyways, that’s a bit of a longer discussion. All that needs to be said here is that, should the foreign subsidies ever be removed, the people making this point should then have the integrity to advocate for free trade in their respective industries, and not go looking for other excuses for protective tariffs. The Right Way to Go After Power-Wielding Interests His missteps aside, Reich does draw attention to an important point, namely that rich and powerful people are influencing policy for their own benefit. But the problem is not that the left’s concept of fairness is being violated. The problem is that fair competition is being violated. What Reich misses is that antitrust laws, trade barriers, and all the other policies in that category are just as problematic as the bank bailouts and corporate subsidies that he rightly condemns. These interventions may look like the government taming powerful interests, but the reality is that they are all examples of the government protecting powerful interests from competition. Trade barriers—lauded by Reich for preventing the outsourcing of labor—protect domestic producers from having to compete with their foreign counterparts. America’s sugar tycoons no doubt appreciate Reich’s defense of their interests! Mandated quality and safety standards for consumer goods, which Reich would likely say are an important means of checking corporate greed, are really a way of protecting established brands from competing firms that would prefer to experiment with different standards. Big Pharma and Big Ag are not exactly complaining about these regulations. Even antitrust laws are actually anticompetitive: they protect entrenched, inefficient firms that happen to be smaller from larger, more efficient competitors. As the economist David Friedman points out, 'Laws that make life hard for new firms—or old firms entering new markets—reduce competition and encourage monopoly, even if they are called antitrust laws.' By uncritically supporting any policy that looks like a boon for the working class, Reich is unwittingly helping the rich and powerful to 'ratchet wealth and power upward.' In failing to take a consistent free market approach, he fails to fully attack the vested interests that are conspiring to rig the market in their own favor. So what’s the path forward? The way Reich presents it, you can either defend the status quo or join him in calling for the government to impose the left’s definition of fairness, including both the pro- and anti-free market policies they recommend. But there’s a third option that most people don’t consider, and it’s the option we actually need to take. The best way to go after the powerful interests that are rigging the economy is to insist on fair competition—which means free markets—in every sphere. Wielding the left’s definition of fairness is at best a halfway measure. The real solution is to completely strip these powerful interests of the taxes and regulations that are protecting them. By doing so, we will expose them to a far more dangerous threat than any government: market competition.

Why Is Crony Capitalism So Strong And Widespread? – OpEd	Crony capitalism is a term of derision, and rightly so. Yet, it is widespread in the Global South. Stanford Political Scientist Stephen Haber explains why. Crony capitalism is widely and publicly derided as the worst form capitalism. It is considered to be injurious to the long term prospects of an economy and also to the welfare of the mases. And yet, it is a widespread phenomenon in the Global South. The main reason is that crony capitalism meets the need for investments in capital-starved countries in the Global South, says Stanford University political scientist and historian, Stephen Haber. Crony capitalism is seen as a source of bribes, of funds for electioneering, and of black money for political leaders who are in politics mainly to line their pockets. It functions as an engine for the parallel economy. In his introduction to The Political Economy of Crony Capitalism, Haber says that crony capitalism is frequently offered as an explanation for the inefficiencies of economic systems in the developing world. But the phenomenon has its functions, he argues. Haber asks the following basic questions: Why do crony economic systems come into being? If crony capitalism is bad for growth, then why has it survived for so long? Crony capitalism is defined as a system in which those close to the political authorities (politicians who run the government at any given point of time) receive favours that have large economic value. These favours allow the politically connected economic agents to earn returns or profits above those that would prevail in an economy in which the factors of production are priced by the market and not by political leaders. Cheap Credit The pre-eminent factor of production in the case of crony capitalism in the Global South is capital or credit, more precisely, cheap credit. In India, cheap credit is obtained by crony capitalists from the Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCB) as well as State Banks (SBs) through political contacts. Cheap credit, thus obtained, is funnelled into their enterprises. Even private banks can be induced to provide credit to politically- backed capitalists if these banks get some sort of economic entitlement from the government. Rules are broken or bent to enable this tripartite alliance of the crony capitalist, the politician and the banker to exist. Haber says that crony capitalists are not only given cheap credit but also the freedom to charge higher prices for their products when they hit the market. Such prices could not be charged under regular competitive market conditions. In case there is international competition in regard to a product made by a crony capitalist the crony capitalist could ask for and get trade barriers to be put up. Stephen Haber sees a link between licensing and crony capitalism. If the system in a country requires firms to obtain licenses to import certain key inputs, a friendly government could use the selective award of licenses to create crony capital monopolies, and enable the crony capitalists to go for the kill unhindered by competition. The government expects the crony capitalist (well-stocked with cheap credit), will invest in industries. This releases the State from the responsibility of investing in enterprises or managing them. The task of investing in enterprises and producing goods and services is left to the crony capitalist. He, rather than the State, boosts the country's GDP, provides products to the masses, and gives jobs to people. Governments in countries in which corny capitalism thrives use the money collected through taxation from the people to fund crony capitalists. If a bank come under strain, and has too many Non-Performing Assets (bad loans) the government pumps in money to keep the banks afloat. The bulk of NPAs in banks are in the names of crony capitalists. The political leadership also gains from the crony capitalist system as crony capitalists use a part of the money doled out by the State or secured from the bank, to bribe the politicians. Obliging bank officials both in the State and the non-State banking sector may also get paid. The system is corrupt to the core, but it keeps the economy humming. Absence of Checks and Balances In advanced countries, the system that prevails is described by Stephen Haber as 'Limited Government.' He says that in this system, the role of the political leadership in the running of the economy or the market place is limited to maintaining ethical and legal standards. Scope for the growth of crony capitalism is limited in such economies. In the US, for example, there are institutional checks and balances and political leaders are subject to them, which prevent the emergence of crony capitalism. But in many of the countries of the Global South, power resides either in a single individual leader or a cabal. It is these people who take the critical decisions and share the loot. Anybody asking questions will be dealt with sternly. The Global South is a fertile ground for the growth of crony capitalism, as many of these countries are either full-fledged autocracies or are elected autocracies. Their economies are marked by paucity capital and governmental inability or unwillingness to invest and run industries. Governments here hand over these functions to crony capitalists who pay bribes, take charge, and make hay while the sun shines. Change of government does not make a difference to crony capitalists who will strike similar deals with the new men in power. Drawbacks However, Haber says that from the point of view of economic growth and distribution, crony capitalism has drawbacks. It encourages the misallocation of resources. The crony capitalist may invest in sectors which are money spinning but not useful for the economy or society as a whole. If rent seeking becomes the main aim, industries that should not exist, come into existence. 'Rent seeking' occurs when a businessman seeks to gain wealth without making any contribution to the benefit of society. 'Rent' in rent seeking is based on the economic definition of the term, which is defined as economic wealth obtained through shrewd or potentially manipulative use of resources. With rent seeking becoming the predominant aim of businesses, monopolies and oligopolies will come up in industries that deserve competition. Opportunities will be denied to entrepreneurs who have the required skills and assets but not the political access or protection required. Crony capitalists and their political contacts tend to have short-term horizons. This causes cronies to demand high rates of return even for projects that have short maturities. Crony capitalism may, in fact, completely discourage long-term investments. Since making money by shortcuts is the main aim, products are sold at high prices. Thus, the retail customer, the common man, bears the entire burden, while the crony capitalist and his political benefactors mint money. Banks, especially, State-owned banks in India have been badly affected by the Non-Performing Assets (NPA) relating to crony capitalists. In the last five years, Indian Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) have together written-off nearly INR 10 trillion worth of bad loans, says Presenjit Bose, an economist and activist based in Kolkata (see: The bulk of the reduction of NPAs in the present government's tenure has occurred through 'write-offs'' and not through 'recoveries,' Bose points out. Data show that during the 2024-2014 Congress regime, for every INR 100 of Non Performing Assets accretion in the Scheduled Commercial Banks INR 63.34 were recovered and only INR 8.62 were written off. But under the Bharatiya Janata Party rule, only INR 31.65 was recovered for every INR 100 of NPA accretion, while write offs were at INR 39.38, Bose says. By March 2015, almost three quarters of the NPAs were on account of large corporate borrowers, Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Vishwanathan had said. Without large-scale taxpayer-funded bailouts, many of the Public Sector Banks would have breached the capital adequacy ratios because of losses on account of such write-offs, Bose said quoting the Reserve Bank of India report of 2021. Public Sector Banks accounted for the majority of the write-offs, representing nearly 63% of the total. The banks retain the right to pursue recovery from borrowers, but actually, this option is not pursued, Bose points out.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgPEKlDDg-hIW4WFYz0z9d	2024-12-05T09:23:55-08:00

Prophet Abraham’s Sirah For Three Monotheistic Religions – OpEd	Prophet Abraham was the first person to be called a 'Hebrew' in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 14:13). The term Hebrew probably comes from the verb to go over a boundary, like the Euphrates or Jordan river, or to be a migrant. Ten generations later the Philistines in Canaan used the term 'Hebrews' to refer to the 12 tribes of Israel: 'The Philistine commanders asked, 'What about these Hebrews?' (1 Samuel 29:3); and Prophet Jonah identified himself to non-Jewish sailors as 'a Hebrew' (Jonah 1:9). Prophet Abraham was the first Muslim Hebrew as Qur'an 3:67 states: 'He (Abraham) was not Yahuudiyyan, 'a Jew', nor Nasraaniyyan, 'a Christian', but rather a Haniifan' i.e. 'a monotheistic Hebrew believer submitting (Islam) to the one imageless God who created all space and time; and who made Prophet Abraham's descendants through Prophets Isaac and Jacob (Israel), into a great multitude of monotheists called the People of Israel-Banu Israel. The Prophet Isaiah said: 'Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the Lord: look to the rock from which you were hewn, and to the quarry from which you were dug. Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you; for he [Abraham] was only one when I called him, that I might bless him and multiply him. (Isaiah 51:1-2) and the Qur'an states: 'You have an excellent example to follow in Abraham.' (60:4) and 'Follow the way of Abraham as people of pure faith.' (3:95) Most people in the world have learned of Prophet Abraham, not by reading a book of Jewish history or religion, but by listening to and reading from the Christian Bible or the Muslim Qur'an. This unique and amazing situation is a reflection of a promise made to Prophet Abraham more than 36 centuries ago, and recorded in both the Torah and the Qur'an. 'I swear (says God) because you did this - not withholding your son, your favorite one, I will bestow My blessing on you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore; and your descendants shall seize the gates of their foes. All the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by your descendants, because you have obeyed My command.' (Genesis 22:16-18) and 'Indeed, We chose him (Abraham) as one pure and most distinguished in the world, and he is surely among the righteous in the Hereafter'. (Qur'an 2:130) Prophet Isaiah also said: But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, are the offspring of Abraham, my friend;' (Isaiah 41:8) So the biological offspring of Prophet Abraham (the Banu Israel) became the first ongoing monotheistic community when God rescued them from Egyptian oppression; and made an ongoing covenant with them at Mount Sinai. Prophet Abraham was not born a Jew, but his descendants from his grandson Jacob/Israel became the Banu Israel—Jewish People. For 1200 + years after Prophet Moses, the Banu Israel was the only ongoing imageless monotheistic community in the world. 'Similarly, no Messenger came to the People before them, but they said (of him) 'A sorcerer, or one possessed''! (51:52) And as the Qur'an informed us: 'The people of Noah denied before them, and the companions of the well and Thamūd; and ʿAad and Pharaoh and the brothers [neighbors] of Lot; and the companions of the forest, and the people of Tubbaʿ. All denied the messengers [Allah sent to them] so My threat was justly fulfilled.' [50:12-14] And those monotheistic communities that did last for a few generations, always fell away during subsequent centuries; while most, but not all, of Banu Israel remained loyal to the covenant God made with them at Mount Sinai: 'Before (Messengers Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus) We sent messengers to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they call Allah in humility. When the suffering reached them from Us, why then did they not call Allah in humility? On the contrary, their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them. (Qur'an 6:42-43) But as centuries passed the ongoing need to protect the Jewish way of life became increasingly the focus of their efforts; and after the deaths of Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah, Banu Israel became more and more inclined to building a fence around the Torah, and making the rules more numerous and restrictive. In 1065 Pope Alexander called for a Crusade against the Moors in Spain. Then in 1073, Pope Gregory issued official proclamations urging Christian princes to recover lands occupied by Muslims in Spain, over which he claimed papal sovereignty on the basis of previous Christian rule and right. These decrees were really the beginning of the Christian Crusades against Islam. Pope Gregory's ideas about Christian war were also extended to fighting against domestic enemies of the Church (like Protestants). For example, in 1209, Pope Innocent III urged a band of northern French nobles to rally an army that swept into southern France, where they unleashed a crusade so bloody it included the sacking of Beziers by an army under papal authority. Just before the attack, which would kill 15-20,000 men, women and children, the pope's man on the scene, Arnaud Amalric, is reported to have uttered one of history's most famous orders: 'Kill them all. God will know his own.' The next 4-5 centuries of religious military war in Europe and the MiddleEast was the result of the previous 2-3 centuries of all-out polemic verbal war between Christianity and Islam. Religious truth became a zero sum game: anything positive said about another religion was seen as a weakening of your own side. The goal was not to modestly try to harmonize various religious perspectives of the one and only God; but to self-righteously exaggerate religious differences, well beyond any reasonable understanding of the two sides. In the Greek world, the Jerusalem Temple (Beit HaMikdosh) was well known, while the Ka'ba, the House of God (Baitullah) in Mecca was not known by name at all. The first Roman reference to the Baitullah is from Diodorus Siculus, a first century BCE Roman historian who wrote that in Arabia there was a temple greatly revered by the Arabs. According to G. E. Von Grunebaum, who I studied with at the University of California Los Angeles in 1959, Mecca was also mentioned by Ptolemy, a second century Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer who wrote, 'The name he gives it allows us to identify it as a South Arabian foundation created around a sanctuary.' (G. E. Von Grunebaum, Classical Islam: A History 600–1258, p. 19) Yet just seven centuries later both of these cities and sanctuaries, one almost unknown by the Romans and the other totally destroyed by the Romans, were destined, throughout the Middle Ages in both Europe and west Asia, to be viewed as the heart, lungs or navel of the world. Jerusalem and Mecca were frequently portrayed by Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the center of their maps. God willing, someday everyone may see both cities and their sanctuaries as central to our monotheistic connections to the One God of Prophets Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac. Indeed, much of the Sirah folklore history about these two holy spaces is very similar. The following fable, transmitted orally in both Arabic and Hebrew for many centuries and finally written down in several versions in the 19th century, illustrates how these two holy spaces can be connected even though they are over 700 miles apart. Two brothers who inherited a 'valley to hilltop' farm from their father divided the land in half so that each one could farm his own section. Over time, the older brother married and had four children, while the younger brother was still not married. One year there was very little rain, and the crop was very meagre. This was at the beginning of a long term drought that would turn the whole valley into an arid, treeless, desert where even grain did not grow, and all the springs dried up. The younger brother lay awake one night praying and thought: 'My brother has a wife and four children to feed, and I have no children. He needs more grain than I do; especially now when grain is scarce.' So that night, the younger brother went to his barn, gathered a large sack of wheat, and left his wheat in his brother's barn. Then he returned home. Earlier that very same night, the older brother was also lying awake praying for rain when he thought: 'In my old age, my wife and I will have our grown children to take care of us, as well as grandchildren to enjoy, while my brother may have no children. He should at least sell more grain from his fields now, so he can provide for himself in his old age. So that night, the older brother also gathered a large sack of wheat, and left it in his brother's barn, and returned home. The next morning, the younger brother, surprised to see the amount of grain in his barn seemed unchanged, said 'I did not take as much wheat as I thought. Tonight I'll take more.' That same morning, the older brother, standing in his barn, was thinking the same thoughts. After night fell, each brother gathered a greater amount of wheat from his barn and in the dark, secretly delivered it to his brother's barn. The next morning, the brothers were again puzzled and perplexed. 'How can I be mistaken?' each one thought. 'There's the same amount of grain here as there was before. This is impossible! Tonight I'll make no mistake—I'll take two large sacks.' The third night, more determined than ever, each brother gathered two large sacks of wheat from his barn, loaded them onto a cart, and slowly pulled his cart toward his brother's barn. In the moonlight, each brother noticed a figure in the distance. When the two brothers got closer, each recognized the form of the other and the load he was pulling, and they both realized what had happened! Without a word, they dropped the ropes of their carts, ran to each other and embraced. God noted the two brothers' actions, and thought that their brotherly love and concern for each other should make a very good example for their descendants, and make them worthy to build a holy House on that hill; and rebuild a holy House in this valley. When all those, both near and far, who revere these sacred places as a standard, share it in love with everyone else who reveres it, then Prophet Abraham's request for Allah to 'make this a land of peace, and provide its people with the produce of the land'. (Qur'an 2:126) will be extended throughout the world; and all the children of Noah and Abraham will live in Holiness, Peace and Prosperity. Jews and Christians believe the hill is Jerusalem. Muslims believe the valley is Mecca. I believe they are both right and someday if we can live up to the ideal that religious pluralism is the will of God, we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5) So God's promise to Prophet Abraham, that the other families of humankind will ultimately bless themselves, and one another, thus aspiring to be like Abraham's descendants (Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14), will be fulfilled in the three Abrahamic religions of Christianity, Islam and Judaism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgPEKlDDg-hBAQjFsjmk7L	2024-12-05T09:17:59-08:00	
The Commercial Fishing Industry Is Destroying Vital Marine Ecosys...	Fish are sentient beings subjected to cruelty to maximize profits for the multibillion-dollar industry. The unsustainable practice of killing fish for human consumption not only harms them but countless other marine animals die as 'unintended' bycatch in reckless fishing operations or lose their lives to the fishing industry's widespread ocean pollution and habitat destruction, which is damaging our ocean beyond recovery—all for the pursuit of maximum profit. Fish are unique animals with complex inner lives. They communicate with one another, recognize human faces, and even feel excitement when they see other fish. Like land animals, fish can feel pain. However, our broken global food system kills billions (maybe even trillions) of these sentient individuals for human consumption every year. While humans have caught and eaten fish for the past 40,000 years—with anglers taking to the water and waiting hours to reel in the perfect catch—global demand for seafood products has turned fishing into a multibillion-dollar industry. Industrial fishing operations breed fish for human consumption and keep them in crowded tanks or pens. This kind of factory fish farming dominates today's seafood market, raising many ethical and environmental concerns. The fishing industry generally overlooks the welfare of fish entirely in its pursuit of profits. It doesn't even measure fish as individuals—only referring to fish in 'tons.' What Is Aquaculture? Aquaculture refers to farming fish and other marine species in barren, overcrowded tanks or pens—a far cry from the natural freedom of the sea. Aquaculture is highly industrialized and involves subjecting fish to the same intensive confinement as land-based factory farms. Aquatic farms cram as many individual fish as possible into small tanks or nets, leading to the fish barely being able to move. The overcrowding and filth make the water a breeding ground for parasites and pathogens. One particular parasite, sea lice, spreads rapidly and feasts on the flesh and blood of fish, causing painful lesions. While fish farms and wild-capture fishing operations may seem far removed from the factory farms on land, these profit-driven industries share a close connection. The fishing industry turns 20 million tons of fish into fishmeal—ground-up fish bones and flesh commonly used for animal feed—each year, according to a 2017 NPR article. These 'protein pellets' provide factory farmers with a cheap way to feed chickens and pigs before they are slaughtered. And, in a grotesque and cruel cycle, 70 percent of fishmeal goes back into aquaculture. According to a 2019 Greenpeace report, the rampant growth of the fishmeal and fish oil industry in West Africa has threatened food security and people's livelihoods. Fish farms raised and killed up to 171 billion as of 2023, generating more than $271 billion in profits globally in 2018. The industry's profits are expected to grow by at least $100 billion more by 2025. Fish farming derives all this profit from the pain and suffering of sentient beings treated as mere raw materials. 'Be it recreational angling, large-scale fisheries, ornamental fish—any way that we use fish, we need to consider treating them better, as if they experience pain,' Lynn Sneddon, director of Bioveterinary Science at Liverpool University, told Science Focus, stated a January 2024 Sentient Media article. The Growth of the Fishing Industry The global seafood market was valued at more than $65 billion in 2019, and the industry's profits are expected to grow even larger, reaching an estimated 103 billion by 2027. Meanwhile, the U.S. commercial fishing activities generated $154.7 in 2020, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Around half of the 8.34 billion pounds of fish caught in 2022 in the U.S. came from Alaska alone. As of 2020, the U.S. was the world's eighth-largest seafood exporter. Shrimp is the most popular seafood in the U.S. Wild fishing and shrimp farming pose devastating ecological consequences, turning large pockets of the ocean into barren wasteland. Why Is the Fishing Industry Bad? Commercial fishing harms countless marine species and habitats. Although humans cannot see the extent of the fishing industry's destruction, the entire planet will feel its effects as vital ocean ecosystems disappear. Some of the practices that are causing extensive damage to the marine habitat are highlighted below. Bottom Trawling Bottom trawling is the practice of dragging an open fishing net along the ocean floor. While trawling nets target species like cod, shrimp, and prawns, these moving deathtraps catch any animal that crosses their path. The indiscriminate practice of bottom trawling especially harms sea turtles, who forage at the bottom of the ocean floor for food. When they get entangled in a bottom trawling net, turtles can suffer from broken shells and bones from the sheer weight of fish bearing down on top of them. They become fearful and stressed as they try—unsuccessfully—to escape the net. Many sea turtles drown from being trapped underwater for so long, and those that make it to the surface risk injury as they're dropped onto the hard deck of a ship. Sea turtles are just one example of the harm of bottom trawling. This practice damages the ocean floor ecosystems, which numerous species rely on for survival, making its impact even more devastating. Damage to the Ocean Floor The ocean floor is anything but dull and flat—its topography varies from plains to mountains, and it is home to countless underwater plants and sea life. And just as humans irreversibly destroy land above water to ensure the unsustainable growth of agriculture and other industries, humans are leaving the ocean floor unrecognizable, too. Bottom trawling erodes the ocean floor, removing sediments. These deep-sea sediments contain diverse marine invertebrates and offer rich foraging grounds for larger fish to feed on. Their benefits extend far beyond nourishing marine life. Like our planet's forests, ocean floor habitats absorb and store carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, helping us combat climate change. When bottom trawlers damage these environments, the seabed releases this stored CO2. Scientists estimate that bottom trawling unleashes the same amount of CO2 into the atmosphere as air travel, according to a 2021 study published in Nature. Scientists also rely on ocean floor sediments to understand climate change. They study samples from the seafloor to uncover how human activity impacts our oceans. Their research on seafloor composition helps inform our environmental protection and policy decisions. By leaving less and less of these marine sediments intact, the fishing industry doesn't just accelerate climate change—it takes away our potential to do something about it. In addition to damaging the seafloor, bottom trawling damages the surrounding habitats. Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to the effects of bottom trawling, as the nets tangle in corals and sweep up the fish living there. These vibrant habitats, typically bursting with biodiversity, are home to everything from microscopic invertebrates to giant, flowering anemones. However, as bottom trawlers plunder these ecosystems, the biodiversity they support declines. Longline Fishing Longline fishers stretch nets with baited hooks across miles of ocean. The nets typically target tuna fish but longlines indiscriminately capture and kill them like bottom trawlers. In 2018, longlining brought in $8.3 billion for the fishing industry, accounting for 20 percent of the global catch by end value. But the practice severely harms the endangered southern bluefin tuna, a species barely starting to recover from years of overfishing. Longline fishing also captures loggerhead and leatherback turtles, and the hooks painfully penetrate their mouths, necks, or flippers. Sometimes, turtles swallow entire hooks, which become lodged in their digestive tracts. This hinders the turtles' feeding and digestion, leaving them at risk of starving to death. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists loggerhead and leatherback turtles as vulnerable, and longline fishing further decimates their populations. Seabirds also suffer the consequences of longline fishing. Seabirds get caught in hooks and drown as they dive beneath the surface for food. According to a 2019 Guardian article, an estimated 100,000 birds die this horrific way due to longline fishing each year, further endangering species like the remarkable albatross. Bycatch We know that practices like bottom trawling and longline fishing claim the lives of iconic marine animals like sea turtles. In addition to turtles, species like sharks and dolphins face the most danger of becoming 'bycatch'—animals unintentionally captured by fishing equipment. The fishing industry doesn't report on it, even though bycatch impacts millions of fish and marine animals. As apex predators, sharks are essential to the natural balance of ocean ecosystems, but they are rapidly disappearing. A combination of bycatch and deliberate fishing (particularly for what fins) kills up to 273 million sharkseach year, permanently altering the underwater ecosystems they call home and endangering some shark species beyond recovery. The fishing industry also devastates cetaceans like dolphins and whales. A 2020 report published in the Endangered Species Research estimated that commercial fishing killed more than 80 percent of dolphins in the Indian Ocean. Although tragic, these examples only represent a small fraction of the animals who are victims of indiscriminate fishing practices. Toxic Water Conditions Industrial fishing practices harm ocean ecosystems long after the catch is reeled in. Fishing operations abandon old nets and gear in the water, leaving them to entangle marine life and contaminate the oceans with plastic for decades. This lost and discarded fishing gear—known as 'ghost gear'—represents the oceans' most significant source of plastic pollution. A 2023 Nature article states, 'Macroplastics represent 88 percent of the anthropogenic debris, and, like other debris types, peak in deeper reefs... with fishing activities as the main source of plastics in most areas.' Fishing nets account for almost half of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch's contents, a collection of floating ocean trash larger than Texas. Aquaculture farms keep fish away from their natural habitats, but their impacts extend beyond their operations and into the ocean. Crowded and filthy fish farms create the perfect conditions for diseases to spread. A study found that disease-causing viruses and bacteria were twice as common in areas surrounding salmon farms. Parasites like sea lice escape from factory fish farms, impacting wild fish populations. Sea lice infestations are painful and sometimes deadly, growing more common as factory fish farms expand their operations. Overfishing Overfishing occurs when fish are caught and killed faster than their populations can replenish. Slow-reproducing species, like sharks, suffer the most from overfishing. '[O]ne-third of the world's assessed fisheries are currently pushed beyond their biological limits,' stated a 2022 UN blog based on information from the Food and Agriculture Organization. Commercial fishers will decimate fish populations to profit in the short term, ignoring that the practice destroys ocean ecosystems in the long term. This irresponsible fishing hurts marine life, habitats, and human communities that depend on the oceans for survival. Illegal Fishing Governments try to regulate the fishing industry to protect against overfishing, but this regulation has limitations. Commercial fishers continue to operate without licenses, kill populations in protected marine areas, and purposely leave catches unreported despite regulations. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is rampant in the fishing industry. 'Researchers estimate that at least 1 in 5 fish caught globally are caught illegally, with a total cost to coastal nations between... $10 billion and $23 billion a year,' according to a 2023 Pew article. A September 2014 study published in the Marine Policy found that an estimated 20 to 32 percent of U.S. seafood imports came from illegal catches. Sadly, illegal fishing has a disproportionate impact on developing countries, as well as on those communities most dependent on the sea for food security and income. Managing Fishing Overfishing and illegal fishing are plaguing our oceans. Fisheries continue profiting from these reckless and dangerous practices because we lack the management and enforcement to stop them, especially in international waters. When regulatory agencies and governments don't have the resources to regulate ocean areas, these areas suffer from the negative impacts of overfishing and reduced biodiversity. A study by PEW Charitable Trusts found that 'insufficient and ineffective management of industrial fishing' contributed to decreased ocean biodiversity. According to a 2019 Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services report, 'More than 40 percent of amphibian species, almost 33 percent of reef-forming corals, and more than a third of all marine mammals are threatened [with extinction].' Illegal fishing has even taken a toll on marine protected areas (MPAs)—critical marine habitats—where fishing is prohibited but still occurs due to lack of enforcement of protections. In December 2022, world leaders took relevant steps to reverse the damage to our marine ecosystems by making a 'commitment to protect and conserve 30 percent of the world's land, freshwater, and ocean by 2030,' according to the World Wildlife Fund. There is a need to ensure this goal is achieved by coming up with meaningful conservation measures and dedicating more human and financial resources toward this goal. The Cruelty of Fishing The fishing industry prioritizes profit above all else. Whether catching fish in the wild or raising them in a crowded factory fish farm, the industry operates with the same goal: kill the maximum number of fish in the shortest time. Its reckless pursuit of profit leaves ocean environments damaged beyond recovery and inflicts massive suffering on marine life everywhere. These fish are not mindless creatures; each one is a unique individual. They have complex inner lives, social dynamics, and problem-solving skills. They will go to great lengths to care for and defend their babies and even seek comfort from one another when they are stressed. As we learn more about the underwater lives of fish, it becomes clear that they are not so different from the land animals we know and love. And, like land animals, fish can feel pain. The commercial fishing industry inflicts pain on an unfathomable scale. When they are suddenly and violently pulled from their ocean homes, the rapid change in pressure their bodies experience causes decompression sickness—the same illness that scuba divers refer to as 'the bends.' The resulting gas build-up can rupture fish's swim bladders or cause blood clots and hemorrhaging. After fish are reeled to the surface, they suffocate to death. Their agonizing last moments can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours or even months. Many fish species must constantly move to get a consistent water flow over their gills. When they stop moving, they suffocate from lack of oxygen. Discarded fishing equipment like nets and longlines indiscriminately don't only suffocate fish. Still, entanglement by such equipment also kills an estimated 300,000 whales, dolphins, and porpoises each year, according to the International Whaling Commission. The industry's cruelty doesn't stop at the pain it causes marine life. Investigations by the Environmental Justice Foundation revealed slave labor in the fishing industry in 2019. Workers endured dangerous and filthy conditions aboard fishing vessels, spending long hours doing manual labor without food or water. In interviews, workers shared that their bosses would dock their already meager wages, verbally threaten them, and sometimes physically assault them. All of this exploitation and abuse goes on to bolster the multibillion-dollar global seafood market. When it comes to maximizing profits, there are no depths to which the fishing industry won't sink. What You Can Do The fishing industry sees only the bottom line. It abuses workers and animals to maximize profit. It plunders ocean ecosystems, turning once-vibrant, diverse environments into barren wastelands and weakening our planet's defenses against climate change. However, we have the power to stand up to the fishing industry and end its destruction. When we remove fish from our plates, we remove the industry's incentive to destroy ocean wildlife and our environment. Instead, we can opt for foods that are kinder to animals and the environment. Innovations in plant-based seafood are challenging the fish industry, with companies offering fish-free, ocean-friendly versions of everything from sushi to fried shrimp. Some startups are experimenting with 'lab-grown' seafood, harvesting natural fish cells to create authentic seafood without killing fish. Switching to compassionate, plant-based options benefits the oceans and can make a huge difference for the planet.

Leftists Attack Religious Liberty In Europe – OpEd	The Observatory on Intolerance and Discrimination against Christians in Europe (OIDAC Europe) annually collects data on the state of religious liberty. Its latest report garnered media coverage on both sides of the Atlantic, but most of it was simply a tally of offenses committed against Christians; the motives of the perpetrators were given scant coverage. Had they probed more deeply, they would have reported on the oversized role played by militant secularists. Given that most of the major media outlets in North America and Europe are left-of-center, this outcome is not surprising. It seems clear that this was less an oversight than a calculated decision. In the nearly 15 years that OIDAC Europe has been documenting anti-Christian hate crimes, there has been a steady increase in the number of incidents; they range from vandalism to murder. The researchers found there were 2,444 anti-Christian hate crimes in 35 European countries last year, including 232 personal attacks on Christians. France, the United Kingdom and Germany posted the worst records. Who’s mostly responsible? The 2024 Report says most of the attacks were done by (a) radical Islamists (b) those who were anti-religious and (c) those who identify with the radical left. The latter two categories combine for the large share of the offenses, and although the Report does not say so explicitly, those two demographic groups are representative of militant secularists. A review of the types of offenses detailed by the Report validates this conclusion. Radical Muslims are not the biggest threat to religious liberty in Europe; it is left-wing radicals who harbor an animus against Christianity. It should be mentioned that much the same kind of persecution is taking place in Canada and in the United States. For example, those who follow traditional Christian teachings were discriminated against by losing their jobs, being subjected to unfounded investigations, the closing of bank accounts, humiliation and bullying. 'Expressing religious convictions such as ‘marriage is a union between one man and one woman,’ or ‘human life begins at conception,’' were among the reasons Christians lost their jobs. Those are the kinds of beliefs that trigger militant secularists on the left to act, not radical Islamists (they are more prone to strike out against converts to Christianity). The Report also found that 'In the context of employment, Christians who expressed traditional views, were often reported by activists, subjected to disciplinary hearings—which some described as interrogations about their personal beliefs—and subsequently dismissed.' Left-wing activists fit the bill completely. Here’s how discrimination on the basis of traditional moral beliefs works. 'Any mention of faith in a CV precludes one from an interview. My yearly assessment was lowered because I spoke of Christ.' That is precisely the type of bullying that secular activists are very good at. Besides the workplace, traditional Christians are being targeted in the universities. 'This perception seems to stem mainly from a hostile attitude towards Christianity among students from the political left and from negative preconceptions about Christians that are attributed to anyone who professes the Christian faith.' That says it all. Some Christian haters in Europe have gone so far as to punish praying in public. They even attack those who pray silently. Christians are being interrogated by the police, fined and prosecuted if they pray outside an abortion clinic. Adam Smith-Connor is an army veteran and father. He was found guilty in October 2024 by a British court after 'praying silently in his own mind in a public area in a so-called ‘buffer zone,’ because at one point his head was seen slightly bowed and his hands were clasped.' That was it. In Northern Ireland a woman who was caught peacefully praying by the roadside now faces up to six months in prison if found guilty. In May, another person who was simply standing on a public street corner in a 'buffer zone' in Birmingham was asked by the police, 'Are you here to pray for the lives of unborn children?' By the way, these 'buffer zones' include private homes: it is against the law in Scotland for private home owners to display pro-life signs if they can be seen within 200 meters of the premises. This is the kind of thing we would expect from the dictators in North Korea, not democratically elected officials in Europe. Transgenderism is all the rage in Europe. They are now banning teachers in the U.K. for 'misgendering' a transgender pupil, meaning they are punishing teachers for calling a boy a boy and a girl a girl even when the boys and girls falsely claim that they are of the opposite sex. In Switzerland, the government took a couple’s 16-year-old daughter from her parents and placed her in a state home because the parents objected to her 'gender transition.' This is the mark of totalitarians, and it is not radical Islamists who are doing it. It is the work of militant left-wing secularists who hate Christianity. They are locking up the wrong people in Europe.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgPEKlDDg-hAAbphW6klGP	2024-12-05T09:09:26-08:00	
Pakistan: The Politics Of Misinformation And Human Rights Violati...	In the realm of modern politics, misinformation and human rights abuses have become potent tools for gaining political leverage. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) stands accused of embracing this troubling trend, with serious allegations that include spreading false narratives, violating fundamental rights, and exploiting international organizations to shield its actions. The implications of such strategies extend beyond partisan politics, threatening the stability of democratic norms and eroding public trust. Misinformation: A Political Weapon In the digital age, misinformation is one of the most destructive forces in political discourse. PTI has capitalized on social media's vast reach to propagate baseless allegations and conspiracy theories. Through well-coordinated campaigns, the party has cultivated an alternate reality that serves its political agenda. This misinformation strategy often paints state institutions as oppressive forces, thereby delegitimizing their role in maintaining order. For instance, protests and demonstrations linked to PTI are frequently framed as peaceful movements disrupted by heavy-handed state action. The truth, however, often tells a different story. Violence and provocation are reportedly instigated by militant elements within the protests, creating chaos while deflecting blame onto the government. Such tactics sow division among citizens, undermining societal cohesion and trust in democratic institutions. Furthermore, the deliberate spread of misinformation diverts attention from pressing issues, allowing the party to evade accountability for its failures. Human Rights Violations: A Troubling Pattern PTI has long positioned itself as a champion of justice and human rights. However, reports of its actions suggest otherwise. Allegations of coercion, harassment, and provocation during public demonstrations paint a picture of a political movement willing to compromise fundamental rights to further its objectives. A stark example is the November 25 protests, where PTI allegedly orchestrated violent confrontations to provoke law enforcement agencies. Innocent participants, unaware of the underlying agenda, were placed in harm’s way. The calculated use of human lives as pawns in a political game reflects a blatant disregard for human rights and ethical standards. This hypocrisy extends to internal dynamics, where dissent within the party is reportedly suppressed, and opposition voices are met with intimidation. Such behavior highlights the selective application of human rights principles, undermining the party's moral authority on the issue. Amnesty International: A Complicit Bystander? Amnesty International, known for its global advocacy of human rights, has faced criticism for its silence on PTI’s alleged abuses. While the organization has been vocal about state actions in Pakistan, its failure to address PTI’s role in inciting violence and spreading misinformation is conspicuous. This selective focus raises questions about Amnesty’s impartiality. By ignoring PTI’s activities, the organization inadvertently provides cover for actions that violate the very rights it seeks to protect. This inconsistency weakens Amnesty’s credibility and detracts from its broader mission of promoting justice and accountability. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of PTI’s approach is the alleged willingness to sacrifice innocent lives for political gain. Reports suggest that the party deliberately incited violence during protests, hoping to provoke lethal responses from law enforcement. Such tactics are designed to create a narrative of state oppression, fueling further unrest and rallying supporters around a perceived injustice. These actions not only endanger lives but also set a dangerous precedent for future political movements. Normalizing such behavior erodes ethical standards in politics and undermines the sanctity of peaceful protest. The consequences of PTI’s strategies extend far beyond the immediate political landscape. The normalization of misinformation, human rights abuses, and the exploitation of international organizations threatens the integrity of Pakistan’s democratic system. Moreover, these actions contribute to a culture of impunity, where political actors feel emboldened to disregard ethical and legal boundaries. This trend poses a significant challenge to efforts aimed at fostering transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights in the country. Conclusion The allegations against PTI highlight a troubling intersection of political opportunism and ethical compromise. Misinformation, human rights violations, and the manipulation of international organizations are not merely tactics; they are threats to the democratic fabric of Pakistan. Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes accountability and upholds the principles of transparency and justice. Only through collective efforts can Pakistan build a political culture that respects the rights and aspirations of its people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgPEKlDDg-hC0zIz6vxNFk	2024-12-05T09:07:45-08:00	
Advancing Deterrence Amid Operational Vulnerabilities – OpEd	India’s successful test of the K-4 Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat represents a significant stride in the nation's defense strategy. The missile, with a range of 3,500 kilometers and the capacity to carry nuclear warheads, enhances India's nuclear deterrence, particularly its second-strike capability. This advancement is a key component of India's nuclear doctrine, which aims to provide a credible deterrent against potential adversaries. However, alongside these advancements are persistent operational vulnerabilities that raise critical concerns. India’s track record of defense mishaps, technical failures, and operational lapses casts doubt on its ability to manage such sophisticated systems effectively. These shortcomings not only undermine India’s strategic posture but also exacerbate the risks of instability in the already volatile South Asian region. The cornerstone of any credible nuclear deterrent is the assurance of a second-strike capability. Submarine-launched ballistic missiles play a crucial role in this framework, as they provide a concealed and survivable platform for retaliation. The deployment of the K-4 SLBM on INS Arighaat reinforces India’s position as a nation capable of responding to a nuclear attack, thereby discouraging adversaries from considering a first strike. This development is particularly relevant in South Asia, where the security dynamics are shaped by long-standing tensions between nuclear-armed neighbors. For India, a robust second-strike capability serves as a counterbalance to threats from both Pakistan and China, enhancing its strategic autonomy. Yet, the efficacy of this deterrence is heavily reliant on the reliability and operational readiness of its delivery systems. While the K-4 SLBM test is a technological achievement, it highlights the broader operational challenges within India’s defense infrastructure. The Indian military’s history is replete with incidents that reveal systemic flaws in managing advanced technology. One of the most notable examples is the 2013 sinking of INS Sindhurakshak, a submarine that exploded due to an onboard fire. This incident not only resulted in the loss of valuable personnel and equipment but also raised serious questions about safety protocols and maintenance practices. Similarly, the accidental launch of a BrahMos missile into Pakistani territory in 2022 exposed glaring deficiencies in command and control mechanisms. Another critical incident was the operational failure aboard INS Arihant, where a hatch mishap rendered the nuclear-powered submarine inoperable for over a year. This error, attributed to human negligence, underscores the challenges of maintaining operational discipline in high-stakes environments. Such incidents are not isolated but indicative of deeper issues in training, maintenance, and oversight within India’s military apparatus. The operational shortcomings in India’s defense systems have significant implications for regional security. South Asia is a region characterized by high levels of militarization, mutual distrust, and limited crisis management mechanisms. In such an environment, even minor lapses can have outsized consequences. The accidental BrahMos missile launch is a case in point. Although the incident did not escalate into a broader conflict, it highlighted the precariousness of the regional security architecture. The presence of nuclear weapons only heightens these risks, as any misstep involving these capabilities could lead to catastrophic consequences. Moreover, India’s defense advancements, such as the K-4 SLBM, risk fueling an arms race in the region. Pakistan and China, as India’s primary adversaries, are likely to respond by accelerating their own defense programs. This creates a security dilemma, where efforts by one state to enhance its security provoke countermeasures by others, leading to a cycle of escalating tensions. The credibility of a nuclear deterrent is not solely dependent on its technical capabilities but also on the safety and reliability of its management. India’s track record of defense mishaps raises serious concerns in this regard. The sinking of INS Sindhurakshak, the BrahMos misfire, and the Arihant hatch failure all point to systemic issues that could undermine confidence in India’s nuclear posture. Safety is another critical concern. The management of nuclear-powered submarines and missile systems requires rigorous protocols to prevent accidents that could endanger not only military personnel but also civilian populations and the environment. Any incident involving India’s nuclear arsenal would have far-reaching consequences, both regionally and globally. India’s test of the K-4 SLBM marks a significant milestone in its strategic defense capabilities, underscoring its ambitions to establish a credible nuclear deterrent. However, this achievement is overshadowed by persistent operational vulnerabilities and safety concerns that undermine the credibility of its deterrence. The systemic issues within India’s defense infrastructure—ranging from technical failures and human errors to delays in project execution—pose serious risks not only to India but also to regional stability. In a highly volatile region like South Asia, these vulnerabilities exacerbate security dilemmas and heighten the risk of unintended escalation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgPEKlDDg-hD8NOjERTJH6	2024-12-05T09:04:10-08:00	
Luring A Man, Sexual Coercion, And The Patriarchal Narratives – O...	There are thousands of self-help books, articles, and social media pages that promise to reveal the secrets to luring different types of people—whether it's a romantic partner, employees, employers, or individuals in positions of power and wealth. Additionally, there are thousands of consultancies cater to corporations and politicians, offering strategies to lure the masses based on their fraudulent propaganda. These resources claim to unveil strategies, techniques, and mindsets that supposedly unlock the keys to successful luring in personal, political, and professional relationships. From tips on effective communication to mastering body language, eye contact, sweet talk and confidence, the vast range of advice often suggests methods to manipulate, persuade, or influence and lure others in ways that appear to promise instant gratification. While some of these books may offer valuable insights into human behaviour and personal development, it’s important to remember that genuine connections—built on trust, respect, and authenticity—cannot be achieved through mere techniques or manipulative tactics of luring. The concept of 'luring' as an act is as ancient as the origin of humanity itself. Men and women have historically lured each other for various reasons, often tied to everyday survival. Humans are drawn to many things—food, money, power, position, health, house, prosperity, knowledge, qualities, as well as spiritual, emotional, and physical attractions. Lure, both as a need and a desire, is an intrinsic human quality. Lure is often used as a tool of coercion to humiliate women, casting doubt on their character by questioning their promiscuity and integrity. However, the core issue lies in the concept of 'luring' itself: how is it defined? What constitutes evidence for it? And how is it justified within the context of sexual violence against women? As a strategy, lure has been utilised by ruling and non-ruling classes, corporations, and governments throughout history to shape societies—sometimes driving positive transitions and other times reinforcing negative patterns. The lure of knowledge, science, equality, justice, liberty, happiness, peace, and prosperity can lead to positive transformations of individuals, families, communities, societies, states, governments, and other social, political, economic, cultural and spiritual institutions. On the other hand, the lure of money, power, positions, and commodified culture often traps people in mundane routines, limiting their potential. Meanwhile, mutual attraction in relationships—whether sexual or otherwise—based on equality, mutual respect, and dignity can facilitate progressive transformations of gender relations. Such relationships and transformations hold the potential to challenge and eventually dismantle different forms of entrenched patriarchy. In the age of patriarchal digital capitalism, both online and offline lures—manifesting in various forms and channels—have increasingly become subtle tools of coercion, disguised as individual choice. This coercion is often framed to appear as personal acceptance or consent. Perpetrators who misuse their power, position, or access to opportunities to commit acts of sexual harassment often exploit the concept of 'luring' to justify their behaviour or evade accountability for their crimes. Rapists and sexual harassers often shift blame onto women, citing lure of so-called 'provocative' clothing as an excuse to justify their crimes. Similarly, market-driven culture of capitalism employs advertising to manipulate and lure unsuspecting consumers into purchasing products and services under the guise of 'consumer choice.' Such practices are deeply rooted in the exploitative narratives of patriarchal capitalism. Men in positions of power frequently use lure as a strategy to rationalise their sexual harassment of subordinates. This tactic serves to trivialise sexual assault, framing it as a mutual interaction rather than acknowledging it as a crime. Lure, in this context, is a weapon of patriarchy used to undermine the gravity of sexual violence. It is important to celebrate 'lure' as a natural human quality of engagement that fosters organic connections, while rejecting its use as a manipulative strategy rooted in patriarchal narratives portraying women as evil temptresses.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgPEKlDDg-hAulz_C_QcFW	2024-12-05T09:01:35-08:00	
Myanmar’s Elections Will Be A China-Sponsored Fraud – Analysis	By Alexis Turek The State Administration Council (SAC) junta in Myanmar is in its worst position since the beginning of the civil war in February 2021. Operation 1027, a joint assault in October 2023 by three ethnic armed organisations in northern Shan state, has catalysed rebel victories across the country. The ethnic armed organisations and other rebel People’s Defence Forces have been making significant territorial gains, targeting border areas, junta bases and industry centres. The SAC has resorted to mandating military service for all men and women, including forcibly recruiting Rohingya into service under threat of arrest. Following the new conscription law, reports have emerged of abductions and illegal detention, with large numbers of young people fleeing to Thailand to escape conscription. The SAC has faced significant territorial losses, impacting its ability to extract vital resources. While the conflict is unlikely to stop soon, rebel forces now stand a better chance of victory than they have at any other point in the conflict. The possibility of a SAC loss of power and the inevitable transition period as a new government is formed presents an element of unpredictability that many observer states seek to avoid — none more than China. Beijing’s Myanmar strategy is one characterised by pragmatism. China maintains relations with both the SAC and a number of ethnic armed organisations and has provided political and material support to parties involved in both sides of the conflict. With the relaunching of operations along the Chinese border, Beijing has grown increasingly frustrated with SAC leadership and northern ethnic armed organisations for spreading conflict which threatens Chinese interests. Along with its concern for Chinese populations along the border, China also has significant economic interests in Myanmar, including a natural gas pipeline, rare earth mineral mines and a port to be established in southwest Myanmar. While some of these economic projects began under the deposed National League for Democracy government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, the SAC has continued to work closely with China and Beijing has no guarantee that any ethnic armed organisation would be willing to carry out the same level of economic cooperation. With no centralised opposition force representing all rebel factions in Myanmar, the SAC remains China’s best alliance option. It is no wonder that China has pushed so hard in talks with combatants and in high-level meetings with regional leaders for an end to the conflict in Myanmar. China has attempted to negotiate ceasefires multiple times, all of which have been broken. Any China-led negotiations benefit the SAC by stopping rebel momentum and allowing the SAC’s armed forces — the Tatmadaw — to regroup and direct their attention elsewhere. Elections have emerged as a key component of Chinese support for the SAC, following a broader pattern within Chinese foreign policy. In August, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi promised to provide technological assistance and monetary aid for the SAC’s upcoming elections. China also made its desire for a ‘democratic transition’ in Myanmar clear in meetings with ASEAN political leaders. The SAC has ensured that they will win any elections that take place, having dissolved 40 opposition parties — including the National League for Democracy, which won almost 90 per cent of the popular vote in Myanmar’s last election in 2020. Other political parties have been prevented from registering for the election. This almost certain victory would allow the SAC to portray itself as the democratically elected government of Myanmar and the rebels as threats to democracy, changing the narrative of the civil war. China and the SAC’s other allies will certainly latch onto this new narrative. Promoting democracy and peace efforts has increasingly been a part of Beijing’s foreign affairs strategy, as China has been seeking to portray itself as a peaceful nation and a key player on the world stage. It would serve China’s best interest if Beijing were able to successfully lead Myanmar towards peace, even if the government it props up is inherently authoritarian. The SAC plans to carry out elections in 2025 with support from the Chinese government. The United States, Japan, South Korea and other democracies must expose these elections for what they are: unfree and unfair. SAC-backed elections will not reflect public support in Myanmar and they certainly will not bring about an end to fighting. Instead, states should work with opposition groups to ensure a truly peaceful transition once the SAC is defeated. While Washington has already taken steps towards dialogue with the shadow National Unity Government, additional messaging campaigns need to occur if elections are held in 2025, to delegitimise the SAC and communicate that their attempts to hold on to power do not reflect the desires of the people of Myanmar. The SAC, China and their allies will try to take control of the narrative surrounding these elections. The United States and its allies must take control of it first.

The Case For An IndoMed Quad: India, Italy, UAE, And US Cooperati...	By Emanuele Rossi (FPRI) -- The Indo-Mediterranean region faces escalating instability, from Houthi missile strikes disrupting maritime routes vital to piracy and regional conflicts in the Horn of Africa. A strategic IndoMed Quad—comprising the United States, United Arab Emirates, India, and Italy—offers a pragmatic framework to address these challenges. The convergence of security, economic, and geopolitical interests among these four nations and their strengthening bilateral relations positions them to act together effectively. With shared commitments to maritime security, infrastructure development, and counterterrorism efforts, this alignment could provide a sustainable solution for regional stability and promote long-term integration across the Indo-Mediterranean corridor. Since the eruption of violence in Gaza following Hamas’s October 7 attack, the geopolitical significance of the 'Indo-Mediterranean'—a term gaining currency in Italian strategic circles—has come into sharp focus. Amid regional instability and security threats, the evolving relationships between the United States, the United Arab Emirates, India, and Italy suggest the formation of a new cooperative alliance: an 'IndoMed Quad.' This integrated cooperation could address the region’s security and developmental challenges, offering a pragmatic solution to stabilize one of the world’s most critical maritime corridors. Strengthening Bilateral Ties as the Foundation of the IndoMed Quad Bilateral relations among the prospective IndoMed Quad members have strengthened considerably in recent years, providing a solid foundation for this new strategic alliance. The US-UAE relationship has deepened, with the United Arab Emirates now designated a 'major defense partner.' This partnership encompasses joint security initiatives similar to those within the original Quad (United States, India, Japan, and Australia), reflecting Washington’s broader latticework approach to regional security alliances. The United Arab Emirates and India have also bolstered their defense cooperation, holding joint military exercises and enhancing maritime security in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. The IndoMed Quad would be a natural extension of this cooperation, building on existing frameworks like the Twelfth Joint Defense Cooperation Committee and India’s active engagement in the US-India Critical and Emerging Technology initiative. Italy’s strong presence in the region, with naval leadership in operations such as EuNavForMed Atalanta, Aspedes, and Combined Task Force 153, positions it as a natural partner in this framework. Italy’s defense industry, including joint ventures like the Fincantieri partnership in the United Arab Emirates, further strengthens its role in the IndoMed Quad. Italy’s expertise, demonstrated by its carrier strike group, Nave Cavour, currently active in the Indo-Pacific, complements its broader diplomatic and defense contributions. The Italian Navy has emerged as the foremost European naval force regarding operational capabilities and interoperability with non-NATO assets. Notably, apart from the United States, it is the first and only NATO force to achieve Initial Operational Capability with the F-35 from a naval platform. This milestone was reached during the mission of the Italian aircraft carrier Nave Cavour and its carrier strike group in the Indo-Pacific. This achievement is particularly compelling for countries like India and Japan, seeking to augment their air-sea military capabilities. Consequently, the Italian Navy positions itself as a critical operative force within the Indo-Mediterranean framework and a maritime power with future oceanic projections. A Region at the Crossroads of Global Security The instability stemming from Houthi missile strikes in Yemen illustrates how vulnerable the Indo-Mediterranean region is to geopolitical disruptions. Iran-backed Houthi militias have repeatedly targeted commercial vessels traveling through the Suez Canal, a vital artery connecting Europe and Asia. These attacks have disrupted global supply chains, forcing some shipping companies to reroute vessels around Africa—an option that increases both costs and delivery times. This geopolitical flashpoint is exacerbated by reports that Russia may supply the Houthis with hypersonic Yakhont missiles, potentially leveraging the Yemeni conflict to further its strategic interests in Ukraine and beyond. These interconnected crises highlight how global security risks converge in the Indo-Mediterranean, where regional instability directly impacts the global economy. This region exemplifies the close interdependence between political stability and geoeconomic conditions. Moreover, the prospect of Russia supplying advanced weaponry to the Houthis adds additional complexity, reflecting Moscow’s broader geopolitical strategy to challenge Western interests. Rising Piracy and Broader Regional Instability In addition to Houthi aggression, piracy resurfaced in the western Indian Ocean, particularly near Somalia, the Comoros, and Seychelles. In October, Admiral Aurelio De Carolis, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Fleet, told reporters in Vasco, Goa, that the threat posed by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel group 'in some way, may have contributed to a resurgence of piracy in the area.' These pirate attacks, also linked to groups like al-Shabaab, threaten maritime routes essential for transporting oil and gas to Asia. As key regional actors, the United Arab Emirates and India have significant stakes in securing these lanes, which are vital for global energy supplies. India, for instance, has ambitions to transform its ports into strategic hubs for Southeast Asia’s energy security, leveraging its multimodal connections with the United Arab Emirates. However, the resurgence of piracy and the possibility of pirates hijacking oil tankers pose a severe risk to these ambitions. Houthi militias, in concert with al-Shabaab, could exacerbate this threat as terrorism and piracy become increasingly intertwined in the Indo-Mediterranean. Furthermore, the broader instability in the Horn of Africa, exemplified by Sudan’s humanitarian crisis and rising tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia, further complicates the security environment. Russia and China’s Strategic Ambiguity Russia and China’s presence in the Indo-Mediterranean region is marked by strategic ambiguity, adding complexity to regional stability efforts. On the one hand, Russia may have provided support to the Houthis in Yemen, allegedly using satellite intelligence relayed through Iranian proxies to identify and target merchant vessels transiting the Red Sea. Despite attempts by cargo ships to obscure their AIS signals, Russian satellites reportedly enabled the Houthis to track commercial routes and plan targeted attacks. On the other hand, while not offering direct military support to the Houthis, China has adopted a similarly ambiguous stance. It refrains from participating in US-led maritime security operations, opting for a low-profile approach that allows it to economically benefit from regional stability without actively contributing. In the meantime, it has allegedly paid no heed to the group’s efforts to acquire arms-related technology from Chinese sources. This strategic ambiguity between Russia and China mirrors the varying approaches of the IndoMed Quad members. Russia and China are global systemic rivals for the United States, met with a resolute counter stance. While aligned toward rivalry, Italy takes a less aggressive approach, while India maintains a nuanced position—competing with China but still relying on Russia for military and energy supplies. The United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, sustains primarily commercial relations with both countries, with Russia playing a pivotal role within the OPEC+ framework. However, suppose Russia and China were indeed to provide substantial assistance to the Houthis in destabilizing Indo-Mediterranean maritime security. In that case, all four IndoMed Quad actors would likely converge in recognizing this shared threat, leading to a more unified response. Strategic Infrastructure and Connectivity Projects Against this backdrop, infrastructure and connectivity projects initiated by the potential IndoMed Quad nations represent a pathway toward stability and development. The UAE’s 'One port, one node' initiative, which aims to establish a network of ports and bases stretching from the Gulf to the Mediterranean, aligns with India’s 'Africa Strategy,' which seeks to enhance connectivity and infrastructure in East Africa. Simultaneously, the United States invests heavily in the Lobito Corridor, a transcontinental infrastructure project linking the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, designed to foster development while countering Chinese influence in Africa. Italy, for its part, has launched the Mattei Plan, a broad strategy for development in Africa focused on infrastructure and energy projects. These initiatives demonstrate how the IndoMed Quad nations are working to strengthen regional connectivity, counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative, and stabilize critical economic corridors. IMEC: The Cornerstone of Shared Interests The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) announced at the G20 summit in New Delhi represents the most apparent manifestation of these shared interests. IMEC, which aims to establish a more resilient trade route between Europe, the Middle East, and India, offers an alternative to routes vulnerable to geopolitical disruption, such as those threatened by Houthi missile strikes or the accidental blockages seen in the Suez Canal (as occurred with the Ever Given in 2021). This initiative also incorporates digital and energy connectivity, including green hydrogen infrastructure, further underscoring the corridor’s strategic importance. Moreover, IMEC could complement the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation on the other side of the Indian subcontinent, forming a broader geostrategic network linking Europe and Southeast Asia. For the IndoMed Quad members, this 'tentacular' system would integrate nearly half of the globe’s circumference, positioning India as a crucial hub between East and West while boosting the United Arab Emirates and Italy’s strategic projections into Southeast Asia. The United States, meanwhile, would act as the global guarantor of this resilient and reliable system of interregional relations. Integrated Security Response At the heart of the IndoMed Quad must be a unified, integrated security response designed to address the region’s complex and interconnected threats. The Indo-Mediterranean corridor, spanning from the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean, is rife with security challenges, including piracy, terrorism, and geopolitical tensions. To confront these effectively, the IndoMed Quad must operate as a collective defense framework, combining its four members’ military and intelligence capacities. Multifaceted Security Threats: The IndoMed Quad nations face diverse security challenges, from Houthi missile strikes threatening commercial vessels in the Red Sea to piracy along key energy routes near Somalia. These asymmetric threats cannot be tackled by individual nations alone. The Quad could offer a comprehensive solution by pooling resources and implementing multilateral military strategies. Integrating naval assets, defense coordination, and rapid-response forces across member nations would provide the necessary infrastructure to counter these threats swiftly. Defense Interoperability: Given that the United States, India, United Arab Emirates, and Italy already engage in bilateral and multilateral defense collaborations, enhancing interoperability is critical. Joint naval exercises, coordinated military patrols, and shared defense technologies are some avenues through which the IndoMed Quad could operationalize its security commitments. For instance, Italy’s involvement in EU-led naval missions in the Mediterranean and Gulf of Aden could be synchronized with US and Indian naval capacities to secure maritime chokepoints, ensuring a unified defense posture. Intelligence Sharing and Real-Time Coordination: A vital pillar of the IndoMed Quad’s security architecture must be intelligence sharing. By establishing a real-time data and intelligence-sharing framework, the Quad would ensure that all members are equally equipped to preempt and respond to threats. This coordination is crucial for counterterrorism operations targeting groups like al-Shabaab, as well as for monitoring state-sponsored disruptions from actors such as Iran and Russia. Real-time intelligence could help identify risks before they escalate, strengthening the Quad’s capacity to protect critical maritime corridors. Strategic Maritime Focus: The IndoMed Quad’s combined efforts must emphasize maritime security, safeguarding one of the world’s most vital trade corridors. Joint naval patrols, establishing maritime security frameworks, and increasing presence in Indo-Mediterranean waters would ensure that commercial shipping remains safe from piracy, missile strikes, and other disruptions. With India and the United Arab Emirates positioned as strategic hubs and the United States and Italy contributing significant naval power, the Quad could ensure long-term stability across these crucial sea lanes. By integrating their military, intelligence, and defense capacities, the IndoMed Quad would counter existing threats and serve as a long-term stabilizing force in the region. This cooperation would represent a unified approach to security that complements the Quad’s economic and developmental goals, ensuring that the Indo-Mediterranean remains secure and open to global commerce. Why not for a Quint with Egypt? By transforming the IndoMed Quad into a flexible, adaptive 'Quint,' the inclusion of Egypt would add a pivotal geostrategic layer to this framework and would enhance resilience and stability across critical corridors, creating a unified system capable of addressing the complex security and developmental challenges of the region. At the nexus of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, Egypt is a middle-space country akin to Rome and a bridge across crucial trade and security corridors linking Europe, Asia, and Africa. Beyond the United States, the other members of this potential 'Quint' would be middle powers, each with specific regional influence but with shared interests in countering asymmetric threats like piracy, terrorism, and broader security challenges. Cairo’s ambitions for regional leadership demonstrated through its efforts to diversify partnerships and address vulnerabilities in energy and food security (with India supplying wheat to Egypt), align closely with the IndoMed Quad’s goals. Egypt maintains robust bilateral relationships with each IndoMed Quad member, further supporting its potential integration into this coalition. Italy and Egypt share a longstanding cooperation in areas such as defense, energy, and migration management, which places Italy in a favorable position to advocate Egypt’s inclusion. The United Arab Emirates and Egypt, meanwhile, enjoy a strategic partnership rooted in economic investment and security cooperation, especially within the Red Sea region. Similarly, Egypt and India have strengthened ties through joint infrastructure projects and shared commitments to maritime security. The United States, as Egypt’s long-standing defense partner, provides substantial military aid and collaborates on security initiatives that reinforce stability across the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, as well as with a Joint Economic Commission. A Vision for Stability and Long-term Cooperation The IndoMed Quad emerges as a logical and pragmatic solution to the region’s security challenges. By coordinating efforts, the United States, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, and India can effectively address piracy, terrorism, and geopolitical instability while promoting regional development and integration. In doing so, the IndoMed Quad would counter the influence of revisionist powers like Russia, China, and Iran and serve as a cornerstone of a stable Indo-Mediterranean order. The IndoMed Quad, alongside alliances such as the original Quad, AUKUS, and the Camp David Principles, would represent a critical component of the US strategy to ensure a secure and prosperous future for the region, reinforcing the global rules-based order. Ultimately, the IndoMed Quad could serve as an initial model of a flexible mini/lateral system, its objectives, strategic operations, and frameworks to the constantly evolving geopolitical landscape. In doing so, it should be open to a 'plus' format, incorporating, for instance, countries like Egypt as aforementioned, or Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states in matters concerning the Red Sea and even potentially extending to African nations or states in the Horn of Africa. This adaptive and inclusive approach would underscore the IndoMed Quad’s role as a practical and functional geopolitical framework capable of fluidly adjusting to emerging regional needs and specific circumstances.

Decouple Trade And IP Protection – OpEd	Many of us who support free trade and private property rights tend to look favorably on regional and bilateral treaties that claim to further these goals. There is a vast network of bilateral investment treaties, or BITs, for example, designed to promote foreign direct investment by Western firms into developing nations by limiting the host state’s ability to expropriate the investments. These BITs aim to strengthen the property rights of international investors in the host state so as to make investment less risky. There are more than 2,500 BITs in force worldwide; the US itself currently has BITs in place with 39 countries. BITs and other measures can benefit both host states and international investors by strengthening local property rights, as I explain in International Investment, Political Risk, and Dispute Resolution. In addition to investment treaties that concern the property rights of foreign investors in host countries, there is also a global network of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements ostensibly aimed at promoting trade between nations. Many of us favored so-called free trade agreements like NAFTA even if we would have preferred more radical approaches. Regional, multilateral, and bilateral trade agreements are viewed as incremental improvements even if thousands of pages of regulations could be easily replaced by a couple of sentences or, better, unilateral abolition of import tariffs. But over time it has become apparent that 'free trade' agreements often serve as a pretext for exporting Western intellectual property (IP) law—mainly US-style patent and copyright law—onto the rest of the world. This is what I call IP imperialism. Here’s how it works. First, we are told that intellectual property rights are legitimate, and in fact are part of the reason for the relative success of the industrialized countries in the West. (It’s not. For more on this, see You Can’t Own Ideas: Essays on Intellectual Property.) Next, developing countries are chided for not having strong IP law enforcement. They are even accused of 'stealing' know-how and technology from Western capitalist firms as if there is something wrong with manufacturers in a developing country using the most efficient known production techniques. Finally, the West, primarily the US, uses its leverage to pressure developing nations to adopt and strengthen IP protections and adopt international IP treaties, primarily for the benefit of US corporate interests, namely pharmaceuticals (patent) and Hollywood and music (copyright). This has led to various IP treaties on copyright, patent, trademark, and so on, which most states and the world are party to (including China, Russia, North Korea, and so on) and which require member states to protect IP in their national legislation. And there is continual agitation by the Western powers to add even more IP protections and to pressure other countries to adopt them. In addition to international IP treaties, the US and other countries pressure developing countries to strengthen local IP protection by including IP provisions in multilateral, regional, and bilateral free trade agreements. The US does not deny this; it admits it. As stated by the United States Trade Representative: 'USTR’s Innovation and Intellectual Property (IIP) uses a wide range of bilateral and multilateral trade tools to promote strong intellectual property laws and effective enforcement worldwide, reflecting the importance of intellectual property and innovation to the future growth of the U.S. economy. … Key areas of work include: … the negotiation, implementation, and monitoring of intellectual property provisions of trade agreements … ' But the ostensible purpose of a free trade agreement is simply to lower tariffs and barriers to international trade. Such an agreement really should have nothing to do with the property rights in force in the other country (unlike BITs, which do concern the protection of property rights of foreign investors in the host country). Notice that free trade agreements never dictate to the developing country that they must respect their citizens’ property rights, not engage in eminent domain, not engage in confiscatory taxation, and so on. So then why do these 'free trade' agreements require IP rights to be protected in the developing country? In any case, this is what the US and other countries do. Their free trade agreements invariably contain a section requiring developing nations to strengthen their local IP law. For example the agreement may require the other state to increase its copyright term even beyond what is required by the IP treaties. As an example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was being negotiated for years between the US and various Pacific Rim economies, until it was scuttled after Donald Trump won the US Presidency in 2016. Of course, although this supposed free trade agreement has nothing to do with the local property rights of member states, it naturally included an entire chapter requiring member states to ratchet up their local IP protections. The Berne Convention on copyright requires member states to protect copyright for at least 50 years after the author’s death (for perspective, copyright used to last for only 14 or 28 years); in the US, copyright protection now lasts for 70 years after the death of the author. The TPP proposed to require member states to follow suit. During negotiation of the TPP, Canada considered strengthening its copyright law. Finally, in 2022, as a result of terms in the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, which replaced NAFTA, Canada got on board and finally extended its copyright term to 70 years after death. In 2018, as a result of the TPP negotiations, Japan also extended its copyright term for some works. This kind of pressure works, even on other advanced economies not as beholden to IP special interests as the US government is. And developing nations of course grudgingly go along as well. They sometimes complain, even if those complaining accept the legitimacy of IP but merely want more 'balance' or 'flexibility.' See, for example, a paper by Anselm Kamperman Sanders, 'The Development Agenda for Intellectual Property: Rational Humane Policy or ‘Modern-day Communism’?,' inIntellectual Property and Free Trade Agreements (pdf), which notes: More in particular, the mounting pressure from developing nations to view intellectual property not just as a means to guarantee the interests of rightholders, but also to bring about economic development and welfare for the whole of global society. …In the fall of 2004 Argentina and Brazil submitted a formal proposal to the WIPO relating to the establishment of a new development agenda within WIPO The proposal addresses the ‘knowledge gap’ and ‘digital divide’ that separates wealthy nations from developing nations and calls for a case-by-case assessment of the role of intellectual property and its impact on development. Whereas in the previous years the prevailing trend has been to harmonise international legal norms through the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement), there is now a clear call for increased flexibility. …these provisions place the protection of intellectual property rights in the context of a balance of rights and obligations of producers and users of technical knowledge. …these provisions recognise that WTO Members are entitled to a certain degree of flexibility when it comes to the protection of public health and nutrition, and the promotion of public interest in sectors of vital importance to their socio-economic and technological development. (pp. 3–4) In other words, the WTO is supposed to protect IP but balance the harms that strict, Western-style IP enforcement puts on developing countries, by giving them flexibility, such as the ability to issue compulsory licenses (which blunt the harshness of patents), access to technology transfers, etc. However, the Western world is undermining the Development Agenda by introducing so-called TRIPS-plus obligations through the WTO system and bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). …The Development Agenda is about finding flexibility in the implementation of TRIPS obligations but also about balancing the monopoly of the intellectual property rights holder with the interests of third parties and of society as a whole. Flexibility is, however, something that sits uneasy with the current trend in intellectual property policy. This trend has been one of maximizing rights to stamp out piracy and one of harmonization to provide a one-size fits all level playing field of rights. (p. 4–5) No surprise. Sanders then quotes Bill Gates, who 'In a recent interview … even went so far as to say that restricting intellectual property rights is tantamount to communism.' As Gates said: Q. In recent years, there’s been a lot of people clamouring to reform and restrict intellectual-property rights. What’s driving this, and do you think intellectual-property laws need to be reformed? No, I’d say that of the world’s economies, there’s more that believe in intellectual property today than ever. There are fewer communists in the world today than there were. There are some new modern-day sort of communists who want to get rid of the incentive for musicians and moviemakers and software makers under various guises. They don’t think that those incentives should exist. And this debate will always be there. I’d be the first to say that the patent system can always be tuned—including the US patent system. There are some goals to cap some reform elements. But the idea that the United States has led in creating companies, creating jobs, because we’ve had the best intellectual-property system—there’s no doubt about that in my mind, and when people say they want to be the most competitive economy, they’ve got to have the incentive system. Intellectual property is the incentive system for the products of the future. It’s a shame that Sanders and others can only dimly see the real problem: that IP law is unjust. Even those who sense something is wrong with the provisions foisted on developing countries by bilateral and multilateral trade agreements (see, e.g.,www.bilaterals.org) criticize the wrong things about free trade agreements. It’s not the free trade part that is the problem. But they all sense something is unfair. In any case, Gates’s comments are ironic on many levels. First, he used tounderstand that patents impede innovation. As he said back in 1991, 'If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today’s ideas were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today.' But now Microsoft is just a huge rent-seeking IP bully. Second, his underlying assumption is that patents are pro-West, part of capitalism, and that socialism is opposed to patents. This is not true either. Most countries, including socialist ones, have IP law, even if the 'capitalist' West keeps pushing themto strengthen IP protections. This should not be a surprise since IP is inherently statist, an artificial manufacturing of pseudo-rights even as it systematically violates property rights. IP rights are not part of capitalism; it is one of modern 'capitalism’s' socialistic aberrations. The West should not foist its destructive IP laws onto developing countries and certainly should not link it to free trade.

Want To Cut Federal Workers? Just Cut Spending – Analysis	By Ryan McMaken Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been making a lot of noise about all the federal employees it plans to fire. The DOGE people have framed total federal employment as something of a proxy for the total size of the federal government. Cutting the federal workforce is all well and good, but in reality, the size of the federal payrolls doesn’t really tell us much about the growth of the federal government. Federal employment has been flat for decades. If the total number of federal workers was a good proxy for federal power, we’d be forced to conclude that the federal government has gotten smaller and weaker over the past thirty years. Obviously, that’s not remotely true given that federal spending has increased at breakneck speed. Since 1950s, federal spending has increased by more than ten-fold while federal employment has not even doubled. The federal government has grown much faster than federal employment because most of the people paid to do things by the federal government are not actual federal employees. Most federally funded workers are now contractors and grant-funded workers. This doesn’t even count the legions of state and local government employees whose jobs are partially funded by federal transfer payments to the states and locals. Like so much of what’s coming out of the Trump administration, this talk about federal employment is mostly theater. This is demonstrated in how DOGE spokesmen tell us how hard it will be to fire federal employees with civil service protections. That is, the DOGE people are already explaining to us why they won’t be able to cut federal employment—probably so they have an excuse for why so little of the federal work force will actually go away over the next four years. If Trump’s people have any interest in actually cutting the number of people who work for the federal government, they can simply start with cutting the millions of federal contract and grant workers who actually outnumber the total number of federal employees. Without federal contracts and federal grants, those employees go away. Wringing our hands about how many civil service workers there are is mostly a distraction when the real problem is federal spending. The 'Regular' Federal Workforce Has Fallen for Thirty Years As of 2023, there were approximately 2.9 million regular federal workers, including postal workers. These are the people who commonly recognize as 'civil service' workers who are directly employed by government agencies. 2023’s total is down from 1990 when the total number of federal workers was 3.1 million. What growth we do see in government employment comes from state and local workers. Including government workers at all levels, government employment continued to grow rapidly even after 1990 when federal employment peaked. Yet, even by this measure, total government employment has been largely flat. Indeed, on a per capita basis, total government employment has declined for more than 20 years. In 2002, there were 747 government workers per 10,000 Americans. In 2023, that number was 680. As noted at The Hill back in 2019—before the covid spending spree—the total number of taxpayer funded workers was more than nine million: The federal government employs nearly 9.1 million workers, comprising nearly 6 percent of total employment in the United States. The figure includes nearly 2.1 million federal employees, 4.1 million contract employees, 1.2 million grant employees, 1.3 million active duty military personnel, and more than 500,000 postal service employees. … many taxpayers may not realize they are additionally subsidizing a ballooning shadow government of some 5.3 million contract and grant employees. While politicians often promise to cut the size of government, many fail to acknowledge the increasing number of contract workers. These contract and grant workers far outnumber the 'regular' federal workers. As shown by the Project on Government Oversight in 2017, 'contractors have long been the single largest segment of Uncle Sam’s 'blended workforce,' accounting for between 30 and 42 percent of that workforce since the 1980s.' Another study from the Brookings institution shows how the blended jobs greatly outnumber the federal jobs that DOGE is fixated on: For example, in 2020, grant and contract workers totaled more than 6.8 million. Regular federal workers? They totaled only 2.7 million (counting postal workers.) In other words, any discussion of federal employment that ignores the contract and grant workers largely misses the point. Contract workers, of course, are everywhere. The ranks of aerospace engineers, Silicon Valley firms, and the 'tech sector' in general is heavily populated with millions of workers who are de facto federal employees. We have no reason to expect the Trump administration to go after these federal contract jobs, though. During Trump’s first term, he grew federal spending to pay millions of new workers funded by federal dollars: Despite campaign promises to the contrary, Trump opened the contract and grant spigots instead, adding more than 2 million jobs to the blended federal workforce including 1 million in the Departments of Defense, Transportation, and Health and Human Services Alone. Federal contract awards grew by over 40 percent during the Trump years, and it should surprise no one that the trend continued unabated through the Biden years: Trump and his backers tend to justify shoveling ever larger amounts of taxpayer dollars to federal contractors on the fact that much of that is essentially military spending. Trump has always been enthusiastic about running up massive new deficits and spending totals so long as it goes to the Pentagon. The Pentagon, of course, just failed its seventh audit in a row and has no idea how its money is spent. Nevertheless, it is very unlikely we’ll see any efforts on the part of this administration to rein in the legions of engineers and computer programmers who ostensibly work for private companies, but are actually federal workers. Just Cut Spending Cutting the federal work force does not require any ornate arguments about the civil service or how many federal employees work from home. If the Trump administration is serious about cutting the federal workforce, it will focus on simply cutting federal spending. If federal spending falls significantly, millions of workers paid by federal contracts and grants will have to join the private sector. Moreover, millions of state and local government jobs will disappear as well, given that many of them are essentially federally funded positions. It’s not really any more complicated than that.

Can Recycling Save The Clean Energy Revolution? – Analysis	The industrial revolution depended on fossil fuels. The current transition to clean energy aims to leave coal, oil, and natural gas behind. But this transition is also heavily dependent on critical metals like copper, lithium, and nickel. It’s also not clear whether the earth contains enough of these metals to support all the solar installations, wind farms, and electric vehicles that can substitute for the current fossil-fuel infrastructure. The World Bank estimated in 2019 that the energy transition will require more than three billion tons of critical minerals by 2050. Although the earth’s crust may well contain all those necessary inputs, the available supply in 2030 of lithium, copper, nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements will not likely meet the growing demand. For many governments and businesses, the answer is obvious: more mining. But the footprint for mining associated with the 'Green' transition has been growing, and so have the negative consequences. 'Generally speaking, these mines are very polluting,' reports Clàudia Bosch, the Electronics Campaign lead at SETEM Catalunya. 'They pollute water. They pollute land and air. Mining also leads to huge levels of deforestation and a loss of biodiversity. Mining is responsible for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, which are contributing to climate change. And mining also has big social impacts.' Environmentalists have a different answer to the problem of supply: urban mining. 'Urban mining' is a term used to describe the extraction and/or recycling of minerals and other materials from the waste products of renewable energy, such as used solar panels, windmill turbines, and the lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles. It can also encompass greater efforts to repair components so that they don’t enter the waste stream in the first place. The savings in terms of energy can be quite significant. The amount of energy needed to extract minerals and metals from a cell phone, for instance, is a lot less than producing those materials in the first place. In the case of aluminum, for instance, recycling requires 10 to 15 times less energy. The European Union has set a goal of sourcing 25 percent of all critical raw materials for its energy transition from urban mining. 'Urban mining is one of the necessary measures to gradually reduce the extractivism of minerals,' explains Júlia Martí of the Debt Observatory on Globalization (ODG). 'Of course, with current levels of consumption, it won’t solve all the needs we have in terms of minerals. But it could help us advance toward a post-extractivist era.' However, the production of renewable energy products and their consumption also generate waste. Felix Best Agorvor, of 5seconds Connect in Ghana, specializes in the urban mining of e-waste. His country is a good example of extracting as much benefit from e-waste as possible. 'Ghana generated 52,000 tons of e-waste in 2019,' he explains. 'Out of those 52,000 tons of e-waste, only about 5 percent is not processed or recycled.' If the full potential of recycling could be achieved, would it make a significant dent in the demand for critical raw materials and reduce the need for more extraction in the first place? That’s the question that Martín Lallana, the co-author of a study on mineral use in the energy transition in Spain, has tried to answer, for instance with respect to lithium-ion batteries. 'If we are able to recycle these batteries and re-enter them into a circular economy, we would reduce the total demand for the minerals by 34 percent,' he notes. 'In general terms, 67 percent of the total demand for those metals would be recovered through recycling in the optimal scenario.' In a public conversation in mid-September, these four experts discussed extractivism, waste, consumption, and the future of renewable energy. They also looked very specifically at how recycling, combined with other policies, could dramatically reduce the amount of new mineral inputs—and thus new mines—needed for the transition away from fossil fuels. The Downsides of Extraction The modern economy is heavily dependent on materials extracted from the earth. An ordinary smartphone, for instance, contains 60 different elements from the periodic table, many of which have been dug out of the ground. The environmental impacts of the extraction of critical raw materials are extensive. Nearly 24 million people worldwide are affected by the toxic runoff from mines into rivers and floodplains. According to the World Resources Institute, mining was responsible for destroying 1.4 million hectares of trees from 2001 to 2020. Primary mineral and metal production, meanwhile, is responsible for an estimated 10 percent of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. Then there are the social consequences of mining, including human rights violations. 'In the past ten years, there have been more than 600 reports of human rights violations linked to the extraction of minerals for the green transition,' reports Clàudia Bosch of SETEM Catalunya. 'Since 2012, more than 19 environmental defenders have been killed.' Workers in the extractive sector frequently work in unsafe conditions, particularly in the informal or 'artisanal' sector where they don’t wear the proper protection. The impact on women is particularly severe. 'In places with a lot of mining, we see precarious conditions that lead to violence against women,' she continues. 'Women are often in the worst-paid jobs. And exposure to these toxic minerals also have impacts on their reproductive health.' Like diamonds, many metals are extracted in areas of the world consumed by conflict. Perhaps the most famous example is cobalt, with more than 70 percent of the world’s production coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A desire to control that cobalt has fueled conflict there, for instance encouraging intervention by neighboring Rwanda. Tin and tungsten are also fueling conflict in the DRC. 'Mineral extraction is being used to fund these armed conflicts,' Bosch adds. 'Brands like Apple or Alphabet can’t be certain that the minerals in their devices are free of these minerals. Even if they say they’re trying to do their best not to source minerals from mines linked to this type of conflict, in reality everything gets mixed up so that it’s very difficult to be certain that the technology is free of conflict.' The Problem and Promise of Waste In 2022, according to the UN, 62 million tons of e-waste was produced, an increase of 82 percent from a dozen years earlier. That’s enough to fill 1.5 million trucks, each with the capacity to carry 40 tons. Less than one-quarter of all that waste was collected and recycled. In fact, the amount of e-waste is growing five times more than the rate of recycling. When it comes to the class of critical raw materials known as rare earth elements, which are so critical to renewable energy production, only one percent makes its way back from e-waste into the industrial supply chain. Artificial intelligence will only make matters worse by pushing a huge upgrade of electronic devices. AI alone will increase e-waste by anywhere from 3 to 12 percent by 2030. 'Recovering and recycling this e-waste and other forms of waste is a path to explore,' notes Júlia Martí of ODG. 'We know that this won’t be able to meet the current demand, which is growing for these minerals. Before opening new mines, we need to make the most of this urban mining, which has a lower environmental and climate impact.' One of the sources of all this waste is the planned obsolescence of products. Clàudia Bosch distinguishes between two types. 'The industry puts all these barriers into place to force us to buy new electronic devices,' she explains. 'Our devices are programmed to stop working after a certain time, forcing us to download software updates that leave our devices outdated. Or the batteries stop working. And then there are all the barriers to repairing the devices.' The second type is perceived obsolescence. 'There’s the popular belief that anything new is better,' she continues. 'Some people want to buy the latest model of iPhone because it’s better, lighter, smaller, and more ‘fashionable.’' European countries have the highest e-waste per capita, led by Norway with 26.8 kilos per person per year. The UK and Switzerland are also in the top three. Beginning in 2025, the Basel Convention will regulate international shipments of e-waste. 'The Basel Convention tries regulating things so that e-waste isn’t exported to other countries,' reports Bosch. 'But sometimes, there are products sent for repair that are mixed up with devices that cannot be repaired. So they end up in dumps. In Ghana, in Accra, there a huge community of people doing repairs, and the repair rate is very high. But this doesn’t mean it’s okay for the Global North to send its waste to other parts of the world.' There is gold in this e-waste, sometimes literally in the case of the billions of dollars of recovered metals, including gold. Another benefit is the reduction in carbon emissions from replacing those metals. The benefits of just the recoverable materials add up to $91 billion while the costs of treating e-waste in terms of pollution, health consequences, and carbon emissions total $78 billion. In Spain, Bosch reports, 'the average rate of recycling is around 40 percent of what is disposed of adequately. Catalonia is more or less the same. But there’s one figure which makes me especially cross. Some disposed items could be easily repaired and reused, and many of the devices are prematurely recycled. This entails a loss of energy. We have a very low ability to repair things compared to what we could do.' Consequences for People and the Environment The extraction of metals from the ground is certainly hazardous for people and the environment. But the extraction of such materials from e-waste also poses risks. Ghana is a mineral-rich country, with a lot of gold and recently discovered deposits of lithium. Illegal mining, known locally as galamsey, 'is destroying our forests, polluting our soil, and polluting our water bodies,' Felix Best Agorvor of 5seconds Connect reports. 'Children are being born with all manner of deformities and strange health conditions that we’ve never seen in our history before.' Ghana is also a leading importer of mineral- and metal-rich e-waste. Every year, legally and illegally, other countries send 150,000 tons of e-waste to Ghana. 'The conditions under which e-waste is managed is very, very hazardous,' he continues. 'E-waste management in Ghana is a gray area. We have laws on the books, like polluter-pay laws, that are not implemented. Policymakers are now coming to terms with the challenges that e-waste poses for the country, especially the major cities, where it gets into our environment. The acid from the car batteries and the mobile phone batteries pollute our soil. It even gets into our water.' As with the illegal mining, many problems arise from the recycling of e-waste in the informal sector. 'They don’t do the proper segregation of e-waste,' Agorvor adds. 'They burn the waste to get the copper or the gold out of it. They don’t have the modern technology to collect, segregate, and recycle this waste. When they burn it, they flare the smoke into the atmosphere, and we all know what that smoke does to the ozone layer and to climate change.' 'There’s filtration of these pollutants into the land, the air and water, which then enters the food chain, and it can end up affecting the whole community,' observes Clàudia Bosch. 'This impacts health, with respiratory disease, cancer and other diseases.' There’s also a lot of waste in the waste business, especially the informal sector. 'They only take the materials of greater value and discard other less valuable materials,' she adds, nothing that the Global North has been busy exporting these problems to the Global South, perpetuating inequalities. Those problems show up in particular among workers in the e-waste recycling sector in the Global South. The rates of accidents even in formal workplaces is high. It’s worse in the informal sector. 'Some of these workers collect these things with the bare hands, they burn them or they inhale the smoke,' Agorvor reports. 'The burning of the acid from the batteries gives them skin cancers and all manner of lung diseases. People who engage in this e waste collection in Ghana must be properly trained. If we properly tackle this sector, it can generate about one million jobs to employ our youth.' Clàudia Bosch agrees. 'People working in the informal sector do this with no protection equipment, and they’re exposed to hazardous substances such as lead and mercury,' she notes. 'Women have a low employment rate in formal waste recycling, but they have a high level of participation in informal waste management. This e-waste management has impacts on their reproductive health.' Also notable is the high rate of accidents in the workplace for those involved in the e-waste recycling sector. On the Consumption Side An energy transition that just focuses on production addresses only half the equation. Switching to electricity generation from renewable sources—and away from fossil fuels—is necessary, but not sufficient. 'If we want to keep this current level of consumption, just changing these sources of energy to new alternative energy sources will require new minerals, which are also finite resources and distributed very unequally around our planet,' observes Martín Lallana. 'The extraction of these minerals is having huge impacts on the environment and also in terms of human rights. We face a new logic of green extractivism. The extraction of fossil fuels is still continuing. But we’re seeing a shift of extractivism toward other minerals needed for the green transition. And the consequences are just as dangerous as the ones we’ve seen with classic extractivism.' The bottom line is that there would be less of a demand for those minerals and less of a huge e-waste problem if people didn’t keep throwing out their devices or if those devices were built to last longer. At SETEM, the Catalonian NGO, 'we’ve been working on raising awareness about consuming,' Clàudia Bosch says. 'This starts off by rejecting aggressive marketing campaigns that entice us to consume in a compulsive way. We promote a reduction of consumption: to repair, to renovate, to give a new use to things that are still functioning, to allow the recycling industry to recover these raw materials. We’re promoting more sustainable use of materials, to make them last longer.' This campaign around consumption, she adds, takes place within a degrowth framework. 'This is where we need to be heading at all levels, to an understanding that happiness is not only met through material means, that there are many other needs that are more important for our happiness,' she explains. 'Things that are not really necessary, that are not contributing to the common good, should not be produced anymore, or not be produced in such large quantities.' The Challenges of Recycling There are costs and benefits to the recycling of electronic wastes. Done properly, the process can minimize the impact on workers, the environment, and communities and reduce the dependency on new extractivism. Done properly, the process can provide employment, reduce north-south inequities, and even help change attitudes toward consumption more generally. But how much can recycling help in the transition away from fossil fuels? Martín Lallana and his team set out to answer that question more precisely. 'Based on Spain’s 2050 decarbonization plans, we wanted to come up with estimates of how much of this demand could be met through recycling raw materials, and which part of the demand had to be met through primary extraction,' he explains. 'We tried, with the circular economy alternative, to show how we could increase the recycling rate, meet more demand through recycling, and also reduce demand in absolute terms.' 'We started off using official policy documents, looking at the estimates of the number of electric vehicles for 2030 and the amount of wind energy to be installed by 2050,' he continues. 'We then compared these estimates with the type of technologies that will be used: the type of batteries. the type of solar panels. To avoid being too pessimistic, we included trends in terms of technology improvements. Solar panels, for instance, used to carry a huge amount of silver but that’s been reduced over the last 20 years. They came up with three scenarios based on the mineral requirements for Spain’s transition. In the first scenario, they assumed the optimal rates of recycling established by the government. In the second scenario, those optimal rates weren’t achieved. 'And in the third scenario,' he notes, 'we go ahead with the energy transition as set out in policy documents but we accelerate recycling and reach optimal levels in 2030 instead of 2050. We lengthen the useful life of technology.' In this scenario, they imagined that they could extend the lifespan of solar panels from 20 years to 30. They reversed the trend toward larger batteries and EVs and charted an alternative mobility strategy. 'Instead of transitioning from combustion engine vehicles to EVs, we reduced the fleet from 25 million today to 9 million,' he explains. 'This entailed a different model of mobility, which would go hand in hand with a drastic increase in public transport, multiplying by three the number of electric buses.' They determined that, if recycling rates are not improved, 'primary extraction would be 40 percent higher.' Along these lines, greater recycling rates, for example, could reduce the demand for lithium—particularly in the 2030s when there is more lithium available to recycle. By 2040, such recycling could meet around 50 percent of the demands for different metals. 'From 2040 to 2050, much more technology reaching the end of its useful life will be entering the market, and we can recover these raw materials.' They also determined that, in the first two scenarios, the bulk of the raw materials would be earmarked for the transportation sector rather than, say, solar or wind energy production. 'It would be mainly private electric cars,' he reports. 'So, we’ll be looking at minerals like lithium, cobalt, tin, and manganese. More than half of the demand for aluminum and copper would come from this e-mobility.' The key minerals needed for e-mobility—cobalt, lithium, nickel—'are the ones that shoot over the equitable global reserve distribution. If all of these circular economy measures were implemented, we could almost avoid overshoot.' In all, under the more ambitious recycling targets, 'we would be able to cover up to half of the demand for the different metals by 2050,' he adds. 'This is a big if. If we have ambitious systems for recovery and recycling, and if we add measures for circular economy and sufficiency that would transform the mobility system, then we would be able to reduce half of the metals that would have to be extracted from the ground.' Demand would be most efficiently reduced by a shift from private cars to public transportation. But, Llalana cautions, 'energy transition isn’t where the greatest demand lies. There’s a greater demand in certain manufacturing sectors, construction and other areas.' In the end, more ambitious e-waste recycling programs are absolutely necessary. But they are also absolutely insufficient given the current scale of primary extraction and all the ills associated with it. Urban mining needs to be combined with a reduction in overall demand and a standardization of clean energy components to reduce the energy required to extract and recycle the minerals they contain. Urban mining is not a quick fix that can substitute for a more systemic transformation.

Buddhist Cossacks Appear To Be Making A Comeback In Buryatia, Wit...	Many in Moscow and the West assume to this day that all Cossacks are Russian Orthodox in religion and Russian-speaking as far as language is conerned, but in fact, many have been and some remain followers of Islam, Judaism and Buddhism and speak other languages (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2015/10/not-all-of-russias-cossacks-are.html). In trying to mobilize the Cossacks for its own purposes, the Putin regime has sometimes tried to wipe out these attachments and at other times has made concessions to them because most Cossacks regardless of faith and language are quite prepared to fight for Russia against enemies foreign and domestic. Moscow has been relatively tolerant of Buddhist Cossacks in Kalmykia, a republic that adjoins the North Caucasus (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2021/09/kalmyk-cossack-leaders-must-now-receive.html); but it has been less so to Buddhist Cossacks in Buryatia in the Russian Far East. Now that may be about to change, as Moscow needs more soldiers for its war in Ukraine, the Russian authorities appear to be ready to look to those who are ready to serve regardless of their religion and even language. That is giving both 'registered' Cossacks who are part of Putin’s regime and genuine, unregistered ones a chance. Not surprisingly, reporting about this is scarce. But the Buryat government is proudly reporting that its Cossack community has been named the second best among those regions with a smaller number of Cossacks relative to population (egov-buryatia.ru/press_center/news/detail.php?ID=185817 and asiarussia.ru/news/43680/). Ulan Ude reports that there are now 21 Cossack stanitsas in the republic, 14 of which are part of the Transbaikal Cossack host that is recognized by and supported by Moscow and seven of which are not part of that body and presumably more traditional and likely, in this case, more Buddhist. Significantly, Buryat officials say they are supporting both, an indication that Moscow’s manpower demands related to Putin’s war in Ukraine are giving Cossacks less affected by the center’s procrustean approach to the Cossack tradition. And what that means is this: in the short term, Moscow benefits; but in the longer term, it may find itself the loser.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgPEKlDDg-hCUZlNZE-2vR	2024-12-04T17:34:01-08:00	
NATO Foreign Ministers Chart Way Forward In Addressing Russian Sa...	NATO Foreign Ministers wrapped up two days of meetings in Brussels on Wednesday (December 4) addressing Russia’s escalating campaign of hostile actions in NATO countries. At their meeting on Wednesday, Allies considered a set of measures to counter Russia’s actions against NATO and individual Allies. Secretary General Mark Rutte said that 'both Russia and China have tried to destabilise our countries and divide our societies with acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, and energy blackmail'. Rutte noted that Ministers agreed a set of measures to counter Russia’s hostile and cyber activities, including enhanced intelligence exchange, more exercises, better protection of critical infrastructure, improved cyber defence, and tougher action against Russia’s 'shadow fleet' of oil exporting ships. He further stressed that NATO 'will work closely together with the EU on these issues'. Rutte underscored that the increasing alignment of Russia, China, North Korea and Iran highlights the global nature of the threats we face, including the escalating dangers of the ongoing war in Ukraine. He noted that in return for troops and weapons, Russia is providing North Korea with support for its missile and nuclear programmes. 'These developments could destabilise the Korean Peninsula and even threaten the United States. So Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine threatens us all', he said. During the two-day meeting NATO Allies also met with His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan to discuss the situation in the Middle East and the importance of NATO cooperating even more closely with its partners in the region. The Secretary General thanked the King of Jordan for his personal leadership and support to the Alliance and noted that NATO will open a Liaison Office in Amman soon to further deepen these ties. NATO Ministers also met with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and with Kaja Kallas, the new EU High Representative, in the NATO-Ukraine Council. They discussed Ukraine’s most urgent needs, as well as what more Allies can do to provide critical ammunition and air defences, as Russia steps up its attacks and expands the war with the aid of North Korean troops and weapons. Rutte noted that continued support for Ukraine is a priority, ensuring that, when the time comes, Ukraine can negotiate peace from a position of strength. He further highlighted how NATO is delivering on its commitments, including through a financial pledge and the new command in Wiesbaden, NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine. The Secretary General stressed that 'we must do more than just keep Ukraine in the fight. We must provide enough support to change the trajectory of this conflict once and for all'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGs9wX54-SOUy0Y_-Ca0MU	2024-12-04T09:19:29-08:00	
Saudi Arabia: ‘Giga-Projects’ Built On Widespread Labor Abuses, S...	Migrant workers in Saudi Arabia are facing widespread abuses across employment sectors and geographic regions, including at high-profile giga-projects funded by or linked to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Wednesday. FIFA, the international football organization, is set to confirm Saudi Arabia as host of the 2034 Men’s World Cup on December 11, without requiring proper human rights due diligence and binding commitments to prevent labor and other abuses, according to HRW. The 79-page report, '‘Die First, and I’ll Pay You Later’: Saudi Arabia’s ‘Giga-Projects’ Built on Widespread Labor Abuses,' documents widespread abuses against migrant workers, some of which may amount to situations of forced labor, including exorbitant recruitment fees, rampant wage theft, inadequate protections from extreme heat, restrictions on transferring jobs, and uninvestigated worker deaths. Saudi authorities have systematically failed to prevent or remedy these abuses, including at high-profile projects financed by its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF). 'The human engine powering the construction of Saudi Arabia’s multibillion dollar giga-projects is the migrant workforce, who are facing widespread rights violations in Saudi Arabia without any recourse,' said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. 'FIFA’s fake evaluation processto award the 2034 World Cup without legally binding human rights commitments will come at an unimaginable human cost, including adverse intergenerational impacts on migrant workers and their families.' The report is based on interviews with more than 155 former and current migrant workers and families of deceased workers across employment sectors and regions. Migrant workers in Saudi Arabia face widespread labor abuses at every point in the migration cycle, Human Rights Watch found. The abuses start from the time companies recruit workers and illegally force them to pay exorbitant recruitment fees and continue with employers in Saudi Arabia violating their employment contracts by failing to honor the terms of employment and benefits stipulated in the contract. 'I was paid on time for the first two months, but never thereafter,' one migrant worker said. 'When I asked my manager for payment, he would answer: ‘Die first, and I’ll pay you later.’' Despite Saudi Arabia’s 2021 Labor Reform Initiative that claimed to make it easier for migrant workers to transfer to a different employer and leave the country freely, migrant workers continue to face barriers to mobility that abusive employers often exploit. 'I was told to take the exit permit, leave the country, and remigrate to another company,' one worker said. 'They [the employer] said: ‘If we let you transfer sponsorship, we will have to let others do so as well.’' Other employers forced workers to sign an agreement to pay their employer if they moved to a new job. Workers who did manage to change jobs also were forced to pay their former employers. One worker employed at a NEOM project—a PIF-funded giga-project that is being built in the northwest of Saudi Arabia—said he paid his previous employer more than 12,000 riyals (about US$3,200) to change jobs. Many migrant workers also often lack the awareness and technical know-how necessary to navigate online employment contract management services. They struggle to understand their rights under the nuances of Saudi Arabia’s labor laws and cannot access support via Saudi authorities or their origin countries’ embassies. The giga-projects often impose unrealistic, tight deadlines for projects, which translates to additional pressure on workers. Many workers are also isolated from support networks such as embassies or well-established migrant diaspora groups. One NEOM-based worker said: 'We are in the middle of nowhere. Embassies are very far away. If something goes wrong, there is nowhere we can go. There is also fear. Where do we go? Who do we tell?' The number of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia, 13.4 million, is expected to increase significantly, with planned mega- and giga-projects that will require massive new construction. Employers also expose workers to serious dangers at job sites, including abuses linked to extreme heat for outdoor workers that are likely to increase as climate change accelerates. A worker employed at a NEOM project said: 'Every day, one or two workers faint, including during mornings and evenings. Sometimes on the way to work. Sometimes while working.' Abuses linked to extreme heat can cause lasting and potentially lethal health harms to migrant workers, including organ failure. According to government data obtained by Human Rights Watch, 884 Bangladeshis died in Saudi Arabia between January 2024 and July 2024, of which 80 percent of the deaths were attributed to 'natural causes.' Many migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia are unexplained, uninvestigated, and uncompensated, leaving families of deceased migrant workers without financial support. The wife of a deceased Indian plumber told Human Rights Watch: 'He did not have any health issues. We do not believe that he died of natural death as is mentioned in the death certificate. The death was not investigated properly.' She added: 'He used to send approximately $536 [KA1] every month to cover family expenses, education, and outstanding loans. After his death, we are in a state of destitution.' Human Rights Watch also spoke to seven former migrant workers who had previously worked in Saudi Arabia who are now dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease. The wife of one patient told Human Rights Watch that her husband’s dialysis was covered by the Nepali government, but she was unable to afford medicine or pay for their children’s school fees in the last six months. She said: 'The [Saudi] company did not provide any assistance beyond booking his [return] ticket.' While Saudi authorities have the primary obligation to protect human rights, including labor rights, businesses also have internationally recognized responsibilities to respect human rights and avoid complicity in abuses. The pervasive enforcement gaps in Saudi laws intended to protect migrant workers require urgent attention. However, as this report documents, while noncompliance needs to be addressed, compliance alone is also not sufficient in Saudi Arabia’s context, where many laws themselves fail by design to meet international norms and the country’s obligations under international human rights instruments, Human Rights Watch said. Saudi Arabia’s 2034 Men’s World Cup bid submitted to FIFA failed to adequately report and address rights abuses prevalent in the country and to offer any concrete assurances that the abuses will be addressed, despite the massive construction required, including 11 new and four refurbished stadiums; more than 185,000 new hotel rooms; and significant airport, road, rail, and bus network expansion. FIFA has engineered the World Cup hosting process to ignore the blatant human rights risks, including a forced labor complaint against Saudi Arabia filed by the global trade union Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI) at the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2024. Human Rights Watch wrote to FIFA on November 4, 2024, sharing findings and documentation of widespread and serious labor rights abuses linked to mega- and giga-projects in Saudi Arabia. FIFA has not responded. 'Saudi authorities, who are spending billions to launder their abominable human rights reputation, would be better served by effectively implementing labor reforms they’ve promised but so far failed to deliver on,' Page said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeGs9wX54-SOdHO0TwJO-yn	2024-12-04T09:17:16-08:00	
Pentagon Confirms Centcom Destroyed Weapons Systems In Syria	By Matthew Olay U.S. Central Command on Tuesday successfully engaged and destroyed several weapon systems that posed a threat to U.S. and coalition forces in Syria, the Defense Department announced. The weapons destroyed — which included three truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers, a T-64 tank and multiple mortars — presented a 'clear and imminent threat' to U.S. and coalition forces in the vicinity of eastern Syria's Mission Support Site Euphrates, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told the media. 'The self-defense strike occurred after the mobile multiple rocket launchers fired rockets that landed in the vicinity of MSS Euphrates, and mortars were fired toward U.S. forces,' Ryder said. He added that, while DOD is still assessing who was operating the weapons, Iranian-backed militia groups are operating in the region that have attacked MSS Euphrates in the past. Tuesday's incident was the second time in less than a week that Centcom forces were used to neutralize a hostile threat in the region. On Nov. 29, Centcom employed A-10 fighter aircraft to successfully engage a hostile target that imposed a threat to U.S. and coalition forces at MSS Euphrates. 'Individuals were observed preparing a rocket rail,' Ryder said of the threat. 'These self-defense actions likewise eliminated threats to our personnel at MSS Euphrates,' he added. When questioned as to whether either of the past week's engagements was indicative of Centcom working with the Syrian Democratic Forces as part of the greater civil war going on throughout the region, Ryder repeatedly made clear that U.S. forces in the region are primarily focused on protecting their own personnel and partnering with the SDF to counter ISIS. 'To be clear, these self-defense actions successfully eliminated imminent threats to U.S. personnel and were not linked to any broader activities in northwest Syria by other groups,' Ryder said. 'Our focus is on protecting our forces and also preserving our efforts to conduct counter-ISIS operations in partnership with the SDF,' he added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf41W35neU5tJZu6DvfQeav	2024-12-04T09:15:44-08:00	
Robert Reich: Pardon Me – OpEd	My first reaction to the Sunday news that President Biden was pardoning his son Hunter was sadness. Biden has a constitutional right to pardon his son, and I can understand his concern that Trump’s overt aim to use the Justice Department and FBI to pursue 'retribution' against political enemies might subject Hunter to further charges and harassment. House Republicans have claimed Hunter is guilty of more than the felonies he was charged with: lying on a firearms application form about his drug addiction and failing to pay taxes that he later did pay. My sadness comes from President Biden’s suggestion that the charges against his son were influenced by Republican politicians. 'It is clear that Hunter was treated differently,' he wrote. 'The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.' Biden continued: 'There has been an effort to break Hunter — who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.' I can understand President Biden’s frustration, but his claim that Republican politicians were responsible for Hunter’s legal problems lends credence to Trump’s long-term claim that the justice system was 'weaponized' against him and that he was the victim of selective prosecution, as Biden says his son was. Biden’s claim also makes it more difficult for Democrats to stand against Trump’s plans to use the Justice Department for political purposes as Trump seeks to install as director of the FBI the cringeworthy sycophant Kash Patel, who has vowed to 'come after' Trump’s enemies. Of course, we know that the prosecution of Hunter Biden was completely different from the prosecutions of Trump. Many legal experts agree with President Biden’s contention that his son’s offenses wouldn’t normally have resulted in felony charges. Trump, on the other hand, was charged with near treasonous actions — illegally seeking to overturn the results of an election he lost in order to hold on to power, and endangering national security and trying to obstruct justice by taking classified documents when he left office and refusing to return them. These cases are being dropped because of his election. But in suggesting that the charges against his son were politically motivated, President Biden has handed Trump something of a Trump card for arguing that of course the Justice Department is used for political ends, so watch me do the same. Biden’s pardon also makes it more difficult for Democrats to criticize Trump for his use of the pardoning power to immunize friends and allies, at least one of whom he’s now appointing to an important diplomatic role. Almost immediately after the news broke of President Biden’s pardon for Hunter, Trump used it to justify his planned pardon of the January 6 rioters. 'Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?' he wrote on social media. 'Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!' Among the people Trump pardoned in his final weeks in office was Charles Kushner, the father of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who spent two years in prison on tax evasion and other charges. Over the weekend, Trump announced he would nominate the pardoned Kushner to be ambassador to France. ** There’s a larger issue here. The pardoning power was never supposed to be a means for presidents to put themselves, their families, members of their administration, and campaign staff above the law. Yet that’s precisely what it has become. Bill Clinton pardoned his brother, Roger, on old drug charges. George H.W. Bush pardoned former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and others in his administration on charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair. As the framers of the Constitution saw it, the pardoning power was supposed to be a safety valve against injustice. The origins of the power in the United States Constitution are found in the 'prerogative of mercy' that originally appeared during the reign of King Ine of Wessex in the seventh century. George Washington first exercised the power in 1795, granting amnesty to those engaged in Pennsylvania’s Whiskey Rebellion. Thomas Jefferson granted amnesty to any citizen convicted of a crime under the Alien and Sedition Acts. Lincoln used clemency to encourage desertions from the Confederate Army. In 1868, President Andrew Jackson pardoned Jefferson Davis, the former president of the Confederacy. In another act of mercy, President Warren G. Harding commuted the sentences of 24 political prisoners, including socialist leader Eugene Debs. But in what was clearly a political use of the pardon rather than a use for humanitarian reasons, Nixon commuted the sentence of James Hoffa, former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and a Nixon ally who was convicted for pension fund fraud and jury tampering. Gerald Ford’s 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon was arguably the most famous exercise of executive clemency in American history. Ford explained that he granted the pardon as an act of mercy to Nixon and for the broader purpose of restoring domestic tranquility in the nation after Watergate. We need a constitutional amendment to prevent the continuing misuse of the pardoning power. Representative Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Tennessee’s 9th District, has repeatedly introduced just such an amendment, which would prohibit a self-pardon and pardons of family members, administration officials, and campaign employees. It would also bar the president from issuing pardons to those whose crimes were committed to further a direct and significant personal interest of the president or others close to him or her, and those whose crimes were committed at the direction of, or in coordination with, the president. Cohen’s proposed amendment deserves widespread support. What do you think?

Brazil’s Supreme Court Sentences 310 For January 8 Coup Acts	By Andre Richter The Federal Supreme Court has convicted 310 individuals for their involvement in the January 8, 2023, coup acts. The Attorney General's Office, responsible for filing the charges, released the figure on Tuesday (Nov. 3). According to the prosecutor's office, nearly two years after the events, 229 individuals have been convicted as direct participants and 81 as instigators of the coup acts. The sentences for the perpetrators range from 15 to 17 years in prison for crimes including armed criminal association, aggravated damage, destruction of protected heritage, violent disruption of the democratic rule of law, and attempted coup d'état. For those accused of inciting the acts, the sentences are one year in prison but have been commuted to community service and mandatory participation in a democracy education course. The convicted individuals will also have their passports confiscated, firearm licenses revoked, and are required to pay a collective moral damages penalty of BRL 5 million, jointly and severally. According to the Attorney General's Office, 500 defendants have entered into non-prosecution agreements, resulting in the closure of their cases. The agreement allows defendants who were not directly involved in the acts of vandalism against Congress, the Planalto presidential palace, and the Supreme Court to admit their crimes in exchange for alternative penalties to imprisonment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLrQPDc48U0-THqhU8ytQd	2024-12-04T09:11:56-08:00	
Jewish And Muslim Children Besieged By Christmas Selling Season –...	Jewish and Muslim children, from an early age, have become increasingly immersed in the national and religious culture of the Christian world around them. The natural tendency of most children to desire to 'fit in'; leads many Jewish and Muslim children to want to copy non-traditional ways in general, and popular Christmas party practices in particular. Each year December becomes the month when many non-Christian children feel left out if they do not participate in Christmas school celebrations; or they have mixed conflicting emotions if they do participate. Over the last three or four generations, Hanukah has increasingly become an important holiday for Jewish families during the heavily commercialized Christmas selling season; because there is lots of pressure from well meaning Christians to get everyone, including Jews and Muslims, to join in all sorts of Christmas cultural and religious activities. In previous generations, the ancestors of most of these children went to Islamic or Jewish schools, lived in Jewish or Muslim neighborhoods, and had very little contact with Christian children. This all changed in the 20th century, especially after WW2, when the commercialization of Christmas, and the Christmas selling season, became universal and ubiquitous. This excessive commercialization of Christmas now threatens Christian children themselves by offering a crass materialistic and superficial experience of what should be a wonder-filled spiritual celebration. Fortunately, the post Biblical previously minor eight day Jewish Holiday of Hanukah occurs during December. Hanukah, with its celebration of the value of standing up and fighting (jihad) for your right to be a nonconformist who is different from the majority, and your freedom to celebrate your own religious laws and traditions, became an important event in the education of Jewish children to be proud of their own religious heritage. It can serve Muslims and even religious Christians as well. In the two thousand years from Jesus in the first century to Jews in the twenty-first century Hanukah, the Festival of Lights, has been the celebration of the victory of a religious minority over an oppressive government. Jerusalem then and now was ablaze in light, as each Jewish family burned oil lamps then and candles now at the doors and windows of their houses. Today Jews still celebrate this festival with a nine candlestick menorah—one for each of the eight days that the pure olive oil did not burn out, and the elevated candlestick called the 'servant candle' which is used to light each of the eight others. As the one and only God's prophet Isaiah (42:1) stated: 'My servant shall bring light to the Gentiles.' When Jews kindle the Hanukah candles (this year (2024) from the evening of December 25 to January 2ed. 2025) they will be celebrating two kinds of dedication. Hanukah (Hebrew for Dedication) celebrates the joyful rededication of the ancient Temple in Jerusalem after it was profaned in 168 BCE by an idol installed in it by the Syrian Greek king Antiochus IV (who named himself: 'Manifest God'). In addition, recent attempts to outlaw circumcision in California, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and other places, by people who think it is a barbaric custom, follow the path of the Syrian Greek king Antiochus IV, whose decree outlawing circumcision was the final outrage that led to the revolt of the Maccabees. All of this can be easily understood by religious people in general; and in particular by first, second and third generation Muslim families living as a small minority in the West, whose ancestors grew up in Muslim majority countries, and never had children facing these kinds of pressures. In 169 BCE the Greek rulers of the Syrian Empire, decided to prohibit Jews from circumcising their sons, as part of a government program to make Jews conform to Greek standards of civilized behavior. Greek pressure on Jews to 'fit in' culturally had some limited success with many wealthy Jews and with some of the upper levels of the government appointed leaders of the priesthood in Jerusalem. Then the Greek King ordered that a statue of himself be placed in the courtyard of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. That led to a revolt which broke out in 168 BCE in the small village of Modin, led by a man called Judah the Maccabee (hammerer), and his four brothers. With trust in God, the five Maccabee brothers (four of who were killed in battle over the next two decades) defeated the much larger Syrian Greek armies, recaptured Jerusalem and rededicated (Hanukah) the desecrated Jerusalem Temple in an eight day festival. Judah Maccabee ordered the Temple to be purified, and a new altar built in place of the one that had been polluted by pig's blood. According to the Torah (Leviticus 24:2), pure olive oil was needed for the two menorahs in the Temple, which were required to burn day and night throughout the year. However, there was only enough unpolluted oil found to burn for one day, and it would take a week to prepare a fresh supply of ritually pure oil for the menorah. Some said: Delay the Hanukah of the Temple for a week. Others said: Kindle the Temple Menorah now, and trust that it will last until new pure oil can be made. The menorah was lit; and it did not go out prior to the arrival of the new oil. An eight-day festival was declared to commemorate this miracle. Thus the Hanukah story is about two kinds of battle; the physical struggle against others (political and sometimes military); and the spiritual struggle within ourselves to trust in God, and never yield to despair; or abandon hope for the future (kindling the oil). Hanukah- the Festival of Freedom celebrating the religious duty to say 'NO' to the unjust demands of a dictatorial government, is still celebrated to this day in Jewish homes by reciting blessings, lighting candles, singing songs and retelling the ancient story with its modern lessons. The oppression of Judaism by Antiochus IV, the Syrian Greek king, was the first known attempt at suppressing a minority religion, but unfortunately not the last. Other well known attempts were the three century long Roman persecution of Christianity, and the persecution of Muhammad and his followers by the majority of pagan Arabs in Makkah. All three religions emerged from their varying periods of persecution stronger than ever. And this is the ongoing spiritual lesson of the Hanukah lights. Once lit by faithful believers, filled with hope and trust in God; its flames last longer than anyone else thinks possible. Indeed, the light of the Hanukah flames has long outlasted the powerful oppressors themselves.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLrQPDc48U0z46oU3y27m3	2024-12-04T09:08:37-08:00	
The Sephardic Jews And The Contribution Of A Language To Business...	A friend of mine, who spends summers on the Princes' Islands, is a descendant of Sephardic Jews who fled the Spanish Inquisition in 1492 and settled in the Ottoman Empire. He studied at Galatasaray High School, received a degree from Istanbul University's Faculty of Business Administration, and now successfully runs a medium-sized enterprise. At home, he speaks Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) with his family, while also being fluent in Turkish, French, and English. One day, a high school friend who works in the same industry approached him with a proposal: 'I'll cover the travel expenses; let's go to Spain. Help me with business negotiations, and you'll benefit too.' Though he had never been to Spain before, my friend accepted the offer. Ladino's Surprise After arriving in Spain, they began partnership discussions the next day. During the meetings, which were conducted in French and English, my friend noticed the Spaniards conversing among themselves. To his astonishment, the language they were speaking was none other than Ladino, the same language he grew up speaking with his family. At dinner that evening, he mustered the courage to address his Spanish counterparts in their language. The Spaniards were surprised by his choice of words—terms that appeared in Cervantes' Don Quixote and other classic literature but were no longer used in modern Spanish. This unexpected linguistic connection eased the tense and formal atmosphere of the meetings, fostering better communication and ultimately facilitating an agreement. Citizenship and Language Advantage In recent years, Spain has granted citizenship to descendants of Sephardic Jews who fled during the Inquisition. Many Turkish Sephardic Jewish businesspeople have benefited from this law, gaining dual citizenship by proving their ancestry through synagogue records. They also acquired the right to move freely within the European Union. The language requirement for citizenship was easily met thanks to their fluency in Judeo-Spanish. The Examples of Yiddish and Azerbaijani Turkish This story highlights the importance of historical linguistic ties. In Central Europe, Ashkenazi Jews speak Yiddish, a language closely related to medieval German. Hearing Yiddish in conversation often feels like listening to German from centuries ago. Similarly, Azerbaijani Turkish closely resembles the Ottoman Turkish of old and the language of classical divan literature. Following Turkey's language reform, which significantly simplified Turkish, Azerbaijani Turkish now evokes the style of Ottoman-era writers. I recall a similar feeling when listening to an elderly Armenian woman in Istanbul whose speech skillfully incorporated old Ottoman literary expressions. The Importance of Cultural Heritage This story demonstrates that language is not just a tool for communication but also a powerful vehicle for preserving cultural heritage and fostering connections in business. Languages like Judeo-Spanish, passed down through generations, not only keep our ties to the past alive but also open doors to new opportunities. Languages and cultures are vital components of a society's identity. Preserving them is essential for maintaining the richness of human history and the diversity of our world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe1dG1dhyb_WfhBwoJEp7KJ	2024-12-04T09:07:00-08:00	
The New European Military Path: Strategic ‘Emancipation’ From The...	The future of the EU will depend largely on how it responds to internal and external challenges. In this context, the two Albanian republics together — political Albania and the Republic of Kosovo — must focus on survival in the anarchic system of international relations. In the regular hearing, yesterday in the European Parliament, before the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs and Industry, Research and Energy, the EU Commissioner for Defence and Space, Andrius Kubilius, stated that the European Union is facing numerous existential threats, recalling as a fact conventional warfare, hybrid attacks and the militarization of space, Euronews reports. See for this he called for the provision of 10 billion euros by 2028 to strengthen European defense. He also stressed that 700 billion euros were needed for the development of infrastructure and an EU air defence shield.[1] Highlighting insufficient investment in the defence sector and the fragmented European market for military equipment, he warned that strategic rivals such as China and Russia were overtaking the bloc in defence spending. In this context, Kubilius called on European lawmakers to support efforts to create a genuine European Defence Union. 1. The EU Common Arms Market The Common Arms Market in the European Union is an initiative that aims to strengthen the defence capabilities of the member states and increase the strategic autonomy of the EU. In recent years, especially after various geopolitical crises, the EU has pursued policies of deeper cooperation in the field of defence, which include better coordination of the production, acquisition and use of armaments. The Common Arms Market in the European Union is an initiative that aims to strengthen the defence capabilities of the member states and increase the strategic autonomy of the EU. In recent years, especially after various geopolitical crises, the EU has pursued policies of deeper cooperation in the field of defence, which include better coordination of the production, acquisition and use of armaments. Pooling resources and harmonising technical standards for weapons and military equipment can reduce costs for member states and eliminate duplication of effort. The goal is to create a more competitive and independent arms and military technology manufacturing sector, reducing dependence on the US and other suppliers outside the EU.[2] On July 29, the RAND Corporation, a Pentagon-funded think tank, released a comprehensive assessment of the state of the US military and Washington’s National Defense Strategy (NDS) to 2022, prepared by a panel of 'non-governmental national security experts' established by Congress. The RAND report is a critical, relentless, and bleak analysis of the US military apparatus, concluding that the US is 'not at all prepared' for serious competition with major global adversaries and is 'vulnerable or even comparable' in almost every modern sphere of warfare.[3] In these circumstances, when Donald Trump is expected to arrive in the White House in January, we will witness an unusual phase of the late period of the American empire, comparable to the last years of the Soviet Union, in which military analysts with clear insight admit that Washington's hegemony is rapidly weakening on the global stage, which is also expected to pave the way for the 'officialization' of the New World Order. European experts in the field, see for example, have advocated for the harmonization of military equipment, since only in this way can the armies of different countries act more easily together in case of need, increasing the operational effectiveness of joint forces. Through these policies, the EU aims to improve collective security by better preparing itself for global challenges and threats in the region. Steps that have been taken:• Harmonization of Standards and creation of common certification mechanisms for military equipment. • European Defence Budget, partly financed by the EU, to support joint development and production projects. • Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) initiatives, which include various joint projects for the development of defence capabilities. The return of Donald Trump to the US presidency could have a major impact on the foreign policy and security of the European Union. Trump has often criticized European allies for their low contributions to NATO and has pushed for more independence for Europe in the field of defence. Thus, his return could push the EU towards accelerating a common defence policy and towards the creation of a more independent defence structure. During his first term, Trump had a more pragmatic and sometimes withdrawn approach towards transatlantic allies, favouring the policy he had also promoted during the 'America First' campaign. This has prompted some European leaders to seek strategic 'emancipation' from the US, to avoid being entirely dependent on American support. As a result, the EU is encouraged to develop its own defense capabilities to counter external threats, especially given the tense situation with Russia and the instability of the Middle East region. '[The Russians] can produce [within] six months everything that Germany has in stock,' he said at the start of a three-hour question from MEPs, adding: 'This should be a warning signal to all of us,'[4] Politico reports. The EU, without competing with NATO, should help develop the capabilities and resources needed to implement NATO’s military deterrence and defense plans, he said. Stressing the need to 'spend more, spend better, spend together as a European community' on defence, Kubilius said that 'we must achieve a true single market for defence'. Doing so seems at first glance an ambitious undertaking. Plans for an air defence system worth more than €500 billion would have to be negotiated within the EU in all member state capitals, who would have to say how much they were prepared to commit to such an effort. There is also a plan for a ground defence network across the bloc’s eastern flank that would require billions in further investment. But the ambitious plan does not end there. Kubilius estimated that around €200 billion would be needed over the next decade for improvements to allow tanks and troops to move easily across the EU on roads and railways. 2. Europe’s ‘space revolution’ The 'space revolution' in Europe involves major projects and developments that are changing the way space technologies are used and understood. The European Union (EU) has invested significantly in this area to improve Europe’s security, economy, and technological sustainability. Here are some of the key EU projects that could be markers of Europe’s 'space revolution': 2. 1 Galileo Galileo is the European satellite navigation system, an alternative to the US’s GPS and Russia’s GLONASS. The system provides precise positioning and timing for civilian users worldwide and increases the security of communications for critical applications such as traffic monitoring and emergency operations. Galileo is Europe's Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and has been operational since December 2016. It provides accurate and reliable positioning and timing information, which is used in devices such as smartphones, but also in other applications and sectors of the economy such as railways, aviation, agriculture, maritime and more. Galileo consists of 24 satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 23,000 km. Galileo's signals are broadcast freely to anyone with a device capable of receiving its signals (e.g. smartphone). Galileo is three times more accurate than GPS, offering 1 meter accuracy and a wide range of services.[5] 2. 2 Copernicus The Copernicus programme includes satellites and other technologies for monitoring the Earth, providing data on climate, environment, marine, agriculture and natural resource management. Copernicus is the Earth observation component of the European Union's Space Programme, looking at our planet and its environment in the interests of all European citizens. It provides information services drawing on satellite Earth observation and in-situ (non-space) data. The European Commission manages the Programme. It is implemented in partnership with the Member States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), EU Agencies and Mercator Océan, the European Environment Agency (EEA), the Joint Research Centre (JRC).[6] This technological advancement also has a significant impact on the political future of the European Union (EU), especially now that Brussels is facing its own challenges, but also new opportunities, driven by a mix of internal tensions, geopolitical changes and changing priorities. Some key aspects of the EU’s future prospects include: • Strengthening integration and institutional reforms Deeper cooperation: To remain globally competitive and overcome internal challenges, the EU may increasingly rely on deeper integration. This could include greater alignment in areas such as taxation, social policy and defence. Majority decision-making: A central point of contention is whether the EU should move to majority decision-making in foreign policy and other sensitive areas in order to speed up decision-making processes. Institutional reforms: There are discussions about reforming the EU institutions to adapt them to a larger and more diverse union. One could imagine a stronger role for the European Parliament and a more efficient administration.• European autonomy and strategic sovereignty Why is this sovereignty increasingly important, especially now that geopolitical realignments are on the horizon? Discussions about the concept of European strategic autonomy are not new, and even less so in this period when the possibility of Donald Trump’s return to power was being discussed. Its authors and interpreters have already provided exhaustive explanations of what exactly is meant by this concept and how it can help Europeans take their fate into their own hands in an increasingly harsh world. Some believe that strategic autonomy is a concept that should be strengthened to the extreme, especially after Donald Trump’s victory. Others see it as a political imperative that must be put into practice more than anything else, regardless of who is in the White House. In between, there are those who believe that we should avoid the old theological arguments and fill the term with practical content. I share this view, Joseph Borell expresses in an essay. He goes on to explain that the term is not new. 'Strategic autonomy' has long been part of the EU’s common language. The term was coined in the defense industry and was for a long time limited to defense and security issues. And that is part of the problem. [7] Independence from global superpowers: The EU is working to find an independent role between the US and China. This can be seen in projects such as the European Defense Initiative and the desired energy sovereignty. Resilient supply chains: The coronavirus pandemic and geopolitical tensions have pushed the EU to diversify its supply chains and seek strategic independence in areas such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and raw materials. • Migration and social cohesion Migration as a core issue: The EU faces the challenge of developing a common migration policy. Tensions between member states over the distribution of refugees and migrants make it difficult to resolve. Integration and social tensions: Dealing with migration and integration is essential for social cohesion. The EU must find ways to make cultural diversity and integration harmonious. Environment and climate policy The EU Green Deal: The EU Green Deal is at the heart of the Union’s future climate policy. The EU aims to be climate neutral by 2050, which requires extensive reforms and investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and transport. Energy crisis and transition: Given the energy crisis and geopolitical dependence on energy sources, the EU needs to accelerate its energy diversification and investment in renewable energy. • Populism and nationalism Intra-European tensions: The rise of populist movements in some member states poses a challenge to the unity of nationalist EU governments and could hinder efforts to deepen EU integration and exacerbate conflicts on issues such as the rule of law and media freedom. Political fragmentation: The EU faces increasing political fragmentation, which can make it difficult to decide on and implement joint actions. • Technological development and digitalisation Digital sovereignty: The EU is striving for greater digital independence in order to be less dependent on big tech companies from the US and China. This includes developing our own digital infrastructures, data centres and technologies. Data protection and AI regulation: The EU can play a leading role in regulating artificial intelligence and data protection to set ethical and social standards and protect the digital rights of its citizens. The future of the EU will largely depend on how it responds to internal and external challenges. Whether it moves towards a stronger political union or allows for more flexible models of cooperation will be crucial to ensuring stability, prosperity and global influence in dealing with natural emergencies and monitoring climate change. 2.3 Space Security Programme The EU is also developing a space security programme that includes protecting satellite infrastructure from risks such as space debris and cyber-attacks. This is an effort to ensure that Europe’s space infrastructure remains secure and protected from external interference and threats. 2.4 NewSpace Initiative The EU has also encouraged the development of the private sector in space, including 'NewSpace,' which supports new and innovative companies in the space field. This includes startups that develop new technologies for launching rockets, developing small satellites and providing services for specific missions. 2.5 IRIS² Constellation IRIS² is a recent project that aims to build a constellation of satellites to ensure secure communications in Europe and improve internet connectivity in rural and remote regions. This project is being considered an essential element to increase Europe’s technological autonomy and strengthen cybersecurity. These projects are part of the EU’s strategy to develop its space capabilities, increase technological independence and influence global innovation in the field of space. *** To expand the range of investments in this plan, the EU Commissioner for Defence and Space, Andrius Kubilius, insisted in this hearing that we mentioned above that Europe must be part of the 'space revolution'. The EU must continue to improve its major space programmes and work to ensure autonomous European access to space, he affirmed in this traditional briefing. The European Investment Bank’s lending policies could evolve and the next multiannual financial framework should have larger spending lines for defence and space, he added. Brussels is also expected to publish a law, namely the EU Space Act, to promote global standards for thousands of satellites in orbit; promote the economy of space data collection; and strengthen the protection of EU space assets for 'the most extreme military contingencies'. The Space Act, warned EU Commissioner Andrius Kubilius, will be a major part of his legislative agenda until 2025, and is likely to set standards to curb light pollution caused by mega-satellite constellations and limit greenhouse gas emissions and pollution caused by rocket launches. The EU currently spends around €2 billion a year on space, he said, but just maintaining services in existing programmes like Galileo will require 'much more significant funding' from the budget — so expect more talks on space allocations in the coming months, adding at the end of this hearing that: 'Space is still untapped for defence.' But can the EU’s common arms market, the space revolution… be guaranteed without the EU’s strategic 'emancipation' from the US? The political future of the European Union (EU) in the context of geopolitical developments and the expected return of Donald Trump to White House is expected to face unpredictable challenges, but also opportunities, imposed by a mix of internal tensions, geopolitical changes and changing priorities. All of this is linked to several factors: • Strengthening integration and institutional reforms To remain globally competitive and to overcome internal challenges, the EU may increasingly rely on deeper integration and cooperation among member states. This could include greater alignment in areas such as taxation, social policy and defence. A central point of contention is whether the EU should move to majority voting in foreign policy and other sensitive areas in order to speed up decision-making processes. This issue goes through deep institutional reforms. There are serious discussions about reforming the EU institutions to adapt them to this existing union and to full enlargement, especially with the six countries of South-Eastern Europe: Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, but also with the two countries of Eastern Europe: Ukraine and Moldova. A stronger role for the European Parliament and a more efficient administration can be imagined. • European autonomy and strategic sovereignty Independence from superpowers: the EU is working to find an independent role between the US and China. This can be seen in projects such as the European Defence Initiative and the desired energy sovereignty. The coronavirus pandemic and geopolitical tensions have pushed the EU to diversify its supply chains and seek strategic independence in areas such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and raw materials. • Migration and social cohesion Migration is seen as a crucial issue. The EU faces the challenge of developing a common migration policy. Tensions between member states over the distribution of refugees and migrants make it difficult to resolve. Dealing with migration and integration is essential for social cohesion. The EU must find ways to make cultural diversity and integration harmonious. • Environment and climate policy The EU Green Deal is at the heart of its future climate policy. The EU aims to be climate neutral by 2050, which requires extensive reforms and investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and transport. Given the energy crisis and geopolitical dependence on energy sources, the EU needs to accelerate its energy diversification and investments in renewable energy. • Neo-fascism: a wake-up call The rise of populist movements with strong elements of neo-fascism in some member states poses a challenge to the unity of nationalist EU governments, which could hinder efforts to deepen EU integration and exacerbate conflicts on issues such as the rule of law and media freedom. The case of Hungary is a specific example. The rise of neo-fascism is expected to deepen political fragmentation on a scale that threatens the future of the EU. • Technological development and digitalization The EU is striving for greater digital independence in order to be less dependent on big tech companies from the US and China. This includes developing our digital infrastructures, data centers and technologies. In this context, the EU can play a leading role in regulating artificial intelligence and data protection to set ethical and social standards and to protect the digital rights of its citizens. 3. Transatlantic developments and Albanians On the transatlantic front, political, economic and security developments also have direct impacts on Albanians, especially considering the close ties of political Albania and the Republic of Kosovo with the United States and the European Union. Albania is already a NATO member state and is currently taking real steps towards EU accession. The Republic of Kosovo has also applied for EU membership. Whether this is the path that should be followed is a matter for further discussion. In recent decades, Albanians have benefited from cooperation with the US and the EU in many areas. For example, NATO played a major role not only in the liberation but also in the security of Kosovo and subsequently helped develop the Kosovo Security Forces, which are now becoming a real defense force. Through NATO, a security umbrella has been created that supports peace and stability in the region. In economic terms, Albania and Kosovo's trade relations with Western countries are growing. Foreign investment, especially from Western countries, is an important factor in the economic development of Albania and Kosovo. For example, EU-funded infrastructure projects and economic agreements with the US help strengthen the economies of both Albanian republics and raise the standard of living for the population. Finally, Albanians in the diaspora, especially in the USA, are also an influential factor in strengthening transatlantic ties. They not only contribute with remittances and investments, but also play an important role in increasing the political and diplomatic influence of Albanians in the international arena. Meanwhile, Albanians in Western Europe were the decisive factor for the changes that followed on February 14, 2021, opening the prospect of the liberation of the Republic from the oligarchy and its functionalization on the scale that today guarantees the sovereignty of the Republic in its territorial integrity. Overall, transatlantic developments offer opportunities for economic growth, improved governance, and strengthened security for Albanians, but they also require a continued commitment to meet democratic standards and pursue policies that harmonize with Western ones. Meanwhile, European efforts for this kind of 'strategic emancipation' from the US, unfortunately, neither in Tirana nor in Pristina seem to have been able to read it properly. Official Pristina has, in fact, invested a lot in establishing good relations with Great Britain, as the bearer of Anglo-Saxon views and interests on the old continent. Consequently, in the expected geopolitical realignments even within the Western Hemisphere, the Anglo-Saxon grouping is likely to have a wider reach than can be judged in Paris or Berlin. [Let us recall on this occasion the AUKUS military alliance — Australia, United Kingdom, USA, signed on September 15, 2021, almost half a year before the Russian invasion for the complete occupation of Ukraine. Over time, Washington realized that this alliance 'would not be enough to contain China, because Beijing was not impressed, that is, it did not give any signs or make known any indication of its intention to submit to American global domination.'[8] After that, Washington focused on attracting its verified European and Asian partners. [Poland, the Baltic states and probably the Eastern Balkans]. Despite all these expected developments in transatlantic relations, the Albanian debate on the results of the US elections — as in the past — indicates the pronounced political deficit of our elite and those who claim to create opinion. The problem remains the forced display of views that place extreme expectations on American presidents. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Joe Biden have been elevated to Messiah-like figures. This dichotomous view does not reflect a mature society, but rather an overly prolonged and delayed adolescence. In this context of developments, the two Albanian republics together — political Albania and the Republic of Kosovo, as countries with little weight in the modern political scene and in international relations, must always pay attention to the power relations in motion in the world and focus on survival in the anarchic system of international relations. Moreover, they must take care of the interests of the Nation, our position and reputation in the world. Conclusion Now that Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office is almost certain, alarm bells about the expected negative impact on transatlantic relations have been ringing. But the biggest problem for Europe is now Ukraine. Given who will be in the White House in January 2025, the US will surely transfer the problem of financing the Ukraine war onto the shoulders of the EU, while it will fully return to the Middle East and confronting China, as the real center of its national interests.[9] Some of the ways in which his return could affect the EU’s political future: • US approach to NATO and Security Cooperation Trump has often shown skepticism towards NATO, calling for European member states to contribute more financially. If he focuses on reducing US commitment to NATO, this could increase pressure on the EU to build a stronger independent defence capability. The EU could try to advance its 'European defence' project to ensure more strategic independence. • Trade and Economic Policies Trump has supported protectionist policies and has sought bilateral agreements that favour the US, rather than multilateral ones. His return could bring new trade tensions between the US and the EU, which could worsen economic relations or lead to a reorientation of the EU towards other trading partners. • Climate and Energy Issues Trump has been skeptical of climate agreements, including the Paris Agreement, which the US withdrew from during his first term. If the EU sees a lack of cooperation from the US on climate issues, it could seek to deepen climate cooperation with other countries or increase its own investments in green technologies to maintain its role as a global leader on environmental issues. • Strengthening European Integration and Autonomy A Trump return could reinforce the narrative of a more independent and integrated EU. With less support from the US, there could be a push for more political and economic integration between member states. Political attitudes towards Russian and Chinese influence could also change, with the EU trying to avoid dependence on external powers. Overall, Trump’s possible return could prompt the EU to reconsider its foreign policy, increasing autonomy and defending its interests in a world where the US may be more focused on domestic policies and protectionist approaches. But due to the lack of leadership within the EU and the long-term flirtation with Putin’s Russian Federation, the EU has remained completely out of the spotlight of the competition of other world powers and their desire to free themselves from American dominance in the last three decades, since both Paris and Berlin believed that through that flirtation in the Washington-Moscow relationship, 'they would more easily gain the space to realize their national interests to the extent they considered necessary.[10]' Therefore, the future of the EU will depend largely on how it responds to internal and external challenges. Whether it moves towards a stronger political union or allows for more flexible models of cooperation will be crucial to ensuring stability, prosperity and influence at the global level. Consequently, the new European military path could be described as a strategic 'emancipation' of its own kind from the USA.

The 2004 EU Enlargement Was A Success Story Built On Deep Reform ...	Poland is one of the success stories of European economic convergence. The country, which in January takes the reins of the Council of the European Union (the decision-making institution representing the Union’s member states) is now the EU’s sixth largest economy. This convergence process was driven by the 2004 EU enlargement, which also welcomed the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovenia, and Slovakia into the Union, expanding the EU’s population by about 20 percent. Twenty years later, as new EU accession discussions are underway, it is worth looking at how much the earlier enlargement benefitted new members and the whole Union, and reflect on the economic returns of broadening the European single market. The current accession candidates, in different stages of the process, are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and Türkiye. In October, the European Commission issued a new report with detailed assessments of the state of play and the progress toward EU accession made by each candidate. A new note by the Regional Economic Outlook for Europe shows that the 2004 EU enlargement brought substantial income gains. These gains were particularly large in the new member states: after 15 years GDP per person was on average more than 30 percent higher than it would have been without EU accession. The factors driving these gains in new members were threefold. First, the 2004 group benefitted from more comprehensive economic reforms prior to joining the EU than implemented in comparable other regions, including on trade, financial sector, and product market liberalization. Second, additional financing from foreign direct investment and EU cohesion funds helped boost the capital stock. Third, technology transfers and enhancements in educational attainment improved productivity. While all regions in new EU countries gained, some gained more than others. Those already better integrated into value chains with the existing member states increased GDP per person nearly 10 percentage points more than those less integrated pre-accession, irrespective of geographic distance. Regions with firms that had easier access to long term financing gained close to 15 percentage point more than others. Existing member states benefitted from EU enlargement too. By 2019, income per person was around 10 percent higher than it would have been in a scenario without enlargement. The main driver of these gains was the expansion of the EU’s single market, which allowed firms to expand production and reap efficiency gains, including through higher investment in the accession countries. While regions in Scandinavia, Germany, and Austria—already well integrated with new member states prior to accession—gained the most, many regions further away benefitted too. What does this mean for next wave of EU accession? A key lesson is that both accession candidate countries and existing EU members can benefit if they put in the work. This is no easy task. It would require strong pre-accession reforms, significant financing, political resolve, and possible institutional adaptation. Some factors of the 2004 successes may be harder to achieve today. For accession countries this puts a premium on those actions directly under their control, such as the reform effort to close business regulation and institutional gaps to the EU. From the existing members’ side, continuing to deepen the single market by removing remaining within-union trade barriers and advancing the capital market union to finance dynamic firms’ growth would further amplify the potential gains. These joint efforts could not only accelerate catch-up within Europe, but also help narrow Europe’s persistently large income gap with the US.

How Javier Milei Explains His Economic Philosophy – OpEd	By Patrick Carroll Javier Milei has garnered significant global attention over the past year, and it’s not hard to see why. The iconoclastic president of Argentina has been making considerable changes to his country’s government, and as an outspoken libertarian he has been introducing many to the freedom philosophy for the first time. In recent weeks, there have even been calls to use Milei’s approach as a model for Trump’s second term. But what exactly is Milei’s approach, and how has it been going? In a recent interview with Lex Fridman, Milei explained his economic and political philosophy and provided an update on Argentina’s situation. Three parts of the interview in particular stood out. 1) How Milei Discovered Austrian Economics In the first part of the interview, Milei explained how he discovered Austrian economics and how that radically changed his thinking about economic theory. The discovery happened around 2014, at which point he had been an economics professor in Argentina for 20 years: I remember that one of the people who worked on my team suggested I read an article by Murray Newton Rothbard called Monopoly and Competition. [The article was Chapter 10 of Man, Economy, and State, which had been excerpted as a stand-alone piece.] I remember reading it like it was today, and after reading it carefully, I said, 'Everything I’ve taught about market structure in the last 20 years in courses on microeconomics is wrong.' This caused a very strong internal commotion in me. So I called this person who used to work with me, and they recommended a place to buy Austrian School of Economics books, and I remember I bought at least 20 or 30 books, which I went to pick up one Saturday afternoon. And when I visited the bookstore, I was fascinated by all the stuff they had there. …I started to read very intensively, and I remember, for example, the experience of reading Human Action by Mises, and this was a book that I didn’t know about. And I remember that on the following weekend, I started to read this book right from the first page, and I didn’t stop until I finished it, and that was a true revolution in my head. And having the chance to read Austrian authors like Rothbard, Mises, Hayek, Hoppe, and Jesús Huerta de Soto, or others like Juan Ramón Rallo, Philipp Bagus, and Walter Block, for example. This is a fascinating story that highlights the power of Austrian economics. It is one thing when an economic school of thought becomes popular among lay readers. But when an accomplished economist does a complete about-face upon discovering a new economic philosophy, maybe that’s a philosophy worth taking seriously! And what, exactly, is Austrian economics? It’s hard to boil it down, but it’s essentially a system of economic laws that—in the Misesian tradition at least—are grounded in praxeology, the science of human action. Austrians take a radically different approach to basic economic theory, emphasizing human choice, subjective value, and the dynamic nature of the market. Though Austrian economics, like any positive science, is technically value-free, the Austrian view of the economy tends to paint all government intervention in the free market as causing problems rather than solving them. Thus, those who believe the Austrian school is correct are often staunch advocates of laissez-faire policies. Milei’s reference to Human Action, Mises’s magnum opus published in 1949, is especially heartwarming because of the special role that FEE played in making that book possible. Here’s what Larry Reed, FEE’s president emeritus, wrote about that story in 2016: Mises occupies a special place in the history of the organization I lead, the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE). Human Action itself was published only when our founder Leonard E. Read agreed to buy nearly the entire first print run and distribute it. This is what kicked off the book to become a big seller for many decades. Suffice it to say, it is tremendously encouraging to see a figure like Milei introducing a new generation of thinkers to the Austrian tradition. 2) Economic Freedom and the Virtuous Cycle Later in the interview, Milei emphasized that Argentina’s plan for achieving economic prosperity is all about leaning into economic freedom: To have a sense of magnitude, the reforms that we already have made with the executive order 7023, and with the bases law, we have actually jumped 90 places in terms of economic freedom. What this means is that today, Argentina has institutions similar to those of Germany, France, Italy, and we obviously want this to continue. When Milei talks about jumping 90 places, he’s referring to global indexes of economic freedom, such as the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World report. The EFW index examines a country’s policies to see how much they are conducive to economic freedom, that is, capitalism. Each country is given an overall score based on five key areas: size of government, legal system and property rights, sound money, freedom to trade internationally, and regulation. Countries are then ranked according to their score, with the highest-scoring countries (those having the most economic freedom) at the top. Jumping 90 places would mean jumping from, say, the 140th most economically free country to the 50th. What is significant about these indexes is that they consistently find that economic freedom is strongly correlated with positive outcomes, such as income per capita, life expectancy, life satisfaction, and environmental stewardship. Put plainly, countries that are more capitalist tend to be wealthier, healthier, and overall better places to live than countries where the government plays a larger role in the economy. After discussing why he is optimistic about Argentina’s prospects for economic growth, Milei made this interesting comment: Therefore, if during the worst moment our image didn’t suffer and we stayed strong in our ideas, now that everything is working much better, why should we change? On the contrary, we are ready to redouble the bet. Though Milei doesn’t quite lay it out this way, the overall plan seems to be creating a positive feedback loop that becomes a virtuous cycle. By establishing a bit more economic freedom, Argentina’s economy can recover and grow. This will bring Milei and his ideas more popularity, which will eventually translate into better electoral outcomes for Milei’s camp. Then, having more power, they can enact even more pro-freedom reforms, which will lead to a better economy, which will lead to more support, which will lead to even more freedom, and so on. And then, Argentina could become a beacon for the world, a shining city on a hill, an example of what a country can accomplish with free markets. And then it will be undeniable to everyone in the world that our ideas work, and it will only be a matter of time before the rest of the world follows suit. Is that a pipe dream? Perhaps. Then again, it could also be an accurate description of the next 10–30 years of world history. And wouldn’t that be something! The hardest part, of course, is getting the feedback loop started. What we need at the outset is the thing Leonard Read continuously stressed: a faith in freedom. Fortunately, what Milei seems to be saying is that we might already be past the hardest part. The Argentine people have put their faith in freedom, and the first signs of economic momentum, he says, are already showing. Time will tell if this proves to be true, but surely it’s a good sign. 3) The Most Wonderful Thing about Capitalism In one of the final sections of the interview, Milei explains why he thinks the market works so well as a guide for humanity: One must first understand what the market is. Simply put, the market is a process of voluntary exchange, where individuals cooperate through the transfer of property rights, in which private property is upheld. This is the system that drives the allocation of resources. In essence, socialism—and this is what Mises condemns in his book Socialism—shows that without private property, prices cease to exist and therefore resources are diverted. Why don’t you think it’s the same to make a road of asphalt or gold? Why not make it of gold? Because you have an understanding of economic calculation, you have an idea of prices in your mind. So, in this context, if there is no private property, there are no prices, and as a result, free market capitalism is the best mechanism ever developed by humankind for resource allocation. This also implies that markets must be free. Free from state intervention, because when the state intervenes, it creates interference. And markets need to allow free entry and exit, what we call competition. For Mises’s perspective on intervention in the market, see his books A Critique of Interventionismand Interventionism: An Economic Analysis. Milei continues: …And also, let’s talk about what pertains to the division of labor and social cooperation. The most wonderful thing about capitalism is that you can only be successful by serving others with better-quality goods at a better price. If you are successful in free market capitalism, you are a hero, you are a social benefactor, you are a prosperity machine. So the better you do, the better it is for society. This is very important. Milei’s comments here are spot on. In a free market, entrepreneurs earn profits by serving others. It is by solving problems, by developing inventions—in short, by creating value—that you get ahead in the free market. And this, fundamentally, is why markets work so well as a guide for humanity. They are a mechanism for systematically meeting human needs—the epitome of social cooperation. As Milton Friedman said, 'The essential notion of a capitalist society…is voluntary cooperation, voluntary exchange. The essential notion of a socialist society is fundamentally force.'

Why Europeans Should Take A Measured Approach Towards Trump In Af...	By Will Brown For Africa watchers, Donald Trump’s first stint in the White House was defined by three iconic episodes. The 45th president set the tone early with his comments about African countries being 'shitholes.' Then there was the utter confusion as a khaki-clad secretary of state Rex Tillerson rushed back from his first official trip to Africa, only to be given The Apprentice-style ‘you’re fired’ treatment on Twitter. Finally, Melania Trump finished up with a right-wing hook: a less-than-successful attempt to get the pith hat back in fashion on a visit to Kenya. European officials might be tempted to scream at a Brussels side-alley wall when contemplating Trump’s policies on Ukraine, Gaza, or tariffs. But on Africa, at least, they probably can breathe a measured sigh. Much like America’s policy towards China, how it engages with Africa seems to be one of the few holdouts in bipartisan politics. Unlike US-China policy, however, this is mainly because Africa is so low on Washington’s agenda that it often becomes subservient to other foreign policy objectives. Regardless, African and European officials should prepare for Trump to play a wild card regarding security. It is simply not clear what ‘America First’ will mean regarding boots on the ground in Africa and military assistance to the continent. Shifting conflict centres During the last Trump administration, the president made fighting Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria a mainstay of his foreign policy. He cultivated his image as the slayer of jihadi bosses, proclaiming in a 2019 speech – accompanied by many a gesticulation – that IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 'died like a dog.' But on Africa, two paradoxical things happened. The US at once massively upped its drone strikes in Somalia to never-before seen levels, while Trump dramatically decreased the number of US troops on the continent from 5,000 to about 1,500. Now the centre of the jihadist conflict has shifted to West Africa’s Sahel, with one in every four deaths from terrorist violence last year occurring in Burkina Faso. But it somehow seems unlikely that, this time around, Trump will give the West African jihadist commanders as much attention as their Middle Eastern counterparts. A second administration might decide that the security crises on the continent are too bothersome for even the limited attention they get now. Indeed, if one thing is certain about the incoming administration’s US security policy on Africa, it is that Trump is likely to be even less willing than Joe Biden to expend any US political capital with the Gulf states – which hold the key to stopping the conflict in Sudan – and trying to push through a peace process in Sudan, the largest humanitarian crisis on earth. Likewise, whether a new administration would continue to counter Russia’s influence in Africa – which Biden’s administration seems to have been doing quietly and effectively – is another wild card hidden behind the misty Kremlinology of Trump’s personal relationship with president Vladimir Putin and the latter’s rabid aggression towards Ukraine. Strength through growth Analysts probably should not put too much credit in the Heritage Foundation’s 920-page ‘Mandate for Leadership’. Even so, it is worth considering the singular page devoted exclusively to what a new Trump policy towards the youngest and fastest-growing continent might look like. Some sentences on the growing geostrategic importance of sub-Saharan Africa to the US seem to be lifted from Biden’s 2022 Africa Strategy. '[Africa’s] explosive population growth, large reserves of industry-dependent minerals, proximity to key maritime shipping routes, and its collective diplomatic power ensure the continent’s global importance,' declares the opening paragraph, seemingly in mimicry. Then, amid the regular analytical banalities, the author recommends shifting from assistance to a growth model, countering 'malign' Chinese influence, and advocating an end to pushing policies 'birthed in the American culture wars' like abortion access and LGBT rights. The idea that Trump’s White House will massively boost autocratic tendencies across Africa seems a somewhat shallow take. Of course, it is bad news for those who champion the principles of an open society and it no doubt leaves US officials even less room to criticise the actions of autocrats. But if Americans are honest with themselves, both Democrats and Republicans have always been willing to support African strongmen who take a pro-US stance – going all the way back to Zaire’s president, Mobutu Sese Seko. Personnel dependencies A huge amount of US-Africa policy will depend on which officials Trump appoints, the tone he sets, and the issues which capture his administration’s imagination. South African-born Elon Musk and the MAGA’s movements foundations of Christian nationalism clearly have sway on Trump’s thinking, and it is conceivable that this could highlight surprising issues. The 47th president may suddenly become more vocal about the murder of white farmers in South Africa or Christians in Nigeria, for example. A couple of general predictions can be made with a degree of certainty. The US will almost certainly see its Africa policy through more of a Chinese lens. Under Biden, officials made a valiant effort to engage with Africa on its terms, not always through the prism of great power politics. But with Trump in the White House, wresting influence away from Beijing will be front and centre of the administration’s approach to Africa. This could mean, for example, US recognition of Somaliland as a hedge against Chinese gains in neighbouring Djibouti, where Beijing and Washington both have a permanent military presence. But it will still be an uphill slog for Washington. US trade with the continent sat at around $47.5 billion in 2023, compared to some $283.1 billion between China and Africa – while the number of US diplomats in Africa has recently fallen slightly, to around 2,000. The name of the game will be transactionalism and bilateralism, not development and multilateralism. Some African presidents, ever distrustful of Western support for civil society programmes, might even appreciate this clear-cut approach. Judging by campaign rhetoric, the United States Agency for International Development will increasingly be seen through an 'America first' narrative. Every dollar spent will be balanced against what its investment brings to the country’s companies, citizens, and interests. Furthermore, US support for family-planning programmes or LGBT rights in Africa will likely evaporate. America’s landmark African Growth and Opportunity Act, which was launched in 2000 to provide eligible countries with tariff-free access to certain products in the US market, does not seem to align with the MAGA talk on tariffs. Should this be on the chopping block in 2025, it would have disastrous effects for South Africa in particular. * While America’s future policy on Africa remains unclear, Trump’s re-election underscores the need for a coordinated and mutual European-African policy on the big strategic issues. Neither Europe nor Africa can rely on a rational, level-headed Washington anymore. But if the right tone is set, it could help usher in a renewed spirit of collaboration between the two continents. Nowhere is this clearer than on security. A vast stretch of land across from the southern flank of Europe, stretching from Mali to Sudan, is on fire. So far, European states have been woefully incapable of navigating the new fractured world of disinformation, mercenaries, and putschists, and of putting aside differences to become an effective force for peace and stability. Democratic leaders in Africa have not fared much better. Europeans need not be alarmist, however. These are tough challenges ahead, but they are not insurmountable. Trump’s re-election highlights the need to stay engaged in the Sahel wherever realistically possible, to throw their weight behind the peace process in Sudan, and overcome the petty divisions that often leave Europe less than the sum of its parts.

US Bond Yields Rise As Reserve Currency Status Wanes – Analysis	By Artis Shepherd With much consternation, capital markets participants are watching US treasury bond yields go up while Jerome Powell and the Fed continue to lower the Fed Funds Rate in an effort to spur another round of easy money. The Fed Funds rate is a short-term interest rate used for interbank borrowing. US treasury bonds are medium-long term securities that represent the sovereign debt of the US government, so the yield on those bonds represents the US government’s cost of borrowing. While there is no law that binds the two, lower rates from the Fed generally translate into lower treasury yields. Explanations for the divergence have been proffered, talking heads have opined, and conclusions abound with regard to the meaning behind the movement. Given the mixed signals, difficult questions related to the financial health of the US Treasury are being asked. Is the government’s profligate spending finally catching up with it? Isn’t more easy money from the Fed a reckless, inflationary gamble? Is the global reserve currency status a curse rather than a blessing? Regardless of what happens with US bond yields, these are important considerations for an American public ravaged by inflation due to government overspending and continual monetary molestation by the Federal Reserve. $2 Trillion Deficits The US is on track to run a $2 trillion deficit this fiscal year, which began in October. This will add to the existing national debt of $36 trillion, or 135 percent of GDP. Notwithstanding the goofy Department of Government Efficiency, all signs point to continued large deficits during the Trump administration. The recent action in US bond yields does not help this situation. By August of this year, futures markets had fully priced in a 25-50 basis point Fed rate cut in September, and were expecting additional 25 basis point cuts in November and December. This expectation for the Fed Funds Rate initially carried over into treasury yields. At the beginning of August—as markets priced in 75-100bps of Fed rate cuts by year-end—10-year treasury yields reacted accordingly, dropping from 4.30 percent in late July (they had been 4.70 percent in April) to 3.65 percent in the middle of September. As of mid-November, that entire move had been erased, with yields back above 4.40 percent, roughly where they were prior to markets pricing in this year’s Fed rate cuts. At roughly $1 trillion annually, interest on the US debt carries an effective interest rate (interest expense divided by debt balance) of 3 percent. However, by mid-November, bond yields across the curve ranged from 4.25 percent to 4.75 percent, meaning interest expense is only going higher as old cheap bonds mature and are refinanced with new, more expensive bonds. Easy Money, Inflation, and Asset Bubbles In late 2020, the global inventory of bonds with negative yields reached an astounding $18.4 trillion. Let that sink in. $18.4 trillion worth of bonds where the lenders—rather than earning interest—were actually paying borrowers for the privilege of lending them money. The direct cause of this unfathomable distortion was central banks—the Federal Reserve foremost among them—playing fast and loose with monetary policy. Forcing interest rates down, creating money by the trillions, and fostering a reckless inflationary environment—centered on the capital markets and asset prices—has produced market signals that are unmistakably irrational. Faced with a much higher cost of living in light of excessive government spending and money creation by the Fed, average Americans have resorted to gambling in those same capital markets. American households and nonprofits now have nearly 42 percent of their financial assets in stocks, while the stocks themselves are at all-time highs. Into the teeth of this raging asset bubble comes the Fed with further rate cuts, the stand-alone effects of which are reflationary. And, all else equal, more inflation means higher yields on government bonds. It’s increasingly unlikely that investors will accept a yield that whittles down to zero after adjusting for inflation. Reserve Currency Status Sober and rational market observer Jim Grant recently analogized the US dollar’s reserve currency status as follows: [Reserve currency status] is like an affluent parent with a somewhat underachieving child saying [to that child], 'Here’s $20 million dollars, go out and drink yourself to death.' That, in a way, is the reserve currency privilege. Mr. Grant puts it well. There is no doubt that the US dollar’s reserve currency status has been abused, and that abuse was inevitable. Endless and expensive wars, combined with runaway spending for political programs, have effectively bankrupted the US Treasury. Honestly-underwritten, no investor would lend to a private entity with such a disdain for financial discipline and no sense of urgency to reverse course. Like the Pound Sterling before it, unhinged profligacy over an extended period of time is likely a precursor to the dollar’s loss of status and there are already compelling signs that global markets wish to decouple from the dollar, including a notable decline in foreign holdings of US treasuries relative to domestic holdings, the latter category including treasuries held by the Federal Reserve. This indicates that prospective foreign buyers of US sovereign debt are already wary of Uncle Sam’s rapidly-declining credit quality. Undoubtedly, the specter of the US losing reserve currency status should move treasury yields much more than a few dozen basis points, but bond markets often move at a glacial pace. While slow, such movements are just as unavoidable. Something That Can’t Last Forever Fair is foul, and the US reserve currency status is likely to be seen in hindsight as a curse rather than a blessing. The Fed’s ability to print money stems partially from the hubris of long-past geopolitical successes. Those successes, combined with a level of economic dominance, fostered an appetite from foreign markets for all things dollar-denominated. Increasingly, that no longer appears to be the case, but the domestic tendency to print and spend has not abated in the least. Those who continue to invest in US government bonds—despite the deranged fiscal recklessness of Congress and the improvisational monetary policy of the Fed—must do so with regard for the creditworthiness of the borrower and the soundness of its currency. As treasury yields go up, dependent markets—including stocks and housing—are likely to be impacted as well. Investors of all stripes would, therefore, do well to remember how currency regimes decline and asset bubbles pop—gradually, then all at once.

The Ulama Leadership Model Of The Islamic Party Of Malaysia (PAS)...	By Syaza Shukri and Muhammad Baihaqi Aminudin The Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) today stands at a crossroads as it seeks to firmly root itself in its traditional ulama leadership model. As PAS strives to uphold Islamic principles within Malaysia’s multi-ethnic social configuration, the time has come for a transformative dialogue about its future leadership. Can PAS evolve beyond its traditional boundaries to embrace a more inclusive vision that resonates with all Malaysians? Balancing its religious history with modern aspirations can unlock new possibilities for the party and the nation. PAS is an Islamist political party founded in 1951. Known for its conservative Islamic ideology, it has been a force of opposition even before Malaysia’s independence in 1957. It was in government for brief periods: 1973-77 and 2020-22. In PAS, kepimpinan ulama (ulama leadership) refers to a group of religious leaders holding key positions. As key players in shaping the party’s ideology and policies, the ulama (Islamic scholars) have been partly responsible for maintaining the party’s strong grassroots organisation. Since the resignation of the party’s fourth president Mohd Asri Haji Muda in the 1982 Muktamar (PAS’ Annual General Meeting), the leadership of PAS has been passed to the ulama faction. It then re-directed the party’s ideology and approach. The movement was led by Yusof Rawa, alongside other young leaders of the ulama cadre, including Nik Aziz Nik Mat, Abdul Hadi Awang and Fadzil Noor. Despite PAS having been founded and led by religious scholars who wanted to distinguish itself from UMNO via its Islamist ideology,[1] the kepimpinan ulamawas further popularised following the Iranian Revolution in 1979. In September 2024, PAS held its 70th Muktamar in Temerloh (Pahang). Party president Abdul Hadi Awang, in his keynote address, emphasised the continued relevance of Islamic governance under the guidance of the Majlis Syura Ulama in navigating Malaysia’s challenging political landscape under the Madani government. In accordance with its tradition, the Muktamar highlights the Ulama Council’s role in shaping PAS’ policy and ensuring that PAS remains grounded in Islamic principles while expanding its influence in the Malay heartland. Overall, the Muktamar reaffirmed the de facto central role of the ulama leadership in guiding the party’s direction. However, can the party’s leadership of the ulama push it forward to garner support from non-Malays? Undoubtedly, the ulama leadership in PAS has been a dominant force in Malaysian politics for over 40 years. On the one hand, the party currently collaborates with Malay-based party Bersatu and multiracial ones such as Gerakan under the Perikatan Nasional (PN) banner. On the other hand, PAS, on its own accord, maintains its Islamist identity, even more so after the 14th General Election (GE14).[2] After Pakatan Harapan (PH) won in 2018, PAS, alongside UMNO, adopted Islamist populism in which the supposed threat of civilisational 'others', particularly Chinese citizens, and necessitated a united Malay-Muslim front.[3] However, in 2023, during the 69th Muktamar, Hadi Awang admitted that one of the party’s weaknesses is its difficulty in garnering non-Muslim support.[4] In the 2024 Muktamar, PAS delegates voted to allow non-Muslims to become associate members of the party in its efforts to reform its image as an 'extreme' party in order to increase its support base.[5] The bigger elephant in the room is whether the PAS ulama leadership model would limit the success of this innovation. To be sure, under new political circumstances, it needs to reassess if the current leadership style is ideal. Malaysia is witnessing what is perhaps considered the 'Second Islamisation Race', whereby PAS is challenged by the Anwar Ibrahim unity government’s interpretation of Islam within the Madani framework.[6] Although Madani is introduced as a concept of civilisation (or civil society), its root in the Arabic term 'medina' (city) and its early discussion by Muslim thinkers such as Al-Farabi, Ibn Khaldun and Ibn Miskawayh suggests it has beginnings within Islamic history. In response to the Anwar Ibrahim administration’s more progressive views on Islam, PAS leadership can consider a new model to increase its relevance among the population. THE EVOLUTION OF ULAMA LEADERSHIP IN PAS Ulama are Islamic scholars who have received religious education. They are traditionally experts in Islamic theology, law (sharia), and jurisprudence (fiqh), playing a crucial role in shaping Muslim politics and influencing social discourse. For the purposes of this paper, however, we investigate the definition of ulama as perceived by PAS’ leadership which subsequently transformed the party into a conservative, oppositional, and sometimes revolutionary organisation.[7] The era of ulama leadership began after the 1982 Muktamar held in the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Kuala Lumpur. PAS witnessed the third formulation of the party’s ideology, after its experimentation with internationalism and left-wing ideologies during the Burhanuddin Al-Helmy presidency, and the Malay-Muslim ethnonationalism of the Asri years.[8] The ulama era marks the growing complexities of these three strains (ulama, internationalism, nationalism), especially when entering Malaysian politics in the 1980s and 1990s to oppose UMNO, a dominant, conservative Malay-nationalist party. By Malaysian standards, an ulama can be anyone with a background in Islamic studies, sometimes leading to the phenomenon of 'false ulama'.[9] Currently, the President and Deputy President of PAS, Abdul Hadi Awang and Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man, have qualifications in Islamic studies and political science (leadership), and party members consider them to be religious clerics.[10] From the 1990s and until recently, PAS had always chosen an ulama to be First Minister (Menteri Besar) in states it has governed.[11] Eight years after the ulama leadership began in 1982, Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, an ulama who received training in Egypt and India, was appointed Menteri Besar of Kelantan. Hadi Awang, another ulama trained in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, was selected by PAS as Menteri Besar of Terengganu after the party defeated Barisan Nasional (BN) in 1999. However, after PAS took control of the Terengganu state administration in 2018, the custom of designating ulama as Menteri Besar was discontinued. Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar, an aeronautical engineer and university lecturer, became the party’s choice for the position. Samsuri had been Hadi Awang’s political secretary, thus his nomination might have more to do with his political experience than his education—or lack thereof—even though it seems to go against party practice. Since then, Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor’s rise to power in Kedah and national politics has continued to indicate a departure from the ulama-centric ideology. Known for his populist appeal and shoot-from-the-hip public statements,[12] Sanusi does not have a background in Islamic studies. The party has yet to determine a different leadership model at the national level.[13] The most possible path forward may be ethnonationalist leadership, given PAS’ veer towards right-wing populism through its partnership with Bersatu. The strength of the ulama leadership lies in its resonance with a significant segment of the Malay populace. This has been proven partly when PAS won in many places inside its largely conservative and rural stronghold in the 15thgeneral election (GE15) in 2022.[14] This is due to Islam’s central role in Malaysian society and politics and an important factor in enhancing legitimacy and control for the Malay-Muslim population.[15] The popularity of this model underscores the validity of religiously grounded leadership.[16] A notable downside surfaces in the perception that the ulama leadership model may be ill-suited to the demands of the current political scene. As argued by Kuru,[17] the alliance between the ulama and the state may lead to authoritarianism as the ulama may no longer play its role effectively as a check on the government. As a result, broader aspirations for reform in the government’s administration would be harder to materialise. The risk is that PAS could find itself alienated within the national reform struggle, particularly among Malaysians who seek a more progressive and liberal political approach. RESEARCH DESIGN This paper is based on qualitative research with a specific focus on expert interviews. This approach has been chosen for its capacity to delve deeply into the experiences, perspectives, and interpretations surrounding the impact and implications of ulama leadership within PAS. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with Ahmad Ubaidillah (Head, Gombak PAS Youth Wing) and Afnan Hamimi (National PAS Youth Chief and Member of Parliament for Alor Setar), whose direct involvement with the party provided a unique lens into the motivations and challenges of this model. Additionally, written interviews were conducted with Dr Mohd Zuhdi Marzuki (Former PAS Research Center Director) and Dr Mahfodz Mohamed (Former Head of the Central PAS Ulama Council). All the interviews were conducted in June 2024. These interviewees represent diverse positions in PAS, including the ulama and non-ulama leaders, with Dr Mohd Zuhdi, Afnan, and Dr Mahfodz being the most prominent. The semi-structured nature of the interview guide ensures a balance between flexibility and coverage of essential themes related to ulama leadership. THE FUTURE OF THE ULAMA LEADERSHIP MODEL Within PAS, there is a steadfast belief in the importance of ulama leadership. The interviewees present this model as crucial to the maintaining of PAS’s core values and to ensuring that its decisions are grounded in Islamic principles. The preference for ulama leadership stems from a commitment to align PAS to the teachings and requirements of the Shariah, or Islamic laws. Dr Mohd Zuhdi Marzuki emphasises the need to defend the ulama leadership model. He points to a period from 2008 to 2015, when he claims that the party’s direction risked being hijacked by external influences within the Pakatan Rakyat coalition. During that period, tension was high between PAS and DAP, especially about the implementation of hudud and the establishment of an Islamic state. It was also high within PAS itself between the so-called ulama and professional factions. Further reinforcing Dr Mohd Zuhdi’s perspective is Afnan Hamimi, who asserts that the ulama leadership is irreplaceable. He states, 'Ulama leadership cannot be replaced with another model because the highest reference in PAS is Al-Quran, Sunnah, Ijma’, and Qiyas.'[18] This highlights the belief that any alternative leadership model could not adequately uphold the party’s religious obligations, and preserve the integrity of its decisions. These views underscore a broader sentiment within PAS that the ulama are uniquely equipped to ensure that the party’s actions and policies remain faithful to Islamic teachings. Based on the party’s constitution, 'Members of the Ulama Council are teachers or/and graduates of any field of Islamic studies from any Higher Education Institution or any person who has mastered Islamic studies who has become a member of PAS.'[19] The ulama’s understanding of religious texts and principles are supposed to position them as the ideal leaders to navigate complex political landscapes while staying true to PAS’ mission. However, the belief in ulama leadership within PAS is not universally held, and there are interpretations that suggest a more flexible approach. The notion that the ulama leadership is necessary is challenged by those who emphasise the guidance of the Majlis Syura rather than specific leadership roles within PAS. As Ahmad Ubaidillah mentioned, '[I]nstitutionally, ulama leadership means the struggle and movement of PAS guided by the Majlis Syura'.[20] This definition highlights that the essence of ulama leadership is not in holding power directly but in providing vital religious and legal oversight. This overview by the Majlis Syura ensures that the decisions and actions of PAS align with Islamic principles, but does not necessitate that an Ulama occupies the presidency or other leadership roles. This view supports a model where the guidance of ulama in legal and religious affairs ensures continuity, regardless of who holds specific titles. This stand had been previously argued by the so-called 'Erdogan' camp in PAS led by Mohamad Sabu. But after his faction was defeated in the 2015 party polls, there has been no clear direction on whether the party is ready to accept this interpretation of leadership, and if so to what extent. Further expanding this idea, Ahmad Ubaidillah noted that, '[W]hether an ulama needs to be a leader or president is flexible and can change'.[21] This flexibility allows professionals or other qualified individuals to lead PAS without losing the party’s core Islamic principles. Such flexibility might bring fresh perspectives and adaptability to PAS’s political strategies while preserving the party’s integrity governed by the Majlis Syura. Although Ahmad Ubaidillah may not be as nationally prominent as the other interviewees, he does hold a position in the party’s branch and his views should not be dismissed. He also observed that the tradition of having an ulama as president is not a constitutional requirement. 'It is merely a tradition, not a strict rule in the constitution that says only ulama can be president.'[22] This assertion highlights the openness within the party’s framework for different leadership models that still respect and uphold the guidance function of the ulama, as already championed by the progressive faction before they left PAS and formed Parti Amanah Negara. But according to Dr Mahfodz Mohamed, 'As long as there is no proposal to revoke it, the ulama leadership will remain.'[23] The prevailing sentiment among interviewees is that the current ulama leadership model is the most appropriate for PAS. There is also a recognition that any significant change to this model would require a substantial shift in the mindset of PAS supporters. As further clarified by Dr Mahfodz Mohamed, '[T]here have been efforts to replace the ulama leadership model with another policy, such as during the leadership election in 2015… There were contests for positions from the president downwards, but they all failed in the election. Therefore, the ulama leadership model has remained in place until today.'[24] Yet, as PAS’ long history has shown, the party ebbs and flows according to the political landscape of Malaysia. If enough people within and outside the party demand change, PAS may find it necessary to reconsider its leadership model. CONCLUSION At its core, Islam as a religion anchors itself in the teachings of the Quran and Hadith, which prioritise respect, tolerance, and peace—values that can foster unity and harmony within Malaysia’s multicultural society. Under the guidance of elected representatives committed to inclusivist Islamic values, these principles have the potential to underpin governance that is both compassionate and just. For example, Nik Aziz, the revered spiritual leader of PAS from 1991 until 2015, exemplified a blend of inclusivist ulama leadership. Emphasising Islamic principles, figures like Nik Aziz and Fadzil Noor keenly fostered inter-ethnic and inter-religious harmony via cooperation with the DAP,[25] understanding that national unity depends on respect for Malaysia’s multicultural fabric. Their commitment to inclusivity ensured that PAS remained relevant and appealing across diverse communities, thus fostering acceptance of the party by a wider population segment. Preserving religious values while embracing diversity could coexist, paving the way for harmony that benefits both the party and the nation. From the interviews, it appears that the core principles of ulama leadership are expected to continue guiding PAS. The party’s future will likely involve a continuous balancing between maintaining its religious foundations and adapting to the changing political environment. Understanding this dynamic will be crucial for the future of Malaysia, given PAS’s current position as the single party with the largest number of seats in Parliament. Failing to evolve, the party will stay stagnant with just the support of conservative Malay-Muslims in Malaysia. The by-elections held in 2024 exemplify this, when Perikatan Nasional lost three of the four state by-elections. In Nenggiri and Mahkota, Barisan Nasional even increased its majority by 16.08% and 43.56%, respectively, at the expense of the Perikatan Nasional candidates. Since Perikatan Nasional and Barisan Nasional (specifically UMNO) compete for the same pool of Malay-Muslim voters, growing support for UMNO is not a good sign for PAS. Although these results cannot be generalised, there is a sense that Perikatan Nasional has reached its zenith in terms of support from its traditional base. Unless PAS decides to make changes swiftly, including in its leadership model, there is little likelihood of it taking over Putrajaya, except with the help of partners within and outside of Perikatan Nasional such as Bersatu, Gerakan, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) and Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS). But for PAS to convince the others to join a government coalition, the party needs to show willingness to compromise—as it did before under Pakatan Rakyat—which might be difficult to achieve with a narrow and populist interpretation of Islamic values. While PAS had worked with these parties to form the federal government from 2020 until 2022, it might be more challenging now that GRS, and especially GPS, have found that they can work effectively with Pakatan Harapan under the leadership of Anwar Ibrahim. Therefore, for PAS to envision a future as the main party leading Malaysia, it needs to have an honest review of its strategy to be more attractive to both non-Muslims and Muslims who may not share the view of having an ulama heading the party or the country. This would be in line with calls by the party to open its membership to non-Muslims. Dissenting voices within PAS must make greater effort to convince the current leadership to accept different views; that is how the party can stay united and avoid another splinter group being formed.

Trump Puts Taiwan On The Tightrope – Analysis	By Haruka Satake Donald Trump’s 2024 US presidential election victory marks the beginning of a critical phase for Taiwan. As US–China tensions continue to escalate, Taiwan’s strategic importance is more pronounced than ever. With Trump’s foreign policy approach largely transactional and focused on financial leverage, Taiwan will need to navigate a shifting dynamic that could reshape its relationship with both the United States and China. Despite already spending around 2.5 per cent of its GDP on defence — comparable to NATO members like the United Kingdom at 2.5 per cent and France at approximately 2 per cent — Trump has criticised Taiwan’s defence spending as insufficient given the growing threat from China. During his first term, Trump pushed Taipei to strengthen its defence capabilities and expanded arms sales to Taiwan, including advanced fighter jets and missile systems. In 2021 alone, the United States approved a US$750 million arms sale to Taiwan, signalling continued defence support. A second Trump presidency could bring greater pressure on Taiwan to increase defence spending or purchase even more advanced military systems from the United States. Trump’s transactional approach would likely mean that Taiwan’s support and willingness to invest more in its defence will be critical to maintaining strong US–Taiwan relations. Taiwan’s multibillion dollar purchase of US arms can be seen as a strategic partnership as well as a financial transaction that benefits the US defence industry. Trump’s accusations of the Taiwanese semiconductor industry ‘stealing’ US jobs and his calls for Taipei to further hike military spending suggests that US support may come at a higher price this time. Some analysts remain positive, arguing that Taiwan could align with Trump’s transactional worldview by using its financial capabilities to increase US diplomatic support. But others have warned that Trump’s election signals a dangerous future for Taiwan, including concerns that Trump’s dismissive remarks about Taiwan may reflect his true stance. Plus, key US officials who supported Taiwan have left Trump’s administration. These warnings underscore the increasing uncertainty surrounding Taiwan’s position under a second Trump presidency. Proactive measures are crucial to navigating these challenges. Taiwan must prepare for potential shifts in Trump’s policies, which could significantly impact industries across the region. Companies should anticipate scenarios where tariffs rise by up to 10 per cent and estimate the corresponding costs to their operations. Given these measures will likely be shaped through negotiations with trade partners, it is essential for industries to develop flexible contingency plans to mitigate potential disruptions effectively. Taiwan could also prioritise relationships with key pro-Taiwan figures within the Trump administration, such as incoming secretary of state Marco Rubio and national security advisor Michael Waltz, who have supported Taiwan’s interests and could play a crucial role in shaping US policy towards Taiwan. Trump’s economic policies, particularly his stance towards China, will also play a pivotal role in shaping future US–Taiwan relations. After Trump’s victory, the Taiwanese government expressed its desire for the United States to continue its current policy of deterring China while maintaining friendly relations with Taiwan. But if Trump reduces US trade dependence on China through tariffs, the United States could increase pressure on Taiwan to counter China militarily and economically. If this were to happen, Taiwan would be forced to strengthen its economic ties with the United States and lessen its dependence on China. Taiwan’s central bank warned such a change in US economic policy may directly impact the momentum of Taiwan’s export growth and deter domestic investment, which could have a negative impact on economic growth. Taiwan’s dominance in the semiconductor industry could also be a source of friction with Trump. Taiwan should carefully navigate this delicate balance between the United States and China and avoid a situation where it is forced to take sides economically or politically in a way that harms its long-term stability. This economic unpredictability ties directly into Trump’s broader diplomatic approach, complicating other countries’ ability to anticipate his policy moves. While his confrontational stance on China — particularly regarding trade and security — has been clear, his overall strategy has been difficult to predict. Already navigating a complex geopolitical environment, Taiwan should prepare for potential volatility in US economic and diplomatic actions. The uncertainty surrounding Trump’s decision-making forces Taiwan to adapt continually to changing US policies in both economic and security spheres. Taiwan should push for policies that strengthen its economic resilience by diversifying trade relationships, reducing reliance on the United States and China and ensuring strong defence capabilities to counter potential threats. Doing so would help Taiwan better navigate US foreign policy volatility while maintaining its economic stability and sovereignty. The second Trump administration will profoundly affect Taiwan and the region. Trump’s transactional foreign policy will likely demand increased financial contributions in military purchases, pressuring Taiwan to invest more in its own defence while supporting the US defence industry. Taiwan must navigate these pressures carefully, balancing economic stability with military deterrence within the complex US–China–Taiwan triangle.

Power Play At APEC – OpEd	By Ambassador Gurjit Singh The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, held from 13-15 November, returned to Peru after eight years. Given that APEC has 21 member economies, Peru has hosted the summit frequently: in 2008, 2016 and now in 2024. The theme was ‘Empower. Include. Grow.’ It’s an essential call for a region with stalled economic integration, growing protectionism, geo-political tensions and restricted growth prospects. The APEC Leaders endorsed the consensus Machu Picchu Declaration,[1] pursuing efforts to achieve robust economic growth. The Lima Roadmap to Promote the Transition to the Formal and Global Economies (2025-2040) and Ichma Statement on A New Look at the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific Agenda, were adopted alongside. The Declaration had a companion Chair’s Statement, manifesting discussion on the Ukraine and other crises. Just Energy Transition Initiative, Achieving Food Security Through Sustainable Agri-food Systems, Agricultural Biotechnology, Combatting Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing and illegal logging and facilitation of remanufactured consumer electronic goods, were among the ideas agreed upon. Will this word salad of resolutions have meaningful implementation or impact? It’s not clear it will. However, some dimensions of the meeting deserve attention. First, with this summit, Peru has brought itself into the international limelight. Contiguity and advance planning with Brazil, which hosted the G20 summit on November 18-19 immediately following APEC, meant that nine G20 leaders could attend both. With the number of global summits growing, their proximity to each other in location and dates helps maximize attendance. Second, Peru attracted many leaders. Most eyes were on Xi Jinping of China, who came ready to cut the ribbon on his $3.6 billion investment in the Chancay Port, on the Pacific coast of Peru. This is one of China’s largest investments in Latin America and is causing concern in the U.S., which does not like seeing China getting too deep in the Pacific. But Peru then facilitated China by announcing that Beijing would host the 2026 APEC summit. Unlike the G20, APEC Summits hosts aren’t selected by rotation but rather, countries seek a convenient year. China last hosted in 2014, and, it seems, has bypassed processes thanks to Peru, to be 2026’s APEC president. For its part, this seems to be Peru’s way of signalling its growing proximity to Beijing. The two other APEC presidents, however, are fixed and selected according to APEC norms: Korea will host the Summit in 2025 and Vietnam in 2027. China certainly pressed home its colligation and influence over Peru. It demanded restricted Taiwanese representation unless it was by an individual they could approve of. Taiwan, one of the 21 member economies of APEC, has, like its peers, normally selected its own special envoy. This time, it was former Vice President Chen Chien-jen, known as a public health expert. Alas, he fell afoul of an assertive Beijing which saw him as too close to the ruling party’s sovereign agenda. Ultimately, Taiwan was represented by senior presidential adviser Lin Hsin-i.[2] The U.S. President participated, but Joe Biden is now at the end of his tenure[3], and the other leaders were keen to understand the next administration led by Donald Trump. That will take time for APEC economies to understand. Russia was represented by Deputy PM Alexey Overchuk, as President Vladimir Putin did not travel to Brazil for the G20 either.[4] There were many new faces at the summit, thanks to the multiple elections which took place around the world in 2024. Among the APEC members, there were new leaders from Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and Thailand. APEC has had its share of churn over the last year. An APEC membership expansion moratorium has been in place since 1998. Initially set till 2008, this was extended indefinitely in 2010. Hence, unlike SCO and BRICS which have expanded over the last two years, APEC is not discussing new members, although India, Cambodia, Colombia, Macau, (China), Costa Rica, Mongolia, Pakistan, Panama, Sri Lanka, and Ecuador have evinced interest from time to time.[5] An equally important event that was held alongside the summit and its preceding ministerial segment was the APEC CEO Forum Expectedly, it had a large Chinese contingent, displaying openly their interest in the Latin America region. The discussions at the CEO Summit, however, were all about the return of Trump, and this impacted the discourse on how trade relations would develop in the months ahead. Xi Jinping warned against protectionism, since he is evidently preparing for a further tariff war by the U.S. Artificial Intelligence, now ubiquitous in all global discussions, was a recurring theme during the CEO Summit, as it is expected to alter the nature of many industries and requires adjustment to ensure that labour markets are not negatively impacted. The number of Chinese businessmen dealing with AI who attended seeking opportunities understand well how other economies are dealing with it; their knowledge was impressive. Financial inclusion was prioritized, particularly by those from emerging markets, like Vietnam. APEC’s significance now lies in its comprehensive strategy for regional recovery and resilience across sectors. In the wake of post-pandemic problems, APEC has enhanced its economic coordination, and its members have implemented fiscal assistance ranging from 1% to 20% of their GDP to stabilize domestic health systems and facilitate the uninterrupted supply of necessary products. This collaborative structure is perceived to foster a layer of enduring economic recovery. Digital transformation is integral to APEC’s agenda, particularly within creative sectors that generate $2.2 trillion globally. APEC advocates digital competencies and infrastructure to empower smaller countries, positioning creative sectors as catalysts for innovation and inclusive development. APEC’s activities on climate resilience and food security highlight its current significance – given that 22% of the South American continent is forest[6], and it accounts for a quarter of global agricultural and fisheries exports.[7] APEC plans to issue climate bonds and regional carbon networks,[8] and has introduced new food security measures to safeguard key supply lines during unforeseen global disruptions.[9] Collectively, these initiatives provide APEC an essential forum for addressing pressing economic, social and environmental issues and remain relevant.[10] [11] Can APEC be that model of collaborative governance and promote long-term prosperity and balanced development in the region? The follow-up to the Peru resolutions over the next year will show whether it can. Meanwhile, distractions abound, most particularly the new rivalry between China and the U.S. before APEC meets again in Korea in 2025.

Cryptocurrency Making Inroads In Central Asia And Caucasus	(Eurasianet) -- Cryptocurrency ownership is gaining popularity across Central Asia and the Caucasus, according to a report prepared by a group of financial services companies. Uzbekistan has the highest adoption rate for crypto assets in the regions and ranks 33rd globally. The Russian-language report, titled Digital Assets in Central Asia and the Caucasus, shows that almost 1.5 percent of Uzbekistan’s population, or roughly 512,000 individuals, owns cryptocurrency. The 15 licensed cryptocurrency exchanges and outlets operating in Uzbekistan handled over $1 billion worth of transactions in 2024, the report adds. Just two years ago, Uzbekistan ranked 87th in global crypto adoption. In 2023, the country shot up to 25th in the world rankings before falling back to 33rd this year. Despite slipping, Uzbekistan still outpaces its Central Asian neighbors when it comes to crypto asset adoption. Kazakhstan ranked 57th in the world and Kyrgyzstan 76th, according to the report. Tajikistan and Turkmenistan were not ranked. Kazakhstan’s ranking might be much higher, if not for a far-reaching government regulatory initiative covering cryptocurrency production and usage. No official data on crypto assets is available for Kazakhstan, but some independent estimates indicate 8 percent of the population may hold cryptocurrency. In 2021, Kazakhstan emerged as a leading center for cryptocurrency mining following a crackdown in China on the practice, which requires immense amounts of electricity. By the fall of that year, Kazakhstan’s global Bitcoin hashrate, an indicator of the amount of power being used to produce cryptocurrency, was over 27 percent. During the same period, the country experienced power outages as the electricity grid buckled under the rising demand. The Kazakh government in following years introduced measures to hinder crypto mining, including the introduction of steep tariffs for intensive power usage. As a result, the country’s Bitcoin hashrate fell to 4 percent in May 2023. The number of mining operations in Kazakhstan likewise plummeted between 2021 and mid-2023, going from 330 to 26. But over the past 15 months, the number of mining outfits have risen to 51, the report states. At the same time the government took steps to hinder mining, it introduced regulatory changes to enable officials to better monitor crypto transactions. In late 2023, Kazakhstan also introduced a digital currency under Central Bank supervision that is designed to compete with cryptocurrencies. In the Caucasus, Georgia has the highest global ranking in crypto asset adoption, coming in at 54th. That position, however, is 17 spots lower than Tbilisi’s ranking in 2022. Armenia was 77th and Azerbaijan came in at 92nd, according to the report, which was sponsored by a variety of financial services entities, including Mastercard, KPMG and the National Payment Corporation of Kazakhstan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQek8QUuQCeZiyG	2024-12-03T16:32:55-08:00	
Libya Energy Profile: Despite Large Oil Reserves, Political Confl...	Libya was the seventh-largest crude oil producer in OPEC and the third-largest total petroleum liquids producer in Africa, after Nigeria and Algeria, in 2023.1 At the beginning of 2024, Libya held 3% of the world's proved oil reserves and 41% of Africa’s proved oil reserves.2 Despite Libya’s large oil reserves, political conflicts and militia attacks on hydrocarbon infrastructure have limited investments in the country’s oil and natural gas sectors. These challenges have also constrained exploration and development of its reserves since 2011. Although Libya is a member of OPEC, it is exempt from the production cuts under the OPEC+ agreement.3 Crude oil production is very volatile and is frequently shut in because of conflicts, labor disputes, budget constraints, ongoing maintenance issues, and insufficient storage capacity. Political instability that began with Libya’s civil war in 2011 continues to pose risks for the energy sector.4 The two government factions, the Government of National Accord (GNA) in the western region and the Libyan National Army (LNA) in the eastern region, and other local militias used oil exports as leverage, and their fighting caused massive disruptions to Libya’s oil production between 2014 and 2020. The GNA and the LNA signed a ceasefire agreement in October 2020 and formed an interim unity government, the Government of National Unity (GNU), in March 2021.5,6 The GNU scheduled presidential and parliamentary elections for late December 2021. However, the various parties could not agree on election laws and candidates, leading to the GNU indefinitely postponing the elections. The United Nations has been working with factions in Libya for almost three years to reach an agreement on constitutional laws and procedures regarding the election process, but the political impasse has impeded elections moving forward.7 In March 2022, Libya’s parliament in the eastern region installed a new interim government and prime minister, Fathi Bashagha, in Tripoli, but the previous prime minister of the GNU, Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, did not step down, resulting in the continuation of a divided government. Although Bashagha attempted to replace al-Dbeibah in Tripoli in July 2022, he was unsuccessful.8 Al-Dbeibah and the eastern military leader Khalifa Haftar struck a deal in July 2022, which involved replacing the head of the national oil company, the eastern government no longer pushing for Bashagha to become the interim prime minister, and eastern factions ending a blockade on oil infrastructure.9 The most recent conflict, which began in 2024, involves a conflict between the eastern and western governments over leadership of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL). The GNU replaced the CBL’s long-time governor, Sadiq al-Kabir, in August 2024 after he attempted to put more fiscal restrictions on spending by the GNU. In response, the eastern government imposed blockades on oil fields and eastern ports.10 However, the eastern government allowed a limited amount of oil cargoes to leave certain ports and oil production to go to refineries.11 The two governments negotiated an agreement that installed an interim governor of the CBL at the end of September 2024.12 Crude oil and natural gas export revenues are a significant part of Libya’s economy, accounting for an estimated 97% of Libya’s total government revenues and an estimated 93% of the country’s total value of exports in 2023.13 We estimate that Libya’s net oil export revenues totaled $30 billion in 2023, similar to 2022 totals. Although Libya’s oil exports rose in 2023, oil prices decreased from 2022.14 Fossil fuels met nearly all of Libya’s energy demand, with oil accounting for 57% and natural gas accouting for almost 43% in 2022. Rooftop solar projects met less than 1% of the remaining energy demand.15 Petroleum and other liquids At the beginning of 2024, Libya held Africa’s largest proved oil reserves, at 48 billion barrels, representing 41% of the continent’s total reserves. Libya ranked in the top 10 countries for global proved oil reserves.16 About 95% of Libya’s recoverable reserves are located in the onshore Sirte Basin in the northeast and Murzuq Basin in the southwest. These two basins also account for most of the country’s oil production capacity.17 Most of Libya remains unexplored for oil, and ongoing civil unrest has prevented a large-scale exploration program.18 Libya produces mostly high-quality light, sweet (low sulfur) crude oil grades, which can be processed into valuable petroleum products in simple refineries.19 After Libya’s crude oil production (excluding condensates) reached around 1.7 million barrels per day (b/d) prior to the start of the 2011 civil war, political dissention over the following decade caused a steep production decline and several major disruptions to production and exports. Libya’s production could return to pre-2011 averages if the various political factions could form a unified and stable government, attract foreign investment for exploration and development projects, and provide sufficient revenue to strengthen the country’s aging oil infrastructure.20 Following the ceasefire agreement signed by the eastern and western governments in October 2020, Libya’s crude oil production recovered to more than 1.1 million b/d by 2021.21 In 2022, crude oil production again dipped, to below 700,000 b/d from May through July, because of a dispute, later resolved, between the two rival governments that resulted in blockades of eastern ports. Despite Libya experiencing stable oil production for nearly two years, crude oil production was severely disrupted in August 2024. The large Sharara oil field in the country’s southwestern region went offline in early August, except for its output that serves oil-fired electricity production and the Zawiya refinery on the western coast.22 Disputing the Spanish government over a charge made against one of General Haftar’s sons, the Haftar family decided to close the Sharara field, which is partially operated by Spanish oil company Repsol.23 The second disruption, primarily in the eastern oil fields, occurred in late August 2024 after the western government replaced the Central Bank of Libya’s leadership. The dispute led to the eastern government closing or reducing production from most of Libya’s oil fields and disrupting export flows from the eastern ports.24 Crude oil production fell to below 600,000 b/d by the end of August and during September 2024.25 After the two sides came to an agreement on leadership at the CBL and the national oil company (NOC) lifted the force majeure at Libya’s oil fields and ports, production began to rise in early October 2024.26 Libya’s natural gas fields produce condensates and natural gas plant liquids (NGPL) and contribute relatively small volumes to the country’s total petroleum and other liquids production. We estimate that condensate and NGPL production was less than 100,000 b/d in 2023.27 Libya’s NOC intends to bolster crude oil and condensate production to more than 1.5 million b/d by the end of 2024 and 2.0 million b/d by 2025.28To reach this target, the NOC’s plans include increasing oil production through developing new projects, rehabilitating fields that were damaged during the conflicts of the past decade, and increasing power supply to the fields. To increase its production and offset current declines from older fields, Libya needs to attract more foreign investment and technical capacity. The NOC and international companies announced several projects, most from the Waha oil concessions, over the past few years, although many of these projects have faced delays because of the complications from Libya’s political conflicts.29 Despite the numerous challenges to maintaining oil production, the NOC kept oil production stable in 2023 and through July 2024 by starting production from new wells or rehabilitating existing wells across the country.30 After declining to just below 200,000 b/d in 2020, Libya’s petroleum and other liquids consumption increased each year since then and reached 235,000 b/d in 2023.31 We estimate that the shares of gasoline (47%), diesel (32%), and fuel oil (8%) accounted for most of Libya’s petroleum consumption in 2022.32 Most of the domestically consumed crude oil is processed in Libya’s refineries, and less than 20,000 b/d of crude oil directly fuels power plants.33Libya has five refineries with a combined nameplate crude oil distillation capacity of 380,000 b/d.34 However, the country produced around 130,000 b/d of petroleum products, about one-third of total nameplate capacity.35 The low plant utilization is the result of damage that occurred to some facilities during the civil war and the slow progress made to rehabilitate all of the plants.36 Ras Lanuf, Libya’s largest refinery by nameplate capacity, was significantly damaged after the 2011 civil war and has been offline since 2013. A legal dispute over the damages between the joint venture (JV) owners, the NOC and Trasta (an Emirati-owned company) was finally settled in February 2022. The arbitration ruled that the NOC did not owe any damage compensation to Trasta and could buy Trasta’s 50% share in the JV. Although this agreement is a significant step toward bringing the Ras Lanuf refinery back online, negotiations regarding the sale of Trasta’s stake in the JV are ongoing, and the NOC would need to rehabilitate the refinery to bring it back into operation.37 The NOC is planning to build a 30,000-b/d refinery in southwestern Libya near the Sharara oil field. Despite the facility’s small size, it would be the first refinery to serve southern Libya. This region is far from the energy demand centers along the coast, and it relies on petroleum products transported a long distance by truck from the western coast. Construction has not begun, but the NOC estimates that the facility will be completed in about three years from the time that construction begins. The NOC signed an engineering contract with Honeywell International, Inc., in 2023. NOC subsidiary, Zallaf Company, reported in mid-2024 that the project is proceeding.38 Natural gas At the beginning of 2024, Libya had proved natural gas reserves of 53 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), the fifth largest in Africa behind Nigeria, Algeria, Mozambique, and Egypt.46 Non-associated gas, which accounted for more than 90% of Libya's natural gas production over the past decade, is from the offshore Bahr Essalam fields northwest of Tripoli and the onshore Wafa field in the western Ghadames Basin straddling Algeria.47 Most of Libya's natural gas associated with crude oil fields is in the onshore Sirte Basin in the eastern region. Libya’s dry natural gas production fell from 423 billion cubic feet (Bcf) in 2022 to 394 Bcf in 2023.48 Output has declined from a high in 2017 because the volatile security situation and unfavorable regulatory environment have deterred upstream investment by international oil companies. Also, associated gas fields have been offline for significant periods of time when the accompanying oil fields are shut in. Because the NOC expects production from major natural gas fields Bahr Essalam and Wafa to decline starting in 2025, Libya will face domestic natural gas shortages if it cannot secure foreign investment to develop its proposed projects. Libya plans to increase natural gas production by reducing flaring and developing new fields to help meet growing domestic demand and export obligations. However, Libya’s current political stalemate and budget constraints are major downside risks to reaching these goals. Oil and natural gas projects in Libya are typically delayed for several years because of security, regulatory, and financial challenges.49 The NOC plans to offset expected declines from mature fields and increase natural gas production from both offshore and onshore fields in western Libya. Italy’s Eni and Libya’s NOC are developing a major offshore project to tie back to the Mellitah natural gas processing complex, Structures A & E. The project, which is slated to add 277 Bcf/y, is expected to begin production in 2027.50 The NOC has proposed several other natural gas development projects, notably Atshan in the southwestern region, two projects in the Hamada Basin region, and the offshore Bouri Gas Utilization project; some of these projects are in early stages of development. Libya’s natural gas consumption totaled 305 Bcf in 2023 and accounted for more than 70% of domestic production after 2020.51 The electric power sector drives Libya’s domestic natural gas demand, accounting for about 85% of Libya’s domestic natural gas use in 2022. The country’s major industries and its oil sector consume the remainder.52 Libya’s natural gas production is not able to fully meet domestic natural gas demand and export commitments, and the electric power sector often burns petroleum products when the natural gas supply is disrupted or is insufficient during the peak summer season.53 Libya ranked as the seventh-highest natural gas flaring country in 2023, when it vented or flared approximately 240 Bcf in 2023, up from 191 Bcf in 2022 and the highest in a decade. Flaring increased because Libya’s associated gas production rose in tandem with crude oil production during 2023.54 Libya lacks sufficient natural gas infrastructure, particularly processing plants, to capture natural gas from fields associated with oil production and to transport it to demand centers or power plants. Libya plans to eliminate natural gas flaring by 2030. Libya’s NOC is in discussions with international oil companies to reduce flaring, increase the production of marketed natural gas, and free up more oil for export.55 Energy Trade Petroleum and other liquids Libya exported an estimated 1 million b/d of crude oil and condensates in 2023, up from 930,000 b/d in 2022. The oil supply disruption to many of the eastern fields in Libya in the summer of 2022 affected that year’s export levels, which declined from nearly 1.2 million b/d in 2021.74 Most of Libya’s crude oil is sold to European countries. In 2023, Europe’s imports accounted for about 78% of Libya’s crude oil and condensate exports. Most of Libya’s exports went to Italy, Germany, and Spain. Asia, mostly China, received an estimated 10% of Libya’s oil exports in 2023. Libya sent a greater share of its crude oil and condensates to Europe in 2023 (78%, up from 72% in 2022) because Russia shifted more of its crude oil away from Europe to Asia and because China purchased more of Iran’s crude oil. According to trade data, Libya is a net importer of petroleum products as a result of its low operational refining capacity. Petroleum product imports rose in 2023 to nearly 200,000 b/d from less than 150,000 b/d in 2021 as a result of higher oil demand.75 Libya highly subsidizes its oil products to customers, which drives up oil demand. These subsidies also distort market prices and is one of the causes for significant levels of fuel smuggling.76Libya imports primarily gasoline and diesel fuel, and it exports mostly naphtha. In 2023, Russia captured a larger share (29%, up from 5% in 2022) of Libya’s oil product import market after Europe and the G7 countries instituted a price cap on Russia’s petroleum product sales in early 2023.77 Natural gas The Greenstream natural gas pipeline connects Mellitah on Libya’s northwestern coast to Gela, Italy, and became the only outlet of natural gas exports after armed conflict from the civil war destroyed the country’s sole liquefaction terminal in 2011. Libya’s natural gas exports reached around 200 Bcf in 2019, the most recent high, but fell by more than half to 89 Bcf in 2023, well below the pipeline’s capacity of 283 Bcf/y.78 Libya’s reduced natural gas production and higher domestic demand have hindered exports during the past few years. Also, Libya’s large Mellitah natural gas processing plant, which processes most of Libya’s natural gas, has gone offline for maintenance, technical, or political issues several times during the past few years, limiting export levels.79 Electricity Libya, which has electricity interconnections with Tunisia and Egypt, began to import significantly more electric power from these neighboring countries after 2015. Libya’s electricity imports reached more than 0.8 TWh in 2022.80 Egypt plans to expand its interconnection capacity to Libya from 150 MW to 2 GW, but as of September 2024, the expansion date is unknown.81 Source: This article was published by the EIA Endnotes: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Short-Term Energy Outlook, August 2024.

Bangladesh-India Relations Could Deteriorate Further – Analysis	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury Disintegrating relations between Dhaka and New Delhi could grow even worse as India’s government mobilizes political support for ex-Bangladesh leader Sheikh Hasina, who fled to the neighboring country in August, and her deposed party, analysts warned. They said Narendra Modi’s government likely wouldn’t deal with the interim administration headed by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, nor any of Dhaka’s political parties, because of previous anti-Indian politics and worries about instability in India’s northeastern states. Those are separated from the mainland by Bangladesh territory. 'The way the bilateral relationship deteriorated over the last three months indicates that Bangladesh-India relations are unlikely to improve. It seems that in the coming days, the relations will worsen further,' Nizam Uddin Ahmed, a political commentator and retired professor at Bangladesh’s Chattogram University, told BenarNews on Tuesday. Bilateral ties chilled after Hasina’s resignation and the collapse of her Awami League administration in early August, amid massive anti-government protests by university students. New Delhi has been a longtime ally of Hasina and backed an independence movement led by her father in 1971, when Bangladesh – then known as East Pakistan – broke free of Islamabad rule. The climate between the two countries has become especially heated in recent days. On Monday, Hindu protesters in northeastern India broke into a Bangladeshi consulate. On Tuesday, the Bangladesh government summoned the Indian ambassador to lodge a protest over that attack. Indian media and news reports said the protesters in Tripura state were agitating against last week’s arrest in Bangladesh of a Hindu leader from that country, Chinmoy Krishna Das. India is likely to keep supporting a movement led by Chinmoy, a Hindu monk. His movement has sought protection for Hindus, who are a religious minority in Bangladesh, following the fall of the Awami League government. 'All political parties of India are united on the issue of Bangladesh after Hasina fled to India. Hasina’s Awami League [AL] government had given everything India asked for to ensure New Delhi’s economic and strategic interests. But now, the interim government and the incoming government would maintain a total opposite role,' Ahmed said. Chinmoy was detained on Nov. 26 for allegedly desecrating the Bangladesh flag. A bail hearing on Tuesday was postponed until early January. Two days after the monk was jailed, Hindu protesters assembled in front of the Bangladesh deputy high commission in Kolkata, burned the Bangladeshi flag and effigies of Yunus and chanted anti-Dhaka slogans. India will support the Hindu movement to put political and diplomatic pressure on Bangladesh, according to Ahmed. 'The present largest party, BNP, and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami have not maintained a minimum friendly ties with India,' he said, using an abbreviation for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The analyst predicted that Indian officials would try to rehabilitate the Awami League. 'India is our biggest neighbor and the second largest trading partner. We are dependent on them economically. They should have maintained good political relations with India for the benefit of Bangladesh,' Ahmed said. Security concerns Another analyst, Imtiaz Ahmed, a retired professor of international relations at the University of Dhaka, said New Delhi would not want the parties that have pushed for anti-India politics to come to power in Bangladesh because of security concerns over its eight landlocked northeastern states. During her 15 years in power, Hasina’s government oversaw efforts to quell anti-Indian rebel groups linked to Bangladesh in those states. 'The anti-Indian politics in Bangladesh and the anti-Bangladesh policy will harm both the countries – socially, politically and economically. It should stop immediately for greater sake,' Imtiaz Ahmed said. 'The ruling BJP may try to keep the issue of Hindu repression in Bangladesh alive,' he said, referring to India’s Bharatiya Janata Party. 'Similarly, the Islamic faith-based parties in Bangladesh will foment anti-Indian sentiment for their political gains while the liberal and secular political parties may suffer,' he said. 'Given the situation, Bangladesh-India bilateral relations are unlikely to improve shortly unless we see a thaw. Ongoing issues Meanwhile, in the wake of the attack on the Bangladeshi diplomatic outpost in Agartala, Tripura, officials announced that all visa and consular services there had been suspended until further notice. Also on Monday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee asked the Indian government to request that U.N. peacekeepers be deployed to protect religious minorities across the state border in Bangladesh, sparking further debate. Earlier on, students at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) had painted Indian flags on walkways in Dhaka to show disrespect for India. Shafiqul Alam, Yunus’ press secretary, told BenarNews that Bangladesh wanted friendly relations with India, noting the nations share a border of over 4,000 km (2,484 miles). 'We have close historical, cultural and linguistic links with India. We want very friendly relations with India. But the relations must be based on equity, fairness and dignity,' he said. 'We hope that India as a friendly and responsible neighbor will extend support to improve the bilateral relations in line with the expectation of the people.' Smruti Pattanaik, a research fellow at MP-IDSA, a think-tank in New Delhi, expressed concern about the effect of the Agartala attack on relations between the neighbors. 'But we should not take into account the stuff circulated [via] social media. Yes, there are some problems. But I think these will go away after some days and relations will normalize,' she told BenarNews. 'It must normalize. 'Our leaders should sit, find ways to fix the problems in the bilateral relations. We need to go forward,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQek40eumd5xfMx	2024-12-03T16:29:47-08:00	
What’s Needed Now: A Calm Conversation About Whether World Would ...	No one should be surprised that Moscow is persecuting those who openly call for the demise of the Russian Federation, Sergey Chernyshov says; but at least equally surprising is the failure of opposition leaders and the media 'are categorically refusing to talk about the liquidation of the Russian Federation in its current form.' Such a conversation is 'extremely necessary,' the Radio Liberty analyst says; because 'if it is shown that a world without Russia in its current form would be better than the world with it, then why should we cling to this political formation?' (sibreal.org/a/kak-rasselit-barak-rossiyskaya-federatsiya-istorik-sergey-chernyshov-o-razumnom-separatizme/33219637.html). Of course, it is the case that 'a conversation about the liquidation of the Russian Federation is extremely difficult to begin, as difficult of beginning a conversation about sex in a Puritanical family.' And thus it is not surprising 'but true' that in Russian history, 'there has never been a single significant political force that has raised the issue of dividing the country.' 'Even the numerous ‘national movements’ which arose in the 19th century across the entire empire in fact raised the question not about the liquidation of a single country but about its ‘reformatting,’' Chernyshov says. And those who have wanted to do that have first wanted to seize power in the center. There is an entirely understandable reason for that: 'outdated countries have been effectively liquidated only in one case when this has happened at the behest of the supreme central power which has then acted decisively and effectively in this field,' the historian continues. 'The British empire was liquidated in the British parliament in London and not in the jungles of Africa,' Chernyshov points out; and 'the USSR fell apart not because three nationalist politicians assembled in Beloveshchaya and signed something there but because a fourth politician in Moscow agreed with them.' That needs to be recognized as must be recognized something else, he argues: until that condition is met, the population will overwhelmingly talk about reforming the country of which they are a part rather than seeking to go their own way. The latter option is almost always the choice of local elites with their own calculations. Such elites will succeed initially if they have an ally in Moscow, but they will succeed over time only if they are able to give their peoples a better life, one that others will envy. If the first doesn’t arise, dissolution is unlikely; if the second doesn’t happen, there will always be those who will want to restore the past, Chernyshov concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQek4uDkM6vvIW0	2024-12-03T16:27:26-08:00	
Second Fall Of Aleppo Marks New Phase In Syrian Civil War – Analy...	By Paulo Aguiar The swift capture of Aleppo by rebel forces, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), marks a pivotal turning point in the Syrian civil war. This development not only highlights the fragility of Bashar al-Assad’s regime but also underscores how regional and broader international dynamics are reshaping the conflict. The city, which symbolized the Assad regime’s resurgence after its recapture in 2016, is once again at the center of Syria’s shifting battlefield. The rebels’ lightning advance reflects deeper geopolitical currents. The Ukraine war has taken a toll on Russia, Assad’s most powerful ally, while Iran and Hezbollah are grappling with the fallout from Israel’s military campaigns. Meanwhile, Turkey has leveraged the situation to expand its influence in northern Syria by utilizing HTS as a proxy force. These overlapping dynamics have given rise to a volatile environment, making Aleppo’s fall a critical turning point. HTS: From Insurgent Group to Major Player Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) has evolved significantly since its origins as an offshoot of al Qaeda in Syria. After splitting from its parent organization and consolidating power in Idlib, HTS has established itself as the dominant force in Syria’s northwestern rebel-held areas. Operating under Turkish protection, the group has transformed Idlib into a de facto Islamist state, with functioning governance structures, military discipline, and strategic autonomy. This transformation has made HTS a potent actor on Syria’s battlefield. Its leadership has sought to distance itself from the group’s jihadist roots, projecting an image of pragmatism and moderation, at least compared to other Islamist factions. This strategy has helped HTS consolidate power and attract Turkish support, even as it remains classified as a terrorist organization by the United States. The Aleppo offensive showcases HTS’s growth into a cohesive and capable military force. The group’s fighters demonstrated effective coordination, utilizing modern tactics and weaponry, including drone warfare—a hallmark of contemporary conflicts, starting with the Ukraine war. The rapid pace of the advance, which cut through Assad’s forces in a matter of days, underscores HTS’s enhanced capacity and strategic planning. Turkey’s Strategic Calculations Turkey’s role in the Aleppo offensive is complex and multifaceted. While Ankara has not explicitly claimed involvement, its influence is unmistakable. Turkish-backed Sunni militias fought alongside HTS in the offensive, and the timing of the attack—amid regional distractions—suggests coordination with Turkey’s strategic goals. Turkey’s interests in northern Syria are twofold. First, Ankara seeks to establish a safe zone along its border to manage the ongoing refugee crisis. The flow of millions of Syrians into Turkey over the years has strained its economy and fueled domestic political tensions. By securing areas like Aleppo through proxies such as HTS, Turkey can create conditions for some refugees to return. Second, Turkey aims to weaken Assad’s grip on northern Syria, expanding its sphere of influence while underminingKurdish autonomy in the northeast. Allowing HTS to govern captured areas offers Turkey a means to extend control without directly administering the territory, a move that reduces costs and avoids direct confrontation with global powers. However, Turkey’s support for HTS is not without risks. While Ankara benefits from the group’s military success, its association with HTS complicates Turkey’s relationships with Western allies and may heighten tensions with Israel due to the perception of supporting a group with extremist and anti-Israel tendencies. Assad’s Weakening Regime For Assad, the fall of Aleppo is a devastating blow that exposes the deepening fragility of his regime. Once hailed as a leader who had weathered the storm of civil war, Assad now faces mounting challenges, notably economic collapse; fragmentation of state power, where authority is now exercised via third-parties like militias and local power brokers; and a weakening of external allies like Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah. Assad’s inability to defend Aleppo underscores how dependent his regime remains on external support. Without Russia’s air power or Hezbollah’s ground forces, his military is largely incapable of holding major urban centers, let alone launching counteroffensives. The loss of Aleppo also disrupts Assad’s broader strategy of projecting stability to attract international recognition and economic relief. The Waning Reach of Russia Russia’s intervention in 2015 marked a turning point in the Syrian civil war, allowing the Assad regime to recapture key territories and gradually consolidate power. However, Moscow’s focus has shifted dramatically since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The ongoing conflict there has drained Russia’s resources, including its air force, which was instrumental in previous Syrian campaigns. The strain on Russia’s military capabilities, coupled with heavy losses in Ukraine, has left Moscow unable to provide the same level of support to Assad. In the Aleppo offensive, Russian airstrikes were limited and ineffective, reflecting Moscow’s reduced capacity. With Russia prioritizing its interests in Ukraine and safeguarding its Mediterranean bases in Syria, Assad is increasingly left to fend for himself. The Iran-Hezbollah Axis Under Pressure Iran and Hezbollah, once Assad’s most reliable allies, are also grappling with significant challenges: Iran is facing a relentless Israeli air campaign targeting its proxies in Syria and Lebanon. These strikes have weakened Tehran’s ability to project power and support Assad effectively. Hezbollah, instrumental in the 2016 battle for Aleppo, is reeling from its confrontation with Israel. The militia has suffered heavy casualties, including the loss of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and lacks the capacity to redeploy significant forces to Syria. With both Iran and Hezbollah preoccupied and weakened, Assad’s reliance on this alliance is becoming increasingly untenable. The (Second) Fall of Aleppo: A Geopolitical Gamechanger? The complete rebel victory in Aleppo has far-reaching consequences. For one, it boosts Turkey’s regional influence. By backing HTS and extending its reach into northern Syria, Ankara is solidifying its position as a key power broker. This development could reshape the balance of power in Syria and complicate efforts to negotiate a lasting peace. It also represents a strategic opportunity for Israel. The collapse of the Assad-Iran-Hezbollah axis in Aleppo could divert resources and attention away from Israel, allowing it to sustain pressure on Gaza and other fronts as needed. It goes without saying that the fall of Aleppo is a disaster for the Assad regime, which faces the prospect of losing more territory and even shrinking into a statelet of Damascus and its surrounding areas, further solidifying the fragmentation of Syria. The fall of Aleppo is not just a military setback for Assad; it signals the beginning of a new phase in the Syrian civil war. The collapse of regime frontlines that were painstakingly secured by Russia and Iran exposes the vulnerabilities of Assad’s government and raises questions about the future of the conflict. As HTS consolidates its gains and Turkey maneuvers for greater control, the coming months will determine whether Assad can regroup or if his regime will continue to unravel. What’s clear is that the Syrian civil war, far from being frozen, is once again shifting in ways that could have profound consequences for the region.

Deepening The Franco-Saudi Partnership – OpEd	By Khattar Abou Diab The French flag is fluttering alongside the Saudi flag in Riyadh during French President Emmanuel Macron’s ongoing three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia. As the highest level of diplomatic engagement, this visit reflects the strong ties between the two nations and the close rapport between Macron and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.By visiting a nation in the midst of significant change and which is a key player in a volatile region, the French president seeks to solidify France’s influence in an area critical to addressing global challenges.Through a series of meetings with the crown prince, Macron aims to build on his prior experience with the Kingdom, including its pivotal role in brokering a ceasefire in Lebanon, to deepen trust between the two nations and address the pressing crises affecting the region. Against the backdrop of global instability, and just weeks ahead of the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency, this visit also provides an opportunity to shape the vision for a unique, multifaceted partnership between Riyadh and Paris.Sources within the French presidency have described Macron’s third visit to Saudi Arabia since taking office at the Elysee Palace as 'exceptional,' highlighting its unique context and critical themes. This return to one of France’s historic allies comes at a time of significant local transformation since his brief second visit in 2021 and amid heightened regional instability following the events of Oct. 7, 2023.The goal of revitalizing Franco-Saudi strategic relations is to lay the foundation for 'a shared and renewed ambition' over the next decade, guided by a joint action plan aligned with the objectives of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, according to the Elysee. Under the leadership of the crown prince, this vision is steering Saudi Arabia toward economic transformation and increased openness. France aims to leverage this opportunity to reaffirm its support for and active participation in this ambitious initiative.Bilateral coordination will focus on key projects and events hosted by Saudi Arabia, such as the 2030 World Expo and the 2029 Asian Winter Games, creating opportunities for both nations to collaborate and invest in these ambitious initiatives. Paris aims to solidify 'France’s position as a key and reliable partner for Saudi Arabia,' supporting the Kingdom’s vision for economic diversification as well as its cultural and tourism ambitions.It considers the pioneering development project in AlUla, in which France plays a key role, as 'an example of what the two nations can accomplish together.'For both sides, the volatile international situation and ongoing regional crises offer an opportunity to 'advance peace and security initiatives within the region and beyond, while tackling global challenges.' On the political agenda, discussions will address urgent issues such as the crises in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen and Syria, alongside broader regional tensions.On the Gaza conflict, Paris commends Riyadh’s efforts through the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, as well as its initiative to establish an international coalition for the creation of a Palestinian state and the two-state solution. Discussions will center on working with Saudi Arabia to secure a ceasefire in Gaza 'as soon as possible,' facilitate the release of hostages, protect civilians and ultimately chart a path toward a political resolution to the war. Paris also views the ceasefire in Lebanon as a potential lever to support a ceasefire in Gaza.Undoubtedly, the Lebanese crisis will be a focal point of the discussions. The focus will be on facilitating the election of a president to end the leadership vacuum and ensuring the formation of a stable government. Both nations are expected to align their efforts within the framework of the five-member committee — alongside the US, Egypt and Qatar — to address Lebanon’s ongoing constitutional crisis.France seeks to work closely with Saudi Arabia, as the Elysee sources have noted, 'to reinforce the ceasefire, provide support to the Lebanese army and focus on advancing the reconstruction process.'On a broader level, the talks between the crown prince and President Macron will focus on promoting 'regional stability.' Talks between the two leaders will focus on enhancing 'cooperation in key strategic areas,' such as defense, security, energy transition and connectivity.This trip is unlikely to yield any major arms contracts, despite the notable presence of senior defense officials in the French delegation tied to key projects such as the Rafale fighter jet, surveillance satellites and A400M military transport aircraft.The discussions will go beyond these sectors, according to an Elysee source, who noted: 'Talks will also explore future investment opportunities in areas such as fintech, cyberspace and artificial intelligence, especially with France set to host the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit next February.'Macron’s packed schedule highlights the importance of this visit at a crucial time for both partners. • Khattar Abou Diab is a French-Lebanese political scientist specializing in Islam and the Middle East, and director of the 'Conseil Géopolitique — Perspectives.'

Senator Ted Cruz Demands Probe Into European Influence On AI Poli...	(EurActiv) -- Republican Senator Ted Cruz has urged US officials to investigate whether European governments have tried to unduly influence the country’s laws around artificial intelligence (AI). The UK hosted the world’s first global AI safety summit last year, bringing tech executives, world leaders and academics together to discuss a coordinated approach on regulation. Some countries have since set up their own AI safety institutes, which have continued to share expertise across borders. Cruz, who ran against Donald Trump in the Republican Party's 2016 race for presidential nominee, is among the party's most influential senators. He has been a vocal critic of President Joe Biden's approach to tech regulation. In a letter addressed to US attorney general Merrick Garland, dated Nov. 21 but only made public on Monday, Cruz said European governments had imposed heavy-handed regulations on US AI companies abroad, and were now trying to steer the direction of AI regulations at home. Cruz described these regulations as 'onerous' and a product of the 'radical left'. 'While the Biden-Harris administration may not want to inform the American people of just how closely they are collaborating with foreign governments, at the very least, the American people have a right to know what foreign actors are trying to impose these radical regulations on American companies,' Cruz wrote. The European Union has led the global charge for regulations tailored to AI technology, having this year passed the AI Act, the world's first sweeping set of laws governing the technology. Cruz cited a memorandum of understanding the US issued alongside Britain in April, as well as a treaty signed by the Biden administration and several European governments, as examples of foreign influence over domestic AI policy. Cruz also said the Centre for the Governance of Artificial Intelligence (GovAI), a UK-based non-profit organisation which recently co-hosted a summit for AI policy experts in San Francisco, had not followed the law by failing to register as a foreign agent despite engaging in political activities. 'GovAI is aware of the request made by Sen. Cruz to the Department of Justice, and, if required, will cooperate fully with the relevant authorities,' a GovAI spokesperson said. 'GovAI is a strictly independent organisation which is committed to operating responsibly and transparently.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQekzK52OcbmNzH	2024-12-03T16:13:19-08:00	
Brazil: Economy Grows 0.9% In Third Quarter Of 2024	By Bruno de Freitas Moura The Brazilian economy grew by 0.9 percent from the second to the third quarter of the year, driven by the industry and services sectors, marking its 13th consecutive expansion. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)—the total of all goods and services produced in the country—rose by 4 percent. In the four quarters to date, Brazil's economy has grown by 3.1 percent. The data were released on Tuesday (Dec. 3) by the government´s statistics agency IBGE. At current values, GDP stands at BRL 3 trillion. By sector, services and industry grew by 0.9 and 0.6 percent, respectively, from the second to the third quarter. Agriculture was the only sector to decline, contracting by 0.9 percent. With the newly released results, GDP and the services sector have returned to record levels. However, the industry remains 4.7 percent below its peak in the third quarter of 2013. The 0.9 percent growth in the third quarter was lower than the 1.4 percent increase recorded between the first and second quarters of 2024. Employment and income Rebeca Palis, the IBGE's National Accounts coordinator, attributed the positive quarterly result to factors related to employment and income. 'We continue to see several positive effects, such as a strong labor market. Inflation is above target, but not at extremely high levels, and the government is maintaining its income transfer policy,' she says, noting that the unemployment rate has reached historically low levels. Palis suggests that the slowdown in growth from 1.4 percent in the second quarter to 0.9 percent in the third quarter is not yet the result of the increase in the basic interest rate by the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) in September, from 10.5 to 10.75 percent per year.' 'It takes a while to have a greater effect on economic activity. The third quarter doesn't have such an impact, even though interest rates are at a high level,' she says. She adds that the basis of comparison is high, which means that increases are less significant. Year-to-date From the beginning of the year to the third quarter of 2024, GDP grew by 3.3 percent compared to the same period in 2023. In this comparison, agriculture (-3.5%) declined, while industry (3.5%) and services (3.8%) expanded. IBGE also reported that the GDP growth for 2023, previously published as 2.9 percent, has been revised upward to 3.2 percent.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQekzliLstpT1dl	2024-12-03T16:10:12-08:00	
Seychelles: Two New Zambian Justices Sworn In To Court Of Appeal	By Sedrick Nicett Two new Zambian justices were sworn in to the Court of Appeal of Seychelles on Monday morning, and they started their duties immediately. The two non-resident justices, Dominic Sichinga and Nicola Sharpe-Phiri, both took their oaths on Monday in a ceremony at State House before the President of Seychelles, Wavel Ramkalawan, along with the Vice-President, Ahmed Afif, the Chief Justice, Ronny Govinden, the President of the Court of Appeal, Anthony Fernando, the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Gervais Henrie, other justices of appeal, and members of the Constitutional Appointees Authority (CAA). In his address during the ceremony, Ramkalawan reiterated the fact that such appointments are not chosen by the President himself but by the CAA, which has two members appointed by the President and two appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly. With 22 years of experience, Justice Dominic Sichinga has served as Zambia's Solicitor General, a legal consultant at the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), a judge in charge of Zambia's Kabwe High Court for 12 years, and a judge of appeal for seven years. From 1992 to 1994, he was employed by Budd Martin Burrett in the UK as a nascent advocate. In the United States, he also served as an administrative officer on the Kosovo Law Enforcement Project from 1992 to 1994 and as a child support officer in the Office of the Attorney General of Texas from 1999 to 2003. While serving as permanent secretary at Zambia's Ministry of Transport, Works, and Communications, he gained experience in senior management. He has experience in litigation and adjudicating in a wide range of appeals, including Human Rights Law, Constitutional Law, and General Civil Law. On the other hand, prior to her appointment as a judge of the Court of Appeal in April 2021, Justice Nicola Sharpe-Phiri had 20 years of experience in private practice, six years as a High Court judge at the Lusaka High Court, and five years as a judge-in-charge at the Family & Children Court. She served on the Judiciary's Advisory Committee on Training and Continuing Education while serving as Judge-in-Charge of the Family & Children's Division from 2017 to 2021. She presently holds several positions in the judiciary, such as Chairperson of Zambia's Small Claims Court. She is also a member of the Judicial Institute for Africa's (JIFA) Appraisal Performance Committee and Zambia's Judiciary Focal Point Person. In addition, she serves as the vice president of the Zambia Association of Women Judges (ZAWJ), a member of the Commonwealth Association of Magistrates and Judges, a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb), and a commercial arbitrator. As a judge, she also adjudicates appeals from subordinate courts. In her capacity as Justice of Appeal, she adjudicates in civil and criminal appeals. Her other areas of interest are Family Law, Constitutional Law, Banking and Corporate Law, and Arbitration.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQek2gWWBmRxHQw	2024-12-03T16:03:16-08:00	
Want More Young People To Join The Military? Spend Less On It – O...	The military is concerned about a growing recruitment crisis. Survey after survey reveals young people just aren’t inspired by military service. Ironically, decades of sky-high military spending — and the endless war it enabled — may have much to do with that. And reversing that trend is critical to making Americans safer. An 18-year-old today will have lived their entire life watching one failed, disastrous war after another. Born in 2006, they would have been an infant when George W. Bush surged troops in Iraq in 2007, years after the infamous 'Mission Accomplished' banner. They would have been in about second grade when ISIS took over much of that country. They could have been eligible to join the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) just as the United States withdrew from Afghanistan after 20 years, having only made conditions worse. That same young person would have spent formative years in isolation because of a global pandemic, during whichbillionaires made record wealth gains and used their wealth to buy elections. They would see a country where public schools are underfunded and where neglected infrastructure means lead in drinking water and dams that can’t stand up to newly destructive storms. This reflects the conscious decisions of the government they’re being asked to fight for. In 2024, the U.S. military budget is approaching $1 trillion, more than half of which goes to for-profit military contractors. Year after year, that’s money that hasn’t gone into education, health care, housing, climate or other needs desperately facing young people — and all of us — today. Young people don’t want to sign up for this. Americans under 30 are the only age group where a majority think the military has a negative effect on the country. Younger Americans are also likelier to say the military doesn’t make the world safer. And fewer than one in five of us under 35 say they’re 'extremely proud' to be American — compared to half of those 55 and over. Notably, these Americans also think the United States is on the wrong side in the Middle East. Just one in five younger Americans tell pollsters they support how Israel is conducting its war in Gaza, even as the United States continues to sponsor Israel’s fight through a continuing stream of weapons. And for all that we’ve spent on the military, we’ve consistently failed to protect those who volunteer. With half the budget going to for-profit contractors with multimillionaire CEOs, the troops are often forced to rely on food stamps to get by. Meanwhile, more veterans have died of suicide since 2001 than have died in wars. And our lawmakers have failed to adequately support veterans harmed by burn pits, traumatic brain injury, homelessness and other tragedies of military service. No wonder over half of all Americans now say they’d advise a loved one not to join the military. If we want the best for our country and its young people, we can’t blindly ask them to join an institution they don’t believe in and fight in wars they don’t support for a country that doesn’t have their backs. Instead, we need to invest in a country worth fighting for. For what we’ve spent on wars and the military since 9/11, we could have easily decarbonized the entire U.S. electric grid, completely erased student debt, continued the pandemic-era Child Tax Credit (which cut child poverty in half) for another decade, and much more. It’s not too late to press for those investments, which — unlike the trillions we’ve plowed into the Pentagon and unjust wars — would actually make this country safer. Just ask the young people we’re asking to defend it. Lindsay Koshgarian directs the National Priorities Project at the Institute for Policy Studies. She wrote this for InsideSources.com.

South Korea’s President Lifts Martial Law Hours After Declaring I...	By Eugene Whong South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol ended martial law, just hours after he declared it to counter 'threats from North Korea' and 'anti-state activities' carried out by the country’s opposition party. According to Yoon’s declaration, martial law would begin at 11 p.m. Tuesday, but the National Assembly voted to lift the decree nearly three hours later as protesters rallied outside. After Yoon’s own party urged him to lift martial law, he announced he would do so early Wednesday, and a meeting of his Cabinet made it official. 'I declare emergency martial law to defend the free Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces and to eradicate the shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order.' Yoon said in a news conference Tuesday night. Yoon, who represents the conservative People Power Party, did not mention any specific threat from Pyongyang, and the move was seen by some as a reaction to domestic political tension and conflict. It was the first time that martial law was declared in the country since 1980. Under South Korea’s constitution, power can be consolidated around the executive branch if the president declares martial law, but any such declaration can also be voted down by the National Assembly, which the opposition Democratic Party controls. After Yoon’s declaration, protesters gathered outside the National Assembly building in Seoul, chanting for lawmakers to end the state of martial law -- which they eventually did with 190 of the assembly’s 300 members present. Opposition leaders vowed that they would remain on the premises until the president officially rescinds his declaration. Reuters reported at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, Seoul time, that Yoon announced he would lift martial law, and moments later jubilant protesters outside the assembly declared victory. Political frustration 'Everybody is flabbergasted,' Kenneth Choi, the international editor for the The Chosun Daily newspaper said in an interview with CNN. 'It’s absolutely stunning.' 'He (Yoon) is frustrated because the opposition party, which controls about two-thirds of the parliament, has impeached like 18 of his Cabinet ministers,' Choi said. 'And then the opposition party cut down almost US$4 billion in the government budget. So he believes that the opposition party is trying to shut his government down.' US reaction The United States said Tuesday it was watching events in South Korea 'with grave concern' and was seeking to engage with South Korean officials at every level in Washington and Seoul. 'We have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,' the second-ranking U.S. diplomat, Kurt Campbell, told reporters in Washington. A spokesperson for the National Security Council told RFA that the U.S. was not notified in advance of Yoon’s announcement. 'We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the ROK,' the spokesperson said. David Maxwell, vice president of the Washington-based Center for Asia Pacific Strategy told RFA that Yoon, who faces a very low approval ratings, has nothing to lose, and may have been hoping that the move could hurt the opposition party. He said Yoon may have felt the timing was right for such a bold move. Yoon is 'likely to receive little or no condemnation from the incoming Trump administration as much as there may be from Biden or would be if Harris had won,' said Maxwell, adding that a large scale labor union protest was set to begin in South Korea on Wednesday. He acknowledged that there were risks though, saying that under martial law, South Korean forces might accidentally use inappropriate levels of force in response to protests, the declaration could damage the reputation of conservative politicians, and that North Korea could find ways to exploit the situation. Yoon’s declaration of martial law drew condemnation from his political opponents. Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon and is the leader of the Democratic Party, said that the military should not rule South Korea. 'President Yoon’s illegal declaration of emergency martial law is null and void,' said Lee. Han Dong-hoon, the leader of Yoon’s own People Power Party and South Korea’s justice minister until last year, said on Facebook that the 'martial law declaration was wrong,' and that he would work alongside the people to stop it.

Contrary To What The Washington Post Says, China Is Doing A Huge ...	The Washington Post had a bizarre article last week in which it questioned whether China was doing much to combat global warming. While the piece noted China’s efforts to portray itself as a world leader in this effort, it commented: 'But China’s global climate leadership bid is complicated by its own enormous emissions. The country has been the world’s largest producer of atmosphere-warming greenhouse gases for nearly two decades, although the United States has released more in total since industrialization. 'China continues to rely heavily on coal power, a leading source of carbon dioxide. In the early years of climate talks, Chinese officials were often accused of spoiling deals with concerns that stronger commitments would undermine Chinese economic growth. 'Beijing also resisted pressure from Western nations before the talks this month to make an early announcement of targets to reduce emissions by 2035 and to join developed nations in contributing cash to help poor countries address the catastrophic impacts of climate change and to transition away from reliance on fossil fuels.' +++ 'But Beijing has done little so far to back up its statements with action. ‘To play a leadership role requires more than just saying they are committed to the Paris agreement,’ she [Belinda Schäpe, China policy analyst with the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a Finland-based research group] said.' China is the world’s leading emitter primarily because, until last year, it was the most populous country in the world. Presumably the Post’s climate reporters are aware of this fact. On a per capita basis it still emits about half as much as the United States. Also, China’s emissions figures are misleading since it has an enormous surplus in trade of manufactured goods. This means that many of the emissions that are attributed to China support living standards in Europe, the United States, and other countries with whom it runs a trade surplus. If its trade surplus were smaller, its emissions would be lower and emissions in other countries would be higher. Also, China has made enormous progress in controlling its emissions even though it is a rapidly growing developing country catching up to Western living standards. It has invested a huge amount of money in its solar and wind industry and now has close to half the entire world’s capacity in both. It is now projected to be at or near its peak emissions level, with declines in the future. This is well ahead of its targets in the Paris Agreement. Also, contrary to what is claimed in this piece, China is offering massive support to developing countries in their transitions to green economies. It is selling EVs, solar panels, batteries and other clean technologies at hugely subsidized prices. To get an idea of the size of this aid, suppose that China exports 10 million EVs a year(not far above its current level of car exports) at an average subsidy of $10,000 each. This would be equivalent to $100 billion in aid for the green transition. If it had comparable subsidies on solar panels, batteries and other green technologies, that would come to $200 billion a year. This is far more than is being put on the table by the United States and other wealthy countries. It would be useful if the Post could try to do a more serious analysis in its pieces on global warming.

Ukraine Again Calls For Full Membership As NATO Ministers Meet In...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukraine has again called for membership in NATO, saying that only joining the alliance in full would guarantee its future security as it fights to stave off Russia's nearly three-year-old full-scale assault. 'We are convinced that the only such real guarantee of security for Ukraine, as well as a deterrent factor for further Russian aggression against Ukraine and other states, is only Ukraine's full membership in NATO,' Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said in a statement released ahead of a December 3 meeting of the alliance's foreign ministers in Brussels. In reaction to the ministry's statement, Kremlin spokesman Dimtry Peskov said on December 3 that Ukraine's joining NATO would be 'unacceptable' and a 'threat' to Russia. The statement comes just days after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Sky News that Ukraine's NATO admittance could end what he described as the 'hot phase of the war' triggered by Russia when it launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Zelenskiy told Sky News on November 30 that he would be willing to consider a cease-fire if Ukraine’s unoccupied territories fell under NATO's protection, as long as an invitation to join the alliance recognized Ukraine's international borders.'If we want to stop the hot phase of the war, we need to take under the NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control,' Zelenskiy said.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha is set to brief his NATO counterparts in Brussels on the current situation on the eastern front, where Russian troops have been making incremental but steady advances against Kyiv's outnumbered and outgunned forces.The meeting in Brussels is to focus on NATO's continued military support for Ukraine, examine Kyiv's air-defense needs, and also discuss Russia's launching last month of an experimental ballistic missile against the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.Russia has said that the new medium-range missile, called Oreshnik, can also strike targets across Europe and cannot be stopped by air defenses. On December 3, Zelenskiy announced that Ukraine had conducted a test on new, domestically developed missiles. 'We thank our Ukrainian missile developers. We're speeding up production,' Zelenskiy said on Telegram after a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian military. Russian hybrid attacks and sabotage incidents against NATO members is also due to be discussed in Brussels.Early on December 3, Russia launched yet another drone attack on Ukraine that was largely repelled by Ukrainian air defenses, which shot down 22 out of the 28 incoming drones over nine regions -- Kyiv, Chernihiv, Vinnytsya, Khmelnytskiy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Odesa, Mykolayiv, and Dnipropetrovsk. Russian shelling also killed a woman early on December 3 in the Dnipro district of the southern region of Kherson, local officials reported.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf5SG3vfaQek2lG2xj0er0V	2024-12-03T15:42:48-08:00	
From Chancay To Shanghai: China Undercuts The US In Peru – Analys...	By Hari Seshasayee The Chinese-built Chancay port in Peru should be seen by many as a harbinger of a new era in Latin America, one where Beijing holds as much sway as Washington in Latin America. This is the culmination of years of geopolitical maneuvering by China to court countries that were previously in the United States’ sphere of influence. The timing is crucial: China’s coaxing of Latin America is juxtaposed with the US distancing itself from the region by threatening to impose tariffs and clamp down on illegal immigration, which leaves little room for new economic engagement. It is thus natural that China’s willingness to expand its stake in Latin America and build much-needed infrastructure projects is seen by governments in the region as a welcome opportunity. Whether newly elected president Donald Trump will be willing to set aside the irritants in the US-Latin America relationship and instead make economic overtures to the region remains to be seen. The Chancay port forms part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), joining a long list of BRI projects in the region, including 'roads through the jungles of Costa Rica; railways in Bolivia and Argentina; industrial parks and a container port in Trinidad and Tobago; the biggest hydroelectric plant in Ecuador; and the first transoceanic fiber-optic cable directly connecting Asia to South America, stretching from China to Chile, among other projects.' Currently, 22 countries from Latin America and the Caribbean have signed on to BRI, and Colombia may soon be added to that list. Chancay may be one of the more successful BRI projects that China has executed, but it should not overshadow other BRI projects that have been left languishingdue to political corruption, labor violations, environmental issues or public protests. Yet, credit should be given where it is due. China has already been South America’s largest trading partner for over a decade; Chancay may well catapult South America-China trade to even higher levels. The saying ‘Chancay to Shanghai’ has become ubiquitous in Peru, a nod bridging the massive distance between Latin America’s Pacific coast to China’s economic hubs. At face value, the Chancay port is impressive: a sleepy fishing village 80kms from Lima has been transformed into one of South America’s largest ports, thanks to a $1.3 billion investment by China’s Cosco Shipping in the project’s first phase. The port is expected to generate $4.5 billion in annual revenue and will create more than 8,000 jobs, all while reducing trade costs between Peru and China by 20%. The first ship from Chancay, Peru to China is set to sail this week carrying fruits from the Andean country. Moreover, Chancay is a modern port, built to withstand earthquakes of upto 8.5 magnitude, and is nearly fully-automated with unmanned electric vehicles used to move containers, automated cranes to load and unload merchandise, facial recognition systems to ensure security, radio frequency systems to track goods and 5G internet throughout the port. Much of the port’s systems and infrastructure have been brought in by the Chinese, with BYD pick-up trucks and Huawei 5G towers. The port is controlled by China’s Cosco Shipping, which has a 60% stake in the project, and a Peruvian mining company, Volcan, which holds the remaining 40% stake. Although Chancay and Peru seems to be the cynosure of all eyes, China’s ambitions with this project reach beyond Peru. Chancay’s primary motive is to serve as a springboard to Asia from Latin America’s Pacific coast, reducing the voyage from Peru to China from 35 to 23 days, but it also has two important consequences with regards to global maritime trade. The first is short-term. Previously, vessels from South America’s Pacific coast would make the journey to Asia via Mexico’s Manzanilla port or California’s Long Beach – both those ports will now see less traffic emanating from South America. The second consequence is long-term and yet unknown. It is linked to another large infrastructure project that aims to connect Peru with neighboring countries in order to give them easy access to Asia via the Pacific. According to the director of Peru’s Chancay Chamber of Commerce, 'China’s main motivation for developing the megaport was access to neighboring Brazil, where a new railway line is planned to carry Brazilian exports such as soybeans and iron ore to the port.' The newly planned railway line between Brazil and Peru could cost up to $3.5 billion, but is far from becoming a reality. On a similar vein, Peruvian Transport Minister Raul Perez Reyes notes that his country’s goal 'is to become the Singapore of Latin America, so that port cargo passes through here when going to Asia. When someone from Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina wants to go to Asia, they should think of Peru as a point of departure.' It is likely that certain goods may now traverse from other Latin American ports in the Pacific to Chancay and then head to Asia via this new trade route. Yet, the loftier plans to connect Peru’s coast by road with Brazil and other neighboring countries, dubbed the ‘Bi-Oceanic Railway,’ traversing from Brazil’s Southeastern cost in the Atlantic to Peru’s Chancay, may still be a pipedream.

The ‘Price Stability’ Myth Undermines Our Economy And Well-Being ...	By Frank Shostak For most commentators, a 'stable price level' is the key for economic stability. For instance, let us say that there is a relative increase in consumer demand for potatoes versus tomatoes. This relative increase is depicted, all things being equal, by the relative increase in the price of potatoes. To be successful, businesses must pay attention to consumer demand. Failing to do so is likely to lead to losses. Hence, by paying attention to relative changes in prices, producers are likely to increase the production of potatoes versus tomatoes. According to many economists, if the 'price level' is not 'stable,' then the visibility of the relative price changes becomes blurred and, consequently, businesses cannot ascertain the relative changes in the demand for goods and services and make correct production decisions. This leads to a misallocation of resources and to the weakening of economic fundamentals. Thinking this way, unstable changes in the price level obscure a business person’s ability to ascertain changes in the relative prices of goods and services. Thus, businesses find it difficult to recognize a change in relative prices when the price level is unstable. Given such presuppositions, it is not surprising that the mandate of the central bank is to pursue policies that will allegedly bring 'price stability' (i.e., a stable price level). By means of various quantitative methods, the Fed’s economists have established that policymakers should aim at keeping the yearly growth rate of prices of goods and services at two percent. Any significant deviation from this figure supposedly constitutes deviation from stable growth. The Assumption of Money Neutrality & 'Price Stability' At the root of price stabilization policies is a view that money is neutral, that is, changes in the money supply only have an effect on the price level while having no effect on the relative prices. For instance, if one apple exchanges for two potatoes then the price of an apple is two potatoes or the price of one potato is half an apple. Now, if one apple exchanges for one dollar, then the price of a potato is $0.50. Note that the introduction of money does not alter the fact that the relative price of potatoes versus apples is 2:1 (two-to-one). Thus, a seller of an apple will get one dollar for it, which, in turn, will enable him to purchase two potatoes. Let us assume that the stock of money has doubled and, as a result, the purchasing power of money has halved, or the price level has doubled. This means that now one apple can be exchanged for two dollars while one potato for one dollar. Despite the doubling in prices, a seller of an apple with the obtained two dollars can still purchase two potatoes. Assuming money neutrality, an increase in the quantity of money leads to a proportionate increase in prices. Conversely, a fall in the quantity of money results in a proportionate decline in the prices. Why is this way of thinking problematic? Money is Not Neutral When new money is injected, there are always first recipients of the newly-injected money who benefit from this injection. The first recipients, with more money at their disposal, can now acquire a greater amount of goods while the prices of these goods are still unchanged. As money starts to move through the economy, the prices of goods begin to rise, unevenly and disproportionately. Consequently, late receivers of the inflated money realize costs from the monetary injections and may even find that most prices have risen so much that they can now afford fewer goods. Artificial increases in money supply generate a redistribution of wealth from later recipients, or non-recipients of money, to the earlier recipients. Obviously, this shift in wealth alters individuals’ demands for goods and services and, in turn, further alters the relative prices of goods and services. Inflationary increases in money supply set in motion new dynamics that give rise to changes in demands for goods and services and to changes in their relative prices. Hence, increases in money supply cannot be neutral. Again, a change in relative demands here is on account of wealth diversion from the latest recipients of money to the earlier recipients. This change in relative demands cannot be sustained without ongoing increases in the money supply. Once the growth rate of the money supply slows down or ceases altogether, various activities that emerged on the back of this inflationary increase in the money supply come under pressure. It follows, then, that an artificial increase in the money supply gives rise to changes in relative prices, which sets in motion an unsustainable structure of production. Hence, the Fed’s monetary policy—which aims at stabilizing the price level—necessarily involves growth in the money supply. Since inflationary changes in the money supply are not neutral, this means that the central bank policy amounts to tampering with relative prices, which leads to the disruption of the efficient allocation of resources. While increases in money supply are likely to be revealed in general price increases, this is not always the case. Prices are determined by real and monetary factors. Consequently, it can occur if the real factors are pulling things in an opposite direction to monetary factors. In such a case, a visible change in prices may not take place. While money growth is buoyant, prices might display moderate increases. If we were to pay attention to changes in the price level and disregard increases in the money supply, we would reach misleading conclusions regarding the state of the economy. On this, Rothbard wrote, The fact that general prices were more or less stable during the 1920s told most economists that there was no inflationary threat, and therefore the events of the great depression caught them completely unaware. There is No 'Price Level' The whole idea of the general purchasing power of money and, therefore, the 'price level' cannot even be established conceptually. When one dollar is exchanged for the one loaf of bread, we can say that the purchasing power of the one dollar is the one loaf of bread. If one dollar is exchanged for two tomatoes, then this also means that the purchasing power of the one dollar is two tomatoes. Such information regarding the specific purchasing power of money at that moment in time does not, however, allow the establishment of the general, total purchasing power of money. It is not possible to ascertain the total purchasing power of money because we cannot meaningfully add up two tomatoes to the one loaf of bread. We can only establish the purchasing power of money with respect to a particular good in a transaction at a given point in time and at a given place. According to Rothbard, Since the general exchange-value, or PPM (purchasing power of money), of money cannot be quantitatively defined and isolated in any historical situation, and its changes cannot be defined or measured, it is obvious that it cannot be kept stable. If we do not know what something is, we cannot very well act to keep it constant. Conclusion For most commentators, the key to healthy economic fundamentals is 'price stability.' A 'stable price level,' it is held, leads to the efficient use of the economy’s scarce resources and hence results in better economic fundamentals. It is not surprising that the mandate of the Federal Reserve is to pursue policies that will supposedly generate price stability. Through monetary policies (inflation) that aim at stabilizing the price level, the Fed actually undermines economic fundamentals. An ever-growing interference of the central bank with the working of markets moves the US economy towards the growth path of persistent economic impoverishment and drastically lower living standards. On the contrary, what is required is not a policy of dubious 'price stability,' but rather allowing free price fluctuations and maintaining sound money. Only in an environment free of central bank tampering can free and voluntary fluctuations in relative prices can take place. This, in turn, permits businesses to abide by consumer instructions.

Vietnam Must Manage Its Trump-Era Expectations – Analysis	By Lena Le On 5 November 2024, the US presidential election drew global attention. In Vietnam, a survey conducted by Tuoi Tre indicated that 76 per cent of respondents supported president-elect Donald Trump, while 24 per cent preferred Vice President Kamala Harris. A VnExpress poll similarly reported 80 per cent backing for Trump. This remarkable level of support is echoed on Facebook and TikTok, where many Vietnamese users appear to favour the president-elect. This preference among Vietnamese social media users may stem from viewing Trump — known for his assertive rhetoric — as a leader capable of reasserting US global leadership. They may also believe he will promote regional stability and assist Vietnam in the South China Sea. But regardless of the motivations behind this support, it would be prudent to temper expectations concerning this assumption. Vietnam will need to swiftly navigate shifts in bilateral trade policies, the long-term consequences of delayed climate action and pressures arising from US–China competition. The US–Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership forged in 2023 importantly does not directly translate into US policies that safeguard Vietnam in disputes. Trump’s previous term and his campaign promises suggest that his administration will pursue fair trade policies, which he positions as essential to creating more US jobs. During Trump’s prior administration, Vietnam agreed to a US$21 billion purchase of Boeing aircraft to help mitigate its trade deficit with the United States. The United States’ trade deficit in goods with Vietnam reached US$104 billion in 2023, placing Vietnam among the top three countries with the highest trade imbalance with the United States. A renewed Trump administration will likely prioritise reducing this deficit as a matter of urgency. Trump’s preference for bilateral trade agreements — viewed as more effective in addressing trade imbalances — may prompt a US withdrawal from the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, established by US President Joe Biden. This speculation is rooted in Trump’s previous actions, including withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his first day in office in 2017, which was a blow to Hanoi. A second Trump administration also plans to impose tariffs of 10–20 per cent on imported goods. Such tariffs would significantly affect Vietnamese exporters, as the United States has been Vietnam’s largest export market in recent years. Industries such as seafood, textiles, tires, furniture and steel would face considerable difficulties, as increased import costs would likely reduce US demand. Trump would have several legal bases to justify these tariffs, including Section 232, Section 301, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and Section 122 Balance of Payments Authority. These enable the US president to adjust imports if deemed a national security threat, to address unfair trade practices and to impose temporary import surcharges or quotas to manage balance of payments issues. One should not assume that an increase in tariffs of 40–60 per cent on Chinese goods would automatically benefit Vietnam. The US–China trade war initially drove some companies towards Vietnam as an alternative manufacturing hub. But in a 2019 interview, Trump accused Vietnam of exploiting the trade dispute to expand its exports to the United States. He called the country ‘the single worst abuser of everybody’ and suggested it might become the next trade target. Trump’s trend of withdrawing from multilateral agreements could also lead to a US exit from the Paris Agreement on climate change. While this may not immediately affect Vietnam, it could undercut collective efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. This is particularly concerning for Vietnam, which ranks among the five countries most vulnerable to climate change. In 2023, Vietnam and the United States elevated their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, Vietnam’s highest diplomatic designation. But given Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy — even with close allies — he has often voiced dissatisfaction with what he perceives as an undue burden on the United States. Trump has previously threatened to withdraw US forces from allied nations and pressured allies to substantially increase their financial contributions to US troop presence in 2020. This precedent raises questions about the extent of support the United States might provide to Vietnam under its partnership, particularly in the face of external challenges. Amid the increasingly intense US–China rivalry and Trump’s diplomatic brinkmanship, the president-elect may also demand that Vietnam make greater contributions to US policies in the region. It is possible that Trump may even pressure Vietnam to take sides between the United States and China. These decisions could pertain to security, defence and technological solutions. This poses a challenge that Vietnam has consistently sought to avoid. The Vietnam–US relationship is strategically significant for both sides due to geostrategic and economic considerations. But it will likely face challenges under a renewed ‘America First’ approach that emphasises bilateralism, prioritises US interests and holds allies and partners accountable to US demands.

Ontario Explores Potential New Energy Generation Sites	The provincial government has told Ontario Power Generation to begin discussions to determine community support for all types of new energy generation, including nuclear, at three sites in the southern part of the province. Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator has said the province's demand for electricity is forecast to increase by 75% by 2050 - the equivalent of adding four and a half cities the size of Toronto to the grid, the Government of Ontario said. The increase in demand is being driven by Ontario's rapid increase in population, new manufacturing facilities, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence data centres, the electrification of industry, and the charging energy required for electric vehicles. 'While the province is already on track to meet demands through 2035 with major projects already announced, including Canada's first small modular reactor and the largest competitive energy procurement in Ontario's history, the province will need 16,000 additional megawatts of generation, in addition to new transmission to meet demand in 2050,' the government added. Early community engagement is a critical part of the province's approach to new energy generation. These 'early conversations' ( will look at how communities would be supported and potential benefits to them from generation projects, including equity participation for Indigenous communities, funding for municipal host communities to support community infrastructure investments and attraction of co-located industry, additional income from municipal property taxes, and associated jobs and economic development for municipalities and Indigenous communities. The three sites owned by Ontario Power Generation (OPG) - already Ontario's largest generator - that have been singled out by the government for discussions with Indigenous, community and municipal leaders are at Wesleyville in Port Hope, Nanticoke in Haldimand County and Lambton in St Clair. These sites are already zoned for electricity generation, have proximity to transmission, and are located in Southern Ontario, within regions experiencing significant growth, according to the provincial government. 'As we prepare for the largest expansion of electricity generation in over 30 years, our government is embracing an important opportunity for economic reconciliation among First Nations communities and workers,' Ontario Minister of Indigenous Affairs and First Nations Economic Reconciliation Greg Rickford said. 'By working together with Ontario Power Generation, we are ensuring that First Nations communities are not just part of the conversation, but active participants in shaping a prosperous, sustainable energy future.' OPG President and CEO Ken Hartwick said the company places 'great importance' on relationships with host communities, neighbours, and the Indigenous Nations on whose traditional territory it operates. 'We look forward to meeting with municipalities and Nations to understand their perspectives and aspirations for their communities,' he said. Clean and reliable baseload electricity from nuclear and hydroelectricity are prioritised in the government's vision document, Ontario's Affordable Energy Future, released in October. The provincial government is already supporting Bruce Power in pre-development work on the province's first large-scale nuclear build in 30 years, as well as OPG's plans for four small modular reactors at its Darlington site and the refurbishment of the Pickering Nuclear Generation Station, as part of what Minister of Energy and Electrification Stephen Lecce said is Ontario's largest expansion of electricity generation in more than thirty years. 'To meet soaring energy demands, we're working with communities to plan ahead and build for our future so that we can generate more power that is reliable and affordable for our families today and tomorrow. Our plan will ensure we keep energy bills down and the power on for generations to come,' he said. About the sites According to information from OPG, the three sites are already zoned for electricity generation, have proximity to transmission, and are located in Southern Ontario within regions where a lot of growth is taking place. Wesleyville (Port Hope) covers about 1300 acres, adjacent to Durham Region which hosts Pickering and Darlington nuclear generating stations Nanticoke (Haldimand County) is a former coal generating site, part of which is currently used for a solar facility. It has existing transmission connection with capacity, railway, and dock Lambton (St Clair Township) is a former coal generating site with access to railway and deepwater dock, and the potential to re-use some existing site features from previous generation OPG says it is 'in the early stages of understanding each community’s willingness to explore energy development in their community or territory'. Projects will only be explored if they have a willing host community and Indigenous participation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5gjPzN308STm	2024-12-02T16:15:18-08:00	
Persistent Fall In Private Borrowing Brings Global Debt Down – An...	Global debt decreased about one percentage point to 237 percent GDP. The values for 2023 are now available from the just released IMF’s Global Debt Database. Global private debt fell by 2.8 percentage points to 143 percent of GDP, below the 2019 level and more than compensated for the turning up in public debt. According to the latest Fiscal Monitor, global public debt is high, rising, and risky. Low Growth Prospects Empirical analysis points to low growth prospects as the main driver of the fall in private debt in 2023. The way households and businesses react to current and expected future growth is very important for private debt. Given weak growth prospects many firms and households are opting to pay down debt. The fall in private debt slowed down compared to 2022 mainly because of a reduction in the contribution from unexpected inflation to debt erosion. As a matter of fact, surprise inflation was a major factor in 2021-2022. Since debt is fixed in nominal terms, unexpected inflation can actually erode the real value of debt and lower its ratio to GDP. In 2022, inflation reached levels unprecedented since the Great Inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. A simple way to visualize the relation between private debt, growth and growth prospects is to look at the elasticity of private debt to the difference between growth prospects and current growth (see our Global Debt Monitor). As economic prospects brighten compared to the current situation, households and firms are more inclined to resort to debt financing. In recent years deteriorating growth prospects have made this logic operate in reverse. Addressing private and public debt risks Although declining, in 2023, non-financial corporations and household global debt is elevated at more than $150 trillion. Financial stability risks and policies to mitigate and manage them are comprehensively covered in the Global Financial Stability Report. The role of deteriorating growth prospects in the decline of private debt is a reminder of the unfortunate combination of high debt and low growth that heightens the challenge of balancing the fiscal equation. Chapter 3 of the recent World Economic Outlookemphasizes that structural policies are crucial to deliver sustainable and inclusive growth. The last Fiscal Monitor argues that, in most countries, additional efforts are necessary now to contain public finance risks with a high degree of confidence. But it also argues fiscal has a central role—for example through public investment and policies that support innovation and research—among the structural policies that must be deployed to deliver enduring, sustained, and inclusive growth.

Can You See Why The UN Is Bad At Peace? – OpEd	By Mehdi Alavi The idea of peace in Europe goes back for centuries. Europeans made many agreements in pursuit of peace. The biggest impetus for what later became the United Nations was the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, mostly based on the previous peace agreements. Run by the UK, the US, France and Italy, thirty-two countries attended the conference. The Big Four used the Treaty as a reference to set up the UN foundation in the 1944 Dunbarton Oaks estate in Washington, DC. The UN has been a nightmare. It is as dysfunctional as the League of Nations. The world has not seen peace even for a day since the UN’s inception in 1945. Delegates should have foreseen the UN’s failure in 1945. The organization came into existence for the UK, the US and the Soviets to expand their hegemony across the world. They projected peace for themselves, and not necessarily for the rest of the world. How the Allies became the United Nations On September 1, 1939, World War II started with Germany invading Poland. The United Kingdom (UK) and France declared war on Germany as allies. The Soviet Union (Soviets) invaded eastern Poland on September 17. In June 1941, the Soviets joined the Allies. The Big Three (the UK, the US and the Soviets) formed a united organization of nations to maintain their global peace and security. The Allied powers met and signed the Declaration of St.James Palace, pledging collaboration in fighting aggression. It proclaimed that 'the only true basis of enduring peace is the willing cooperation of free peoples in a world in which, relieved of the menace of aggression, all may enjoy economic and social security.' The US Constitution strictly limits the president’s power and rests the war declaration with Congress. However, President Franklin D. Roosevelt short-circuited the Constitution, by authorizing the US to finance and arm the UK and France. In March 1941, Congress put this policy into law in the form of the Lend-Lease Act without the constitutional process of declaring war. Germany and its allies, Italy and Japan (the Axis Powers), of course, considered the US to be aiding the enemy in war. The US later entered the war formally. In December 1941, Japan’s air force attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii, catching the US by surprise. Within days, that attack triggered the US to declare war on Germany. Within hours, Germany also declared war on the US. That month, China joined the Allies while resisting Japan’s expansion in China since 1937. In August 1941, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill signed the Atlantic Charterpledging to stop territorial expansion, engage in free trade, collaborate with other nations, have access to 'high seas and oceans', stop the use of force, and work for a world peace free of 'fear and want', where all individuals are free to choose their form of government and enjoy economic advancement and social security. In January 1942, about four weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Big Three (the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union) and China, along with 22 other countries, signed a document pledging to accept the Atlantic Charter, which is referred to as the Declaration by the United Nations. During World War II, the devastating effect of that war encouraged the Big Three and China, (the Big Four), to put aside their differences and collaborate in the war. To avoid such a war in the future, they began planning for the world. As the discussion progressed, the idea of a united world organization emerged. In October 1943, the Big Four signed the Moscow Declaration, recognizing 'the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organization, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States, and open to membership by all such States, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and security.' In November- December 1943, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for the first time in Tehran, Iran. They discussed the post-war arrangement and partitions. Roosevelt and Churchill assured Stalin that he could expand Soviet territory into Poland and Germany. President Roosevelt was so infatuated with Stalin that he called him Uncle Joe. 'I began to tease Churchill,' the American President boasted, '… Winston got red and scowled and finally Stalin broke into a deep, hearty guffaw. It was then that I called him Uncle Joe.' This cavalier attitude of President Roosevelt regarding Eastern Europe is a typical example of a public servant intoxicated with power, and turning into a despot. Such a cavalier is responsible for the US presidents’ empowering the Zionist genocide against Palestinians and the takeover of Palestine. At the end of the Tehran meeting, they agreed on the Tehran Conference. They said: 'We are sure that our concord will win an enduring peace. We recognize fully the supreme responsibility resting upon us and all the United Nations to make a peace which will command the goodwill of the overwhelming mass of the world’s peoples and banish the scourge and terror of war for many generations.' The victorious Allies founded the UN In October 1944, the Big Four met at Dumbarton Oaks, in Washington, DC. They proposed a United Nations consisting of the following: A General Assembly, composed of all the member nations oversees an Economic and Social Council. Nowadays, it oversees other councils, too. A Security Council is composed of eleven members, five permanent and six chosen by the GA for two-year terms. An International Court of Justice. A United Nations Secretariat. After the war, they all wanted to be in control of the global issues. The US had risen to the most powerful one among the Big Three but felt needed Soviet cooperation to finish the war. The Soviets did not trust the UK or the US. They insisted on restoring the old Russian Empire and succeeded. In April 1945, delegates from 46 nations attended the San Francisco Conference and discussed and approved the UN. They set up the UN objectives to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights…to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.' On June 25, 1945, the delegates met in San Francisco. After days of meetings, they unanimously passed the UN Charter. The major debacle was the veto power of the Big Five (the UK, the US, France, the Soviets, and China). Less powerful nations feared that if a veto power threatened peace, the Security Council would lose its significance. They wanted more power distribution. Finally, they went along in the interest of global peace. On September 2, 1945, the war ended. The Big Three decided to expand the United Nations by inviting other nations to join it. The shortcomings of the victors’ peace To ensure their global hegemony, they planned the UN Security Council (UNSC) in the UN. The UK insisted on limiting the UNSC to the UK, the US and the Soviets. The US wanted China to be included because of its strong resistance against Japan, which freed the US to support Europe. To ensure Western control, the UK insisted on adding France to the Council. That is how the Big Five surfaced. The Soviets felt outnumbered by the West and asked for veto power, which was granted to all permanent members. The UN General Assembly (UNGA) is the only organ in the UN in which all member nations vote. Regardless of size or population, each member nation has only one vote. A simple majority decides procedural questions while a simple majority or a two-thirds vote decides substantive ones, depending on importance. It is mainly a deliberative body empowered to make recommendations to the UN Security Council (UNSC) regarding international issues. In contrast, the UNSC is primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security. It is an exclusive club. Nowadays, it has 15 members, 5 of whom are permanent members and endowed with veto power on every issue. The permanent members are the US, the UK, China, France, and Russia, also known as the Big Five. The GA chooses the other ten for two-year terms. Like the League, the UN’s primary purpose has been to preserve peace and security. The UN members have promised not to use force except in self-defense and to use force collectively to preserve peace. In apparent violation of the UN Charter, the veto powers granted to certain member states have led to conflicts and wars, rather than preventing them. Until the fall of the Soviets in December 1991, the world faced two superpowers, the US and the Soviets, competing for global influence, a period known as the Cold War. They incited proxy wars nearly everywhere. Following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US emerged as the world’s sole superpower. This shift in global dynamics has led to military interventions and interference in various countries, resulting in significant human suffering and destruction. Presently, the US is responsible for much of the global deaths and destruction, particularly in Iraq, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. The US complicity in the genocide against Palestinians is the talk of the world these days. Given these ongoing challenges, it is clear that the current state of the UN is not conducive to achieving lasting global peace. Meaningful reform or even the dismantling of the organization may be necessary. Adding Brazil, Germany, India, Japan or another country is unlikely to address the fundamental issues.

Is The End Near For The War In Ukraine? – OpEd	By James Fite It has been more than two-and-a-half years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and both the people and the president of the beleaguered nation have been fighting ever since. That was during Joe Biden’s presidency, however, and his 'as long as it takes' policy toward keeping American gear and tax dollars flowing into Ukraine. Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, and there has been plenty of speculation that he’ll turn off the tap. He has also said numerous times that he can end the war in a day. Lo and behold, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is now talking about peace and compromise with Russia. Zelensky Sues for Peace? In an interview with Sky News – his first significant sit-down with Western media since Trump won the White House – President Zelensky explained that he’s now considering a compromise to end the 'hot' war with Russia. 'If we want to stop the hot phase of the war, we need to take under the NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control,' Zelensky told reporters. 'We need to do it fast. And then on the [occupied] territory of Ukraine, Ukraine can get them back in a diplomatic way.' Zelensky continued to advocate for Ukraine’s addition to NATO, but he admitted that it isn’t possible right now, under the current circumstances. To join the alliance, Ukraine would have to end the border dispute by officially ceding the Russian-held areas to Putin – something Ukraine’s constitution doesn’t allow. Still, Zelensky hopes for NATO protection for the parts of his nation not currently held by Russia. No NATO for Ukraine Putin has declared that Ukraine joining NATO would raise the threat of nuclear conflict, and western leaders fear that bringing Ukraine into the fold while its border is contested in an actual shooting war would drag the whole of the alliance into it as well – and then, quite possibly, the rest of the developed world. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty reads: 'The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered and attack against them all and consequently agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with other Parties, such actions as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.' In short: Attacking one member of NATO obligates the whole alliance to join the fight. What happens if the 32 other member nations, representing most of North America and Europe, all team up against Russia? Will that be the end of it, or will it officially become World War III when India, China, North Korea, Iran, and all the other Russian allies join in? And will it stay in Europe, or will it – like the last world war – span the globe as already tense situations in other areas get rolled into the larger conflict? If Ukraine’s leader is really willing to give up his dreams of retaking the lands captured by Russia and to – at least temporarily – stop trying to join NATO, there may actually be some ground both Zelensky and Putin can meet on to end the fighting. Losing territory yet again (recall that Russia successfully annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine during the Obama administration) would be a hard pill to swallow. But with the constant drip of dollars and weaponry from the Biden administration seemingly likely to dry up soon, Zelensky may have decided that it’s best to cut his losses before those losses include his entire country.

Debunking Putin’s New World Order – OpEd	During the tense months of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, the National Security Council’s Middle East expert Gary Sick was inundated daily with hundreds of pages of classified documents describing the rapidly evolving situation in Tehran. Yet the sources that Sick found most valuable in making sense of the crisis were neither the reports nor memos that the NSC staff helpfully supplied, but the direct speeches of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 'You could tell what these people were thinking […] [F]or intentions, you can’t do better than get a politician and let ‘em rant on for two hours.' Fortunately for analysts who take a cue from Sick to interpret the intentions of the Kremlin, the Russian president can 'rant on' for two hours—or four. Indeed, that’s how long Putin’s commentary ran during the November 7 meeting at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi. An annual meeting of international scholars, world leaders, think tank experts, and journalists funded by pro-Kremlin NGOs, the Valdai forum is primarily aimed at shaping international perceptions of Russia. According to the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s DisinfoWatch, Valdai’s purpose is to platform Russia’s geopolitical agenda while casting a scholarly glaze on pro-Kremlin talking points. This year, Putin spoke for one hour and took questions for three hours in an effort to contour the narrative about Russian intentions and activities on the world stage. Tellingly, the Russian president kicked off the event with praise for the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution which, like the French and English revolutions before it, had 'determined the course of history.' He then remarked that today’s citizens are 'destined' to see 'revolutionary changes' in their lifetimes as 'a completely new world order, nothing like we had in the past' is ushered in. The stakes, in other words, couldn’t be higher as Putin laid out his vision for the world to come. Yet it wasn’t a vision so much as instructions directed at both domestic and international audiences about how to understand Russia’s ideological struggle against Western nations. The independent news outlet Meduza reported that pro-Kremlin media organizations received guidelines from the Putin administration about how to cover the Valdai forum. The guidelines emphasized that the Russian president is a 'great world leader' and that his speech introduced the 'doctrine of a new world order.' Given their marching orders, Russian media outlets immediately got to work. The popular Lenta.ru ran the following headline: '‘The moment of truth is at hand.’ Putin spoke out about the formation of a new world order' while the more than century-old Izvestia chimed in with 'At the Valdai Club meeting, Putin declared the formation of a new world order.' As though a new geopolitical arrangement is something that can simply be announced into being—by Putin, no less. Although much of what was said at Valdai was familiar—grievances about NATO expansion, American duplicity, and Western hegemony—there was an unusual emphasis placed on a pseudo-philosophical framing of Russia’s relations with the West. Reminiscent of how he had treated the world to his lengthy amateur historicizing during the Tucker Carlson interview earlier this year, Putin is now legitimizing Russian aggression by means of lengthy amateur philosophizing. Characterizing his remarks as 'philosophical digressions,' the would-be philosopher-king dove headfirst into the 'dialectics of history.' As Putin related to his audience, the unforgiving 'course of history' is currently characterized by an 'irreconcilable struggle' informed not by a scramble for strategic predominance, but by ideology. The ideological combatants are, on one side, a hegemonic 'modern Western liberalism' that’s both 'racist' and 'globalist,' imposing 'totalitarian ideologies' in a 'crude colonial approach.' The belligerent hegemons bent on an 'ideological, military, and political monopoly' of the world include the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany (the 'collective West' for short). On the other side of the ideological divide, Putin identifies a somewhat vague but diverse 'global majority' that simply wants to be left alone to live in peace. Predictably, and without a trace of irony, Putin contends that Russia, China, and North Korea represent the world’s peace-loving nations. The Russian leader reminds his audience that, dialectically speaking, ideological contradictions are resolved via 'synthesis, transitioning to a new quality' which, practically speaking, means that the U.S.-led rules-based order will be invariably replaced with a regional and egalitarian arrangement in which 'all voices are heard.' Putin warns that the global domination by Western states, which are themselves engulfed in 'chaos, a systemic crisis,' is 'irreversibly passing away' because 'the course of history cannot be stopped.' This is not dialectical reasoning à la Hegel, for whom opposing forces are always reconcilable. Instead, it is evident that Marxist-Leninism is alive and well in the halls of the Kremlin, with the Russian leader praising, as his Soviet predecessors had done, the justice of a great ideological battle waged against imperialist powers on behalf of oppressed nations everywhere. In this Marxist-Leninist formulation, the West is perpetually on the brink of annihilation and its opponents need only strike while the iron is hot. Indeed, it was on the basis of Marxist theory that Lenin promised nearly a century ago that 'the epoch of capitalist imperialism is one of ripe and rotten-ripe capitalism, which is about to collapse.' Today, the bogeyman is no longer capitalism as such, but rather what Putin described at Valdai as the 'greed of those Western elites,' with 'elite' being today’s hip, populist term for 'bourgeois.' Indeed, it’s no coincidence that the military and economic cooperation among Russia, China, and North Korea mirrors that of the mid-twentieth century, when the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China worked together to bolster North Korea’s war against the U.S.-supported South—the first proxy conflict of the Cold War. Despite two world wars and the Great Depression, Western states didn’t collapse in the first half of the twentieth century and, considering America’s humming economy, aren’t poised to collapse any time soon. Putin’s intellectual sleight of hand relies on Valdai’s audience of 'experts' unquestioningly accepting his idiosyncratic version of history. On the one hand, the Russian leader coolly explains historical laws that cannot be altered, only observed. In this Hegelian conceptualization, Russia won’t need to aggressively confront the United States to establish multipolarity—the liberal world order will disintegrate on its own since 'any monopoly, as history teaches us, eventually comes to an end.' Remarking that the coming transformation 'is not even a fight for power or geopolitical influence,' Putin contends that the struggle against the West is entirely in the realm of ideas. On the other hand, however, Putin threatens kinetic action arising from the latter of two alternatives: either the West capitulates or there will be 'global catastrophe.' These are the sole possible outcomes because, as Putin said multiple times at Valdai, the collective West aims at the alleged 'strategic defeat of Russia' as evidenced by NATO expansion and economic sanctions against Russia. He then warned that the West’s crazed drive at nothing less than the total annihilation of the Russian nation risks 'mutual destruction' resulting from the use of nuclear forces and unspecified, technologically advanced weapons. Deploying his familiar tactic of studied ambiguity, evident in Russia’s revised nuclear doctrine and intended to sow public panic in the United States and its allies, Putin cautioned that 'nobody can guarantee that these weapons will not be used.' This is likely a reference to the hypersonic 'Oreshnik' missile that hit Dnipro exactly two weeks later. Here, the Russian president’s 'dialectical' logic reaches an impasse and betrays the Kremlin’s intentions: the global liberal order will collapse either because historical laws demand it or because Russian nuclear forces will blow it to smithereens. Put differently, history will be made one way or the other—and it will be made by the Kremlin. Of course, it was Lenin who had rejected Marx’s insistence on letting historical laws take their natural course, demonstrating that the movement of history can be hurried along with violence. The rival outcomes—Western collapse or Russia’s destruction—are phantoms of the Kremlin’s own making. But, despite Putin’s intellectual posturing, this is neither dialectic nor philosophy. It’s simply paranoia mixed with a strong dose of propaganda.

America’s Unprecedented Divisions Taint Holiday Season – OpEd	By Dalia Al-Aqidi A wave of targeted threats has disrupted the lives of key figures in President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming administration, as bomb scares and swatting hoaxes escalate tensions following a heated election season. The FBI has confirmed that several high-profile nominees and appointees have been deliberately targeted in a series of dangerous and politically charged incidents.Prominent cases include that of Lee Zeldin, the potential head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who received a pipe bomb threat accompanied by a politically motivated message. Meanwhile, the nominee for ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, was the focus of a swatting call — made to attract a police response to the target’s home — while she traveled for the holidays. Howard Lutnick, slated to be commerce secretary, received threats against his property in New York and former attorney general nominee Matt Gaetz’s home was the scene of a bomb squad response. The list also includes the incoming chief of staff, Susie Wiles.These events have raised alarm among the authorities, with the FBI working closely with local law enforcement agencies to investigate. The threats come amid heightened political tensions following a contentious election season, during which Trump survived two attempts on his life.President Joe Biden has condemned the incidents, stressing the importance of protecting individuals in public service from politically motivated violence. The escalation of such threats highlights the increasing risks political figures face in the current climate.Counterthreats have subsequently been directed at Democratic lawmakers. On Thanksgiving last week, multiple members of Congress in Connecticut became the targets of bomb threats, escalating the tense political climate in the country. Among those affected were Reps. Joe Courtney, Jahana Hayes, Jim Himes and John Larson. Authorities promptly responded to the threats at their homes and no explosives were found. Sen. Chris Murphy also faced a bomb scare at his residence, which was ultimately determined to be a hoax. Similarly, Rhode Island Rep. Seth Magaziner reported a swatting-style incident targeting his family.Notably, the messages accompanying the Democratic threats reportedly included references to 'MAGA,' heightening speculation about them being politically motivated retaliations.Americans today find themselves navigating an era of profound division, with political beliefs serving as both the catalyst and the battleground for an increasingly polarized society. These ideological divides permeate every aspect of public life, shaping debates on governance, cultural identity and the very definition of core national values.What was once a robust exchange of ideas has now devolved into entrenched partisanship, in which compromise is viewed as weakness and dialogue is too often replaced by confrontation.A recent Gallup poll illuminated Americans’ profound and growing perception that the nation is deeply divided on its fundamental values. This year, a record-high 80 percent of respondents reported feeling that the country is split on key principles, up from 77 percent in 2016. This sense of division has been steadily rising over the last two decades, with only 18 percent of Americans now believing the nation is united in its core values — a stark contrast to earlier periods in its history.The findings underscore a troubling trend in the American psyche, with division, rather than unity, becoming the defining characteristic of public sentiment. Notably, this was not always the case. In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a striking shift occurred, as more than two-thirds of Americans felt a sense of national solidarity. This was a rare moment when shared values and purpose seemed to transcend political and social divides. However, this unity was fleeting, as polarization returned and has since intensified.The Gallup poll captures the increasingly fractured landscape of American public opinion, shaped by various issues that have become lightning rods for discord — political ideologies, cultural debates, economic disparities and even differing views on what constitutes national identity. While these divisions have always existed to some degree, their current depth and persistence reflect a broader struggle to find common ground in a rapidly changing world.These findings have profound implications, not just for policymakers but for society at large. A nation perceived as divided risks undermining its ability to address pressing challenges effectively. A lack of trust and shared purpose can erode the democratic process, making it harder to enact meaningful change while weakening the country’s standing on the global stage.As the holiday season — a time traditionally marked by family reunions, goodwill and shared celebrations — unfolds, the US is grappling with a troubling narrative of division. This sacred season, which calls for reflection, understanding and unity, is being overshadowed by rhetoric that prioritizes political alienation over connection. Instead of fostering an environment that encourages families to bridge ideological divides, certain left-leaning media outlets have taken a different path, urging viewers and readers to boycott or distance themselves from family and friends who supported and voted for Trump.This approach not only deepens the divisions within families but also reflects a broader trend of demonizing dissent and discouraging constructive engagement. Political differences, while inevitable in a diverse democracy, should not overshadow the shared values that unite Americans. Family bonds, friendships and the human connections that underpin society must transcend partisanship to preserve the fabric of the nation. This schism is not merely a disagreement over policy, but also a reflection of deeper fractures in trust, perception and understanding between opposing camps. As the nation struggles to reconcile these differences, the challenge lies in rediscovering a shared commitment to unity without sacrificing the diversity of thought that is both a hallmark and a strength of American democracy.At a time when Americans face numerous challenges — ranging from economic uncertainty to global instability — the need for solidarity has never been greater.The holiday season offers a unique opportunity to pause, reflect and renew commitments to understanding one another, even in the face of disagreements. It is a call for all voices of influence — whether in media, politics or culture — to rise above division and embrace a message of reconciliation, urging Americans to rediscover the common humanity that binds them together.Only by prioritizing unity over discord can the nation move toward a more harmonious and hopeful future.

The Long War To Reaffirm Western And Israeli Primacy Undergoes A ...	The long war to reaffirm western and Israeli primacy is undergoing a shape-shift. On one front, the calculus in respect to Russia and the Ukraine war has shifted. And in the Middle East, the locus and shape of the war is shifting in a distinct way. Georges Kennan’s famed Soviet doctrine has long formed the baseline to U.S. policy, firstly directed toward the Soviet Union, and latterly, towards Russia. Kennan’s thesis from 1946 was that the United States needed to work patiently and resolutely to thwart the Soviet threat, and to enhance and aggravate the internal fissures in the Soviet system, until its contradictions triggered the collapse from within. More recently, the Atlantic Council has drawn on the Kennan doctrine to suggest that his broad outline should serve as the basis of U.S. policy towards Iran. 'The threat that Iran poses to the U.S. resembles the one faced from the Soviet Union after World War II. In this regard, the policy that George Kennan outlined for dealing with the Soviet Union has some applications for Iran', the Atlantic report states. Over the years, that doctrine has ossified into an entire network of security understandings, based on the archetypal conviction that America is strong, and that Russia was weak. Russia must ‘know that’, and thus, it was argued, there could be no logic for Russian strategists to imagine they had any other option but to submit to the overmatch represented by the combined military strength of NATO versus a ‘weak’ Russia. And should Russian strategists unwisely persevere with challenging the West, it was said, the inherent contrariety simply would cause Russia to fracture. American neocons and western intelligence have not listened to any other view, because they were (and largely still are) convinced by Kennan’s formulation. The American foreign policy class simply could not accept the possibility that such a core thesis was wrong. The entire approach reflected more a deep-seated culture, rather than any rational analysis – even when visible facts on the ground pointed them to a different reality. So, America has piled the pressure on Russia through the incremental delivery of additional weapons systems to Ukraine; through stationing intermediate range nuclear-capable missiles ever-closer to Russia’s borders; and most recently, by shooting ATACMS into ‘old Russia’. The aim has been to pressure Russia into a situation where it would feel obliged to make concessions to Ukraine, such as a to accept a freezing of the conflict, and to be obliged to negotiate against Ukrainian bargaining ‘cards’ devised to yield a solution acceptable to the U.S. Or, alternatively, for Russia to be cornered into the ‘nuclear corner’. American strategy ultimately rests on the conviction that the U.S. could engage in a nuclear war with Russia – and prevail; that Russia understands that were it to go nuclear, it would ‘lose the world’. Or, pressured by NATO, the anger amongst Russians likely would sweep Putin from office were he to make significant concessions to Ukraine. It was a ‘win-win’ outcome – from the U.S. perspective. Unexpectedly however, a new weapon appeared on the scene which precisely unshackles President Putin from the ‘all-or-nothing’ choice of having to concede a bargaining ‘hand’ to Ukraine, or resort to nuclear deterrence. Instead, the war can be settled by facts on the ground. Effectively, the George Kennan ‘trap’ imploded. The Oreshnik missile (that was used to attack the Yuzhmash complex at Dnietropetrovsk) provides Russia with a weapon, such as never before witnessed: An intermediate range missile system that effectively checkmates the western nuclear threat. Russia can now manage western escalation with a credible threat of retaliation that is both hugely destructive – yet conventional. It inverts the paradigm. It is now the West’s escalation that either has to go nuclear, or be limited to providing Ukraine with weapons such as ATACMS or Storm Shadow that will not alter the course of the war. Were NATO to escalate further, it risks an Oreshnik strike in retaliation, either in Ukraine or on some target in Europe, leaving the West with the dilemma of what to do next. Putin has warned: ‘If you strike again in Russia, we will respond with an Oreshnik hit on a military facility in another nation. We will provide warning, so that civilians can evacuate. There is nothing that you can do to prevent this; you do not have an anti-missile system that can stop an attack coming in at Mach 10’. The tables are turned. Of course, there are other reasons beyond the permanent security cadre’s wish to Gulliverise Trump into continuing the war in Ukraine, in order to taint him with a war that he promised immediately to end. Particularly the British, and others in Europe, want the war to continue, because they are on the financial hook from their holdings of some $20 billion Ukrainian bonds which are in a ‘default-like status’, or from their guarantees to the IMF for loans to Ukraine. Europe simply cannot afford the costs of a full default. Neither can Europe afford to pick up the burden, were the Trump Administration to walk away from supporting Ukraine financially. So they collude with the U.S. interagency structure to make the continuation of the war proofed against a Trump policy reversal: Europe for financial motives, and the Deep State because it wants to disrupt Trump, and his domestic agenda. The other wing to the ‘global war’ reflects a mirror paradox: That is, ‘Israel is strong and Iran is weak’. The central point is not only its cultural underpinning, but that the entire Israeli and U.S. apparatus is party to the narrative that Iran is a weak and technically backward country. The most significant aspect is the multi-year failure as regards factors such as the skill to understand strategies, and recognize changes in the other sides’ capabilities, views and understandings. Russia seems to have solved some of the general physical problems of objects flying at hypersonic speed. The use of new composite materials has made it possible to enable the gliding cruise bloc to make a long-distance guided flight practically in conditions of plasma formation. It flies to its target like a meteorite; like a ball of fire. The temperature on its surface reaches 1,600–2,000 degrees Celsius but the cruise bloc is reliably guided. And Iran seems to have solved the problems associated with an adversary enjoying air dominance. Iran has created a deterrence fashioned from the evolution of cheap swarms drones matched up with Ballistic missiles carrying precision hypersonic warheads. It puts $1,000 drones and cheap, precision missiles up and against hugely expensive piloted airframes – An inversion of warfare that has been twenty years in the making. The Israeli war however, is metamorphosing in other ways. The war in Gaza and Lebanon has strained Israeli manpower; the IDF have sustained heavy losses; its troops are exhausted; and the reservists are losing commitment to Israel’s wars, and are failing to show up for duty. Israel has reached the limits of its capacity to put boots on the ground (short of conscripting the Orthodox Haredi Yeshiva students – an act that could bring down the Coalition). In short, the Israeli army’s troop levels have fallen below present command ordered military commitments. The economy is imploding and internal divisions are raw and bruising. This is especially so due to the inequity of secular Israelis dying, whilst others stay exempt from military service – a destiny reserved for some but not others. This tension played a major part in Netanyahu’s decision to agree to a ceasefire in Lebanon. The growing animus about Orthodox Haredi exemption risked bringing down the Coalition. There are – metaphorically speaking – now two Israels: The Kingdom of Judea versus the State of Israel. In view of such deep antagonisms, many Israelis now see war with Iran as the catharsis that will bind a fractured people together again, and – if victorious – end all of Israel’s wars. Outside, the war widens and shape-shifts: Lebanon, for now, is put on a low flame burner, but Turkey has triggered a major military operation (reportedly some 15,000 strong) in an attack on Aleppo, using U.S. and Turkish trained jihadists and militia from Idlib. Turkish Intelligence no doubt has its own distinct objectives, but the U.S. and Israel have a particular interest to disrupt weapons supply routes to Hizbullah in Lebanon. The Israeli wanton onslaught on non-combatants, women and children – and its explicit ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian population – has left the region (and the Global South) seething and radicalised. Israel, through its actions, is disrupting the old ethos. The region is ‘conservative’ no more. Rather, a very different ‘Awakening’ is gestating.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5qrlxG7vNvOO	2024-12-02T15:55:33-08:00	
Maritime Deal With China: Observers Unimpressed As Indonesian Min...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus Indonesia’s foreign minister on Monday responded to concerned lawmakers that a recent joint maritime development deal with China did not recognize Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea, but analysts said his explanations were a weak justification for a serious error. A joint statement issued after a meeting last month in Beijing between new Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Chinese President Xi Jinping said the two countries had reached an 'important common understanding on joint development in areas of overlapping claims.' However, Jakarta had consistently rejected China’s sweeping claims in the contested South China Sea, which encroaches into Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) north of the Natuna islands. During a parliamentary hearing on Monday, Indonesian legislator Sukamta said these Chinese claims, which are represented on its maps by a so-called nine-dash line, are changed by Beijing as it pleases. 'Previously it was nine dashes, now it’s 10,' said the legislator who goes by one name. 'We must be firm in asserting our rights. … Without clear boundaries, we risk being manipulated by China,' he said. Sukamta called for more clarity on the geographical scope of the development agreement mentioned in the text of the joint statement issued after Prabowo met with Xi. China’s claims in the South China Sea overlap those of five Asian nations and Taiwan. And in what many analysts back then saw as a political message, Jakarta in 2017 renamed the southern reaches of the South China Sea the North Natuna Sea to emphasize its sovereignty over those waters encompassing natural gas fields. Another Indonesian lawmaker, Farah Puteri Nahlia, echoed Sukamta’s concerns. 'We all understand that China is Indonesia’s key trading partner, but we should not become overly dependent,' Farah said. 'What steps will the foreign ministry take to ensure we maintain our non-aligned stance? We must aim for not only free trade but fair trade, while safeguarding our EEZ amidst these tensions.' Already, during the first week of Prabowo’s presidency in October, Indonesian naval and coast guard ships confronted and expelled a Chinese coast guard ship from its EEZ in the North Natuna Sea on three occasions. China has in recent years also opposed Indonesia’s oil and gas exploration activities in its EEZ. This agreement comes amid escalating tensions in the South China Sea region, a crucial maritime route for global commerce. ‘50% of nothing is still nothing’ Foreign Minister Sugiono responded to lawmakers’ concerns saying that the joint statement did not recognize China’s nine-dash line. 'The text itself is clear – it does not imply any such recognition,' Sugiono, who goes by one name, told lawmakers. 'The specifics, including the locations and terms of the cooperation, have not yet been defined. This is merely a preliminary agreement and the details will be worked out later.' He also said joint cooperation was President Prabowo’s plan 'as part of efforts to reduce tensions and maximize resource utilization,' and had been discussed with leaders of neighboring countries. 'The core principle is that President Prabowo has directed us to enhance cooperation with our neighboring countries for mutual benefit, while upholding Indonesia’s sovereignty,' Sugiono said. He said Indonesia’s position on sovereignty remained unchanged, noting that the joint development agreement would be guided by international law and Indonesia’s interests. 'Indonesia's stance remains unchanged, as do the positions of its neighbors. However, the principle stands: 50% of nothing is still nothing,' Sugiono further said. 'If there is no way to derive benefit from these resources for our nation's interests, it is better to collaborate while strictly adhering to fundamental principles and maintaining sovereignty.' ‘Little room for multiple interpretations’ For foreign policy analyst Mohamad Rosyidin, these explanations from Sugiono did not explain the crux of the problem – why the joint statement included the phrase 'overlapping claims.' 'The statement is merely an excuse for the blunder in the joint statement. It's unlikely the government will admit to that mistake,' Rosyidin, of Diponegoro University, told BenarNews. 'Just because we want to collaborate with China in the South China Sea doesn't mean Indonesia should shift from a rule-based approach to pragmatism.' The Indonesian government should remain consistent with the nation’s stance on the South China Sea, he said. 'The real problem is that Chinese vessels frequently enter Natuna waters. However, this does not mean there is an overlapping claim; it is a violation of sovereignty by China.' Another international relations analyst, Muhammad Waffaa Kharisma, concurred. 'I am among those who believe there is little room for multiple interpretations of the joint statement between President Prabowo and President Xi Jinping regarding overlapping claims,' he told BenarNews. 'Regardless of how it is responded to or justified, I see the initial phrasing in the agreement as a concession by Indonesia, yielding or compromising with China.' He said the problematic text could have an effect on Indonesia, if not immediately then in the near future. 'Whether intentional or not is a secondary matter. Intentional or not, there will be impacts on Indonesia’s sovereign rights. … especially if there are no serious efforts for reversal through follow-up measures or statements,' he said. Such a concession may ease any tensions between Indonesia and China, but it strengthens Beijing’s hand and gives the impression Jakarta is yielding to the major power, he said. 'Currently, the foreign minister and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are in damage-control mode. The potential for conflict and unilateral claims are two sides of the same coin,' he said. 'The only positive aspect is that the initiative has not yet materialized, as mentioned by the foreign minister.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5njMTn9BMub5	2024-12-02T15:52:24-08:00	
NATO Rejects Pristina’s Request For Kosovar Deployment To North	(RFE/RL) -- NATO's mission in Kosovo says it has withheld authorization for a request by Pristina to deploy the ethnically fractured country's national security body, the Kosovo Security Force (KSF), to the Serb-majority northern region where an explosion last week damaged a water canal and ratcheted up tensions. Kosovar officials have accused neighboring Serbia of involvement, without providing evidence -- a charge Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic rejected before vowing to conduct an investigation and hinting cryptically, 'We have information about who might be the perpetrator.'NATO's KFOR mission confirmed to RFE/RL's Kosovo Service on December 1 that Kosovar authorities had asked to deploy the KSF to the northern area of Zubin Potok, a region where the transatlantic alliance and European civilian mission EULEX have helped keep the peace for years.'The KFOR Commander has not given such authorization, based on his security assessment and the actions already undertaken by KFOR,' the NATO force said in a written response.Serbia rejects independence for its former province, and decade-old talks facilitated by the European Union to normalize relations between Pristina and Belgrade have largely stalled.Belgrade has long maintained parallel institutions in northern Kosovo that serve the tens of thousands of Serbs there who mostly reject Kosovar central authority.Pristina has essentially pledged since a 2013 agreement not to deploy its mostly ethnically Albanian forces to the northern region without KFOR's prior consent.Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti called the November 29 blast that damaged the canal supplying water to his country's two main coal power plants a 'criminal and terrorist attack' by northern neighbor and bitter rival Serbia.The attack did not cause any casualties but threatened power disruption as the region hunkers down for the onset of winter.Drinking water supplies to Pristina were also said to be at risk. 'KFOR has deployed units to secure the Zobin Potok area of the damaged water canal,' KFOR told RFE/RL. 'KFOR has also offered additional assistance to the Institutions in Kosovo, including logistical and explosive ordnance disposal support.'It said it was in contact with all key partners and was monitoring events.At a press conference late on December 1, Kurti avoided saying whether he had sought KFOR permission for a deployment but acknowledged Pristina was 'constrained' by the 2013 deal. The next day, Kurti invited foreign envoys for a meeting to discuss the situation. Afterward, U.S. Ambassador to Pristina Jeffrey Hovenier said Washington doesn't know who was behind the attack. But, he added, 'Once it is...determined who is responsible, we will work with the proper authorities to ensure that they are held accountable.'Kurti, whose ruling Self-Determination Movement (Vetëvendosje) is facing national elections next year, has spent much of the past year squeezing out dinar payments, Serbian postal and banking ties, and other Serbian-dominated aspects of everyday life in northern Kosovo.EU and U.S. officials have repeatedly warned his government to refrain from unilateral and potentially provocative steps.The explosion in the village of Varrage, in the Zubin Potok municipality, created a large crack in the Iber-Lepenc canal.The waterway, which originates at Ujman (Gazivoda) Lake, supplies water to the entire northern region of Kosovo, the Mitrovica regions, and Pristina and its surroundings, including the Kosovo Energy Corporation for cooling its power plants.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5szy4Mi_i3JL	2024-12-02T15:51:23-08:00	
The Carbon Soil Opportunity: Organic Farming Helps Counter Climat...	Switching to organic products is an easy way to eat healthier and support the environment. Climate change is no longer an abstraction. I can literally see it at my front door. My figs ripened in October 2024, which has never happened before as it was never warm enough during that month. In my home state of Oregon, wildfires set new records this year, with almost 2 million acres burned. Meanwhile, in my hometown, Eugene, we had the longest stretch of consecutive days when temperatures reached at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. It's hard for me to think about the world that I will leave to my grandchildren. So I look for what I can do, and believe it or not, there's hope right at the grocery store; buying organic can contribute to combating climate change. Organic farmers actually store carbon in the soil, meaning there's less in the air to change our climate. A series of long-term studies mentioned below demonstrate that organic farming increases soil carbon. In other words, organic farming is carbon farming. Federal law defines organic farming as a farming method, so we know what we're buying. Organic farmers use cover crops, mulches, and crop rotations to build healthy soil. They utilize various techniques to prevent pest problems, using only certain pesticides, which have been thoroughly reviewed as a last resort. You can support carbon farming by buying organic. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2023 Synthesis Report states that carbon sequestration in agriculture has one of the highest potentials for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon sequestration, or carbon farming, uses farming techniques to increase soil carbon, keeping it out of the atmosphere (For more details about carbon farming and farmers who are using the method, see 'How Land Use Is a Tool for Solving Climate Change' and 'Carbon Farming: A Sustainable Agriculture Technique That Keeps Soil Healthy and Combats Climate Change.') Referring to the IPCC recommendations, the World Economic Forum's November 2024 article states, '[E]nhancing soil carbon sequestration through regenerative agriculture could sequester up to 23 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050, a substantial portion of the mitigation required to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.' Studies on Organic Farming and Soil Carbon—the Big Picture Organic carbon farming has been documented by scientists for decades. In 2012, researchers from Switzerland, Scotland, and Italy published a meta-analysis of 74 studies that were pairwise comparisons of organic and conventional farms growing various crops around the world—from all continents except for Africa and Antarctica. The researchers measured soil carbon in three ways (if the underlying study provided the necessary data): the soil carbon concentration, the amount of soil carbon per unit area, and the rate at which the soil carbon measurements changed. They found that for all three measurements, soil carbon was greater at the organic farms than conventional farms. They concluded that 'organic farming has the potential to accumulate soil carbon.' Meanwhile, a 2017 study by Northeastern University and the Organic Center—which studied more than 1,000 soil samples from both organic and conventional farms across 48 states in the U.S.—'found that organic soils had 13 percent higher soil organic matter and 44 percent higher long-term carbon storage than conventionally managed soils.' Crops That May Be on Your Grocery List Eating organic fruits and vegetables is better for the environment and has overall health benefits. 'Not only does organic production help reduce public health risks, mounting evidence shows that food grown organically are rich in nutrients, such as Vitamin C, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus, with less exposure to nitrates and pesticide residues in organically grown fruits, vegetables, and grains when compared to conventionally grown products,' states the Organic Trade Association. Below is a list of popular items we regularly purchase from grocery stores. I chose these products because they are foods that most of us buy often. For each food, There is at least one study showing that choosing organic can help support carbon sequestration and, therefore, allows us to play our part in combating climate change: Corn A 2015 review article examined six long-term organic and conventional corn farming comparisons. Each study involved one site, with some plots managed organically and others managed conventionally. Four studies were done in the Midwest, one in California, and one in Maryland. All the studies grew corn in rotation with other crops. The studies were initiated between 1981 and 1998, and these plots had been continuously used for farming between 10 and 24 years when soil carbon was measured. In five of the six studies, soil carbon capture increased in instances of organic treatments compared to conventional treatments. (The one exception was a plot that used to be a dairy farm and had high soil carbon levels at the beginning of the study.) The review article concludes, 'These results suggest that organic farming practices have the potential to reduce nitrate leaching, foster carbon sequestration, and allow farmers to remain competitive in the marketplace.' Wheat An 11-year comparison of organic and conventional wheat farming (with other crops grown in rotation) in Nebraska found that soil organic matter (one way to measure carbon) was higher in the organic plots than in conventional plots. Tomato (in rotation with corn) California's Century Experiment has compared organic and conventional tomato (and corn) farming since 1993. Measurements of soil organic carbon showed that the concentrations in organic plots were two to three times higher than in the conventional plots. The study authors noted that the increases occurred throughout the soil profile, down to a depth of 6 feet. Potato (in rotation with wheat and corn) A long-term field study in Switzerland that compared organic and conventional farming systems showed that soil organic carbon was higher in the organic plots. The researchers collected soil samples over two decades after the experiment started. A study in Germany found that while carbon was sequestered in the organic plots for more than 15 years, in the conventional plots, the soil lost carbon. Almonds In 2018 and 2019, researchers in California compared eight conventional almond orchards with eight organic orchards. (The researchers identified the organic orchards as 'regenerative,' but all were certified organic.) The trees in the orchards had been growing for between three and 38 years. Total soil carbon was about 30 percent greater in organic orchards than in conventional orchards. The researchers concluded: 'Our results support the notion that converting agriculture to regenerative systems could contribute to remediating several imminent global problems, including climate change diminishing water resources, biodiversity loss, agricultural pollution, human health problems, and diminishing rural economies.' Strawberries (in rotation with broccoli and lettuce) In 2004 and 2005, researchers, mainly from Washington State University, compared 13 pairs of organic and conventional strawberry farms in Watsonville, California. The farms had been either organic or conventional for at least five years. They found that the amount of carbon in the soil from organic farms was higher than 21 percent compared to conventional farms. Apples Scientists from Washington State University and the United States Agency for International Development compared conventional and organic apple production in a commercial orchard in the Yakima Valley. Trees were planted in 1994, and soil measurements were taken in 1998. At that time, soil organic carbon in the organic plots was about 15 percent higher than in the conventional plots. Citrus Two studies, one from Brazil and the other from Italy, showed that total organic soil carbon was higher in organic citrus orchards than in conventional orchards. The increase in soil carbon was 30 percent in the Italian study and 300 percent in some Brazilian measurements. Extra Benefits Organic farming benefits people who grow and harvest food because they are exposed to fewer pesticides. According to a 2024 study from California, researchers looked for seven common herbicides and two fungicides in carpet dust from homes in the Central Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area. The frequency at which each pesticide was detected and its amount increased in homes where larger amounts of pesticides were used nearby. None of these pesticides are used on organic farms. 'Our findings suggest that most of these herbicides and fungicides travel from the field via primary and secondary drift to homes in the surrounding area, potentially impacting the health of children and other vulnerable groups,' the study published in Environmental International states. Organic farming also benefits those of us who eat the food. In 2024, Consumer Reports (CR) analyzed pesticide contamination of 59 common fruits and vegetables. The data came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, spanning seven years, and included both conventional and organic produce. The analysis by CR found that pesticide contamination posed significant risks in 20 percent of conventional foods but in almost none of the organic foods. Eating more organic produce ensures a healthier diet. Tackling a Global Problem With Personal Choices Climate change is an enormous and complex problem, and the solutions are also complex. There's no single silver bullet that can fix the crisis, including carbon farming. Even its proponents state that converting power generation to solar or wind energy and reducing the destruction of natural ecosystems are more significant measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, while organic food is sometimes hard to find and more expensive, it is a relatively simple step that many of us can incorporate into our daily lives, providing a crucial opportunity to help mitigate climate change.

Biden’s First Trip To Africa Should’ve Come Earlier In Presidency...	By Mariama Diallo After promising to visit Africa two years ago at the U.S. Africa summit in Washington, President Joe Biden makes his first presidential trip to the continent where he is visiting Angola with a quick stop in Cabo Verde. Analysts in Africa say the trip should’ve come sooner and some are asking why Angola is the primary destination – given its troubling human rights record. White House officials say President Joe Biden is looking forward to visiting the continent after a promise he made in 2022. But some analysts tell VOA that Biden’s trip, which comes weeks before he steps down, would’ve had more weight if he had done it earlier. Louw Nel, senior political analyst for Oxford Economics Africa, spoke to VOA from South Africa. 'I think his trip is less significant than it would’ve been otherwise just because of the fact that he withdrew as presidential candidate and, of course, now [is] not returning for a second term. So, it really feels like an afterthought to his presidency,' said Nel. After a short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde off Africa’s northwestern coast, President Biden heads south to Angola. There, officials say he plans to focus on U.S. leadership on trade, investment, and infrastructure in Africa. He’ll also recognize Angola’s President João Lourenço’s regional leadership and global partnership on trade, security, and health. More importantly, President Biden will highlight one of his signature initiatives, the investment of the Lobito Corridor — a regional railway project linking natural resource-rich areas stretching from the Angolan port of Lobito to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. The corridor is part of a wider joint effort between multiple partners aimed at closing the infrastructure gap in growing economies around the world, officials say. Dr. Frances Brown, special assistant to the president and senior director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking about the broader benefits associated with the project. 'What I found really notable about the Lobito Corridor is that it isn’t just about a railroad or critical minerals. It’s also about the communities that are strengthened along the way, it’s about more access to education, it’s about agricultural products moving to market, and it’s about increases in digital connectivity,' said Brown. Last year, U.S.-Angola trade totaled approximately $1.77 billion, making Angola America’s fourth-largest trade partner in Sub-Saharan Africa. Angola has vast mineral deposits and is Africa’s third largest oil producer. But according to Amnesty International, the country’s natural resource wealth has not translated to prosperity for most of its people, resulting in numerous peaceful protests against poverty, unemployment and high cost of living. Nel says some Angolans may see a benefit with this Biden visit. 'Many ordinary Angolans will recognize that Angola desperately needs to diversify its economy, and this is an enormous opportunity to do so, to move away from oil and gas and bolster other parts of the economy and it has massive potential,' said Nel. But others including human rights campaigners and opposition parties, Nel says, will feel aggrieved by President Biden’s visit because they see the Lourenco administration as being rewarded despite growing concerns about the shrinking space for independent civil society organizations and freedom of expression. In a new report, Amnesty International said that anyone who publicly criticizes the Lourenço government risks arrest. And 'if human rights are central to President Biden’s foreign policy, then he must demand Angola’s government immediately …free arbitrarily detained government critics.' Adriano Nuvunga, who runs the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Mozambique, echoes that sentiment. 'I commend the people of Angola and president Lourenço for hosting President Biden. It means a lot for the people of Angola. While I commend them, I would also want to encourage President Biden to ask those tough questions to President João Lourenço,' said Nuvunga. 'We have a number of human rights defenders in Angola that are detained unjustly, unfairly for doing nothing. They are languishing in jails, some of them in critical conditions,' said Nuvunga. Nuvunga hopes that this could be addressed during this trip.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5kLVxs5HAIk-	2024-12-02T15:44:11-08:00	
Pakistan: TTP Mercenary Terror – Analysis	By Sanchita Bhattacharya As reported on November 25, 2024, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) threatened to begin attacking Chinese Belt and Road development projects unless the government paid them a 5 per cent tax on the construction. In a video message, the 'commander' of the Taliban's Gandapur faction warned that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project would be destroyed. 'Five per cent is our tax everywhere,' the 'commander' declared in an address to construction workers in Dera Ismail Khan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). 'Machinery and staff will be targeted' by Taliban fighters if the taxes are not paid, he added. As reported on November 19, Shahzaib, a resident of Charsadda District had received a text on TTP's letterhead in October (date not specified), and paid up a reduced amount of the USD 50,000 the militants initially demanded, after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. On October 25, 2024, the guesthouse of a former Senator, Saleh Shah, located in South Waziristan District's Tiarza tehsil (revenue unit), was completely levelled in a blast after 'unidentified attackers' reportedly planted explosives at the residence. Shah told Police that he had been receiving extortion calls from unknown people who had been threatening him and his family with 'dire consequences'. As reported on September 7, Dr. Muhammad Yousuf from Shaukat Khanum Hospital was abducted from the Bhatta Khusht Bazar in the Achini Road area of Peshawar, and a ransom of PKR 50 million was demanded, before he was finally recovered by the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD) and Police from the Khyber tribal District after ten days in captivity. On August 28, 2024, Lieutenant Colonel Khalid Amir and three of his relatives were kidnapped by TTP from the Kalach area of Dera Ismail Khan District. Later, in September, they were released following a ransom payment and the release of some TTP cadres in detention. A September 30, 2024, report indicated that, during 2024, 98 cases of extortion were reported in KP. The President of the KP Chamber of Commerce, Fawad Ishaq, stated, 'No one is willing to invest here due to the risk of extortion and terrorism. In recent times, 10 out of 12 textile mills in KP have been closed due to extortion, while about a hundred manufacturers have shifted their business abroad to countries like the USA, UK, Vietnam, Malaysia, UAE and Turkey. Similarly, around 800 small units in the province have also been closed due to the law and order situation… ' As reported on November, 19, the southern districts of KP have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcement personnel. In the evening, militants are seen watching the streets and setting up checkpoints in the Districts of Tank, Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, and North and South Waziristan. While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well off people in other Districts of the province regularly get threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from TTP - with demands to pay or face attacks. Apart from extortion, the terrorists are also involved in generating funds through narcotics trafficking. TTP, in particular, benefits from this illicit trade, using drug money to finance terrorist operations. The Taliban's rule in Afghanistan has further bolstered the TTP, with drug trafficking acting as a lifeline for both groups. As reported on October 2, 2024, TTP and Lashkar-i-Islam continue to make their presence felt in parts of Tirah Valley as they have started asking the leading local narcotics dealers for a 'share' in their earnings from the recently harvested cannabis crop. Earlier, as reported on July 28, 2024, TTP generated 'revenue' from the Khyber District, extorting as much as 20 per cent to 30 per cent from major drug producers or dealers in the District. TTP imposed a tax of PKR 5,000 on every kilogramme of hashish (cannabis) produced/trafficked through the District. Also, as reported on August 10, 2024, Pakistan Taliban terrorists have engaged in robbing of bank vehicles carrying cash. A disturbing connection has emerged between these acts of violence and financial networks that funnel money to terrorist factions operating in Afghanistan, through hawala and hundi (illegal money laundering channels) in the provinces of Laghman and Khost. Several incidents of robbery of bank vehicles have been reported in Dera Ismail Khan District: on August 8, 2024, PKR 8.8 million was looted from a bank cash van; PKR 40 million on July 30; and PKR eight million on July 8. A September 10 report indicated that TTP was currently active in 10 of KP's 34 districts. In the North Waziristan District, TTP fighters force locals to feed them, and extort businessmen and wealthy landowners. July 2024 reports stated that contractors working on government-sponsored projects in North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, Bajaur, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, and Mohmand were believed to be paying anywhere from 5 per cent to 15 per cent to TTP. Earlier on July 22, 2024, in a jirga (tribal council) of the elders of Bannu District, it was demanded that all centres of surrendered Taliban be ended permanently, as well as the elimination of 'patrolling/ picketing by Taliban forthwith', because Taliban's patrolling, extortion of money and checking of documents undermined the writ of the Pakistani state, strengthening the impression that the government was either unwilling or incapable of protecting citizens from the terrorists. Nevertheless, the situation in KP continues to deteriorate rapidly. The social and financial disruption caused by TTP terrorists in the province is a clear indication of a bleak future, showcasing the failures of the Pakistani state. Moreover, with constant support from the Afghan Taliban, and a fighting force of an estimated 6,000-6,500 TTP fighters sheltering in Afghanistan, the group is a severe threat to the administration. The TTP, moreover, has a maximalist agenda, seeking to overthrow the existing government in order to establish an Islamic Emirate of Pakistan. The ideology that Pakistan has long promoted has now boomeranged, threatening the very existence of the state itself.

India: PLFI Residual Nuisance – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On November 24, 2024, two youths, identified as Ravi Tanti (22) and Ghansa Topno, were killed by suspected cadres of the People's Liberation Front of India (PLFI), a splinter group of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist), in Giru village under the Gudri subdivision in West Singhbhum District, Jharkhand. A Naxalite [Left Wing extremist, LWE] poster found on a tree at the village square, called for a halt to sand extraction from Peding in Gudri to Serengda in Goilkera. While confirming the contents of the poster, the Police were probing its connection to the killings. Another two other persons were abducted by PLFI cadres from the village, Police said. Earlier, on March 18, 2024, Matiyas aka Mangra Tuti (25), a PLFI supporter, was shot dead allegedly by its cadres in a weekly market in Gundri village under Anandpur Police Station limits in West Singhbhum District. Matiyas was a former cadre who had eight criminal cases registered against him and had been jailed. He was released from prison a couple of months earlier. He had come to the haat (weekly market) in Gundri village, when he was shot dead over a money-related dispute, the police disclosed. PLFI received a major shock following the arrest of Dinesh Gope aka Kuldeep Yadav aka Badku (51), the PLFI 'supremo', and its disruptive activities had almost come to a halt. Gope was arrested in a joint operation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Jharkhand Police in New Delhi on May 21, 2023. However, the recent incidents indicate that PLFI cadres are again pushing hard to make their presence felt in their erstwhile areas of activity. According to partial data collated by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), three PLFI-linked fatalities (all civilians) have been recorded in 2024, thus far (data till December 1). During the corresponding period of 2023, two fatalities (one civilian and one PLFI cadre) were recorded, while no further PLFI-linked fatalities were registered in the remaining period of 2023. A maximum of 30 PLFI-linked fatalities (14 civilians and 16 PLFI cadres) were recorded in 2016. PLFI-linked fatalities have subsequently followed a cyclical trend, dropping to 21 fatalities (eight civilians, two SFs and 11 PLFI cadres) in 2017, and further fell to nine (five civilians and four PLFI cadres) in 2018. The fatalities spiked to 12 (two civilians and 10 PLFI cadres) in 2019 and then declined to 10 (one civilian and nine PLFI cadres) in 2020. There were two fatalities (both PLFI cadres) in 2021, one (PLFI cadre) in 2022, two (one civilian and one PLFI cadre) in 2023 and three (all civilians) in 2024 (data till December 1). Significantly, since July 2007, when PLFI was formed, a total of 225 fatalities, including 115 civilians, seven SF personnel and 103 PLFI cadres, have been documented. Analysis of other crucial parameters suggest that the PLFI's operational capacities have suffered severely over the past few years due to an SF crackdown against the outfit in the state. Indeed, no major incidents (each resulting in three or more fatalities) involving the PLFI has been reported in 2023 and 2024. The last such incident was recorded on May 28, 2020, when three PLFI cadres, including a woman, were killed, while a fourth was injured in an exchange of fire with SFs in the Tabo Valley of the Manmandubera Forest area under Tabo Police Station limits in the West Singhbhum District. Further, no incident of explosion has been carried out by the group in 2024, as, indeed, in the previous seven years. The last such incident was recorded on October 16, 2016, when suspected PLFI cadres blew up two concrete sleepers on railway tracks, detonating an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) between Khelari and McCluskieganj stations in Ranchi District. However, PLFI's petty criminal and disruptive activities persist. Taking action against PLFI, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) also sped up cases related to the group. The NIA chargesheeted four accused in two cases, and also conducted raids on premises of suspects who had links with PLFI. On October 5, 2024, the NIA chargesheeted Kapil Pathak aka Rana Singh aka Arjun Rana aka Pandit Ji of district Dhemaji, Assam, and Binod Munda aka Sukhu aka Dahura of Khunti, Jharkhand, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), in a case related to the revival and strengthening of PLFI in Jharkhand and neighbouring states. NIA had registered the case RC-04/2023/NIA/RNC suo motu in October 2023 in connection with the involvement of PLFI cadres in generating funds through extortion from various coal traders, transporters, railway contractors, businessmen, etc., in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha. These members of PLFI had also conspired to commit various terrorist activities, including murder, arson and violent attacks, to create terror, especially among businessmen and contractors. During investigation, NIA had also recovered a country-made rifle, a country-made pistol, 57 rounds of 7.62 MM prohibited ammunition and 20 rounds of .315 (8mm), from Binod Munda. The arms and ammunition had been supplied by Kapil Pathak, investigations had revealed. On June 11, 2024, NIA filed a chargesheet against Nivesh Kumar aka Nivesh Poddar, and Raman Kumar Sonu aka Sonu Pandit, in the case of strengthening the PLFI. Further, on August 7, 2024, the NIA conducted searches at two locations in the Khunti district of Jharkhand in a PLFI extortion and terrorism racket. Premises of suspects with links to PLFI were searched by NIA teams, and several incriminating digital devices and documents were seized. The case, RC-04/2023/NIA/RNC, related to extortion from various coal traders, transporters, railway contractors, businessmen, etc., by PLFI cadres in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These cadres had also conspired to commit various terrorist acts, including murder, arson and violent attacks. Additionally, on April 10, 2024, the NIA arrested an armed PLFI cadre, following raids at two locations each in Jharkhand and Assam. The crackdown led to the arrest of Binod Munda aka Sukkhwa from the Khunti District of Jharkhand. The accused was wanted in four PLFI cases in Jharkhand and has been arrested in a case relating to revival attempts by PLFI. As part of their revival activities, PLFI cadres had been involved in generating funds through extortion from various coal traders, transporters, railway contractors, and businessmen in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. NIA teams seized incriminating material, including PLFI-related documents, two walkie-talkies, five mobile phones, SIM cards and INR 11,000 cash, during the searches. SFs conducting raids in the state have arrested at least four PLFI cadres since the beginning of the current year, according to the SATP database (data till December 1, 2024). During the corresponding period of 2023, 32 PLFI cadres had been arrested. A total of 34 PLFI cadres were arrested through 2023. Since July 2007, when PLFI was formed, at least 768 PLFI cadres have been arrested. Mounting SF pressure has also led to in the surrender of 32 PLFI cadres since July 2007, though not a single surrender has been recorded in 2024 yet; the last surrender was recorded on March 11, 2018. Concerns persist as some of the leadership elements are still on the Jharkhand Police rewarded Naxal list Martin Kerketta, 'regional commander,' with a head bounty of INR 1.5 million; Balram Lohra aka Jatu aka Majnu, and Krishna Yadav aka Toofan ji aka Sultan Munda, 'area commanders,' carrying head bounties of INR 200,000 each; and Samuel Budh aka Samu, a Local Guerilla Squad (LGS) member, carrying head bounty of INR 100,000, have managed to evade the Police dragnet till now. PLFI has certainly lost its sway in erstwhile areas of dominance, especially after the arrest of Dinesh Gope, but retain some disruptive capacities, visible in incidents of violence perpetrated against civilians. The residual leadership elements that continue to evade the police remain a threat to public security, and a nuisance for the state.

Spanish Socialists Unite Behind Sánchez To ‘Resist’ Right, Far-Ri...	By Fernando Heller (EurActiv) -- The Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE/S&D) showed its determination to 'resist' in the face of renewed right-wing and far-right attacks against Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who was re-elected leader of the progressive party by a large majority at a party meeting in Seville. Sánchez's PSOE closed its 41st federal congress with a strong message of unity following the repeated attacks on Sánchez by the main opposition force and the third-largest force in parliament, Partido Popular (EPP) and the far-right Vox (Patriots for Europe). Speaking at the opening of the party conference, Sánchez was optimistic about his term in office, which will end in 2027 unless early elections are called. 'The best is yet to come. We have to keep moving forward, out of responsibility and out of hope. FOR THE LEFT', the Spanish prime minister said on Saturday. Despite Sanchez's optimism, the left-wing government faces a serious obstacle to maintaining its precarious stability: it must convince the right-wing Catalan separatist JxCatparty of former regional president Carles Puigdemont, to vote in favour of the 2025 national budget, among other challenges related to the issue of Catalonia. In a speech on Saturday, Spanish Finance Minister María Jesús Montero slammed the right-wing camp and Vox for their aggressive stance against the Spanish prime minister. 'We are going to come out of this congress new, committed, reinforced, as always. And we are going to stop this right-wing and far-right in their sexist, xenophobic discourse, (and their) de-legitimation of politics,' Montero stressed. Sánchez, a leader with extreme political endurance Sánchez, who was ousted by some of his party colleagues - seen as the more orthodox 'old guard' - in October 2017, returned to the post of PSOE secretary general just eight months after winning militants' support in an internal vote. The head of government, who recently wrote an autobiographical book describing himself as a 'resister,' was re-elected leader of his party on Sunday by the majority of its members (90%). A PSOE source told EFE that the party's congress was marked by one word: 'resistance' against reactionary forces (Partido Popular, Vox). Sánchez's defiance contrasted with the harsh words of Partido Popular leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo, who - ironically alluding to Sánchez's 'resilience' - warned him on Sunday that the PSOE would eventually be defeated. 'Hold on, Pedro, don't resign because you don't deserve to leave with a minimum of honour; we are going to kick you out the Spaniards freely and democratically,' said the right-wing leader. The PSOE currently has around 153,000 card-carrying members, in addition to thousands of supporters who are not formal party members. The progressive formation has 120 MPs in the national parliament and 20 MEPs in Strasbourg. In a show of unity and to maintain the party's strategic continuity in the face of the right-wing camp, the PSOE revalidated the 'hard core' of the formation, including Montero-Sánchez's right-hand man and Santos Cerdán, the party's organisational secretary, while retaining many of the current ministers. Stopping reactionary forces The PSOE, which governs in coalition with the left-wing Sumar platform, has been the target of harsh criticism from the PP and Vox, particularly since the entry into force of a controversial amnesty law pardoning several Catalan separatist leaders, including Puigdemont, who is currently in self-imposed exile in Belgium. Sánchez has also been the subject of fierce political attacks from both right-wing parties over an ongoing investigation into the prime minister's wife, Begoña Gómez, for alleged corruption and influence peddling. The case, led by the civil servants' union Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), linked to the extreme right in the Iberian country, prompted Sánchez to consider resigning at the end of April. Another sensitive dossier affecting the Spanish prime minister is the so-called ‘Koldo case’, a corruption affair involving millions in illegal commissions for the purchase of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, which directly implicates former transport minister José Luis Ábalos (PSOE), Sanchez's former collaborator. Adding to the controversy surrounding the left-wing party, last week, the leader of the PSOE in the Madrid region, Juan Lobato, resigned following the revelation of confidential information relating to a tax fraud case involving the boyfriend of the controversial president of the Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso (Partido Popular).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5ipZhy_LzYj7	2024-12-02T15:35:38-08:00	
China Slams Lithuania Over Expulsions Amid Cable-Cutting Row	By He Ping China on Monday slammed Lithuania’s expulsion of three of its nationals amid an ongoing row over the involvement of a Chinese-registered cargo vessel in the cutting of undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea. The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday declared three staff members of China’s representative office in the country, a type of diplomatic mission, as personae non gratae, citing alleged violations of the Vienna Convention outlining diplomatic law and Lithuanian legislation, and ordered them to leave the country within a week. Calling the move 'brutal and provocative behavior,' China’s foreign ministry said Vilnius had previously expressed a desire to improve ties with Beijing, and expressed 'strong condemnation.' The spat comes after questions were raised over the activities of a Chinese ship that was spotted near two undersea internet cables that were cut in the Baltic Sea on Nov. 17 and 18. While European officials haven’t made details of their investigations public, one of the undersea cables that was cut runs between Sweden and Lithuania. Social media users spotted the Chinese ship slightly slowing down and altering course as it crossed the 730-mile C-Lion 1 undersea cable connecting Finland and Germany and the 130-mile link between Sweden and Lithuania around the time that they were cut. Several media reports said the authorities in Sweden and Finland are investigating the suspected sabotage of two undersea fiber-optic cables in the Baltic Sea, with attention focusing on a Chinese-registered cargo ship, the Yi Peng 3. The ship was still anchored off Denmark on Monday, in close proximity to the German patrol vessel Bamberg, according to MarineTraffic.com. Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning had said on Friday that Beijing was 'willing to cooperate ... to find out the truth' of the allegations. But China hit out at Lithuania’s move on Monday. 'China hopes that the new Lithuanian government will take concrete actions to abide by the political commitments made in the communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, adhere to the one-China principle, and push bilateral relations back on track,' foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular news briefing in Beijing on Monday. The state-run Global Times newspaper said Lithuania has already angered Beijing by switching ties in 2021 to democratic Taiwan, which China claims as 'an inalienable part' of its territory. 'Three years on since the downgrade of bilateral ties with China, Lithuania has again taken detrimental action that further exacerbates the relations,' the paper said in an editorial. 'China calls on Lithuania to immediately stop undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and stop creating difficulty for bilateral relations,' China reserves the right to take countermeasures against Lithuania, it quoted the country’s foreign ministry as saying.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdYtoppxu7b5g2fw6otf74g	2024-12-02T15:33:54-08:00

Robert Reich: Wikler For DNC Chair – OpEd	Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chairman, announced he was entering the race to lead the Democratic National Committee. This is important. The person who runs the DNC is the key organizer for the Democratic Party between now, the 2026 midterms, and the 2028 presidential election (assuming we have one). That person will be a critical voice in opposition to Trump’s authoritarian fascism. Speaking on CNN’s 'Inside Politics,' Wikler said, 'I’m running for chair of the Democratic National Committee because we need to unite, we need to fight, and we need to win to stop the GOP from ripping this country apart and ripping off working people to enrich mega billionaires.' Wikler is the right man for the job. I got to know Ben when he proved to be a thoughtful and effective top official at MoveOn. He’s chaired the Wisconsin Democrats since 2019, presiding over the successful rebuilding of a party that had been seriously weakened by many years of Republican control of the state government. Wikler organized and mobilized voters in a state that Republicans had rigged to ensure total dominance and control. Ben unrigged that system. He turned Wisconsin into a year-round organizing and fundraising powerhouse, winning seven of the last 10 statewide elections since he took over. Democrats just picked up four congressional seats in Wisconsin. They held on to their Senate seat. They also broke the GOP supermajority in the state Senate, picked up 10 seats in the state Assembly, and are on track to flip both chambers in 2026 and potentially get a trifecta if they win the governor’s race that year too. This was made possible in part because Democrats flipped Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court in April 2023. That court then struck down the gerrymandered GOP-drawn state legislative map. Democratic Governor Tony Evers signed into law a new competitive state legislative map. Wikler’s activism is all over Wisconsin. Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin prevailed with a few thousand more votes than Vice President Kamala Harris, and both Harris and Baldwin got more votes than anyone in the history of the state other than Barack Obama in 2008, when he won by 14 points (and Trump). In an interview with The New York Times, Wikler said he aimed to do for the national party what he did in Wisconsin. 'The Democratic Party is best served by leadership that’s been fighting on the front lines in one of the most contested states in the country and has demonstrated an ability to build an operation that has shattered expectations for what was possible.' This is what Democrats must do nationally. Wikler is right when he says, 'Democrats win when voters know that we’re the ones fighting for them against those who will seek to rip them off to add an extra billion dollars to their bank account.' And he correctly calls for an approach 'grounded in where people actually get their information, not just where we want to speak or what we want to say.' Ben was one of the first to attack Project 2025 and link it to Trump. 'These ideas aren’t just bad. They’re dangerous for our country,' he said during the Republican National Convention. 'Donald Trump and JD Vance want to ransack the public treasury to hand out massive tax cuts to billionaires and stick working Americans with the bill.' Just 43 years old, Wikler started in politics as a research assistant for Al Franken and hasn’t looked back. Can he win? The DNC election is slated for February 1. The current chair is South Carolina Democrat Jaime Harrison, who is not running again. There are 448 voting members of the Democratic National Committee. Why is this important? Because for years, the Democratic National Committee has been little more than a fundraising machine, which means it’s been tilted toward sources of big money: billionaires, big corporations, and Wall Street. That’s precisely the problem. That’s why the DNC cut Bernie Sanders off at the knees when he ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016. That’s why starting in the 1980s the party began turning its back on the working class. There’s no way the party can speak for the majority of working people in America when it’s reluctant to bite the hands that feed it. Wikler is a progressive who knows how to win elections with a Democratic Party that’s on the side of the little guy.

A Bangladeshi Perspective On Restoring Ties With India – OpEd	Jatiyo Nagorik Committee member Alauddin Mohammad calls for people to people interactions to end mutual suspicions Alauddin Mohammad, a member of the Bangladesh National Citizens' Committee Executive, seeks people-to-people contacts between Bangladesh and India to clear misunderstandings that had vitiated the relationship after the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a violent student-led movement in August this year. While Bangladeshis saw the ouster of Hasina's repressive regime as perfectly legitimate, India suspected that it was engineered either by Pakistan or the US or together, to nullify its traditionally close ties with Bangladesh particularly, Sheikh Hasina. New Delhi was particularly irked when the Interim Government led by the pro-US Chief Advisor Dr.Muhammad Yunus sought the extradition of Hasina from India to face criminal charges in a Dhaka court. Feelings ran really high in India when Islamic radicals attacked Hindu temples and a Hindu monk, Chinmoy Das Bhramachari, was arrested and denied bail for allegedly dishonouring the Bangladesh flag. The Hindus of Chittagong had earlier held mass demonstrations demanding protection. In Bangladesh, on the contrary, the popular narrative was that India was hatching a plot to use the Hindu minority in Bangladesh to discredit the Interim Government and eventually put protégé Hasina back in power. Relations between New Delhi and Dhaka stay frozen with no sign of an early thaw. It is against that background that this writer talked to Alauddin Mohammad, a National Citizens (Jatiyo Nagorik) Committee member. The Jatiyo Nagorik Committee came into being in September seeking to unite diverse groups in Bangladesh to establish a new 'political settlement for a democratic Bangladesh.' It aims to reform the State in line with the aspirations of the student-led mass uprising. It is run by a 55-member committee led by Nasir Uddin Patwary. Alauddin's Take Alauddin said: 'India is our neighbour, and we share a history and a cultural heritage with it. Moreover, in 1971, our freedom fighters together with Indian forces fought against Pakistan. This is an important part of our history which both countries celebrate. When it comes to bilateral relations Bangladeshis deserve a fair, people-to- people, state-to-state relationship with India.' 'Bangladesh is in no way a threat to the sovereignty for any country in this region including India. India should therefore help strengthen democratic institutions in Bangladesh and build people-to-people friendship between the countries so that there will be no room for hatred against each other. On Bangladesh's part, it can build and reaffirm confidence in the Indian political establishment,' he added. Giving a background to the New Delhi-Dhaka stand off from the Bangladeshi angle, Alauddin said: 'Unfortunately, India's relationship with Bangladesh was highly biased when the Awami League was in power which was an unpopular stand here. India supported the Awami League in exchange for unequal deals on many fronts which were unsustainable. India should give priority to the restoration of the democratic process in Bangladesh and deal with the democratically elected government.' Hindu-Muslim Conflict On the prickly issue of Muslim-Hindu conflict and the fears in India that Islamists inspired by Pakistan are gaining traction in Bangladesh, Alauddin, who is a Ph.D student, put the blame squarely on Sheikh Hasina. 'The Awami League (led by Hasina) did everything to throw the Islamic outfits out of the public sphere. Now, because a democratic space has been created, Islamists are more visible than before. But nobody is tagging them as militants. I think, the democratic process will break Islamophobia (in India), as it will make the Islamists play a constructive role in building the country like any other political group,' he said. He went on to say that the Hindus of Bangladesh are a significant part of Bangladeshi society and politics but 'unfortunately, they were used by the Awami regime to further its political ends.' 'The reality is that when Awami League was in power, there were numerous attacks on the minorities and nobody was punished. But when out of power the Awami League played the minority card to come to power,' Alauddin recalled. On the charges about minorities being attacked now, Alauddin said that these are exaggerated and fabricated. 'Immediately after Hasina's flight there were some attacks on Awami League leaders which included Hindu leaders as well. So the attacks were not against a minority as such, but against a political identity, namely, association with the Awami League,' he explained. Bangladeshi Muslims suspect that a section of Hindus is acting at India's behest. Alluding to this charge, Alauddin said that the Hindus are a large community in Bangladesh and there are several groups in it with different orientations. 'We cannot say that the whole community is under the influence of an outside force just because of the activities of a few radical groups in the community,' he stressed. 'In this context, it must be mentioned that 13 Hindus were killed during the police crackdown this year. But nobody mentioned this. The real situation as regards minorities in Bangladesh is better than what it was during Hasina's regime. Muslim preachers and Madrasas are now actively working with the minorities to ensure social harmony,' he claimed. First 100 days Alauddin assessed the performance of the post-Hasina Interim Government along several parameters. 'Because of Hasina's dictatorship, State institutions were weak and without legitimacy. The police force was absent from the scene after 5th August. In such a situation, restoring the administration was the biggest challenge facing the Interim Government, a task which the Interim Government fulfilled with quite a bit of success.' 'After that, the government had to create a democratic space for all political and social groups so that they could speak fearlessly. Restoring law and order was an achievement, but greater focus and careful management of law and order are needed now. The fragile banking system is showing signs of recovery. Several reform commissions are working to draft reports which will help rebuild the country's principal institutions, such as the judiciary, police and bureaucracy.' Drawbacks On the drawbacks, Alauddin said: 'There is an absence of a clear road map on what the Interim Government wants to do and how those will be executed. We demanded a new constitution because the old constitution had fascist features. The government is yet to reveal its stand on the new constitution, creating suspicion among the stakeholders in the uprising.'' 'Under the previous regime, the State was a single institution with the government machinery and the ruling party functioning in tandem. The Interim government is obliged to work with the old governmental machinery with a different mind-set. The Interim government is facing non-cooperation from bureaucrats. This is in addition to the absence of experienced personnel in the advisory panels themselves.' Political Space Restored On the change in the political atmosphere, the young leader said: 'There was no political activity in the last one and half decades in Bangladesh due to the absolute domination of the Awami League and Sheikh Hasina. The mass uprising was the only political action undertaken with her in power. But mass action has created a vast new space for political participation. Political parties now express their views freely.' 'But the government's inability to arrest the political criminals of the past is causing concern. Much work also needs to be done to bring justice for those who families which were victims of enforced disappearances,' he said. Economy Recovering The economy has to be cleared of oligarchs and crony capitalists, Alauddin stressed. 'More than US$ 148 billion was siphoned off from the economy during Hasina's rule. Public debt was at an all-time high at US$ 99 billion. The banks were struggling facing cash shortages. During the protests, major infrastructural damage took place. We have to assess the Interim Government's performance against this backdrop.' Pointing out to the brighter side, he said: 'In the first three months of FY '25 (July-September), export earnings increased by 7.62% reaching US$ 11.66 billion compared to US$ 10.83 billion during the same period in the last fiscal year. Remittances also showed an increase in July–October 2024 of nearly US$9 billion, a 30% increase from the previous year.' Human Rights The human rights situation has improved visibly, the activist said. 'There are no secret torture cells, no enforced disappearances, no harassment by the law enforcing agencies. Even Awami League's former MPs are getting bail on a regular basis which shows that the judicial system is functioning freely.' Bangladesh Nationalist Party On the prospects of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Alauudin said: ' The BNP is the largest and most popular political party in Bangladesh now. So far, BNP has been playing a balanced role, protecting the spirit of the July-August uprising. The BNP actively took part in forming the Interim Government and is now giving moral support to it. In any fair electoral contest, the BNP can emerge as the single largest party in parliament.' Awami League Asked if the Awami League could ever re-enter politics, he said: 'After the July massacre, people demanded Awami League leaders' trial. After the trial the Awami League can return to politics but they must own their guilt and seek public forgiveness for their complicity in the 'genocide'. Their leaders and beneficiaries had trafficked US$ 148 billion abroad from the economy in the last 15 years. They must bring the money back to the economy before coming back to politics. Their strength lies in the power of the plundered money, engineered bureaucracy, a particular historical narrative and a particular cultural thrust. Of course, finally, it the people who will decide whether or not the Awami League can come back to politics.' On the demand that the properties of Awami League MPs, who participated the 2014,2018,and the 2024 elections should be confiscated, Akauddin said: 'This demand is not a collective one from the students. The student body will not take any step without assessing the consequences. The primary goal of the youth is to unite the country with a common goal and to uphold the values that characterized the uprising.' Jatiyo Nagorik Party On the Jatiyo Nagrik Committee itself floating a political party, Alauddin said that a new party is not a priority for the youth in Bangladesh. 'The youth want to be a watchdog for upholding democracy and a clean administration. They may organise a party in response to a demand, but that demand has not arisen yet.' Army's Role Since the 1975 coup that toppled President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Bangladesh army had been actively interfering in politics till 1990. 'The army is a popular force in Bangladesh. It has been playing a crucial role at critical moments in the history of the country,' Alauddin said adding: 'In July 2024 it decided to be with the people and didn't take part in the killing of innocent protesters which brought them very close to the heart of the people. Currently, the army is working under the civil administration and trying to facilitate the reform process. I don't think there is significant change in its role in State affairs. ' 'A point we shouldn't forget is that the army lost 57 brilliant officers in a planned mutiny during Sheikh Hasina's regime, when justice couldn't be delivered. Still the army is showing a sense of responsibility in its interactions with the State administration.' No Stalemate In conclusion, Alauddin said: 'Bangladesh is not in a stalemate. There was a stalemate under the previous regime. The present government may face difficulties but it is a people's government. This government has an agenda to reform the State, and I believe there is a political consensus on reforms. The Bangladeshi people are now united.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdd7Fsih0lOzXLCA9Q3uRBm	2024-12-02T09:16:42-08:00	
Russia’s Record-Breaking Defense Budget And The Strains Of War – ...	On December 1, 2024, Russia unveiled its budget for 2025, setting aside an unprecedented $126 billion (13.5 trillion rubles) for national defense, accounting for 32.5% of government expenditures. This allocation surpasses the previous record of 2024 by a staggering $28 billion (three trillion rubles). Although the new three-year fiscal plan anticipates a slight reduction in military spending for 2026 and 2027, the sharp increase in defense funding underscores the immense demands of the war in Ukraine. The budget, approved by both chambers of Russia's parliament, reflects the nation's prioritization of military objectives amidst a grinding conflict. The War in Ukraine: Europe's Largest Conflict Since WWII The ongoing war in Ukraine, now entering its third year, is the most significant conflict in Europe since World War II. Russian forces have made incremental advances along key points of the frontline while defending against a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kursk region. Kursk stands out as the site of Kyiv's only major success in 2024, but the broader war remains defined by attritional tactics on both sides. Often described as a 'war of attrition,' the conflict has become a prolonged battle where each side seeks to exhaust the other's resources. Ukraine, with a smaller economy and fewer military assets, has been heavily reliant on Western support, receiving billions of dollars in aid. However, uncertainty clouds Ukraine's future prospects as the United States, one of its largest benefactors, undergoes a leadership transition. The impending presidency of Donald Trump has raised questions about whether American military and financial support will continue at the current scale. Russia, by contrast, benefits from a larger pool of resources, including more weapons, ammunition, and personnel. Yet, these advantages come at a cost, as the prolonged war exerts significant pressure on the Russian economy and society. Economic Strains and Domestic Pressures in Russia Russia's increased military spending over the past two years has fueled significant economic challenges, with signs of overheating becoming apparent. Inflation rates remain high, eroding the purchasing power of ordinary Russians. Compounding the issue, labor shortages have emerged across various sectors as resources and manpower are diverted toward the war effort. In an attempt to control inflation and stabilize the economy, the Russian Central Bank raised interest rates to 21% in October 2024—the highest in decades. These measures, while aimed at curbing economic volatility, have further strained businesses and households. Despite these efforts, the war's financial burden continues to weigh heavily on the nation. Human capital has also been severely impacted. The partial mobilization announced in late 2023 led to widespread panic and the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Russian men seeking to avoid conscription. This demographic loss not only affects military recruitment but also undermines economic productivity. The challenge of replenishing Russia's armed forces has grown acute, with battlefield casualties mounting and public support for additional mobilizations dwindling. North Korea's Role: Reinforcements and Weaponry Amid these challenges, Russia has turned to external allies for support, most notably North Korea. In November 2024, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that approximately 11,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to the Kursk region to bolster Russian efforts on the frontlines. These reinforcements provide a temporary boost to Russia's manpower, addressing immediate gaps in its military ranks. In addition to soldiers, North Korea has supplied Russia with a significant portion of its weaponry. Ukrainian defense officials estimate that nearly one-third of the ballistic missiles used by Russian forces in 2024 originated from North Korea. This influx of material aid highlights the deepening military partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang, forged in the face of global condemnation and sanctions. While these contributions strengthen Russia's position in the short term, they raise questions about sustainability. North Korea's assistance is unlikely to offset the broader material losses Russia has incurred, particularly as the conflict continues to drain its resources. Ukraine's Resilience and the Role of Western Aid Despite its disadvantages in material and manpower, Ukraine has shown remarkable resilience, leveraging both its strategic ingenuity and international support. Western nations, including the United States, the European Union, and NATO allies, have collectively provided billions of dollars in military and humanitarian assistance. Advanced weaponry, intelligence sharing, and training programs have played a crucial role in bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities. However, the future of this support remains uncertain. In the United States, the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump introduces potential shifts in foreign policy. Trump's previous statements have signaled a more cautious approach to funding international conflicts, raising concerns about whether the flow of aid to Ukraine will continue uninterrupted. For Kyiv, the prospect of reduced Western support could pose significant challenges, further tilting the balance of power in Russia's favor. The Human Cost of the War As the war grinds on, the human toll continues to escalate on both sides. Russia's numerical advantage in terms of population is offset by significant battlefield losses. Ukrainian forces, though smaller in number, have employed asymmetric tactics to inflict substantial casualties on Russian troops. The human cost extends beyond soldiers, affecting civilians caught in the crossfire and those displaced by the conflict. In Russia, the societal impact of the war is becoming increasingly visible. Public discontent with mobilization efforts, economic hardship, and the loss of loved ones has begun to erode domestic support for the war. While the Kremlin has maintained strict control over the media narrative, growing skepticism within the population signals potential challenges to the government's ability to sustain the conflict. Ukraine, too, faces immense human suffering. Cities and infrastructure have been devastated by relentless missile strikes, many of which are attributed to North Korean weaponry supplied to Russia. The rebuilding process will be long and arduous, even if the conflict were to end tomorrow. The Road Ahead: Uncertainty and Escalation Risks As the war enters another year, both sides face a precarious future. For Russia, the question is whether its economic and human resources can sustain the prolonged conflict without triggering domestic unrest or systemic collapse. The strain on the economy, coupled with difficulties in recruitment and battlefield losses, poses significant risks. Ukraine, on the other hand, must navigate the dual challenges of countering Russian aggression and maintaining international support. Its ability to secure continued aid from Western allies will be critical to its survival and resistance. However, as geopolitical dynamics shift, particularly in the United States, the steadfastness of this support is far from guaranteed. For the international community, the ongoing war underscores the broader risks of escalation. The involvement of external actors like North Korea introduces additional complexity, while the economic and humanitarian fallout extends beyond the borders of Ukraine and Russia. Conclusion: A Conflict Without Resolution Russia's record-breaking defense budget for 2025 reflects its determination to continue prosecuting the war in Ukraine despite mounting challenges. However, the financial, human, and geopolitical costs of this prolonged conflict are becoming increasingly apparent. While North Korea's contributions may offer temporary relief, they do little to address the deeper systemic strains on Russia's economy and society. For Ukraine, resilience remains its defining feature, but the path forward is fraught with uncertainty. The sustained support of Western allies will be vital, yet the shifting political landscape, particularly in the United States, adds a layer of unpredictability. Ultimately, the war in Ukraine represents not just a military struggle but a broader contest of wills, resources, and strategies. Its outcome will have profound implications, not only for the two nations involved but for the future of European security and global stability. As both sides grapple with the immense costs, the prospects for resolution remain elusive, leaving the international community to navigate an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdd7Fsih0lOzQLaPCXiUbt3	2024-12-02T09:14:10-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: International Trade And The Region – O...	As no person was ever able to meet all his needs alone, there was always an exchange of goods and services throughout most of human history. Exchanging goods and services, of course for a price, is called by different names. It is called trade, commerce or simply markets and this has grown from simple communities to regions and countries and, indeed, across vast spaces covering continents. It is the international trade that involves this exchange of goods and services across countries and payments thereof that we will discuss in this article, including the payment systems involved and its impact thereof on the region. Trade or commerce is the purchase and sale of goods and services and may involve consumer goods, manufactured goods, raw materials, machinery, tourism, banking, insurance and other goods and services. When such trade or commerce is across borders with other countries, it gets more complicated than going to the store or market in the neighborhood or even when buying and selling within the same country. In this article we shall deal mostly with international trade, which deals with the category of commerce across countries and across continents. The market place is larger and the competition may be stiffer and it is why countries compete, selling their wares as far wide as is possible and buy raw materials from differing sources at cheaper or more reasonable prices. This competition may lead, sometimes, to complications that can cause wars and conflicts and hence wise men have always laid down rules to follow to lessen the occurrences of such conflict situations. There is the World Trade organization ('WTO'), the International Trade Centre ('ITC'), the International Chamber of Commerce ('ICC'), and a plethora of regional organizations like the United States Mexico and Canada ('USMCA'), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ('COMESA') and many others. Trade, more so, the international aspect of it, has contributed greatly to the growth of global economy, where the supply and demand and hence prices impact and/or are impacted by global events. Different countries have differing advantages, where some countries may have cheaper labor costs than others, or more capital or material resources than others or even more and better skills and technologies than others. It is the basis of the exchanges they make among themselves and with others. It is where international payment systems become essential for commercial, governmental, and non-governmental organizations, as well as for individuals to ease trade, investments and individual needs. The financial world has developed over the years processes and networks to ease and facilitate payments. There was once the telegraphic transfer or 'TT' system and there was the telex system and there was and still is the Clearing House Interbank Payment Systems ('CHIPS'), the Fedwire and Ripple, and others. But SWIFT or the Society for World-wide Financial Telecommunication appears to have absorbed most activities of international payments and currently dominates the field. The SWIFT payment system was developed in the 1970s and is based in Belgium. It is a network that connects as of April 2023 some 11,000 financial institutions from over some two hundred countries and in effect handles some 40% of all international payment transfers. International payments require certain procedures and protocols, which must be followed to avoid fraud, corruption, money-laundering and other evil activities. Other than information of payer and payee parties and accounts, it requires other important codes, namely the International Bank Account Number (the 'IBAN') and the Business Identifier Code ('BIC') i.e., the SWIFT Code. Now that we know how important world trade and payment systems are, one needs to explain why the Horn of Africa States region is so important in this matrix. For one, it is a poor region and does not contribute much to global trade and for two, it is full of its own idiosyncrasies of mismanagement and tribal/clannish approach to politics and political processes. Despite the aforesaid, it is still part of the world and is involved in world politics such as Ethiopia moving away from its traditional alliances of the West to the currently growing BRICS Plus institution bent on moving away from the current trade and settlement issues, using new currencies as the main currencies of reserves in the place of the United States’ mighty dollar, which makes the United States the banker of many of the nations of the world. Many of the current rules involve unwritten ones including the usage of the dominant United States Dollar whereas the BRICS Plus proposes to move to a new currency or usage of their own currencies to settle payments among themselves. This would definitely affect the region as Ethiopia with the largest population appears to be moving onto to the BRICS Plus camp and away from the traditional financial protocols although the country recently signed conditioned arrangements with both the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, perhaps playing what seems to be a dangerous double-dipping game. The region also overlooks the western shores of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, a passage way for some 11 to 12 percent of international trade including the vital energy source of oil and gas from the Arabian Gulf countries on the other side of the same seas. This makes the region a strategic energy transportation waterway and an equally significant global trade hub. One must note that it connects Asia, Africa and Europe and henceforth has links with the remaining continents. The Horn of Africa States region is reported to enjoy abundant resources and henceforth an immense potential, which thus attracts not only the major powers of the world but also other regional powers. These include among others the Peoples Republic of China, the United States of America, the European Union, The Russian Federation, the GCC countries, Egypt, and Türkiye, among others. The interest of all these parties is prompted by the potential exploitation opportunities of the resources of the region without putting in much in return. These may include safe passage of ships on the waterway connecting the Indian Ocean to the Suez Canal or investments in the agricultural potential of the region or accessing at cheap prices the enormous mineral resources of the region including the food stocks of its vast marine space. It is where it becomes important for the countries of the region to revisit their strategies. Instead of being pawns in the game of others, the countries of the region should be putting their heads together to forge a new path for the region. They should be working on turning tables to take advantage of those interested parties to create not a self-competing and self-destroying region but a cooperating region. The Horn of Africa States region would benefit more from this cooperation and economic integration to exploit the resources of the region for the mutual benefit of the countries of the region and for reducing the conflicts and the terror activities that is currently prevalent in the region. Through joint efforts, the region can create a secure space where normal investments can be made not only by the locals of the region but also by others from beyond the region. The region, indeed, has much to offer. It can grow in peace and face together the corrupting foreign interests bent on keeping it 'as is' backward and underdeveloped.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeNi3HFSKbdXJ8pADN3HjuL	2024-12-02T09:10:46-08:00	
Germany Allocates €181m To Support Bangladesh’s Sustainable Devel...	Germany has reaffirmed its longstanding partnership with Bangladesh by committing €180.807 million (approximately Tk2,265 crore) in financial and technical assistance. This new pledge aims to bolster key sectors such as renewable energy, technical education, trade infrastructure, and combating domestic violence against women and children, marking another milestone in a relationship that has spanned over five decades. Formalizing the Commitment On November 28, agreements formalizing this support were signed by Md Shahriar Kader Siddiky, Secretary of the Economic Relations Division under Bangladesh's Ministry of Finance, and Achim Tröster, the German Ambassador to Bangladesh. These agreements outline Germany's dual approach to development cooperation through both financial and technical aid. Of the total commitment, €45.8 million will be directed toward Technical Cooperation, while €135 million will fund Financial Cooperation projects. Key Focus Areas The cooperation agreement covers a wide range of initiatives, with an emphasis on sustainable development and social welfare. The primary areas of focus include- 1. Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Projects aimed at promoting sustainable energy practices, reducing reliance on non-renewable resources, and enhancing energy efficiency will be a cornerstone of this partnership. These initiatives align with Bangladesh's ongoing efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources. 2. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Investments in technical education and vocational training aim to equip Bangladesh's workforce with skills that meet the demands of a modern economy, fostering greater employment opportunities and productivity. 3. Trade and Infrastructure Development Germany's support for trade and infrastructure will focus on creating robust supply chains and enhancing connectivity to boost Bangladesh's export potential and global competitiveness. 4. Sustainable Urban Development With rapid urbanization posing challenges in cities across Bangladesh, German support will address issues such as housing, waste management, and transportation, contributing to more livable urban environments. 5. Protection of Biodiversity Preserving Bangladesh's rich natural heritage is another critical area of focus, with initiatives aimed at protecting ecosystems and promoting environmentally sustainable practices. 6. Combating Domestic Violence Against Women and Children A dedicated project under this agreement will address domestic violence, aiming to protect vulnerable groups and promote gender equity and social justice. A Legacy of Support This enduring partnership reflects a shared commitment to fostering sustainable development and addressing critical socio-economic challenges. Bangladesh has been a key partner in German Development Cooperation (GDC), one of 47 bilateral relationships maintained by Germany. Following the latest intergovernmental negotiations in May 2024, Germany pledged €180 million for bilateral development initiatives in Bangladesh. Since the inception of this partnership in the 1972, Germany has invested more than €3.5 billion in Bangladesh's development projects. Additionally, since 2017, over €185 million has been allocated to assist Rohingya refugees and their host communities in southeastern Bangladesh. The implementation of GDC projects in Bangladesh primarily involves state-owned agencies such as GIZ, KfW, and BGR, while the Development Cooperation Section of the German Embassy provides political guidance and ensures coordination with the Government of Bangladesh and other international partners. Focus Areas of Cooperation German Development Cooperation in Bangladesh centers on three bilaterally agreed core areas- 1. Climate and Energy: A Just Transition Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Bangladesh's rapid economic growth has led to a significant rise in energy demand, necessitating innovative, climate-friendly solutions. Germany supports Bangladesh's transition to renewable energy, sharing its own experiences in moving towards sustainable energy systems. Collaborating with the European Union, Germany co-leads the Team Europe Initiative for Green Energy Transition, promoting renewable and reliable energy sources. Sustainable Urban Development The challenges posed by rapid urbanization and climate change—such as severe flooding, droughts, cyclones, and rising sea levels—are particularly acute in Bangladesh's urban areas. To address these issues, GDC focuses on financing resilient infrastructure, enhancing mobility, and improving waste management systems. Emphasis is placed on low-carbon and adaptive solutions to make cities more sustainable and less vulnerable to climate-related risks. 2. Sustainable Economic Development, Training, and Employment Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Bangladesh faces labor market challenges, including high rates of informal employment and youth unemployment. Recognizing this, GDC has introduced TVET initiatives to equip workers with skills aligned with emerging sectors like renewable energy. These programs aim to diversify Bangladesh's economy and reduce dependence on traditional industries such as ready-made garments (RMG). Sustainable Supply Chains and Trade Infrastructure A significant focus is improving labor conditions and environmental standards, particularly in the RMG sector. Germany supports Bangladesh in aligning with international labor, social, and environmental standards, helping sustain export-driven growth as the country aims to graduate from Least Developed Country (LDC) status. Germany's Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains complements these efforts by encouraging ethical practices across industries. Collaboration with organizations such as the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) and the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) has led to the establishment of help desks for Bangladeshi companies seeking guidance on sustainable supply chains. 3. Conserving Nature and Protecting Life Biodiversity Preservation Germany supports Bangladesh in strengthening ecosystem-based governance and preserving its natural resources. Projects focus on expanding protected areas through the integration of digital technologies, citizen science, and youth participation, with a particular emphasis on the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest.Through these efforts, GDC fosters the integrated management of coastal and marine ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity conservation and promoting sustainable development in vulnerable regions like the Swatch of No Ground, a critical habitat for marine life. Broader Impacts Rohingya Support Since 2017, Germany has directed over €185 million toward aiding Rohingya refugees and the host communities in southeastern Bangladesh. These funds have supported infrastructure, healthcare, education, and environmental initiatives, ensuring sustainable living conditions for affected populations. Collaborative Framework GDC projects are implemented through partnerships involving government agencies, civil society, academia, and private sector stakeholders. Germany also collaborates with international bodies like the International Labour Organization (ILO) to advance sustainable development goals (SDGs) and climate action objectives. Strengthening Bilateral Ties The latest commitment underscores the depth of the Germany-Bangladesh relationship, which has evolved into a multifaceted partnership over the decades. Germany's consistent support reflects its recognition of Bangladesh's potential as an emerging economy and its strategic importance in South Asia. A Shared Vision Germany and Bangladesh share a vision of sustainable development that prioritizes economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. Through collaborative projects, the two nations aim to address pressing global challenges such as climate change, inequality, and sustainable urbanization. Enhanced Collaboration The agreements also pave the way for deeper collaboration between government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private sector stakeholders in both countries. By leveraging shared expertise and resources, these partnerships are expected to yield long-term benefits for both nations. Looking Ahead As Bangladesh continues its journey toward becoming a middle-income country, partnerships like the one with Germany play a crucial role in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). The latest commitment not only strengthens existing ties but also sets the stage for innovative projects that address emerging challenges. Broader Implications 1. Economic Growth By focusing on trade, infrastructure, and technical education, the partnership is poised to drive economic growth and create employment opportunities in Bangladesh. 2. Social Welfare Projects targeting domestic violence and urban development are expected to improve the quality of life for vulnerable populations and foster social equity. 3. Environmental Sustainability Investments in renewable energy, biodiversity protection, and sustainable urbanization underscore a commitment to combating environmental degradation and climate change. Conclusion Germany's €181 million commitment to Bangladesh reflects a strong, enduring partnership built on mutual respect and shared goals. By focusing on critical areas such as renewable energy, education, and social welfare, this cooperation promises to drive sustainable development and improve lives across Bangladesh. As the two nations continue to strengthen their ties, this partnership serves as a model of international collaboration for a more equitable and sustainable future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeNi3HFSKbdXIxXCNMP08XP	2024-12-02T09:08:30-08:00	
Key Considerations In Negotiations With Chinese Companies – OpEd	In Turkish domestic tenders, many Chinese companies continue to secure projects by leveraging Chinese Eximbank project financing support and offering competitive pricing. While tenders for fossil-fuel thermal power plants have ended, recent news highlights plans for the production of 150,000 electric cars annually in Manisa organised industrial zone. It is noted that 2,500 Chinese workers will be employed during the production phase. But how will these workers be housed, fed, and integrated with the local community? Clearly, the processes involved are far from straightforward. Unfortunately, our local investors and public institutions often enter such negotiations insufficiently prepared, leaving them vulnerable to Chinese negotiation tactics and frequently ending up on the losing side. So, how can this change? How can one work effectively with Chinese companies, conduct successful negotiations, and address critical points? Key Differences in Negotiations with Chinese Firms The belief that 'negotiation tactics are universal' is widespread; however, negotiations and contracting processes with Chinese counterparts carry distinct characteristics. While we typically operate under a win-win principle, for the Chinese, contract negotiation resembles a form of 'war.' They often apply strategies outlined in The Art of War, a 2,500-year-old work by Sun Tzu. Reading this book is highly recommended as part of your preparation. The Importance of Location Whenever possible, conduct negotiations in your own country. If this isn't feasible, opt for a neutral third country. As a last resort, choose a Chinese city you are already familiar with. Negotiating in an unfamiliar Chinese city places you at a significant disadvantage. Time and Concession Management Chinese negotiators create time pressure from the outset. For example, the staff who meet you at the airport may ask, 'When are you leaving?' Avoid providing a clear answer. Keeping your return date ambiguous can disrupt their tactics. Also, decline pre-signature dinner invitations, as socializing before negotiations can be risky. Throughout negotiations, the Chinese side may repeatedly bring up new issues to wear you down. It is crucial to hold firm on your key principles. While a signing ceremony may seem enticing, never make concessions to secure it; cancel the ceremony if necessary. Chinese Negotiation Tactics and Strategies Chinese negotiators often request revisions at every stage, causing project delays and exhaustion. It is vital to adhere strictly to the terms agreed upon initially. Do not hesitate to cancel agreements or enforce penalty clauses when necessary. Chinese negotiators typically have limited decision-making authority and frequently consult their senior management. Therefore, insist that decision-makers participate in the negotiations; otherwise, the discussions will be largely unproductive. Contracting and Implementation Phases Contracts must be drafted in English, with the English version being the legally binding one. Technical documentation should also be in English. Stand firm against continuous requests for changes and revisions. Keep in mind that negotiations will likely continue post-signature, with ongoing demands for adjustments. Working and negotiating with Chinese companies is undoubtedly challenging. However, with a robust strategy, these processes can be managed effectively. Preparation, maintaining firm principles, and demonstrating professionalism are critical at every stage of agreements with Chinese firms. Remember: the more resolute you are, the more respect you will command. Losing ground, however, diminishes your value.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeNi3HFSKbdXGJsIeHWW_qR	2024-12-02T09:05:01-08:00	
US President Joe Biden On Pardon Of Son Hunter – Statement	Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room – with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision. Executive Grant of ClemencyJoseph R. Biden, Jr.President of the United States of America To All to Whom These Presents Shall Come, Greeting: Be It Known, That This Day, I, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United States, Pursuant to My Powers Under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, of the Constitution, Have Granted Unto ROBERT HUNTER BIDEN A Full and Unconditional Pardon For those offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024, including but not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted (including any that have resulted in convictions) by Special Counsel David C. Weiss in Docket No. 1:23-cr-00061-MN in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and Docket No. 2:23-CR-00599-MCS-1 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF I have hereunto signed my name and caused the Pardon to be recorded with the Department of Justice. Done at the City of Washington this 1st day of December in the year of our Lord Two Thousand and Twenty-four and of the Independence of the United States the Two Hundred and Forty-ninth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum3ymKlMfHqOs	2024-12-01T17:41:39-08:00	
China’s Wagner? Beijing Establishes Private Security Company In M...	By Antonio Graceffo China is collaborating with the Myanmar military junta to establish a joint security company to protect Chinese investments and personnel in Myanmar. On October 22, 2024, the junta formed a working committee to draft a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the initiative, reflecting China’s growing concerns over the security of its projects, particularly those under the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor. As a key part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), CMEC comprises highways, railways, pipelines, and economic zones connecting China’s Kunming province to the deep-sea Kyaukpyu Port in Myanmar’s Rakhine State. The economic corridor is vital to Beijing, providing direct access to the Indian Ocean and bypassing the strategically vulnerable Malacca Strait, a chokepoint critical to China’s energy and trade supply lines, particularly in the event of a conflict with the United States. Yet unfortunately for Beijing, many CMEC projects pass through some of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones. Since pro-democracy opposition armies declared a 'people’s defensive war' in 2021, Chinese projects, including oil and gas pipelines, have come under increasing threat. Notably, in January 2022, a local People’s Defense Force attacked the $800 million Tagaung Taung nickel processing plant. More recently, the Chinese consulate in Mandalay was damaged in a bombing attack last month. While no group has claimed responsibility, both the People’s Defense Forces and the National Unity Government (NUG) have condemned the incident. The announcement of a joint security company has sparked controversy in Myanmar, with many arguing that it could be perceived as a breach of the country’s sovereignty. Myanmar’s 2008 constitution prohibits the deployment of foreign troops on its soil, and the framing of this initiative as a Chinese 'company' in a joint venture appears to be a strategic move to deflect accusations of a foreign military intervention. By structuring the company as private and partially Burmese, Beijing can claim arm’s-length deniability, distancing itself from direct involvement while potentially directing the security force to carry out state-derived foreign policy objectives. The deployment of a Chinese private security company (PSC) comes at a critical moment in the Myanmar civil war, and amid sustained financial and military support for the junta, including shipments of weapons and aircrafts. But above all Beijing’s motivation for establishing the joint venture signals waning confidence in the junta’s ability to protect Chinese investments and personnel. Such concerns are underscored by the junta’s overstretched military forces, which have lost significant ground and numerous bases and outposts to pro-democracy rebels, further eroding the junta’s presence across Myanmar. In late October 2024, Chinese authorities reportedly placed Peng Daxun, commander of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), under house arrest in Kunming, Yunnan Province, to pressure the group to withdraw from Lashio. The MNDAA’s capture of Lashio in August 2024 dealt a major blow to Myanmar’s junta. Lashio, a strategic hub in northern Shan State, serves as a gateway to China’s Yunnan Province and central Myanmar along the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC). Its control is vital for ensuring the flow of Chinese investments and trade. China frequently claims to adhere to its official stance of non-intervention in the sovereign affairs of other nations, yet developments in the Myanmar civil war suggest an active involvement. By detaining Peng Daxun, Beijing seems to be stepping in where it perceives the junta has failed, underscoring its wider rationale for establishing a private security company in Myanmar. Beijing already has numerous private security companies operating globally, including four in Myanmar, in areas where China has significant strategic and economic interests. The largest Chinese security companies include De Wei Security Group Ltd, Hua Xin China Security, Guan An Security Technology, China Overseas Security Group, and Frontier Services Group. The idea of a Chinese security company is reminiscent of Russia’s Wagner Group, a private military company (PMC) that has been heavily involved in conflicts across Africa, the Middle East, and Ukraine. Wagner functions as an unofficial extension of Russian state power, providing military training, combat support, and securing strategic assets, often under the guise of protecting Russian interests abroad. Its operations frequently involve direct combat roles, covert military activities, and securing resource-rich areas, making it an instrument of geopolitical influence for Moscow. In contrast, Chinese private security companies primarily focus on safeguarding infrastructure projects, personnel, and investments linked to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Unlike Wagner, these companies avoid direct combat roles, instead specializing in site security, risk management, and logistical support. However, the proposed firm in Myanmar will be a joint venture with the junta, introducing a new dynamic. It is already known that this company will facilitate arms shipments and deliveries to the junta. As a junta-aligned company, it may operate with fewer restrictions and potentially involve heavily armed personnel, diverging from the usual limitations imposed on Chinese PSCs. The joint arrangement could also mean the company is not bound to adhere strictly to Chinese regulations, raising concerns that it might take on a more militarized role than typical Chinese security firms. In an extreme case, there is speculation that Chinese security firms could take an active role in the junta’s fight against pro-democracy forces, similar to the role that Russia’s Wagner Group has played in its engagements in Africa and the Middle East. Incidentally, the joint private security company approach is also being attempted in Pakistan, where a string of recent attacks against Chinese citizens and economic interests have shaken faith in Islamabad’s ability to protect the CPEC corridor. In response to the announcement, Myanmar’s civilian National Unity Government (NUG) asserted that collaborating with the NUG and revolutionary forces is the only viable way to effectively protect Chinese investments and operations in Myanmar. The NUG further emphasized its commitment to safeguarding lawful investments and fostering friendly relations with neighboring countries. The messaging serves to reassure Beijing that, even if Myanmar transitions to democracy, it will continue to maintain trade relations with China. Yet it seems for now that Beijing is not ready to abandon the junta, and amid a fraught outlook on the battlefield, the deployment of a Chinese private security company is the only way to ensure the junta’s survival. For its part, the NUG remains isolated, lacking in both recognition from Western powers and a direct line of communication with Beijing.

China Debuts New Fighter Plane: How Does It Compare To The F-35? ...	By Tara McKelvey When it debuted at an air show in Zhuhai, China, earlier last month, the J-35 fighter plane made an impression. Produced by a Chinese aviation company, Shenyang, the new jet took more than a decade to build- and bears more than a passing resemblance a U.S. fighter, the F-35, made by Lockheed Martin. As the U.S. Air Force’s chief of staff, David Allvin, told Air & Space Forces Magazine, the similarities between the two aircraft were striking. Both models have silver-grey wings, a pointed nose and a smooth, slicked-back design. Though made in two different countries, they looked as if they came from the same factory. If you were to put the two jets side-by-side, said Allvin, you could practically see where they both 'got their blueprints.' That in itself is an achievement for the Chinese military, which has for years struggled to compete with the U.S. military advances. Still, there are differences between the two aircraft. The Chinese-made J-35 is more svelte than the American jet—despite the fact that the Chinese model has two engines, while the U.S.-made F-35 has one. Chinese designers may have chosen to build their aircraft with two engines to give the jet more power, says Douglas Royce, a senior aircraft analyst with the Sandy Hook, Connecticut-based research company, Forecast International. But the design could have also been chosen for a more primitive reason: the second engine could serve as a backup in case of mission failure. 'Maybe they have less faith in the reliability of the aircraft,' says Greg Malandrino, a former U.S. fighter pilot now at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Chinese pilots will have to make do with a smaller workspace than American F-35 pilots, according to Boyko Nikolov, the head of a media company Bulgarian Military. The U.S. fighter jet’s cockpit is cushier, roomier, with a bigger canopy, while the Chinese plane’s cockpit reflects 'a more utilitarian approach to pilot ergonomics,' according to Nikolov. Malandrino, says he did not notice any significant differences in the design of the two cockpits. Besides, as he points out, the cockpit of a fighter jet, whether Chinese or American, is not known for comfort. The seat is designed to provide the pilot with a way out of a tricky situation. 'You’re sitting on ejection seat,' he says. 'It’s basically a rocket seat.' Others questioned whether the Chinese jet, however well-designed, is all that sneaky. According to aviation expert Dario Leone, the J-35 spits a lot of smoke from its exhaust pipe when it’s in the air, which could make it easier to detect the plane. But experts agree that the real power of a fighter jet lies in the overall strength of the military they serve. Says Forecast International’s Royce: 'People are thinking about two jets operating in a dog fight. But in the real world, it depends on the entire combat system.' 'Until the two countries fight, it’s just guesswork,' Royce says. 'You really don’t know till the shooting starts.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum-3Vkp6vYVr0	2024-12-01T17:32:13-08:00	
Tech, Talent And Trump Pose Risks To Vietnam’s Economic Strategy ...	By David Dapice Vietnam, one of Southeast Asia’s star performers, finds itself facing an all-too-common problem. Having rapidly grown its economy by bringing its workforce into low value-added manufacturing jobs, Vietnam’s model is now threatened by technology and labour constraints, as well as the spectre of Western protectionism against its exports. In 2024, Vietnam’s economy will likely experience a solid 6–6.5 per cent growth rate, but investment into critical AI infrastructure and technological development is essential to ensure future economic growth. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund forecast continued growth of around 6 per cent in 2025, as many US-bound exports have shifted from China to Southeast Asia where Vietnam remains a major beneficiary. The country has a 4 per cent inflation rate and low debt, a trade surplus and continuing inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). But newly registered FDI grew only 1–2 per cent in 2024, falling in real terms. Vietnam’s ability to move more than a million workers a year from farms to factories and other urban jobs — and in doing so, boost worker productivity and GDP growth — is diminishing. With fewer young workers to do assembly jobs, the low value-added model of Vietnam’s exports is approaching its limits. From 2018 to 2019, manufacturing jobs grew by 1.3 million but from 2022 to 2023, they grew by only 0.2 million. The result was that GDP growth fell from 7.4 per cent in 2019 to 5 per cent in 2023. A further complication facing Vietnam’s economy comes from US President-elect Donald Trump. He is a fan of tariffs and dislikes getting ‘ripped off’ when US imports exceed exports to a particular country. The US Census reports that the trade deficit with Vietnam amounts to US$10 billion a month in 2024. Even worse, a lot of those exports include imported inputs from China which were lightly processed to avoid tariffs on direct Chinese exports to the United States. While Vietnam does not subsidise these exports, China may subsidise its exports through Vietnam. Vietnam benefits from this middleman status and curbing it would slow growth. With Trump’s appointees targeting Mexican and Canadian exports involving Chinese inputs, Vietnam is likely to face similar treatment. It would help tariff negotiations if Vietnam added more value itself, especially from domestic companies. But this is not happening enough. For example, from 2019 to 2023, Vietnam reported that exports to the United States rose by US$34 billion, while imports into Vietnam from China grew by US$30 billion. In September 2024, a Chinese economist wrote about the low level of domestic firms’ value added in Vietnam’s exports, especially for the fast-growing electronics sector. In 2019, Vietnam’s Politburo Resolution No. 52-NQ/TW also identified the weakness of Vietnam’s domestic industrial sector in its ‘Industry 4.0’ analysis and recommendations. But there has been limited progress in the last five years. Some argue this is because officials only understand top-down directives, while others point to private firms being underutilised as a source of revenue for potential development opportunities. In any case, adding export restrictions to a still-lagging real estate sector would depress retail consumer spending growth of about 4 per cent a year in real terms, capping sales of domestic firms. A more forward-looking example of Vietnam lagging behind is evident in its hyperscale data centre infrastructure. Hyperscale data centres process inquiries for — and teach — large language models for artificial intelligence. Vietnam has so far tried to ‘go it alone’ but its data centres are only 5–10 per cent the size of its competitors, much less secure and lack value-added services for local companies. The rules on data localisation are cumbersome and uncompetitive with Malaysia or Singapore. For example, as of mid-2024, Vietnam’s existing, under-construction, committed and early-stage data centre investments stand at 143 megawatts compared to 3,221 megawatts in Malaysia. Vietnam has also had trouble supplying adequate electricity for existing factories in the north — there is not enough transmission capacity when hydroelectricity is limited due to drought. While transmission to the north — but not the south — is being remedied, green energy contracts are frozen due to a reluctance to sign agreements similar to those given to coal plants. This poses an issue give many FDI data centre companies want green energy. Vietnamese Communist Party Secretary General To Lam has spoken about a new era of technology. If Lam realises just how threatened existing exports may be due to tariffs and how far behind Vietnam is in critical AI infrastructure, he may be able to reorient growth away from low value-added exports, which face demographic headwinds, and rapidly strengthen the private sector. This is the only way that Vietnam can reduce the income-per-capita and technology gap with China and maintain its functional independence and ‘bamboo diplomacy’. So long as Trump’s tariffs do not impede growth, Vietnam’s outlook for 2025 can remain positive. But this will only be a short-term respite — like in other middle-income economies, the gains from moving low-productivity workers to more productive jobs are slowly fading.

From Marcus Aurelius To Omar Little: A Man’s Code Is Vital – OpEd	As this Thanksgiving weekend draws to a close, my gratitude centers not on the usual holiday platitudes, but on something that has become increasingly precious in our artificial age: authentic relationships – both family and lifelong friends – that deepen rather than fracture under pressure. What binds these relationships, I’ve come to realize, isn’t shared opinions or circumstances, but a shared code – an unwavering commitment to principles that transcends the shifting sands of politics and social pressure. I’m particularly grateful for my inner circle – friends I’ve known since elementary school and family members whose bonds have only strengthened through the crucible of recent years. Like many others who spoke out against Covid tyranny, I watched what I thought were solid relationships dissolve in real time. As the owner of a local brewery and coach of my kids’ sports teams, I had been deeply embedded in my community – a 'man about town' whose friendship and counsel others actively sought. Yet suddenly, the same people who had eagerly engaged with me would scurry when they saw me coming down the street. Professional networks and neighborhood connections evaporated at the mere questioning of prevailing narratives. They reacted this way because I broke orthodoxy, choosing to stand for liberal values – the very principles they claimed to champion – by rejecting arbitrary mandates and restrictions. In this moment of testing, the difference between those who lived by a consistent code and those who simply followed social currents became starkly clear. Yet in retrospect, this winnowing feels more like clarification than loss. As surface-level relationships fell away, my core relationships – decades-long friendships and family bonds – not only endured but deepened. These trials revealed which bonds were authentic and which were merely situational. The friendships that remained, anchored in genuine principles rather than social convenience, proved themselves infinitely more valuable than the broader network of fair-weather friends I lost. What strikes me most about these enduring friendships is how they’ve defied the typical narrative of relationships destroyed by political divisions. As Marcus Aurelius observed, 'The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.' Despite taking opposite sides of the dialectic on political and cultural issues over the decades, we found ourselves united in opposition to the constitutional transgressions and rising tyranny of the past few years – the lockdowns, mandates, and systematic erosion of basic rights. This unity emerged not from political alignment but from a shared code: a commitment to first principles that transcends partisan divisions. In these contemplative moments, I’ve found myself returning to Aurelius’s Meditations – a book I hadn’t opened since college until Joe Rogan and Marc Andreessen’s excellent conversation inspired me to revisit it. Aurelius understood that a personal code – a set of unwavering principles – was essential for navigating a world of chaos and uncertainty. The connection feels particularly apt – like my own friend group, Rogan’s platform exemplifies a code of authentic discourse in our age. Critics, particularly on the political left, often talk about needing their 'own Joe Rogan,' missing entirely what makes his show work: its genuine authenticity. Despite being historically left-leaning himself, Rogan’s willingness to engage in real-time thinking with guests across the ideological spectrum and across a broad variety of topics, his commitment to open inquiry and truth-seeking, has paradoxically led to his estrangement from traditional liberal circles – much like many of us who’ve found ourselves branded as apostates for maintaining consistent principles. This commitment to a code of authentic discourse explains why organizations like Brownstone Institute – despite being routinely smeared as 'far right' – have become a crucial platform for independent scholars, policy experts, and truth-seekers. I witnessed this firsthand at a recent Brownstone event, where, unlike most institutions that enforce ideological conformity, diverse thinkers engaged in genuine exploration of ideas without fear of orthodoxy enforcement. When attendees were asked if they considered themselves political liberals ten years ago, nearly 80% raised their hands. These are individuals who, like my friends and me, still embrace core liberal values – free speech, open inquiry, rational debate – yet find themselves branded as right-wing or conspiracy theorists merely for questioning prevailing narratives. What unites this diverse community is their shared recognition that the reality being presented to us is largely manufactured, as explored in 'The Information Factory,' and their commitment to maintaining authentic discourse in an age of enforced consensus. In The Wire, Omar Little, a complex character who lived by his own moral code while operating outside conventional society, famously declared, 'A man got to have a code.' Though a stick-up man targeting drug dealers, Omar’s rigid adherence to his principles – never harming civilians, never lying, never breaking his word – made him more honorable than many supposedly 'legitimate' characters. His unwavering dedication to these principles – even as a gangster operating outside society’s laws – resonates deeply with my experience. Like Rogan’s commitment to open dialogue, like Brownstone’s dedication to free inquiry, like RFK Jr.’s determination to expose how pharmaceutical and agricultural interests have corrupted our public institutions: these exemplars of authentic truth-seeking mirror what I’ve found in my own circle. My friends and I may have different political views, but we share a code: a commitment to truth over comfort, to principle over party, to authentic discourse over social approval. This shared foundation has proven more valuable than any superficial agreement could be. In these times of manufactured consensus and social control, the importance of this authentic foundation becomes even clearer. The 2012 Smith-Mundt Modernization Act, which made it legal to propagandize American citizens, merely formalized what many had long suspected. It represented the ultimate betrayal of the government’s code with its citizens – the explicit permission to manipulate rather than inform. As anyone not under the spell has come to realize – we’ve all been thoroughly 'Smith-Mundt’ed.' This legal framework helps explain much of what we’ve witnessed in recent years, particularly during the pandemic – when those who proclaimed themselves champions of social justice supported policies that created new forms of segregation and devastated the very communities they claimed to protect. This disconnect becomes even more apparent in the realm of charitable giving and social causes, where 'virtue laundering' has become endemic. The absence of a genuine moral code is nowhere more evident than in our largest charitable institutions. While many charitable organizations do crucial work at the local level, there’s an unmistakable trend among large NGOs toward what a friend aptly calls the 'philanthropath class.' Consider the Clinton Foundation’s activities in Haiti, where millions in earthquake relief funds resulted in industrial parks that displaced farmers and housing projects that never materialized. Or examine the BLM Global Network Foundation, which purchased luxury properties while local chapters reported receiving minimal support. Even major environmental NGOs often partner with the world’s biggest polluters, creating an illusion of progress while fundamental problems persist. This pattern reveals a deeper truth about the professional charitable class – many of these institutions have become purely extractive, profiting from and even amplifying the very issues they purport to solve. At the top, a professional philanthropic class collects fancy titles in their bios and flashes photos from charity galas while avoiding any genuine engagement with the problems they claim to address. Social media has democratized this performance, allowing everyone to participate in virtue theater – from black squares and Ukrainian flag avatars to awareness ribbons and cause-supporting emojis – creating an illusion of activism without the substance of real action or understanding. It’s a system entirely devoid of the moral code that once guided charitable work – the direct connection between benefactor and beneficiary, the genuine commitment to positive change rather than personal aggrandizement. The power of a genuine code becomes most evident in contrast with these hollow institutions. While organizations and social networks fracture under pressure, I’m fortunate that my closest friendships and family bonds have only grown stronger. We’ve had fierce debates over the years, but our shared commitment to fundamental principles – to having a code – has allowed us to navigate even the most turbulent waters together. When the pandemic response threatened basic constitutional rights, when social pressure demanded conformity over conscience, these relationships proved their worth not despite our differences, but because of them. As we navigate these complex times, the path forward emerges with striking clarity. From Marcus Aurelius to Omar Little, the lesson remains the same: a man gotta have a code. The crisis of authenticity in our discourse, the chasm between proclaimed and lived values, and the failure of global virtue-signaling all point to the same solution: a return to genuine relationships and local engagement. Our strongest bonds – those real relationships that have weathered recent storms – remind us that true virtue manifests in daily choices and personal costs, not in digital badges or distant donations. This Thanksgiving, I find myself grateful not for the easy comforts of conformity but for those in my life who demonstrate real virtue – the kind that comes with personal cost and requires genuine conviction. The answer lies not in grand gestures or viral posts, but in the quiet dignity of living according to our principles, engaging with our immediate communities, and maintaining the courage to think independently. As both the emperor-philosopher and the fictional street warrior understood, what matters isn’t the grandeur of our station but the integrity of our code. Returning one final time to Meditations, I’m reminded of Aurelius’s timeless challenge: 'Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.'

The Strategic Defeat Of Iran’s Regime In The Region: Consequences...	The Iranian regime, already mired in insurmountable domestic crises and faced with persistent uprisings that have pushed it to the brink of collapse, sought to shift the narrative through regional conflict. On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched an attack on Israel, seemingly with Tehran's endorsement, aiming to achieve two goals: 1. Suppress internal dissent and prevent renewed uprisings. 2. Create a regional distraction, hoping the conflict would result in a temporary or permanent ceasefire, ultimately allowing Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to solidify his rule. However, this gambit miscalculated the response of Israel’s right-wing government, which identified Iran as the mastermind behind the attack. Israel resolved to neutralize the threat posed by Iran's regional proxies, particularly Hezbollah, Iran's most valuable militant asset in Lebanon. Hezbollah's Retreat: A Strategic Blow Despite Tehran’s initial attempts to keep Hezbollah out of full-scale conflict, the flames of war engulfed the group, leading to devastating losses. Within two months, Hezbollah was forced to sign a ceasefire with Israel. This retreat underscored the regime’s declining influence in a changing Middle East. Simultaneously, the situation in Syria spiralled out of Tehran's control. Emboldened by Hezbollah’s setbacks, Syrian opposition forces launched a surprise offensive, recapturing key areas like Aleppo and Hama. The Iranian regime's investments in Syria, once a symbol of its regional dominance, crumbled in mere days. Domestic Implications of Regional Losses The regime’s strategic depth is collapsing, further fuelling domestic unrest. Social dissatisfaction, driven by economic crises, has reached boiling point. Iranian regime President Masoud Pezeshkian recently admitted to the growing crises: 'Forty-five years after the revolution, our problems worsen daily. If we had chosen the right path, why are we here? Clearly, we are at fault.' Economic mismanagement, exemplified by ballooning debt and failing institutions, exacerbates the regime's fragility. The conservative-dominated parliament, fearful of the nation's explosive socio-economic conditions, has turned against Pezeshkian's administration, rejecting key legislative reforms. Protests across Iran continue to highlight the population's demand for systemic change. Mounting International Pressure On the international stage, Iran faces renewed scrutiny over its nuclear ambitions. On November 21, the IAEA issued its second resolution in five months, condemning Tehran's lack of transparency regarding undeclared nuclear sites. The regime also risks the activation of the 'snapback mechanism,' which could reimpose comprehensive international sanctions. Europe, historically favouring diplomacy with Iran, is shifting its stance. A conference in Brussels, attended by Maryam Rajavi and European Parliament members, underscored this policy shift. The conference highlighted the need for a tougher approach to counter Iran's destabilizing activities and support for a democratic alternative. A Democratic Alternative: A Vision for Post-Regime Iran Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), outlined a roadmap for Iran’s transition to democracy during the Brussels conference. Her plan includes: 1. A six-month transitional government tasked with organizing elections for a constitutional assembly. 2. Dissolution of the NCRI upon the assembly's formation, transferring power to elected representatives. 3. Drafting a new constitution and holding a referendum to establish a democratic republic. Rajavi emphasized the NCRI's commitment to a society based on freedom, equality, and the rule of law, rejecting all forms of dictatorship. Key tenets of her vision include gender equality, freedom of speech, separation of religion and state, and the abolition of the death penalty. Conclusion The Iranian regime’s regional losses and escalating domestic and international crises signal an irreversible decline. As Tehran struggles to maintain control, the possibility of a democratic transition grows stronger. The alternative proposed by the NCRI offers a hopeful vision for an Iran free from oppression, poised to re-join the global community as a peaceful and democratic nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum3aW42jO4oa7	2024-12-01T17:22:09-08:00	
Circassians Have A Chance To Lead Coming Parade Of Exits From Mus...	Below is a speech I delivered online to the Second International Conference on Independent Circassia on Nov. 23. A video of this speech is available at youtu.be/AG8f94YS164?si=B_VxbzzCnfVD1-fz, and I want to thank Adel Bashqawi for producing a text version of it (justicefornorthcaucasus.info/?p=1251685433). I reproduce the text here with my own title for readers of Window on Eurasia Circassia’s Prospects for Recovering Independence have Never Been Better A year ago, I had the opportunity to speak at an earlier conference of the ICIC, and I am honored and extremely pleased to have the chance to return and speak with you again. Although I know far less about Circassians and the Circassian cause than most of you, I can present the perspective of a sympathetic and supportive outsider, which is what I plan to do this morning. As I said a year ago, I am—and remain—quite sure that Circassia is on the path to being restored. I believe this will happen within a decade or less, its independence will be recognized, and we will celebrate an enormous Circassian victory after so many years of struggle. However, at that time, I also cautioned that the final steps toward achieving these goals may prove to be the most difficult. The events of the ensuing months have only reinforced my confidence in both my prediction of Circassian independence and the immense challenges that lie ahead due to Moscow’s reactions. Ironically, while Moscow’s responses have made the outcome more likely, they have also complicated the path forward. I believe the Circassian community will overcome these challenges only by confronting them directly and making full use of the resources at their disposal. Today, I would like to revisit some of what I said last year and provide an update in light of changes in the international environment. The strategies Circassians need to employ to achieve their goals have evolved in fundamental ways, and these changes must be recognized. Five Key Considerations for the Circassian Cause As I stated a year ago, Circassians and their supporters must keep five crucial considerations in mind as they pursue their goals. These points highlight both the resources available to Circassians and the difficulties in using them effectively, particularly in the face of Moscow’s likely escalation of its police powers, diplomatic efforts, security services, and propaganda aimed at discrediting the Circassian cause. 1. The Unique Strength of the Circassian Nation Circassians are uniquely positioned among non-Russian peoples within the current borders of the Russian Federation. They have a large and increasingly assertive ethnic population in their homeland and an even larger, nationally conscious diaspora. In fact, the Circassians have the largest diaspora of any people within Russia’s borders. Moreover, many Circassians, including some of you here today, have learned to leverage social media to unite their homeland and diaspora communities. This creates a powerful dynamic: actions in one part of the Circassian nation strengthen the other, and Moscow’s moves against one lead to new losses for Russia elsewhere. 2. Ukraine as a Strategic Ally Never before has the Circassian nation had as important an ally as it does now in Ukraine. Kyiv recognizes Circassians as natural allies in their shared struggle against Russian imperialism. The deeper Russia becomes embroiled in its war of aggression, the more Ukraine can be counted on to support the Circassian cause. If someone had predicted in 2020 that the Ukrainian parliament would endorse Circassia, it would have seemed unimaginable. Now, it’s only a matter of time before we see stronger declarations of support. 3. The International Shift in Perception The international community is increasingly recognizing a truth they were once reluctant to admit: Putin embodies the problem, but the Russian Federation’s existence as an imperial state is an enduring threat to world peace. For true stability, Russia must be dismantled. The Circassians, along with other unrecognized or submerged peoples, stand to benefit from this geopolitical shift. The collapse of Russia’s centralized administration offers Circassians an unprecedented opportunity to reclaim their independence. 4. Alliances Within Russia Circassians also have potential allies within the Russian Federation, including ethnic Russians outside Moscow’s power structure. These regionalists and non-Muscovite Russians also suffer under the centralized 'Muscovite yoke' and increasingly see Circassians as a leading force for post-imperial transformation. Much like the Baltic nations’ role at the end of Soviet times, Circassians are poised to play a leadership role in shaping a post-Russian reality. 5. Moscow’s Institutional Weakness In Soviet and early post-Soviet times, Moscow’s institutions were stronger, making it harder for Circassians to achieve their goals. Now, Putin’s systematic destruction of these institutions has backfired. This collapse makes the prospect of a radically new political order more likely, benefiting peoples like the Circassians. Recognizing this moment’s significance is critical. Avoiding Self-Defeating Attitudes Despite these opportunities, there are risks. Some may view the challenges as insurmountable and retreat into inaction, while others might assume victory is inevitable and fail to act decisively. Both attitudes are dangerous. Inaction forfeits today’s advantages, while complacency allows Moscow to claim undeserved victories. Circassians must act carefully, thoughtfully, and urgently. They must adapt to the shifting international environment and focus their efforts where they will have the greatest impact. Focus on Europe and Turkey Circassians must recognize that the future of their cause is now more dependent on Europe and Turkey than on the United States. While it is painful for me as an American to admit, Europe—along with Ankara—will play a more decisive role in shaping the region’s future. Circassians should focus their diplomatic and advocacy efforts on Brussels, Paris, Berlin, and Ankara while continuing to engage with Kyiv and their fraternal peoples within Russia. Leveraging the Diaspora The Circassian diaspora remains a unique and invaluable resource. To maximize its impact, Circassians need a centralized, multilingual internet portal to provide daily updates on developments in Circassia. Such a platform, accessible in Turkish, Circassian, Arabic, English, French, German, and Ukrainian, would ensure the global community stays informed. This information flow is critical for building and maintaining international support. Unity Without Uniformity Circassians must remain united while accepting that unity does not require unanimity. Agreeing on core principles is essential, but diversity of opinion is healthy and necessary. Moscow’s security services are adept at exploiting divisions, so Circassians must be vigilant against attempts to sow discord. Preparing for Moscow’s Escalation Finally, as Circassians approach their goal of reviving their state, they must anticipate increased aggression from Moscow. The collapse of the Russian Empire this time will be more radical and may even lead to Russia’s dissolution. This prospect terrifies Moscow, making its reaction likely to be more violent and subversive. Circassians must counter this with accurate, timely information to rally international support and prevent Russian narratives from dominating the discourse. Conclusion In closing, I want to thank the organizers for allowing me, a supportive outsider, to participate in this important gathering. I look forward to the day when the International Conference on Independent Circassia (ICIC) can hold such conferences not in foreign capitals, but in a revived and flourishing Circassian state. God willing, I hope to join you all there in celebration. Thank you.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum2Bvg9t5Ng9W	2024-12-01T17:17:19-08:00	
Ukraine And Gaza: Zelensky And Netanyahu Pyrrhic Victories – OpEd	As the two wars in Ukraine and Gaza grind to a halt and uneasy peace, who are winners and losers; and what are the lessons that the world can take away from the war and aftermath. First there are no victors amongst the combatants - not military, not political or from any other summation, although so-called independent western and allied Asian media would have their readers believe otherwise. Apart from those killed fighting the wars, what is more appalling has been the impact on those directly or indirectly in the path of the rockets, missiles and other military weaponry unleashed in war and non-war zones. Ukrainians, Russians, Palestinians, Lebanese, Israelis - all are casualties, victims and losers with estimates running into several millions and still counting. * krainian-soldiers-killed-in-full-scale-war/+ 0-2024-5da3ce43df8662fe9eeab4ad804bdc0f^^ =According%20to%20UN%20OCHA%20estimates,the%20number%20exceeds%201%20million.^^^ and-injuries-caused-by-the-israel-and-hamas-war/ Gaza’s Health Ministry has stated that the Palestinian real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. In Ukraine, The Economist newspaper, basing its calculations on leaked or published intelligence reports, defense officials, researchers, and open-source intelligence reported that Ukraine and Russia lost a greater share of their population than the U.S. during the Korean and Vietnam wars combined. The paper may have been paying tribute to President Biden's credo to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian. Zelensky and Netanyahu: Winners or Losers Although still lionized by US and western allies as indomitable fighters of freedom, peace and security, the two leaders of Ukraine and Israel are unlikely to be well regarded by history or even their own people. Both Volodymyr Zelensky and Benjamin Netanyahu not only failed to pursue but also spurned the offers of peace for the longest time and were insistent that they could win military victories. Their intransigence and refusal to sit at the negotiation table is now coming to an end. Zelensky will soon find that his new position, following Donald Trump’s presidential victory, is too little too late in terms of the enormity of the cost to Ukraine which has a reconstruction programme that will stretch for several decades ahead. As for Netanyahu, his repeated promise of 'war without end' and refusal to accept a Palestinian state will especially backfire on Israel's future generation if not renounced by the next Israeli leader. The Big Winners The real winners of the two wars are US and western military-industrial complexes (MIC). A report in Spanish paper, El Pais noted that the market value of the main military equipment manufacturers in the United States and Europe has skyrocketed over the past two and a half years in the wake of the two wars. This was confirmed by a study of the financial and strategic consultancy organisation, Accuracy, which analyzed the performance of the seven main U.S. companies in the industry and their European counterparts from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries (NATO). See the-value-of-major-arms-manufacturers.html Not coincidentally, NATO played a key role in the Ukraine war initially by extending its membership to former Soviet Union countries beyond what had been agreed by American and European leaders to their Russian counterparts. It has more blood on its hands in Ukraine than commonly known. Recent declassified documents dating back to 1990 reveal that security assurances against NATO expansion were made to Soviet leaders by James Baker, George Bush, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Helmut Kohl, Robert Gates, Mitterrand, Margaret Thatcher, Douglas Hurd, John Major, and Manfred Woerner. Russian leaders then were Mikhail Gorbachev and Eduard Shevardnadze (See orbachev-heard-western-leaders-early). This chapter of NATO and Russian relations following the breakup of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany provides a different analysis of the origins of the war in which western leaders and media point to Russian president Vladimir Putin as the aggressor and instigator, and insist that the blame is entirely on the Russian side whilst NATO is an innocent and unwilling stake player. Following the Russian advance into Ukraine in February 2022, NATO member countries have mobilized a massive inflow of military and non military assistance to Ukraine, the intention and effect of which has been to keep Zelensky away from the negotiation table. According to the Accuracy report, the stock market capitalization of the military dependent companies - mislabeled to the public as defence companies when in fact their products are multi purpose - had increased by 59.7% from 24 February 2022, when the war in Ukraine began to March 2024. The rise is much higher than that of the benchmark stock market indexes on both sides of the Atlantic (S&P 500 and Eurostoxx 50), which in the same period recorded increases of just over 13% and 7%, respectively. U.S. companies that are winners in the market according to the report are Honeywell International, RTX Corporation, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, L3Harris and Huntington Ingalls. On the European side, the winner list of companies included France’s Safran, Dassault Aviation and Thales; the U.K.’s BAE Systems; Germany’s Rheinmetall; Italy’s Leonardo, and Norway’s Kongsberg Gruppen. According to Ignacio Lliso, a partner at Accuracy the companies they selected were those whose activity is heavily influenced by the ‘defense’ sector. The findings of the study accords with that of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) which found that global military spending in 2023 was $2,443 billion, a 6.8% increase from 2022. This was the largest increase since 2009. The average military expenditure as a share of government expenditure was 6.9% in 2023 and world military spending per person was $306, the highest since 1990. See ng-tensions-and-insecurity Pressure for new wars to feed and strengthen the MIC’s and defence companies of the world will continue unabated. All that is required are leaders such as those currently entrenched who are intent on pursuing the new cold war version of ‘freedom, peace and security’.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum92XSO3H3KkE	2024-12-01T17:05:52-08:00	
How The Philippines Is Losing Its Way – Analysis	Economic futures that were within reach in the Philippines just a few years ago are slipping away. The ongoing political noise will not affect the performance of the economy, given the government's 'sound and sustained' economic policies, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said Thursday. Unsurprisingly, NEDA Secretary Arsenio Balisacan issued the statement after meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Senate President Francis Escudero and Speaker Martin Romualdez in Malacañang. In reality, the economy is not immune to political flames. Forget BRIC-like futures 'Political noise won't slow down economy,' Balisacan pledged. 'Our economic policies, our economic policy directions are sound and sustained.' In the past year, the tensions in the Philippine political class have escalated dramatically, exploding in the past few weeks, coupled with renewed China friction and the effort to cement Manila’s way into the Indo-Pacific front. The stakes are high because such alignments have already caused massive displacement and devastation in Ukraine and Gaza and could prove far more destructive in Taiwan Straits and Southeast Asia. Judging by the headlines and debates of the political class, the primary objectives are currently political. Meanwhile, the Philippines economy is taking one hit after another. Hence, the effort to assuage constituencies that everything is fine. In reality, the post-pandemic impoverishment and runaway inflation have undermined ordinary Filipinos’ economic prospects. No BRIC-like future is viable in the Philippines as long as the country’s focus is on personal politics and geopolitics rather than on Filipino welfare and struggle against poverty. Economic growth: expectations vs. realities Early in the year, US news agency Bloomberg asked President Marcos Jr whether the Philippines could achieve an 8% growth rate. 'Why not?' the president replied. 'Yes, I think it is, I think it is doable.' Marcos expected the country to achieve up to 7% growth for 2024. Yet, the GDP year-on-year growth was only 5.2% in the third quarter of 2024. In the past three quarters, household consumption has grown only by 4.8% year-on-year; the slowest in the post-pandemic quarters. In historical view, something similar occurred last time in late 2011, over 13 years ago. Philippines GDP annual growth rate (%), 2010-2024. Source: Philippine Statistics Authority; author The slow pace was presumably due to sustained high inflation in the past 1.5 years, weak credit gains and soft growth in durable equipment. Moreover, unemployment peaked at 4.7% in July, even before the rainy season, due to lower job-creation in construction, services and agriculture. Potential for negative turns Supporting growth, investment spending reached 6% year-on-year in the first half of the year, along with net exports. The former relies on rising debt and the latter presumes a steady course. The problem is that, in the coming months, both will become more uncertain with the impending Trump trade and technology wars. Most analysts expect improved growth with easing inflation into 2025, which should provide relief to household purchasing power. However, this scenario relies on the hoped-for rate cuts and continued lower inflation rate. The two are affected by US rates and inflation; particularly due to the increasing economic dependency of the Philippines on the West and the US in particular. Philippines Interest Rate and Inflation. Source: Philippine Statistics Authority; author President-elect Trump has pledged that under his rule, 'inflation will vanish completely.' That, of course, is baloney. Trump’s policy proposals are likely to worsen inflation. Trump’s plans to impose huge tariffs on imported goods, deport millions of migrant workers and demand a voice in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policies would likely send prices surging, as 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists warned back in June. Trade deficit adversities Not only has the Philippine trade deficit continued to widen, but recently it posted its largest increase in over two years. The country’s trade deficit posted a 43.4% growth in September 2024; the highest since the 81.1% growth recorded in August 2022, amid the pandemic plunge. In September, the United States (17.3%) was the country’s top trade partners, along with Hong Kong (13.9%), Japan (13.5%), and China (13.3%). China, meanwhile, was the country’s top import source, accounting for 25% of total imports in September 2024; more than twice as much as the second-ranked Indonesia or Japan. Here's the problem. As Philippine friction has dramatically accelerated with China, the country’s largest trade partner – Hong Kong/China (27%) – faces long-term risks. There are alternatives but all of them will add to rather than reduce the inherent economic costs. The spread of geopolitical friction into trade in bilateral trade would prove very costly to the Philippines because it would penalize affordable China prices and foster a return of higher costs thus contributing to inflation. Investment and tourism from China have already plunged dramatically. Also, Manila has a trade surplus with the US. Misguided trade wars and geopolitics Since most ASEAN economies are net exporters to the US, they cannot avoid consequences when Trump implements his 10%-20% tariff on imports of all goods from all countries, in addition to 60% tariff on Chinese imports. In the Philippines, additional concerns linger on heightened security risks since Manila has pledged alliance to US military ties. Such tariffs could reduce exports from non-China Asia by 3% or more. Those ASEAN members, which hope to benefit from investment if multinationals away from China, now tout their economic and geopolitical loyalty to the US. Hence, too, the recent friction between Manila and Beijing, fueled by the effort to acquire US mid-range missiles, which China calls a 'provocative.' These geopolitical calculations have turned the Philippines an outlier in the ASEAN, as evidenced by the State of Southeast Asia 2024 survey. Economic development can only be premised on peace and stability, not on missiles and geopolitics. Despite some political disagreements with China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and other ASEAN countries have successfully built their economic progress on this premise. So could the Philippines.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyumzvGzJAE9q-y	2024-12-01T16:54:34-08:00	
Controversy Has Dogged Anti-Crossover Measures In Maldives, India...	The conflict has been between the need to bring about political stability and order on the one hand, and respect the democratic freedoms of the Members of Parliament, on the other. Party cross overs have been dime a dozen in South Asian democracies. They were rampant in India in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. They were symptomatic of widespread political corruption, political instability and moral decay in society at large. India and the Maldives have passed anti-crossover or anti-defection laws to ensure political stability. India did it in 1985 and Maldives in 2024. Some democratic organizations tried to work out legislation to curb defections but failed due to vested interests blocking the efforts. But is an anti-crossover law the answer to MPs' switching sides and creating instability? Will the law work satisfactorily or has it worked satisfactorily? Opinion in Maldives and India is divided, with some saying it ensures stability and some saying it only curbs MPs' democratic rights and promotes inner party dictatorship. Maldives The Maldivian government led by President Mohamed Muizzu recently got the Majlis or parliament, to pass an anti-crossover or anti-defection law to ensure political stability in parliament and strengthen loyalty to political parties which had put up candidates and got them elected. Parliament amended Article 73 of the Maldivian constitution, to make MPs lose their seats if they defected to another party or were expelled from their party. Previously, MPs ditching their parties were only expected to resign. There was no word about what would happen if they refused to resign. Under the amended rules, however, ouster from parliament will be automatic. The Maldivian parliament also passed the State's Debt Bill and the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, in line with the recommendations of parliament's Public Accounts Committee. Another new measure was the centralization of the planning of development schemes so that there could be coordinated development. The constitutional amendments also included prior parliamentary approval for the use of Maldivian territory by foreign nationals for military purposes. Justifying these measures President Mohamed Muizzu said: 'These amendments are critical decisions made for the sake of the people in order to safeguard the country's independence, sovereignty, development and stability. These decisions were made by the honourable members of the People's Majlis (parliament) with patriotic fervour and in the national interest.' Opposition Goes to Court However, the Maldives opposition cried foul on the amendments. It moved the Supreme Court on the matter and the court agreed to hear the case. On November 24, former member of parliament, Ali Hussain, petitioned the Supreme Court to strike down the anti-defection rules as unconstitutional. He said that the amendments conflicted with constitutional provisions on fundamental rights and the functions and privileges of MPs. The Maldives Democratic Party (MDP) and another party, The Democrats, joined the case as third parties. They said that the amendments eroded constitutional supremacy, deprived the people of their right to elect representatives, and violated basic democratic principles and legislative precedents. According to The Diplomat, the anti-defection rules allow parties to enforce their 'whip' with the threat of expulsion from the parliament seat. It was also pointed out that the measures were passed in a frightful hurry. On November 20, President Muizzu's People's National Congress (PNC) used its 75-seat supermajority in the 93-member Majlis to insert the new provisions into the constitution. The government-sponsored legislation was submitted late on November 19, taken up by parliament the following morning, and pushed through in less than nine hours. President Muizzu ratified the bill on the same day. Local rights groups led by anti-corruption NGO Transparency Maldives, expressed grave concern over 'a marked absence of transparency in the unprecedented amendment process, inadequate procedural safeguard mechanisms, and the potential erosion of fundamental democratic principles.' The rights groups condemned 'the lack of proper review, informed debate and public consultation in the rushed legislative process. ' They further said: 'The anti-defection provisions undermine the foundational democratic principle of representative choice and constrain the political independence of parliamentarians.' To avoid losing their seats, lawmakers would be compelled to vote as instructed by their parties regardless of personal objections or the interests of constituents, the rights groups' joint statement explained. 'Such centralization of control would weaken internal party democracy and effectively subordinate the autonomy of elected representatives,' it added. Rights activists also said that vesting the power to formulate national development policies solely with the President 'undercuts the mandate of local councils to make development plans in close consultation with the public.' India's Experience with Anti-Crossover Law India passed its Anti-Defection law in 1985. However, it has not proved to be useful though Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who authored it, had the noblest of intentions in introducing it. He wanted to prevent crazy and unprincipled cross overs for power and pelf, destroying the party system on which parliamentary democracy rested. An assessment of the working of the law published recently in Indian Express said that the anti-defection promoted the dictatorship of the party leadership, especially its General Secretary. It restricted the legislators' freedom of speech by making MPs accountable to party leaders (or the party line) rather than to their constituents, thereby challenging the essence of representative democracy. The Indian anti-defection law discriminated against independent members, who were elected by the people by immediately disqualifying them if they joined a political party. In contrast, nominated members were given a six-month grace period, it was pointed out. The Indian Express said that the law needed a set timeline for resolving defection cases. These cases took years to be decided thus nullifying the law. The Indian law also allowed large-group defections, fostering opportunistic mergers and 'horse-trading', destabilising the political system. It banned only individual defections. In other words, the law disallowed 'retail' defections but allowed 'wholesale' defections! Additionally, it failed to address the root causes of political misbehaviour like corruption and electoral malpractices. It did not deter parties from accepting defectors. All these issues had prompted calls for revising the law to balance party discipline and political stability with individual rights and the imperatives of democracy. Debate on the constitutional amendments took place amid protests by supporters of the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) outside parliament. Proposals by the MDP to conduct a consultation process and to hold public referendums on dismissing lawmakers were flatly rejected the protesters said. A Maldivian media outlet Adhadhu, alleged that the sudden changes made by the government followed 'rumours that some MPs of the ruling Peoples' National Congress (PNC) were planning to leave the party after the High Court was petitioned to quash part of the Anti-Defection Act that requires MPs to resign for floor crossing.' Sri Lanka Defections from one party to another had been common in Sri Lanka but still there is no anti-defection law as such. This is because increasing a parliamentary party's clout through defections has been an acceptable practice with no great stigma accruing. However, political parties which had lost members to the ruling party, had gone to court to nullify the defections. But these have not borne fruit always. Unlike in the Maldives and India, in Sri Lanka, an MP who defects does not lose his seat, but he can be expelled from the party he had belonged to, and someone else from the party list could be appointed in his place. But this could be challenged in court on the grounds that the expulsion was not done through due procedure and in a democratic manner. For example, an inquiry might not have been held. But Sri Lankan courts have overwhelmingly held expulsions to be invalid on various grounds. In 2023, Sunday Times editorially suggested enacting an Anti-Defection Law, saying: 'The reality has been that defections are rarely based on conscience and largely engineered in today's political context by crude monetary gains or political agendas. That must be stopped forthwith. But how? A Government always has an advantage in that it has plums to dangle to bait opposition MPs. The traffic in defections is usually one-way.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum7w0etrt4Eps	2024-12-01T16:48:48-08:00	
Biden To Spotlight Angola’s Lobito Corridor, His Legacy To Counte...	By Patsy Widakuswara When U.S. President Joe Biden visits Angola on Wednesday, he will put into focus his legacy infrastructure project aimed at securing crucial supply chains on the African continent. Called the Lobito Corridor, the project is the centerpiece of his administration’s strategy to counter China’s clout in global development. The Lobito Corridor is a $5 billion investment across multiple sectors that is intended to revitalize and extend the 1,300-kilometer Benguela railway line. It will connect the 120-year-old Angolan port of Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in its second phase, to Zambia. Announced in September 2023, much of the corridor’s financing comes from the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The PGI is a Biden-led 2022 initiative from the Group of Seven wealthiest economies that evolved from his Build Back Better World plan launched in 2021 as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Once operational, it will boost access to critical minerals for the United States and its partners, including cobalt and copper, that are essential in electric vehicle manufacturing. According to a U.S. congressional report, 80% of the DRC’s copper mines are Chinese owned. China is responsible for mining 85% of the DRC’s rare earth minerals, including 76% of its cobalt. The Lobito Corridor is expected to cut transportation costs, open access to arable agricultural land and drive climate-resilient economic growth, Helaina Matza, acting special coordinator for the PGI at the U.S. Department of State, said Tuesday in a briefing to reporters. The PGI’s investments will 'amplify the impact of that infrastructure' with projects such as developing solar energy, local electricity networks and desalination efforts, she said. The project is championed by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. Angola owes about $17 billion to China, more than a third of its total debt. The debt is mostly in the form of infrastructure development loans, backed by oil, that funded the country’s economic recovery following three decades of civil war that ended in 2002. PGI to counter BRI Since launching the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, in 2013, China has become the main backer of global development financing. In Africa, Beijing has signed loan commitments with 49 African governments and seven regional institutions. From 2013 to 2021, China provided $679 billion for infrastructure projects around the world, according to a U.S. government analysis, while the U.S. provided $76 billion. The U.S., alongside G7 partners, announced in 2022 that the PGI aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 as an alternative to infrastructure financing models that are 'often opaque, fail to uphold environmental and social standards, exploit workers and leave the recipient countries worse off.' That’s a lot of financing to catch up to in a few years, and Lobito is 'the first and the most developed' project in that effort, said Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. 'That's the A+ project, but I don’t see a whole lot of other projects,' Schneidman told VOA. The PGI’s other project, the Luzon Corridor, was launched in April to support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila and Batangas in the Philippines. In Lobito, the U.S. works mostly with European partners. In Luzon, the U.S. is teaming up with Japan to secure critical industries such as semiconductors. The White House pushed back against the notion that Biden has scaled back his global infrastructure ambitions to the two corridors. 'We’ve mobilized more than $60 billion, just the U.S., and that’s a part of the larger G7,' national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA during a briefing last month. 'And that’s not just been for two corridors,' he said. 'That’s been for investments across Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.' US-Africa strategy In August 2022, the Biden administration launched an Africa strategy that 'reframes the region’s importance to U.S. national security interests,' the strategy says. Later that year, Biden hosted the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, where he pledged the U.S. to invest $55 billion in Africa over three years. 'We are overdelivering on that thus far,' Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said in a briefing Tuesday. 'We’ve invested more than 80% of that commitment.' But much of that $55 billion was allocated under existing programs and does not bring the kind of megaproject that is 'visible to the average African that says the United States financed that in the way that the Chinese do,' said Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Which is why the Lobito Corridor stands out, Dizolele told VOA. It is the 'one palpable project that people can look at and say, ‘If this is implemented, then maybe it would move things forward.’' On a continent where the presence of Chinese financing, businesses and migrants are so prevalent that many African countries teach Mandarin in schools and incorporate Chinese characters in public signage, that’s a start. Moving forward, activists hope the U.S. will not set aside social and environmental concerns that have besieged projects under Chinese financing. 'We have to ensure that we can hear all stakeholders engaging in the process,' said Sergio Calundungo, founder of the Social Observatory of Angola. So far, civil society groups have not been invited to the table, but they are ready to ensure that local communities can 'share as much as possible the prosperity through this important infrastructure,' he told VOA. Will it continue? President-elect Donald Trump will enter office in January. While some are concerned that the U.S. commitment to Africa might falter under his America First doctrine, analysts point to initiatives taken under his first administration. In 2018, the Trump administration launched Prosper Africa, an initiative that brings together U.S. government services to help investors do business on the continent. In 2019, it launched the Blue Dot Network, an international certification mechanism to ensure infrastructure projects meet environmental and social standards. They were aware that infrastructure investments needed 'to foster economic growth, to foster stability, but also for U.S. interests globally when competing with China,' said Joseph Lemoine, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Freedom and Prosperity Center. 'I'm hopeful that they will continue those efforts,' he told VOA. Trump also launched the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in 2020. The DFC is an agency that functions as America’s development bank, with $60 billion in lending capacity. DFC’s first CEO, Adam Boehler, a college roommate of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, spoke openly of linking development aid to foreign policy goals. In a 2020 interview, he admitted promising $2 billion for Indonesia should the country agree to join the Trump administration's Abraham Accords and recognize Israel. 'If you listen to all the Trump people, they want a foreign policy that's transactional,' Schneidman at Brookings said. Trump has promised to take a confrontational approach to China. Analysts say aligning infrastructure financing needs with Trump’s foreign policy goals may be an element in the U.S.-China rivalry that developing nations can leverage.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum0i83i92uZvE	2024-12-01T16:41:18-08:00	
UN Officials Raise Alarm Over Escalating Violence In Northwest Sy...	By Vibhu Mishra A sharp escalation in fighting in Syria’s Aleppo Governorate has displaced thousands and caused heavy civilian casualties, prompting urgent warnings from senior UN officials about the growing humanitarian crisis and threat to regional stability. The alarm comes amid a sharp escalation in fighting in the Aleppo Governorate, spreading to parts of Idleb and Hama governorates and leaving the situation volatile and unpredictable. In a statement on Sunday, UN Special Envoy for Syria Geir O. Pedersen expressed grave concerns over the dramatic shift in frontlines, including advances by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Security Council-designated terrorist group, and intensified government airstrikes. 'In a country torn by nearly 14 years of war and conflict, the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international peace and security,' he said. He stressed the urgent need to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, calling on all parties to uphold international law. 'What we see in Syria today is a mark of a collective failure to bring about what has plainly been required now for many years – a genuine political process to implement Security Council resolution 2254 (2015),' Mr. Pedersen added. Humanitarian crisis deepens Meanwhile, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria Adam Abdelmoula underscored the dire humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, where violence since November 27 has claimed civilian lives, including women and children, displaced families, and disrupted essential services. Describing the situation as 'tragic', he urged all parties to the conflict to immediately cease hostilities and to prioritise the protection of civilians, including the safety of aid workers. 'The people of Syria must not endure more suffering, and we urge dialogue to be given an opportunity,' he said. Thousands flee violence According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the violence in Aleppo has forced thousands to flee, many seeking refuge in unsafe open areas. The key M-5 Damascus-Aleppo Highway is inaccessible between Saraqab City (Idleb) and Aleppo. Curfews were imposed in Aleppo City on Friday and Saturday, and all public facilities, including universities and schools, have been suspended. Hospitals are said to be overwhelmed with injured individuals, while banks and automated teller machines (ATMs) running out of cash. 'This recent escalation of hostilities is coming at a time when countless people, many of whom have already endured the trauma of displacement, are now forced to flee once more, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods,' Mr. Abdelmoula said. He also highlighted the severity of the long-running crisis, noting that prior to the influx of more than half a million returnees and refugees from Lebanon since September, over 16.7 million people were already in need of humanitarian assistance. 'This latest violence adds even more lives that now need to be urgently saved,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum9yVu7n0dbzF	2024-12-01T16:36:01-08:00	
Georgia: Fresh Protests Erupt As Demonstrators Block Public Broad...	(RFE/RL) -- Georgia's prime minister has said President Salome Zurabishvili must leave office at the end of her term later this month, despite her pledge not to, while anti-government protesters -- who are supported by Zurabishvili -- took to the streets again, scuffling with security forces at key sites in the capital. Demonstrators gathered on December 1 in the courtyard of the Channel 1 public broadcaster, blocking the entrance and vowing to stay until leaders of the organization resign. Protesters also demanded the broadcaster report on the demonstrations of the pro-European groups as they stand opposed to the Russian-friendly Georgian Dream-led government. Channel 1 said in a statement that 'viewers are watching the unprecedented pressure' on its journalists. 'Channel 1 was and will remain free and will defend editorial independence despite any pressure,' it said. There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries at that site or near the parliament building, but video by Current Time showed large crowds of protesters and security personnel facing off, with water cannons and tear gas being fired. The Interior Ministry warned 'the aggressive participants of the rally to stop illegal activities, otherwise the ministry will take appropriate measures granted by law.' It also warned parents to keep their children away from the 'violent environment.' Shortly thereafter, police began moving protesters away from the parliament building and erected barricades. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's comments earlier in the day set up a showdown with Zurabishvili, a day after she called the newly elected parliament illegitimate and vowed to remain as president. Demonstrations in the capital, Tbilisi, have turned increasingly chaotic and violent. Georgia has plunged deeper into a political crisis that started in late October, when the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in parliamentary elections. The opposition said the vote was marred by fraud. Western countries have called for an investigation.Thousands of demonstrators had returned to the streets of Tbilisi on November 30 for a third night to protest against the government's decision to suspend accession talks with the European Union.In central Tbilisi, police fired tear gas and water cannons at demonstrators, some of whom chanted 'traitors' and held photographs of journalists who they say were beaten by police. Demonstrators have erected barricades on Tbilisi's main avenue. More than 200 people have been arrested in the past three days, officials said.Zurabishvili, who has allied herself with pro-European opposition, asserted that parliament does not have the right to choose her successor following the end of her term in December and she vowed to remain in office. 'There is no legitimate parliament, and therefore, an illegitimate parliament cannot elect a new president,' she said on November 30. 'Thus, no inauguration can take place, and my mandate continues until a legitimately elected parliament is formed,' she saidOn December 1, Kobakhidze dismissed her pledge, saying she would have to leave the office.Kobakhidze also dismissed the United States' announcement that it would suspend its strategic partnership with Georgia. Calling it a 'temporary event,' he said his government would talk to the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump when it takes office in January.Kobakhidze also accused opponents of the halt to EU talks of plotting a revolt, along the lines of Ukraine's 2014 Euromaidan protests. Sparked by the president's decision to spurn closer ties with the EU, months of protests in Kyiv culminated that February in violent street clashes. The president, Viktor Yanukovych, later fled the country.'Some people want a repeat of that scenario in Georgia,' he said. 'But there will be no Maidan in Georgia.'A State Department spokesman criticized the decision to suspend EU talks, saying it 'made Georgia more vulnerable to the Kremlin.' 'The United States condemns the excessive use of force by police against Georgians seeking to exercise their rights to assembly and expression, including their freedom to peacefully protest,' Matthew Miller said in a statement. U.S. authorities have sought to pressure Georgian officials, imposing sanctions on dozens of government officials whom Washington said had 'undermined' democracy and human rights in the country.The European Union's new foreign policy chief warned Georgian authorities over violence against demonstrators.'It is clear that using violence against peaceful protesters is not acceptable, and the Georgian government should respect the will of the Georgian people,' Kaja Kallas told journalists during a trip to Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyumyOmzdtD1u__	2024-12-01T16:29:58-08:00	
US Needs To Rethink Its Approach To Central Asia – Analysis	By Luke Coffey The foreign policy in-tray for the incoming Trump administration is filled to the brim. As Donald Trump nominates his Cabinet and prepares to reenter the Oval Office in January, major foreign policy issues demand attention. One region that must not be overlooked is Central Asia, an area that holds significant geopolitical and economic importance.The five Central Asian republics — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — are located at the heart of the Eurasian landmass. Since gaining independence in 1991 after the Soviet Union’s collapse, they have gradually developed unique foreign policies and national identities. Strategically situated at a historic crossroads for trade and transit, Central Asia has played an essential role in Eurasian commerce for thousands of years. The region, especially near the Caspian Sea, is also rich in natural resources, offering substantial economic potential.Despite its importance, US policymakers often overlook Central Asia. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the US improved relations with some Central Asian states due to military operations in Afghanistan. However, as US interests in Afghanistan diminished, so did engagement with the broader region. No sitting US president has ever visited Central Asia and only a handful of Cabinet-level visits have taken place. This lack of high-level attention signals a broader disengagement, which could undermine US strategic interests.Another issue is America’s approach to the region, which often prioritizes human rights and democratization over other critical matters, such as security, counterterrorism, energy and trade. While these values are essential, a balanced strategy is necessary to foster broader regional cooperation. The overemphasis on political reform has often alienated Central Asian governments, resulting in a lopsided relationship that fails to address mutual strategic interests effectively.In today’s era of great power competition, crafting a coherent US strategy for Central Asia is vital. The last US strategy for the region, published in February 2020, emerged during Trump’s first term. Though initially well-regarded, it is now outdated. The 2020 strategy focused on Afghanistan’s role in regional dynamics, an approach less relevant now since the US withdrawal and the Taliban’s return to power. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine have reshaped geopolitical and economic landscapes, requiring a reassessment of US priorities in Central Asia. There is currently little clarity on how the next Trump administration will approach the region. During Trump’s first term, key Cabinet members had considerable regional experience. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, previously ExxonMobil’s CEO, spent significant time in Central Asia due to the energy sector. Similarly, former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis had extensive regional knowledge from his tenure as chief of US Central Command. However, none of Trump’s recent appointments have demonstrated expertise in Central Asia, leaving the administration’s future approach uncertain. However, a new strategy is anticipated next year and several key areas should be prioritized to strengthen US ties with the region.First, the US must support Central Asian states in balancing their foreign policies. These nations are acutely aware of their geopolitical, economic and cultural ties with regional powers, such as Russia and China. The US should avoid framing engagement as a binary choice between the West and these powers, instead fostering relationships that acknowledge regional complexities, while promoting mutual interests. Encouraging multifaceted diplomacy will enable Central Asian countries to maintain autonomy, while engaging with all major global players.Second, energy and transit cooperation should be central to US engagement. Ensuring Europe diversifies its energy resources is vital due to NATO obligations, while Central Asian countries seek to broaden their export markets and enhance connectivity. The US should explore opportunities for expanding oil and gas projects and developing new transit routes. Notably, supporting the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline, which would connect Turkmenistan’s vast natural gas reserves to European markets, should be a clear policy goal. Such initiatives would not only strengthen energy security for Europe, but also provide Central Asian countries with alternative trade routes, reducing their dependence on Russia and China.Third, security cooperation must remain a priority. The US has long collaborated with Central Asian republics on counterterrorism, particularly in addressing the threat posed by regional extremists joining groups such as Daesh. For Central Asian governments, this issue is sensitive and best handled through discreet, trust-based engagement. With the US no longer present in Afghanistan, regional security concerns have intensified. Strengthening security partnerships with Central Asian countries is crucial for countering emerging threats and maintaining regional stability.Finally, in this era of great power competition, the US must collaborate with allies to promote shared interests in Central Asia. Recognizing the growing role of the Organization of Turkic States is essential. This grouping serves as a platform for Turkic countries, including four of the five Central Asian republics, to enhance trade, energy and political cooperation. Turkiye, a key NATO member and driving force behind the Organization of Turkic States, plays a crucial role despite current tensions with the West. Engaging with Turkiye through the organization offers an avenue for the US to pursue common goals in Central Asia, while reinforcing ties with Ankara.To support this new strategy, the Washington administration must prioritize showing up in the region. Trump should become the first US president to visit Central Asia, sending a strong signal of commitment. In the meantime, high-level visits by US officials would symbolize renewed engagement. Cabinet-level visits could strengthen diplomatic ties and lay the groundwork for deeper cooperation.Central Asia remains geopolitically significant to the US, as recent developments in Afghanistan have highlighted. If the US aims to compete effectively in great power competition, it cannot afford to neglect this critical region.

Uzbekistan: Religious Communities Blocked From Using Own Building...	By Mushfig Bayram Bukhara's registered Baptist Union Church has not been able to meet publicly for worship since May 2021. After a broken water pipe caused damage, the authorities sealed the Church building. Baptists told Forum 18 that they want to rebuild the Church building, but were told that they cannot do this as the regime's Cultural Heritage Agency will allow repair work to be done only by a specialised state company. A neighbour's house collapsed at the same time, but local authorities allowed them to rebuild their own house. Bukhara City Administration 'keeps promising us that they will hand over the building to us and asked us that we sign a paper we have received 500,000 Sums [about a week's average wages] for the repair work', Baptists told Forum 18. 'We are not so naive, and did not sign any papers.' Baptists added that they think that the 'local officials may have expropriated the funds and are trying to cover it up'. Corruption has long been endemic in the country, including in relation to freedom of religion or belief violations (see below). The Head of the City Administration, Kurbon Tursunov, claimed to Forum 18 that 'we cannot give the building to the Church without the permission of the central government in Tashkent as the Church is not a state entity but a private entity.' He appeared evasive when Forum 18 asked whether the central government had been asked for permission, dropping his voice and mumbling: 'Yes we have, but maybe they have not had time to look at our request.' He then claimed that the central government will answer within a week. Officials in the Office of the Prime Minister in Tashkent did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called (see below). Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov on 24 June ordered the seizure and possible demolition of more than 400 unregistered mosques and houses, built by residents but not registered with the Justice Ministry. In mid-July 2024, a State Security Service (SSS) secret police officer and an official of the local Administration's Religious Affairs Department came to Abu Zar Mosque in Yangiyul District of Tashkent Region. They said that as the Mosque is not functioning, it will be handed over for business use. A local Muslim linked the move to the Prime Minister's reported 24 June order (see below). Abu Zar Mosque, built with state permission, functioned from the 1990s. The regime closed the mosque in 2007 and it has not functioned since then, despite campaigns by local Muslims to reopen it. When Forum 18 on 25 April pointed out to Jakhongir Azomkhanov, Tashkent Regional Administration's official overseeing freedom of religion or belief issues, that the Abu Zar Mosque was built by the mosque community who would like to pray every day in their own mosque, and that travel to other mosques can be difficult, Azomkhanov did not address those points. On 21 November he refused to speak to Forum 18 about the continued forced closure of Abu Zar Mosque (see below). Gazalkent's local Baptist Church, part of the state-registered nationwide Baptist Union, has repeatedly tried to register with the regime. However, Bostanlyk District authorities in Tashkent Region continue to refuse registration applications. 'The Church can hold meetings in the building without any interference from the authorities,' Baptists told Forum 18. 'But we would like to gain legal status so that we are not in a situation when at any time the Church could be prosecuted for the 'illegal' exercise of freedom of religion or belief.' Jakhongir Azomkhanov, Tashkent Regional Administration's official overseeing freedom of religion or belief issues, claimed not to be able to hear Forum 18 when it called him, although the line was clear. He then switched his phone to a fax machine. Bostanlyk District Administration officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called (see below). In June 2024, Baptists in Gulistan asked Syrdarya Region Architecture and Justice Departments to register a new building the congregation had built on land they own. Although the congregation has met for worship in the new building, they want registration as 'it is safer under the law to have meetings in a registered building.' However, the Regional Justice and Architecture Departments refused the application. The excuse given was that the Land Cadastre Department refused to recognise the sale of the land to the Baptists when the original landowner tried to register the sale. The mainly unoccupied building has now been damaged by vandalism, including broken windows. Repairing the damage is likely to be expensive for the congregation (see below). Sherzod Rasulov, who is responsible for the registration of religious organisations in Syrdarya Regional Justice Department, claimed to Forum 18: 'We do not have a problem to register them, but the Regional Administration and Architecture Department have not given them permission.' He then refused to discuss the issue more with Forum 18. Land Cadastre Department officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called. Irkin Muminov, Deputy Head of Syrdarya Regional Administration, refused to tell Forum 18 why his Administration refuses to register the Baptists' new church building. 'I do not know you and we have been told not to give any information over the phone,' he claimed (see below). On 25 April, two buildings under construction belonging to Urgench Council of Churches Baptists were ordered to be destroyed and were partially demolished. The demolition was halted after protests, but they are not being permitted to repair the damage or complete the construction of the buildings, local Baptists told Forum 18. Khorezm Regional Administration officials, and Zafarbek Khojaniyazov of the Land Cadastre Department (who is responsible for dealing with complaints) all did not answer whenever Forum 18 contacted them. So Forum 18 was unable to ask why they are refusing to give permission for the Baptists to repair the damage the regime has caused and complete the construction work (see below). Jehovah's Witnesses have made multiple attempts over many years to gain registration for their communities in Uzbekistan outside the town of Chirchik, the only place where they have a registered community. This problem exists throughout Uzbekistan, with regime officials frequently using property-based excuses to block registration applications from a variety of Muslim and non-Muslim religious communities. Such refusals cause many problems for religious communities seeking to exercise their freedom of religion or belief. The Religion Law does not allow religious communities to meet outside their registered address, and such meetings can face police raids (see below). Jehovah's Witnesses have many times sought to meet officials to discuss how to solve the problems caused by the regime's human rights violations. One such meeting was on 5 July with Dilnoza Muratova, Deputy Director of the state-controlled National Human Rights Centre. She claimed that Uzbekistan could not implement human rights obligations 'since there are no tools in Uzbek law'. Muratova did not explain why, when her state-controlled Centre was drafting the Religion Law, it was not drafted in a way that provided 'tools' to implement legally-binding human rights obligations instead of 'tools' to violate them. Forum 18 asked the Centre's Chief Specialist, Amir Khamidov, to explain this. He refused to answer, claiming: 'I need to get permission from the leadership to answer you' (see below). The grounds of the only functioning Buddhist temple in Uzbekistan, the Chaynsa (Compassion) temple in Tashkent, has long been under threat from the local authorities. In Buddhist belief this is a serious matter, as each part of a temple grounds has a sacred significance. The expansion of Tashkent's metro line was initially planned to include the demolition of the Chaynsa Temple. The Temple was not demolished, but a 12 meter wide overpass for the metro line was built 5 meters above the Temple grounds and close to the Temple itself. 'Although the noise from the metro line is not loud, a lot of dust from the line collects in the grounds and on the temple every day,' members of the Buddhist Community told Aleksei Volosevich, the editor of Asia Terra independent Tashkent news website (see below). The community wants the existing Temple to be moved to another location and reconstructed according to Buddhist beliefs. They also wanted any agreement to be made in writing and signed by the relevant officials, as well as published immediately. Contrary to their previous agreement, Zangiota District Administration has not given the Buddhist community a plot of land for a new temple and no agreement was reached at the July 2022 meeting. Tashkent Administration officials and Religious Affairs Committee officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. So Forum 18 was unable to ask them why they have not honoured their promise to the Buddhist community to provide them with another plot of land for their Temple (see below). Bukhara Baptist Church still blocked from using its building The registered Baptist Union Church in the historical part of the south-western city of Bukhara has not been able to meet publicly for worship since May 2021. After a broken water pipe caused damage because the authorities sealed the Church building, which dates from 1971. Baptists told Forum 18 that they wanted to rebuild the Church building, but were told that they cannot do this as the regime's Cultural Heritage Agency will allow repair work to be done only by a specialised state company. A neighbour's house collapsed at the same time, but local authorities allowed them to rebuild their own house. 'We asked the authorities to allow us to repair the new building, since they are not doing anything with it now, or allow us to construct a new building in the place of our sealed building,' Baptists told Forum 18. 'But they refused both our proposals.' Sukhrob Ochilov, Head of the Heritage Department's Bukhara regional division, wrote to the Church's pastor in July 2024, claiming the Department was not competent to remove the church building from the heritage register to allow it to be rebuilt. Ochilov declined to talk to Forum 18. Officials in 2024 appear to have changed their attitude to church members. 'Last year [2023] at least they were listening to us and promising that they will help us. Now some officials tell us directly to our face: Leave my office and get lost!' local Baptists told Forum 18. They did not want to identify these officials, for fear of state reprisals Since May 2021 the Church has been meeting privately in members' homes and renting public buildings, Bukhara Baptists told Forum 18 on 19 November. Bukhara City Administration was allocated funds by the government to repair a building offered to the Baptists, but has not begun the repairs, Baptists told Forum 18. Bukhara City Administration 'keeps promising us that they will hand over the building to us and asked us that we sign a paper we have received 500,000 Sums [about a week's average wages] for the repair work,' Baptists told Forum 18. 'We are not so naive, and did not sign any papers.' Baptists added that they think that the 'local officials may have expropriated the funds and are trying to cover it up.' Corruption has long been endemic in the country, including in relation to freedom of religion or belief violations. Many are reluctant to discuss corruption as a factor in the human rights violations they experience, yet there appears to be a strong connection between human rights violations and corruption. Nozim Nurov, Deputy Head of Bukhara City Administration, claimed to Forum 18 on 19 November that 'We cannot resume work on the building since there are some legal issues our administration's lawyers are working on.' He then declined to talk further. The Head of the City Administration, Kurbon Tursunov who was appointed on 1 May, claimed to Forum 18 on 19 November that 'we cannot give the building to the Church without the permission of the central government in Tashkent as the Church is not a state entity but a private entity.' He appeared to be evasive when Forum 18 asked whether the central government had been asked for permission, dropping his voice and mumbling: 'Yes we have, but maybe they have not had time to look at our request.' He then claimed that the central government will answer within a week. Officials in the Office of Prime Minister in Tashkent did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Tashkent Region's Abu Zar Mosque still closed Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov on 24 June ordered the seizure and possible demolition of more than 400 unregistered mosques and houses, built by residents but not registered with the Justice Ministry. Prime Minister Aripov has long been hostile – like the regime – to Muslims exercising their freedom of religion or belief outside state control. In September 2023, he is reported to have warned state officials not to attend mosques. Officials in the Office of Prime Minister did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Religious Affairs Committeeofficials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. So Forum 18 was unable to ask them why the regime has ordered the demolition of unregistered mosques. In mid-July 2024, a State Security Service (SSS) secret police officer and an official of the local Administration's Religious Affairs Department came to Abu Zar Mosque in Yangiyul District of Tashkent Region. They said that as the Mosque is not functioning, it will be handed over for business use. A local Muslim linked the move to the Prime Minister's reported 24 June order that unregistered Mosques should be demolished or handed over for business use. 'They just came, brazenly told us this and said that no one from the mahalla [local district] should get angry about it,' a local Muslim who asked not to be identified for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Abu Zar Mosque, built with state permission, functioned from the 1990s. The regime closed the mosque in 2007 and it has not functioned since then, despite campaigns by local Muslims to reopen it. 'Mahalla residents have actively tried to register it since 2017, going to all state agencies,' the Muslim said. 'Finally, in 2022 officials promised us that it would soon be re-opened. A full-scale renovation then took place. Now they are acting like this – I don't even know what to call it.' The regime has a long-standing policy of blocking state registration attempts by Shia and Sunni Muslim, Protestant, Catholic, Jehovah's Witness, and other religious communities, making it impossible for them to meet legally. Often the excuses used are property-related, with officials taking full advantage of the opportunities provided to them by the Religion Law for arbitrary and inconsistent actions. This has continued in 2024. Jakhongir Azomkhanov, Tashkent Regional Administration's official overseeing freedom of religion or belief issues, defended the regime's blocking of the Abu Zar Mosque community's registration attempts. 'There are very large mosques in the areas where Muslims can pray, and they can attend those,' he claimed to Forum 18 on 25 April. 'Those Mosques also have convenient parking places for private cars. Why don't they just attend those Mosques?' When Forum 18 pointed out that the Abu Zar Mosque was built by the mosque community who would like to pray every day in their own mosque, and that travel to other mosques can be difficult, Azomkhanov did not address those points. On 21 November he refused to speak to Forum 18 about the continued forced closure of the Abu Zar Mosque. Gazalkent Baptist Church repeatedly denied state registration The local Baptist Church in Gazalkent in Bostanlyk District of Tashkent Region, which is part of the state-registered nationwide Baptist Union, has repeatedly tried to re-register with the regime after the 1999 Religion Law imposed compulsory re-registration on religious communities. The 2021 Religion Law continues to impose a burdensome and arbitrary registration procedure, which violates the regime's legally-binding international human rights obligations. However, Bostanlyk District authorities continue to refuse registration applications, Baptists who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18 on 19 November 2024. 'The Church can hold meetings in the building without any interference from the authorities,' Baptists told Forum 18. 'But we would like to gain legal status so that we are not in a situation when at any time the Church could be prosecuted for the 'illegal' exercise of freedom of religion or belief.' Bostanlyk District Administration first refused a registration application in May 2000, alleging that registering a non-Baptist Protestant church in the District had caused riots. The Baptists had not heard of these alleged riots in their District, and the regime did not substantiate these claims with evidence. 'The District Administration then told Gazalkent Baptists to attend the Russian Orthodox Church instead.' Jakhongir Azomkhanov, Tashkent Regional Administration's official overseeing freedom of religion or belief issues, claimed on 21 November not to be able to hear Forum 18 when it called him, although the line was clear. He then switched his phone to a fax machine. Bostanlyk District Administration officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Religious Affairs Committee officials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. So Forum 18 was unable to ask them why the regime continues to, against its legally-binding international human rights obligations, obstruct state registration attempts and ban the unregistered exercise of freedom of religion or belief. Gulistan Baptist Church repeatedly denied state registration Regime officials in Syrdarya Region south-west of Tashkent refused in 2019 to register a local Baptist Union congregation in Gulistan, local Baptists who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals have told Forum 18. The congregation eventually gained state registration, but 'the registered address where we meet for worship is very small place, a 15 square meter room in a private house which does not have space for all our members,' local Baptists explained to Forum 18. In June 2024 the Baptists asked Syrdarya Region Architecture and Justice Departments to register a new building the congregation had built on land they own. Although the congregation has met for worship in the new building, they want registration as 'it is safer under the law to have meetings in a registered building'. However, the Regional Justice and Architecture Departments refused the application. The excuse given was that the Land Cadastre (Registry) Department refused to recognise the sale of the land to the Baptists when the original landowner tried to register the sale. In 2019 the absence of a document from the Land Cadastre (Registry) Department was one of the excuses used to refuse a registration application. The mainly unoccupied building has now been damaged by vandalism, including broken windows. Repairing the damage is likely to be expensive for the congregation. Sherzod Rasulov, who is responsible for the registration of religious organisations in Syrdarya Regional Justice Department, claimed to Forum 18 on 20 November 2024: 'We do not have a problem to register them, but the Regional Administration and Architecture Department have not given them permission.' He then refused to discuss the issue more with Forum 18. Land Cadastre (Registry) Department officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Irkin Muminov, Deputy Head of Syrdarya Regional Administration, refused to say why his Administration refuses to register the Baptists' new church building. 'I do not know you and we have been told not to give any information over the phone,' he claimed to Forum 18 on 20 November. Religious Affairs Committee officials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Urgench Baptist Church demolition stopped, church still not allowed to build On 25 April, Judge Nurlubay Akimniyazov ordered the destruction of two buildings under construction belonging to Urgench Council of Churches Baptists. The decision, which against Uzbek law the Baptists had not seen, entered into force on 27 May. Demolition began on 30 July. One of the buildings was intended to be a church. The Judge, regime officials, and state-appointed Muslim clerics involved in the destruction have either refused to explain the demolition order or given contradictory explanations, and officials have stated they are 'determined to complete the demolition sooner or later'. Council of Churches Baptists do not seek state permission to exercise freedom of religion or belief, and normally meet for worship in homes owned by church members. Under Uzbekistan's legally-binding international human rights obligations, the Baptists have the right to exercise their freedom of religion or belief in these ways, as the OSCE / Council of Europe Venice Commission Guidelines on the Legal Personality of Religious or Belief Communities note. The demolition stopped after the Baptists complained. However, officials do not allow them to repair the damage or complete the construction of the buildings. 'We are waiting for the regional authorities to give us permission to go ahead with the construction,' local Baptists told Forum 18 on 21 November. Khorezm Regional Administration officials, Zafarbek Khojaniyazov of the Land Cadastre Department (who is responsible for dealing with complaints) all did not answer whenever Forum 18 contacted them between 21 and 25 November. So Forum 18 was not able to ask them why they are refusing to give permission for the Baptists to repair the damage the regime has caused and complete the construction work. Religious Affairs Committee officials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. Jehovah's Witness registration attempts still blocked Jehovah's Witnesses have made multiple attempts over many years to gain registration for their communities in Uzbekistan outside the town of Chirchik, the only place where they have a registered community. 'Each time the communities faced insurmountable obstacles from state authorities,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18 in June 2023. This problem exists throughout Uzbekistan, with regime officials very frequently using property-based excuses to block registration applications from a variety of Muslim and non-Muslim religious communities. 'The Religion Law gives the authorities unlimited powers to refuse our registration, to our regret,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18 in April 2024. Religious Affairs Committee officials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. So Forum 18 was unable to ask them why the regime continues to, against its legally-binding international human rights obligations, obstruct state registration attempts and ban the unregistered exercise of freedom of religion or belief. Such refusals cause many problems for religious communities seeking to exercise their freedom of religion or belief. For example, the Religion Law does not allow religious communities to meet outside their registered address, and such meetings can face police raids. In March 2024, Navoi Police raided the local Jehovah's Witnesses' commemoration of the Memorial of Jesus' Death – the most important annual event for Jehovah's Witnesses. Five police officers between 07.00 am and 09.30 'pounded on the door and windows of the flat'. The head of Navoi Police 'Struggle with Extremism and Terrorism Department', Yusufbek Ismoilov, refused to explain to Forum 18 on 26 November why his officers raided the meeting, claiming that he could not hear well. The Jehovah's Witness community in the capital Tashkent has long tried to gain state registration – so far in vain. During the latest registration attempt in 2024, Tashkent City Administration refused an application for a building to be designated as the Tashkent community's legal address. Such an address is necessary for a state registration application. The regime claimed that urban planning construction regulations prevented the building from being the community's legal address, and that 'a number of [unspecified] neighbours of the Jehovah's Witnesses in their mahalla [local district] had in the [unspecified] past made [unspecified] complaints against the community.' On 6 February, Judge Olimjan Shamsiyev of Tashkent Inter-District Administrative Court rejected the Jehovah's Witnesses complaint against the decision. He claimed that as local authorities have 'discretionary powers' to refuse a request to use a building as their legal address, 'the contested decision cannot be considered illegal'. Shamsiyev also defended the use of alleged 'complaints' by unspecified 'neighbours' as a reason for Tashkent Administration to reject the Jehovah's Witness application. He refused on 23 April to discuss his claims with Forum 18, or to explain what religious communities could do when faced with arbitrary regime decisions. Jehovah's Witnesses have many times sought to meet officials to discuss how to solve the problems caused by the regime's human rights violations. One such meeting was on 5 July with Dilnoza Muratova, Deputy Director of the state-controlled National Human Rights Centre. Muratova claimed that Uzbekistan could not implement United Nations Human Rights Committee Concluding Observations (such as those from May 2020) 'since there are no tools in Uzbek law'. Uzbekistan ratified both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its Optional Protocol (OP1) (under which individual complaints are made) in 1995. By voluntarily doing this, Uzbekistan took on both the binding international human rights law obligations of the ICCPR, and the obligation to correct any violations of its obligations – such as violations found by the UN Human Rights Committee. Muratova did not explain why, when her state-controlled Centre was drafting the Religion Law, it was not drafted in a way that provided 'tools' to implement human rights obligations instead of 'tools' to violate them. On 26 November 2024, Forum 18 asked the Centre's Chief Specialist, Amir Khamidov, to explain this. He refused to answer. 'I need to get permission from the leadership to answer you,' he claimed. He could not specify when he might get permission and then refused to talk more to Forum 18. Will Tashkent officials honour their promise to the Buddhist community? The grounds of the only functioning Buddhist temple in Uzbekistan, the Chaynsa (Compassion) temple in Tashkent, has long been under threat from the local authorities. In 2018, Zangiota District Administration wanted to seize most of the temple grounds to expand a road. In Buddhist belief this is a serious matter, as each part of a temple grounds has a sacred significance. A compromise was eventually reached, Cabar news agency reported on 30 January 2019, under which a plot of land of equivalent size will be given to the Buddhist community to build a new temple. However, the expansion of the Circle Line of Tashkent's metro was initially planned to include the demolition of the Chaynsa Temple. The Temple was not demolished, but in early 2023 a 12 meter wide overpass for the metro line was built 5 meters above the Temple grounds and close to the Temple itself. 'Although the noise from the metro line is not loud, a lot of dust from the line collects in the grounds and on the temple every day,' members of the Buddhist Community told Aleksei Volosevich, the editor of Asia Terra independent Tashkent news website, in November 2024. Aleksandr Kheqay of the Buddhist community on 13 July 2022 met a Religious Affairs Committee official and Almardon Karshiyev, head of Tashkent City Administration's section responsible for work with religious organisations, to discuss the relocation of the Temple. The community wanted the existing Temple to be not demolished, but moved to another location and reconstructed according to Buddhist beliefs. They also wanted any agreement to be made in writing and signed by relevant officials, as well as published immediately. Contrary to their previous agreement, Zangiota District Administration has not given the Buddhist community a plot of land for a new temple and no agreement was reached at the July 2022 meeting. Tashkent Administration officials did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November 2024. Religious Affairs Committee officials, including Chief Specialist Begzod Kadyrov, also did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 21 and 27 November. So Forum 18 was unable to ask them why they have not honoured their promise to the Buddhist community to provide them with another plot of land for their Temple.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum2ZUeETBuXim	2024-12-01T16:21:07-08:00	
Reaching The Unreached To Find Missing TB Cases – OpEd	Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has,' had said the famous anthropologist, Margaret Mead. Imbibing these values, a small group of people in India and Philippines have changed the lives of many people affected by tuberculosis (TB) – especially those who were being missed or left behind by public services. TB, despite being preventable and curable, continues to be the deadliest of infectious diseases in high TB burden countries. In 2023 TB infected 10.8 million people and killed 1.25 million people worldwide. Globally almost a third of people who get active TB disease every year are missed. The number of people with TB who are missed in high burden settings (almost all in the Global South) is alarmingly higher than the global average. More worryingly, we also miss TB among those who take a TB test. Almost half of those who get a TB test worldwide, are tested through sputum microscopy – an outdated test that underperforms and is likely to miss finding TB in around half of those who take this test. But when we see the numbers in high burden settings, use of underperforming microscopy is higher. For example, in India - a country with highest TB burden worldwide - as per India TB Report 2024, 79% of TB tests in 2023 were done using the underperforming microscopy (which misses around half of them). That is why the World Health Organization (WHO) had called upon in 2018 to replace all microscopy with upfront molecular testing by 2027. Selfless doctor on a #HealthForAll mission in Philippines In multiple islets of Bantayan in the northernmost part of Cebu, Philippines, only around one-third of the estimated TB cases could be notified before the pandemic. But after the introduction of new TB screening and diagnostic tools, now almost all the TB (99%) is found in 2024. Bantayan has 25 barangays (small townships) and one district hospital which is understaffed and undersupplied. These areas are also marked as geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA). Pump boats are the main form of transportation here. Most of the residents there are fisherfolk or farmers and their income is a humble 300-350 Pesos (USD 6-7) a day. Using latest and state-of-the-art TB screening and diagnostic tools in the Philippines was made possible in 2022 through the Introducing New Tools Project (iNTP) of the Stop TB Partnership, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and FHI360. These new diagnostic tools included computer and artificial intelligence aided ultraportable handheld X-ray machines of Fujifilm (to screen for TB) and point-of-care, laboratory independent and decentralised WHO-recommended molecular test Truenat of Molbio Diagnostics (to diagnose TB). Both, Truenat and ultraportable X-ray machines, are battery operated, and can be deployed at point of need, even in remote and hard to reach areas like the Bantayan islets. When these new tools were deployed in Bantayan islets, new TB case notifications, as well as treatment success rate, increased manifold. But the journey was not easy. Braving inclement weather and carrying these new innovative diagnostic tools for TB in moulded plastic tubs, Dr Samantha Tinsay, the Municipal Health Officer of Bantayan, leads her team from islet to islet on pump boats, to screen and diagnose people with TB. She was speaking at a session in the world's largest TB and lung disease conference this year (Union World Conference on Lung Health in Indonesia 2024). Her untiring efforts have resulted in a tremendous increase in TB case finding: the number of persons screened for presumptive TB went up from 187 (in 2019) to 2506 (in 2022), 2027 (in 2023), and 5679 people in 2024. The target for presumptive TB screening for 2024 was set at 2248 people, but Dr Samantha's team has already screened 253% more than the target this year. Before the pandemic, 187 people with active TB diseases were found (39% of the estimated cases). After introduction of new TB screening and diagnostic tools, Dr Samantha's team found 458 people with TB in 2022, 341 in 2023 and 394 in 2024 so far. Before the pandemic, 39% of estimated TB cases were found but after introduction of new tools, 99% of estimated TB cases are found by Dr Samantha and team. All people found with TB were linked to TB treatment on the same day. 'TB treatment success rate has also increased to 97% in 2023,' she confirmed. Average TB treatment success rate in the Philippines was 78% in 2023 as per the WHO Global TB Report 2024. Imagine the difference it can make in the Philippines' response to end TB if such interventions can be scaled up and become a norm. As per the latest WHO Global TB Report 2024, out of the estimated 739,000 people with TB in the Philippines, around 77% (575,800) were notified to the national programme, and over 37,000 lives were lost due to TB in 2023. Also, only 65% of those reached, got a WHO recommended molecular test diagnosis. 'When the going gets tough, the tough gets going' When Dr Samantha Tinsay embarked on her journey to find TB with new tools in September 2022, extreme climate events- such as typhoons and storms- compounded the challenge. But it was sheer determination on her and her team's part to hop on a pump boat and brave the storms and typhoons to go from islet to islet and find TB, treat TB and prevent TB. The X-ray and Truenat molecular test were brought to the Bantayan Rural Health Unit and packed in a suitcase with wheels for transportation. Both these machines fitted well in a moulded plastic tub and were transported via pump boats. On 29 October 2022, Tropical Storm Nalgae, locally known as Paeng, hit the Philippines, and affected around 4.8 million people within a week. On that fateful day, Dr Samantha Tinsay and her team were enroute to one of the islets with the diagnostics tools in tow. 'As we were out of the range of mobile signal, we did not know that a storm signal had been raised, and that nobody should be travelling or working. Nevertheless, rain or sunshine, we were working and could not have stopped as patients were already waiting for us at the clinic,' said the spirited Tinsay. Integrated healthcare 'We bundle a lot other health services, and not just focus on TB', says Dr Samantha. Her team delivers a range of healthcare services when they go from islet to islet, such as HIV testing, hepatitis testing, dental, laboratory and diagnostics, psychiatric, psychological and mental healthcare services, among others. Those with TB, HIV or hepatitis, are linked to treatment care and support on the same day. Dr Samantha is also leveraging technology, an example of which is the setting up of a Starlink (a satellite constellation system that provides satellite-based internet service) in the middle of a basketball court. In recognition of her efforts to strengthen local health systems, Municipality of Bantayan received three Awards- (i) Excellence in Newborn Screening, (ii) Andres Bonifacio Award, and (iii) Nominee, Best in Local Health Systems- in November 2024. Making a difference where it is needed most: Reaching the homeless and migrant people with TB services CNS team has met and listened to the intense journeys of almost a 100 homeless people, unauthorised slum dwellers, and migrants who could only access TB services (and get cured) because of a novel initiative implemented by Humana People to People India. Despite living in the proximity of the best of TB and healthcare facilities in major metropolitan cities of India, homeless and migrant people often slip on the blindspot. Poor and congested living conditions, alcoholism, tobacco smoking, stigma and comorbidities (such as malnutrition and chronic lung diseases) increase their TB risk. Lisbeth Aarup, Programme Head, Humana People to People India said that her team developed a model called LEAD (Leveraging, Engaging, Advocating for Disruption of TB transmission). Its first phase was implemented in 2023-2024 in 4 cities of India: Delhi, Hyderabad, Howrah and peri-urban Mumbai. LEAD was supported by USAID, JSI India, and Government of India's National TB Elimination Programme. Lisbeth's team at Humana had trained several frontline healthcare workers (mostly women) who worked with a range of experts to help support homeless people and migrants access existing public healthcare services (as well as some private or non-profit healthcare facilities, for instance for x-rays, nutrition support, etc). Lisbeth was speaking at a session at Union World Conference on Lung Health 2024 in Indonesia. Humana helped those most in need (and most likely to be left behind) to access health and social support services with dignity and rights. Standard quality TB screening and diagnostics, treatments, care and support became accessible to those who could not even get a TB test earlier. Diagnostic delays and catastrophic costs often go in tandem and get more pronounced in marginalised populations. Humana's entire team deserves a salute for their dedication in ensuring that a person is supported in every possible way in his/ her/ their journey from TB diagnosis to cure. With those CNS could speak to, a lot of them (after completing their treatment) were actively involved as TB survivors, championing the cause of helping support the drive to raise awareness, dispel myths and misconceptions, find more TB, and help support them through the treatment. No wonder 'lost- to- follow up' (when people drop off from care and are unable to complete treatment) was almost negligible. This stands out because of two reasons: one, none of them would have been reached with TB services sans approaches on line with Humana model, and second, risk of left to follow up would have been probably the highest amongst them! Thank you Humana. Humana's team also leveraged upon new technologies, such as artificial intelligence aided cough sound-based TB screening app, as well an upfront x-ray to screen those with presumptive TB. 'During the last year we have reached out to more than 150,000 people,' said Lisbeth Aarup of Humana. 'We should test the people who do not have symptoms because in the slums where we have many homeless people and migrants, we find people with TB too late. We should have found them long before!' Lisbeth is right: if we find people with TB when they are asymptomatic and link them to effective treatment, we can stop the spread of pulmonary TB. Breaking the chain of transmission is key if we are to end TB. Learning from experience, Lisbeth's team goes to the people when they are more likely to be available (early morning, evening or night). Along with LEAD, Humana People to People India is also implementing Project SWEET (Street Women Empowered and Engaged to Stop TB) that is focussed on reaching and engaging female homeless people and migrants with quality TB services, with support of Stop TB Partnership. About 25-30% of people tested for TB (as part of LEAD's first phase) could get an upfront molecular test in public services so far. 100% of those who get a TB test should get upfront molecular test. This is necessary if we are to stop missing TB cases. As early and accurate TB diagnosis is the gateway to TB care pathway (and breaking the chain of infection transmission), all of us must ensure that: * All TB services are people-centred, human rights-based and gender transformative * We screen everyone in high burden settings (regardless of TB symptoms) with WHO recommended TB screening tools * All those who are screened as presumptive TB cases should get upfront molecular test, and be linked to effective treatment, care and support - preferably on the same day * TB programmes must integrate other healthcare and social support services too as needed and appropriate (for example, nutrition, shelter, quitting tobacco and alcohol, HIV and hepatitis test and treatment, NCDs, among others) * We must reach out to those who are likely to be on the blindspot of routine public services in a sustained manner, with models such as those developed by Humana. Initiatives led by Lisbeth and Samantha and their team are sterling examples that change is possible despite obstacles. Would governments scale these initiatives up at mass level?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum3sOUTITgv_b	2024-12-01T16:18:28-08:00	
Armageddon Is Not Just A War, It Is Also A Global Warming – OpEd	The word Armageddon does not appear in the Hebrew Bible, and appears only once in the Greek New Testament, in Revelation 16:16 which makes no mention of armies being predicted to one day gather on or near Mount Megiddo; but instead seems to predict only that 'they (will gather) the kings together to ... Armageddon'. The text does however seem to imply, based on the text from the earlier passage of Revelation 16:14, that the purpose of this gathering of kings in the 'place called Armageddon' is 'for the war of the great day of God Almighty' which is the ongoing battle against Global Warming. Both Judaism and Islam teach their followers to take care of the earth. Muslims and Jews also believe that humans should act as guardians and trustees (stewardship and khalifah) off our planet, and that they will be held accountable by God for their actions. So what will a half degree Celsius of warming do to our planet? Europe is the world's fastest-warming continent and has been heating up twice as fast as other regions since the 1980s. Parts of Earth's ice sheets that could lift global ocean levels by several meters will crumble with another half degree Celsius of warming, according to new research. New research suggests that the number of people threatened by sea level rise has been underestimated by tens of millions due to poorly-interpreted satellite data and a lack of scientific resources in developing countries. More than 90% of the world's population is projected to face increased risks from the compound impacts of extreme heat and drought, potentially widening social inequalities as well as undermining the natural world's ability to reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere—according to a study from Oxford's School of Geography. And communities around the world emitted more carbon dioxide in 2022 than in any other year on records dating to 1900, a result of air travel rebounding from the pandemic and more cities turning to coal as a low-cost source of power. Warming is projected to intensify these hazards ten-fold globally under the highest emission pathway, says the report, published in Nature Sustainability. In the wake of record temperatures in 2022, from London to Shanghai, continuing rising temperatures are projected around the world. And Antarctic sea ice shrunk to a record low at the end of February 2023 in the 45 years of satellite record-keeping. That exceeded the previous record low set in 2022 An international team of researchers has found that approximately 90% of all marine life on Earth will be at risk of extinction by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed. High-severity wildfire is increasing in Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascade forests and has been burning at unprecedented rates compared to the years before Euro-American settlement, says a study from the Safford Lab at the University of California, Davis. High-severity burns are those where more than 95% of aboveground tree biomass is killed by fire. If humans will not reduce man made carbon magnification, not even the coming of Mahdi and Messiah may be able to overcome human unwillingness to reverse human pollution. God demands that humans fulfill their God given responsibilities. The incidence of adult diabetes in the United States has doubled over the last 20 years, afflicting 37.3 million people, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The total economic losses caused by natural disasters hit an estimated $72 billion in the first half of 2022, fueled by storms and floods, Swiss reinsurance giant Swiss Re estimated. And according to a 2020 Oxfam report, the richest 10% of the global population produce half of the Earth's fossil-fuel emissions, while the poorest half contribute a mere 10%. And for the first time in two decades, there are now more closed autocracies than liberal democracies in the world according to the Varieties of Democracy Institute (V-Dem Institute) at the University of Gothenburg. The democratic decline has taken place globally, and an increasing number of people are living in closed autocracies. The level of democracy enjoyed by the average world citizen in 2022 is back to 1986 levels. This means that 72 percent of the world's population, 5.7 billion people, now live under authoritarian rule. Liberal democracies do not automatically overcome autocracies. Democracies must be supported and defended. Like Judaism and Christianity, Islam has a powerful eschatological strand. Islam anticipates the end to the world as we know it, a final historical confrontation between the forces of good and evil; after which human life will be transformed in a positive way. Many Islamic traditions (Ahadith) say that Prophet Jesus, will return and will join forces with the Islamic messiah, the Mahdi, in a battle against a false messiah, the cruel one eyed Dajjal, called Armilos in Jewish tradition. Now would be a good time for one or more Messianic figures to get to work. As a Reform Rabbi who believes that the world wide upheavals we see are part of the birth pains of the Messianic Age, I offer Christians and Muslims some positive insights from the Jewish Prophets and the Rabbinic Sages. Many millions of Jews, Christians and Muslims believe the wars of Gog and Magog (Gog u-Magog in Hebrew and 'Yajuj and Majuj' in Arabic) which started in the 18th to 20th centuries will come to an end in the 21st century. It is true that human society changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last 250 years than ever before in history. Doctors saved the lives of millions. Dictators sacrificed the lives of millions. Populations are exploding in Africa and populations are declining in Europe. Technology produces both worldwide prosperity and worldwide pollution at the same time. Should we look upon the future with optimistic hope or with fatalistic trepidation? Is the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday? Or are both occurring almost concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? Jews, whose Biblical prophets were the ones who first wrote about a future Messianic Age, recognize that the birth of a Messianic Age must be preceded by its birth-pangs. But the prophets of Israel also emphasize the glories of a future world living in peace and prosperity with justice for all. Ancient Jewish prophecies did proclaim that there would be an end to the world as we know it. But they did not prophesy that the world will come to an end, nor did the Prophets of Israel offer an exact date for the transition. The exact advent of the Messianic Age is not knowable because humans have free will and thus the exact time and manner of redemption cannot be determined in advance. Much depends on what we humans do. The beginning of the Messianic Age is a time of transition from one World Age into another. How we move through this transition, either with resistance or acceptance, will determine whether the transformation will happen through cataclysmic changes or by a gradual reform of human society; which will lead to a world filled with peace, prosperity and spiritual tranquility. The Prophets of Israel conceived redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of the Jewish community. This transformation, which will take place in this world at some future time, is called the Messianic Age. The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah. The birth of a redeemed Messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her religious tradition, we would ourselves have helped bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come about through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps and most obvious of all climate change which will affect both nature and the economy-society. The Messiah (Mahdi) refers to one or more human agents of God who help bring about a non-destruction positive transformation. The Jewish tradition teaches that this agent of God (together with several forerunners and many disciples) will be a human being, a descendant of Prophets Abraham and David, with great qualities of national leadership similar to Prophet Moses and Prophet Mohammed. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. The Islamic 1400s we are now living in, is the age of the coming of Hazrat Mahdi. Prophet Jesus will also return to Earth in this century. As Prophet Micah states: 'In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; and exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it. Many nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. 'The Torah will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor train for war anymore. Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD GOD has spoken. All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we (Jews, Christians and Muslims) will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.' (Prophet Micah 4:1-5) One of the signs of the End of Days is the arrival and defeat of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj or Ajuj and Majuj). Gog and Magog appear in the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Islamic Quran as individuals, tribes, countries and catastrophic acts of nature. The Quran mentions Gog and Magog twice: 'He said: 'This (barrier) is a mercy from my Lord: but when the warning of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to dust (and Gog and Magog—the Colonialist Empires, the Nazis, and the Communists would be released into the world); and the promise of my Lord is true.' (18:98) So Gog and Magog are destructive groups like the Colonialist Empires, the Nazis, and the Communists, who near the time of the end of days will penetrate into every part of the world. Many of the disasters of Yajuj and Majuj have been occurring over the last few centuries. Their appearance is one of the signs of the end times. Gog and Magog are sometimes personified as individuals, sometimes identified as nations, or as terrible nature catastrophes. All references in the Bible, Qur'an and Hadith clearly indicate that human caused Gog and Magog are very numerous in number, and nature caused catastrophes will come from the northern hemisphere, at the end of times, before the Days of Judgement: The very worst period of human caused spread of Gog and Magog was the 30 years between the autumn of 1914 and the summer of 1945, when 150 million people were killed in World War I and World War II. In addition, the nature caused spread of Gog and Magog according to Patterson and Pyle (1991) added between 24.7 and 39.3 million people worldwide who died from the Spanish flu pandemic. The classical rabbinic exegetical text Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer, attributed to the late first century Jewish sage, Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, contains references that prophesied the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple not just by Jews; but also by bnei Yishmael, (the sons of Ishmael). The Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer final chapter 30, lists 15 things that the sons of Prophet Ishmael will do in the holy land at the End of Days. One is particularly interesting: 'Rabbi Ishmael said: The sons of Ishmael will do fifteen things at the end of days.... They will rebuild the breaches in the wall of the beyt hamikdash (bayt al maqdis); and build a broadcast structure near the heiykal (the central sanctuary of the Holy Temple)' This broadcast structure could be in the near future, a virtual reality broadcast station from a small physical building on some open space near the Dome of the Rock. Just as millions of Muslims can join every day with tens of thousands of Muslims pilgrims praying and circling around the cube-shaped Kaaba at Islam's most sacred site; Jews would be able to strap on a headset and enter the holy city of Jerusalem, and see and hear Jewish prayers at the Western Wall, and someday God willing, as broadcast from the virtual reality Jerusalem Temple, without ever leaving their own homes. The end generation of Yajuj and Majuj may be coming soon, so it would be best if all monotheistic religions stopped being rivals, and became allies who know and respect each other: 'O mankind, We created you from male and female, and made you peoples and tribes, that you may know (respect) one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted. (Quran 49:13) The other mention of Gog and Magog in the Quran is: 'But there is a ban on a town which We have destroyed: that they (the people of the town) shall not return (to reclaim that town as their own); until Gog and Magog are let through (the barrier), and swiftly spread out in every direction.' (21:95-96) This verse refers to Jerusalem, destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE, and only reclaimed 18 centuries later as Israel's capital, following the era of the defeat of the Nazis, the Communists, and the Colonialist Empires, who had been Gog and Magog for generations. Thus, humanity has so far passed through the most devastating era of human history. However, we have not yet reached the goal of the Messianic Age when 'They (all nations) will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD GOD has spoken.' (Prophet Micah 4:2-4) This era will begin when Israelis and Palestinians make a long lasting two state partnership of peace; thus fulfilling the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'... (Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum6gJVzv7uL4W	2024-12-01T16:06:20-08:00	
Similarities In The Plight Of Tibetans And Hindus In Bangladesh –...	In the last four months after the toppling of Sheik Hasina government on August by a new regime in Bangladesh, attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh appear to have become the order of the day. Not a day passes without media reporting that some temples have been attacked or some Hindus have been beaten up. Hate campaign against Hindus in Bangladesh As it appears now, the hate campaign against Hindus in Bangladesh has been allowed to go on by a government led by Mohammed Yunus, a Nobel prize winner. Recently, the Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das Prabhu was arrested on sedition charges. Later on, two more Hindu monks were arrested. Now, there has been demand that Iskcon, an organisation to promote the Hindu culture and philosophy operating in Bangladesh, should be banned immediately. The above developments clearly indicate that some Islamic extremists harbouring huge animosity against Hindus are behind this 'exterminate the Hindus in Bangladesh' campaign. Dwindling population of Hindus in Bangladesh In the year 1947, Hindus constituted around 23% of the population in Bangladesh. Now, the Hindu population has shrunk to 8%, as many Hindus have left Bangladesh with their families to go to India and other countries. Obviously, the Islamic extremists and some misguided students in Bangladesh do not seem to be satisfied with the declining Hindu population trend and want it to decline further. Plight of Hindus no different from Tibetans The ground reality in Bangladesh is that the Hindus live in fear and are frustrated and feel helpless. They really do not know as to whether they would get effective and sympathetic support from other countries and from civilized people belonging to various religions across the world. In short, the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh today is no different from the plight of Tibetans when China entered Tibet and occupied the country around seven decades ago. While Tibetans resisted the Chinese invasion in the then Tibet that had no worthwhile army, China massacred the protesting Tibetans and China is now sitting pretty ruling Tibet with an iron curtain. Many Tibetans have left Tibet as refugees to other parts of the world including India. The similarity in the plight of Tibetans and Hindus in Bangladesh is that the world conscience virtually remain silent and has not taken note of the plight of Tibetans and the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh. Will India deal with Bangladesh Hindus and Tibetans in the same way? For Tibet, India is a neighbouring country and India is a neighouring country for Bangladesh also. When China occupied Tibet, India did not protest and just remained silent and later on went to the extent of recognizing Tibet as part of China. Certainly, this was a historic mistake on the part of India and history will not forgive India for its recalcitrant attitude towards the plight of Tibetans. Unlike the case of Tibetans who were attacked by another country namely China, in the case of Hindus in Bangladesh, the attack seem to be carried out by Bangladesh government itself by keeping its eyes closed to the attack and vicious campaign against Hindus in Bangladesh by Islamic extremists. However, the feeling of helplessness of Tibetans and Hindus in Bangladesh are just similar in extent and intensity. In the case of Bangladesh Hindus too, India has expressed only lip sympathy so far, just in the case it did for the suffering Tibetans earlier. Though government of India has protested to Bangladesh government and insisted that it should protect minority Hindus there, government of India appears to be unwilling or hesitant to go beyond this verbal protest. Difference in approach of Muslims and Hindus / Tibetans In contrast to the reaction of the Hindus in Bangladesh and Tibetans, one should recall the protests by the Muslims all over the world when Prophet Mohammed was criticized in some European countries earlier. This shows that Tibetans who traditionally believe in peaceful co existence and are wedded to Buddhist philosophy of non violence and Hindus in Bangladesh who too share such values like Tibetans, have become whipping boys, unlike the muslims who vigorously defended their cause. What future now? The question now is will the future of Bangladesh Hindus become as uncertain as the future of Tibetans still living in Tibet and in other parts of the world. In any case, the United Nations Organisaiton, which is supposed to be a peace keeping body, is conspicuous by silence and has reduced itself to the level of mere observer ,as far as the plight of Tibetans and Bangladesh Hindus are concerned. Ultimately, it appears that the world would always be controlled by the aggressors, extremists and violent prone groups. This is a sad scenario indeed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum4N3fZ3Joimp	2024-12-01T16:02:47-08:00	
Seabed Mining: The Final Frontier Of Geopolitical Dominance – OpE...	The seabed or the 'final frontier' for resource exploration is increasingly evolving into a strategic axis for the major nations in constant pursuit to gain economic viability and regional dominance by securing strategic minerals. Recently, China and India have made substantial headway in the deep seabed mining efforts, motivated by their interests to enhance and modify their supply chains and industrial capacity, respectively. Conversely, Article 76 of UNCLOS grants Pakistan rights to exercise sovereignty on the maritime territory expanding up to 290,000 square kilometers. This expansion appoints the nation as a critical player in regional maritime affairs, having a significant legal victory Pakistan has the leverage to unveil the untapped potential for the exploration and exploitation of seabed resources. Subsequently, an emerging avenue for economic growth and resource development awaits a productive exploration. In this regard, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the International Seabed Authority (ISA) provide the legal framework for deep seabed mining exploration. However, laws to regulate the sustainable extraction of resources are underway. Primarily, Articles 140 and 143 of UNCLOS highlight that the conduct of mining activities in high seas will bear equitable benefit for mankind as a whole keeping in view the regulation of environmental protection of marine resources. As states, especially those along the coast, attempt to define the boundaries of this 'Area' of uncertainty, the high seas serve as a battlefield for their strategic interests. One potential avenue for claiming sovereignty is thought to be underwater resources. Although the deep seafloor is considered a 'common heritage of mankind,' it has the same problems with fair sharing as other res nullius. ISA is criticized, meanwhile, for its lack of objectivity across its operations. For instance, the organization's finance strategy prevents it from ceasing to give licenses without endangering its own survival. ISA mostly depends on the revenue from the exploration licenses it issues to support itself, receiving $500,000 for each license granted and an annual fee of $47,000 per contractor. Because of the way it operates, it is more likely to function as a regulator than a protector. Additionally, it prioritizes its regulatory goal over its protective one in its operational mode. The organization has come under fire for its lack of openness and for not taking scientific advice seriously enough. China's veto of a proposal to put a prohibition on granting exploitation licenses until regulations are adopted on the agenda has raised concerns that it may silence opponents of deep-sea mining within the ISA. There are two opposing viewpoints: on the one hand, nations like China and Nauru favor expediting the approval process (fast track); on the other hand, nations like Canada and Peru favor a moratorium of 10 to 15 years; Brazil and Ireland support a 'precautionary pause'; and France calls for a ban. Within established alliances, whether they are strategic (OPEC, MSP, etc.), geographical (CELAC, African Union, AOSIS), or economic (G7, BRICS+, EU), deepwater mining creates a new rift. States are forced to create new and more ad hoc alliances to defend their interests as a result of the complexity of international affairs. States use four different narratives that conflict in the media to support or oppose seabed mining. By lowering environmental pressures on land, the first two highlight the potential advantages of mining: a) access to metals required for the ecological transition; and b) revenues made in the Zone that would be shared with poor nations, serving as a mechanism for redistributive justice. However, the next two stories highlight c) our ignorance of the seafloor and the ecosystem services it offers to the earth, and d) the necessity of a stringent conservation strategy that prioritizes metal recycling over a new extraction front. Three division lines within allied blocs—between small island states, Western nations, and what is referred to as the Global South—can be seen as these arguments collide, illuminating these new tensions. Deep seabed mining signifies a $20 trillion prospect to extract critical minerals to drive green technologies. Taking note of the preceding framework, deep seabed mining activities have become more relevant lately due to the continuous depletion and dislocation of terrestrial resources such as nickel, aluminium, manganese, lithium and cobalt. Additionally, increased dependence on valuable minerals, economic interests, and strategic opportunities stimulate the sustainable exploration of yet-to-be-explored rare earth metals and minerals. This endeavor offers a potential alternative to land-based exploration opening new frontiers of mineral discovery. Therefore, the world has shifted its eyes towards deep-seabed resources. China’s seabed mining expeditions fueled by advanced technologies and institutionally centralized governance make it a leading nation in this venture. In contrast, India is demonstrating its intent to secure the 'seabed hegemony' driven by a multi-institutional approach within the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as a counterbalance to China. Regrettably, despite having established bodies like the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Maritime Affairs, and the National Institute of Oceanography, Pakistan remains notably behind in this program. Concerning this, Pakistan is over-hauled by numerous challenges encapsulating technological limitations, weak or no concerned regulatory framework, poor environmental preservation techniques, and marginal investments. This deep seabed mining industry calls for advanced technologies coupled with complex regulations to ensure sustainable practices further supported by crucial funding- areas where Pakistan currently lags. To sum up, the seafloor is becoming a new geopolitical theater with its own fault lines and justifications. The function of states is under scrutiny, as is common in contemporary geopolitics. In such a field, businesses play a crucial role - as to run million dollar venture Metal companies would advocate for the use of the seabed, which will directly profit them. Nevertheless, they can also limit the economic benefit of these new resources by opposing their usage, as evidenced by the 49 multinational corporations who have endorsed a moratorium. Additionally, some states, beginning with France, have changed their minds and are now in favor of a ban on seabed mining due to the proactive engagement of NGOs under the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition and the mobilization of the scientific community and civil society. It is unclear if this spectrum of opinions will be represented in the ISA negotiations that are scheduled for this summer.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyum0uCgId_5wJd	2024-12-01T15:59:40-08:00	
Permanence And True Legacy: From Autocrats’ Greed For Wealth To T...	Nothing is permanent. The transformative and consuming power of time gradually erases or alters everything. In this transient world, even the traces individuals leave behind often fade quickly. Yet many people consider leaving behind only material wealth as sufficient. Unfortunately, this approach falls short of creating a truly lasting legacy. The insatiable drive of autocrats to accumulate wealth and property is the most striking example of this. Their attachment to material possessions prevents them from pursuing what is truly enduring. To share a personal example, after the passing of my parents, everything they had accumulated over the years was quickly dispersed. Books went to secondhand bookstores, belongings were sold to thrift shops or street vendors. The disappearance of these items, which held meaning beyond their monetary value, led me to question the permanence of what we possess. True permanence is found in written legacies. Works by thinkers like Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius, written over 2,000 years ago, still reach us today. These writings not only reflect the conditions of their times but also convey universal ideas about human existence. In doing so, they defy the passage of time and illuminate the future. Among the writings that hold special meaning for me are the letters my parents wrote to me. Reading them from time to time allows me to remember them and open a window to the past. The power of writing lies not only in what it expresses but also in its ability to create emotional connections and preserve the memories of an era. The wise words of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius' reflections on life guide not only their contemporaries but also address the challenges of our times. These works are not just books but enduring imprints on the history of humanity. Angela Merkel serves as a wonderful example in this regard, having documented her 16 years in office in a 746-page memoir. Through her narrative, we gain insight into previously undisclosed decisions and moments shrouded in darkness. For this invaluable contribution, we owe her gratitude. What is permanent is neither money nor possessions. True permanence lies in profound thoughts, philosophical teachings, and writings that withstand the test of time. While material things may vanish, ideas and writings carry forward into the future. Thus, the most powerful symbol of permanence is writing, as it transcends time and continues to guide us.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdaQS_goKyumy2qH8mln-IZ	2024-12-01T15:56:36-08:00	
The Heartland Theory: More Relevant Than Ever? – Analysis	Sir Halford Mackinder’s famous Heartland Theory was first formulated in the early 20th century, but it holds renewed relevance and importance today, especially when analyzed though a critical lens of the current geopolitical system, one that emphasizes individual freedom, limited government intervention, and skepticism of centralized power. Mackinder’s theory posits that control over the 'Heartland' — roughly the region of Eastern Europe and Central Asia — grants substantial power over global politics and commerce due to its geographic centrality, strategic importance and resource abundance. This seemingly simple, but potent, core idea, highlights both the dangers and opportunities posed by state power struggles and emphasizes the need for decentralized and voluntary approaches to international relations and global geopolitical power balances. Mackinder argued that whoever controls the Heartland, also referred to as 'the pivot area' in his 1904 analysis 'The Geographical Pivot of History', could eventually control the world’s very trajectory. Historically, command over this central position has allowed a nation or an alliance of nations to exert immense influence over global affairs. Clearly, for liberty-loving individuals and independent thinkers, this level of dominance raises serious concerns due to the concentrated power it affords a central authority, potentially undermining individual freedoms and self-determination. It also raises very legitimate fears over the potential for coercive policies that threaten individual autonomy both domestically and internationally. What’s more, the fierce competition over the Heartland not only encourages interventionist policies, but also indirect hostile actions or even outright aggression, usually ending up in 'unholy' alliances and in devastating and costly wars. We’re seeing this all play out in real time in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As opposed to what the mainstream media propaganda and Western political leaders would have the public believe, Russia didn’t invade Ukraine out of nothing or because President Putin is some kind of comic-book madman like he is so often portrayed. Without wishing to defend any sort of aggression, especially of a military nature, and without being a Moscow apologist (for it is crystal clear that the Russian government is very far from benign and freedom-loving), there is a solid case to be made against the Western allies too, for their part in instigating this war NATO’s eastward expansion and increasing U.S. presence in Eastern Europe indicate a renewed geopolitical interest in countering Russia and China in the Heartland area and reinforcing its influence in a clearly threatening way. The West’s actions prior to and after the Ukraine invasion raise questions about interventionism’s costs and its potential for unintended consequences, as well as about the political and strategic lines that nations are willing to cross in order to expand their power and control. It goes beyond the very obvious and catastrophic impact of this war in terms of human losses (lest we forget about the more that 500,000 souls that perished after being forcibly conscripted by the Ukrainian government, many of them teenagers, civilians with little to no prior military training, or even mentally disabled individuals) and the infrastructural and economic destruction of the two warring parties. There has also been a very high price paid indirectly by the citizens of the allied nations, who never voted for or in any way consented to participating this conflict. They all just got dragged into yet another prolonged war that has already drained resources, increased national debt, and curtailed freedoms through increased surveillance, freedom of speech restrictions, military spending and direct encroachments on individual financial sovereignty. In a world that is brutally dividing itself between East and West – the Ukraine war will likely be remembered in history books as a key catalyst. Naturally, the desire to control the Heartland is not some bizarre obsession unique to the West, as Russia also fully recognizes and appreciates the power that comes with it. Moscow’s hold over Ukraine would allow the nation to secure critical land access points, obtain influence over transit routes for natural resources, and project power over Europe. Ukraine’s geographic position bridges Europe with the resource-rich lands of Central Asia, and it provides access to the Black Sea, making it a key strategic asset in Mackinder’s Heartland framework. A Russia with control over Ukraine and, by extension, control over more of the Heartland, would destabilize Europe and make the continent more dependent on Russian resources, thereby reducing Western influence and relevance on the global power balance. This is especially relevant and quite clear to see when it comes to the all-important energy market. Mackinder’s theory emphasizes the strategic value of resources in the Heartland, and indeed, today, Russia uses its energy exports as a geopolitical tool, while the West uses its sanctions as a counter-offensive weapon. With control over the substantial oil and gas reserves and key pipeline routes, Russia can exert leverage over European nations that depend on its resources, especially since so many of them have for so long adopted catastrophic energy policies (premature transition to 'green' initiatives) that have all but guaranteed this near-absolute dependence. This current dynamic demonstrably confirms Mackinder’s prediction that control over the Heartland could allow a power to dominate through resource control. Europe’s reliance on Russian gas, for instance, has exposed significant energy security vulnerabilities, particularly as Russia has intermittently restricted exports in response to sanctions and military aid from the West to Ukraine. The Heartland Theory implicitly assumes a globalist system, where powerful states vie for control and seek to influence others through centralized strategies, which clearly contradicts libertarian values, which prioritize the sovereignty and self-determination of communities and especially of the individual, the smallest minority of all. This is particularly relevant in a world where centralized, global institutions, such as the United Nations or the World Economic Forum, are forcing upon us another Cultural Revolution, and as they are increasingly involved in geopolitics, often coercing smaller nations into decisions that go against the interests of their own people, jeopardizing their security, their prosperity and regrettably, even their very existence. Of course, none of this new or even surprising to the observant students of history. Countless lives have been lost since time immemorial due to this endless and largely vain competition between nation states and alliances to gain control over the Heartland. The last time we saw a serious escalation was, of course, WWII, and we all know how that ended… Or do we? 'The virtuous Allies crushed the evil Nazis and saved the world from fascism.' That’s pretty much the summary of every history book taught in schools all over the world, of every mainstream documentary ever produced on that period and of every political speech that seeks to criticize opposing views and rivals by accusing them of being 'literally Hitler'. We see this political messaging strategy at work today, in real time, too: Victor Urban in Hungary, the AFD party in Germany, Nigel Farage in the UK, Marine LePen in France, and last but certainly not least, President Elect Trump in the US, all of them have been decided as 'literal Nazis' – though the irony of the true meaning of the term, namely 'National Socialist' is most of the time totally lost on the name-callers. What is also entirely lost on them are the circumstances that led to WWII and the rise of Hitler himself, namely the Heartland-theory-underpinned WWI (an effort to prevent a Russo-German alliance) , which ended with the callous humiliation of the Germans and the Treaty of Versailles that clearly sowed the seeds for the next World War. However, unfortunately for those of us seeking to understand history, the truth is always more nuanced than a children’s bedtime story. Or as comedian Norm MacDonald concisely put it: 'It says here in this history book that, luckily, the good guys have won every single time. What are the odds?' Take Winston Churchill for example. There has hardly ever been a more revered, nearly deified human in modern history, to the extent that one couldn’t be blamed for forgetting that he was in fact, human. We do need to remember this though, that he was just that, human, in order to provide a balanced view, one that scrutinizes actions often overlooked or sanitized in popular narratives. For instance, for all his widely celebrated strategic genius, Churchill’s leadership was also tainted by several decisions that led to catastrophic failures, resulting in unnecessary loss of life and resources, including the Gallipoli Campaign and the The Norway Campaign. Most shamefully, Churchill’s approval of area bombing campaigns is also often brushed aside in many historical accounts, even though they cost the lives of around 600,000 civilians and left around 800,000 seriously injured. The most (in)famous example of these is, of course, the firebombing of Dresden. Its barbarity, even though it was not the first of its kind nor the last, shook Churchill’s moral core – as he put it, immediately after the attack: 'Are we beasts? Are we taking this too far?…. It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed. Otherwise we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land. We shall not, for instance, be able to get housing materials out of Germany for our own needs because some temporary provision would have to be made for the Germans themselves. The destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing. I am of the opinion that military objectives must henceforward be more strictly studied in our own interests rather than that of the enemy.' These raids targeted civilian populations and caused massive destruction, with questionable strategic value. One can easily argue that such actions blurred the moral distinction between the Allies and Axis powers. Of course, the consequences of twisting or 'spinning' history to match a certain narrative go far beyond the obvious, namely creating generation after generation of ill-informed, biased and naive citizens. It also shapes the policy direction of the future. As Ralph Raico explained in an analysis for the Mises Institute: 'In more recent decades, the Churchill legend has been adopted by an internationalist establishment for which it furnishes the perfect symbol and an inexhaustible vein of high-toned blather. Churchill has become, in Christopher Hitchens’s phrase, a 'totem' of the American establishment, not only the scions of the New Deal, but the neo-conservative apparatus as well—politicians like Newt Gingrich and Dan Quayle, corporate 'knights' and other denizens of the Reagan and Bush Cabinets, the editors and writers of the Wall Street Journal, and a legion of 'conservative' columnists led by William Safire and William Buckley. Churchill was, as Hitchens writes, 'the human bridge across which the transition was made' between a noninterventionist and a globalist America. In the next century, it is not impossible that his bulldog likeness will feature in the logo of the New World Order.' It is vital to keep this in mind today, as we are going through an extremely important, tectonic shift in the global geopolitical order. We need to look at history through a critical lens, to question every 'received wisdom' and to ask as many questions as possible, even if (or perhaps, especially if) they are uncomfortable. Mackinder’s Heartland Theory remains highly relevant as it highlights the ongoing struggle for control over the region and all that it implies for the world at large. For freedom-loving individuals, the theory serves as a stern warning against the dangers of centralization and interventionism. In today’s global climate, where large states aim to leverage geographic influence, military might and economic warfare, rational and decent individuals must resist convenient and simplistic narratives that paint humanity as entirely good or entirely evil, and must instead stand for non-aggression, non-intervention, decentralized cooperation, and free-market-led initiatives, as the only ways to promote stability and prosperity without the need for coercive control over any strategic 'Heartland.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YS8IVFqloM7X	2024-11-30T15:59:43-08:00	
South Sudan’s ‘Game Of Thrones’ Continues – Analysis	By Peter Fabricius After the fourth extension of South Sudan’s first post-independence elections, it is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine how Africa’s youngest state will ever become a democracy. The polls were scheduled for December, with the transition ending in February 2025. But on 18 September, signatories to the 2018 peace agreement postponed elections until December 2026 because almost no progress had been made in undertaking the necessary preparations since the last extension. It is becoming ever clearer that the leaders of the bloated transitional government – most notably rivals President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Vice-President Riek Machar – do not see any self-interest in rushing into elections. As long as the transition remains in force, they remain in power, unelected but willing and able to plunder public resources. As Major General Charles Tai Gituai, Chairperson of the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission, said in October, ‘many recurring challenges’ delayed implementation of the 2018 agreement by six years. These included ‘insufficient political will, trust deficit, lack of sufficient, dedicated and predictable funding, and capacity gaps.’ Gituai’s commission was set up to monitor the execution of the peace deal. This time around, he said, ‘There is unprecedented need to do things differently. A clear demonstration by the Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU) to mobilise sufficient resources to implement the agreement would be a strong indication of political will and commitment.’ It is becoming ever clearer that Kiir and Machar don’t see any self-interest in rushing into elections However, in his address to the United Nations Security Council, Nicholas Haysom lamented that despite the urgent need to hold elections, ‘Implementation of the revitalised agreement and its roadmap has, yet again, been relegated to the back burner while political interests play out at the national level.’ Haysom is a Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). Given the lack of preparation, he said the postponement was ‘inevitable but regrettable’. The troika of countries giving the transition most support – the United States, United Kingdom and Norway – expressed ‘profound disappointment’ at the postponement. They said South Sudan leaders had ‘demonstrated a lack of political will and have instead conserved power in the hands of a small elite’ while neglecting citizens’ welfare. By contrast, African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat merely noted the postponement and called for ‘concrete steps’ to realise the 2018 peace agreement. Workneh Gebeyehu, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Executive Secretary, actually welcomed the ‘consensual manner’ in which the postponement was decided. He called on South Sudanese to spare no effort to meet the new deadline. That effort has not been helped by the stalling of the Tumaini Peace Initiative. The initiative is a negotiation hosted by Kenya in Nairobi between the transition government and various small groups and factions who didn’t sign the 2018 agreement, about bringing them into the government. Serious compromises will be needed if South Sudan is to meet the new December 2026 deadline Machar quit the initiative in July, apparently suspecting that Kiir was exploiting the admission of new parties to dilute the powers allocated to Machar’s party in the 2018 peace deal. After an intervention by Kenyan President William Ruto on 6 November, there have been faltering efforts to revive the stalled initiative. Haysom called for serious compromises if South Sudan was to meet the December 2026 deadline. ‘Decisions, actions, realism and benchmarks associated with an implementation plan are needed,’ he declared. He said UNMISS had proposed six immediate actions. First, deploy the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF), continue their joint training and decide on command structures. Second, launch civic education and third, prepare for voter registration. Fourth, amend the National Security Services Bill to expand civic and political space and fifth, develop a code of conduct for political parties, civil society and the media. Last, clarity was needed on sharing responsibility for security during elections. Given their past deadly clashes, forming and deploying the Necessary Unified Forces that integrate Kiir and Machar’s combatants is vital. As Daniel Akech, Senior Analyst on South Sudan at the International Crisis Group, told ISS Today, ‘South Sudan doesn’t have one commander-in-chief. There are about [six].’ Haysom’s to-do list could kick-start a train of actions enabling elections in two years. But will Kiir, Machar, and the other transitional government leaders jump into action at last? It seems unlikely. Instead, the government parties ‘are likely to continue with the same 'game of thrones' mindset around the power-sharing arrangements rather than seeking legitimacy through the ballot box,’ writes Luka Biong Deng Kuol, Director of Juba’s Sudd Institute. The technical prerequisites for holding elections in 2026 are unlikely to be met in time In any case, he believes the technical prerequisites for holding elections are unlikely to be met in time. He notes that National Constitution Review Commission (NCRC) Chairperson Dr Riang Yer Zuor recently said it would take at least 18 months to make a new Constitution – if the NCRC had the necessary resources, which was unlikely. That would leave only six months to prepare for voting. Likewise, he believes it will be impossible to complete the necessary census before elections. Also, he says even if the NCRC and National Election Commission were given the resources to do the job, they were too politicised and partisan to do it properly. Akech shares his misgivings. He also notes that the eruption of civil war in neighbouring Sudan aggravates the problem. It has cut off the pipeline carrying South Sudan’s oil to port, depriving the country of most of its revenue. If South Sudan could not manage the 2024 elections when oil and money were flowing, how would it do so now? Deng proposes a neutral caretaker government of bureaucrats to administer the 2026 elections, bypassing the squabbling politicians. But the politicians would have to agree to be bypassed. Akech thinks Kiir’s firing last month of his spy chief General Akol Koor Kuc, attempts to arrest him, and last week’s subsequent shootout in Juba, were ominous. He blames that partly on the interrupted oil exports, compromising Kiir’s ability to pay his security chiefs. So far, despite localised skirmishes, the country has not relapsed into civil war. But the peace is relative and fragile.

Asia Must Brace For Impact And Opportunities Of Trade Tensions – ...	By Takashi Onoda Since August 2024, there has been a wave of new tariffs on China-made products. The United States finalised a review of Section 301 tariffs, increasing the tariffs on a range of Chinese-made products. Canada also announced 100 per cent tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs), alongside 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium products, while the European Union voted in favour of 45 per cent tariffs on EVs from China. Trade tensions may further escalate between the United States and China. US President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a 60 per cent tariff on Chinese imports alongside a universal tariff of 10–20 per cent. US consumers will bear the brunt of these tariffs, facing higher prices on imported goods. Potential Chinese retaliation could further aggravate the economic strain. Increased tariffs on Chinese imports will likely have negative global spillover effects, reducing real expenditures by US and Chinese households and dampening demand for foreign-made final goods. Damage to Chinese industries will propagate through global supply chains, decreasing demand for intermediate goods produced in third countries. This spillover effect is expected to be more pronounced in countries with strong economic ties to China. The impacts of an extreme trade war between the United States and its allies — such as the European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea and Australia — and China have been studied with quantitative general equilibrium international trade models. In the study, I assumed a 30 per cent increase in trade barriers between the two groups with no change in trade barriers against third countries. The findings revealed that South Korea and Taiwan’s electrical and optical equipment sectors would shrink significantly due to their deep input–output linkages with Chinese industries, leading to a real income decline comparable to that in China. Countries closer to US and European markets with weaker input–output relations with China — such as Brazil and Turkey — could experience net positive effects by capturing market share from China, depending on model parameters. Though this scenario was more extreme in terms of the breadth of the US group and product coverage than the current conflict, it suggested that Asia is likely to experience more severe negative spillover effects. While the negative consequences are clear, rising tariffs on Chinese goods also present opportunities for other Asian countries. These countries’ products may face higher tariffs due to Trump’s proposed universal tariff increase. But their relative competitiveness compared to Chinese products improves, potentially enabling them to replace Chinese exports to the United States. Asia has already felt the impact of US–China trade tensions, reflecting this force. In 2012, the United States announced anti-dumping duties against washing machines imported from Mexico and South Korea. In response, major Korean appliance brands, Samsung and LG, shifted their export bases from Korea to China. In 2016, when the United States announced another anti-dumping duty — this time on China — these firms shifted their export bases againto Thailand and Vietnam. These shifts took place within their existing production networks, but they nonetheless boosted production and exports to the US market from each country. Beyond the reallocation of production within existing networks or specific products, manufacturing supply chains in Asia are being re-optimised, as indicated by a surge of foreign direct investment in Malaysia. Manufacturing investment in Malaysia has increased significantly. The three-year average of approved capital investment from 2021 to 2024 more than doubled compared to between 2015 and 2017. The surge is unlikely to end soon. A Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) survey conducted in 2023 with Japan-based firms revealed that approximately 10 per cent of firms with establishments in China felt that the US import restriction on Chinese products had affected their business and were concerned about trade developments. Nearly 60 per cent of firms expressed concern about the restriction, suggesting a large pool of firms could be prompted to relocate their facilities outside China if the trade war escalates further. Southeast Asia has the potential to become a focal point in this re-optimisation, with this preference also being reflected by Japanese investors. In the same 2023 JBIC survey, Vietnam surpassed China for the first time, becoming the second-most promising country for Japanese firms’ overseas business. Among firms selecting Vietnam, 22.2 per cent attributed their choice to ‘risk diversification’ and some firms identified Vietnam as a potential relocation destination from China. 20.6 per cent of voters for the Philippines — ranked eighth-most promising country for Japanese overseas business — highlighted the same factor. The escalation of the US–China trade war may further elevate risk diversification as a priority, enhancing these countries’ attractiveness. Not all Southeast Asian countries stand to benefit equally from these shifts. According to the JBIC survey, firms consistently rank ‘stable political and legal practices’ among the top factors — alongside product quality, supplier capacity and existing relationships — when selecting suppliers. Countries with political instability and weak institutions may miss the opportunity to acquire buyers seeking alternatives to Chinese suppliers. Such business-friendly conditions are also critical in investment decisions. Strengthening these conditions will not only benefit the countries’ economies but also support the efficient functioning of global supply chains.

Chinese Companies Not Showing Sufficient Presence In FII – Analys...	By Zhou Chao On October 29, the 8th Future Investment Initiative (FII) officially opened in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. This event is considered one of the kingdom's most important economic activities and is often touted as the 'Davos in the Desert'. The conference brought together prominent figures from global business, finance, and technology sectors, and during the FII meetings, transactions worth billions of dollars were announced. Initially, Saudi Arabia designed the FII to support and align with the implementation of the 'Vision 2030', aiming to promote the diversification and transformation of the national economy. The goal was to establish FII as a gateway for the outside world to enter Saudi Arabia, attracting intellectual and production support to offer advice and guidance for the kingdom's development. However, as the FII has evolved, this institutional event has shifted from focusing solely on Saudi Arabia to addressing global issues, seeking solutions to tackle worldwide challenges. The theme of the 2018 FII was 'A Blueprint for the 22nd Century', under which three parallel sub-themes were established. In addition to topics related to Saudi Arabia itself, two global themes were added: 'Technology as Opportunity' and 'Advancing Human Potential'. The theme for 2019 was 'What is Next for Global Business', while in 2021, it was 'The Neo-Renaissance', followed by 'Enabling a New Global Order' in 2022, and 'New Compass' in 2023. The theme for this year is 'Infinite Horizons: Investing Today, Shaping Tomorrow'. The sub-themes under each year's main theme have gradually expanded from climate change to healthcare, finance, education, and other areas, covering various aspects of global development and governance. In addition to the themes, the organization of the FII has increasingly incorporated elements from Davos. In 2020, the hosting rights of FII became independent, managed by the newly established FII Institute, a global nonprofit foundation. The FII Institute has been advancing its 'go global' strategy, holding priority summits in locations such as Hong Kong, Miami, and Rio de Janeiro. The composition of the board of directors of the FII Institute further reflects its global trend. In addition to the chairman, Yasir al-Rumayyan, other members include the CEO of the FII Institute, Richard Attias from Morocco, former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Saudi Ambassador to the United States Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, and Mohammed al-Abbar, founder and chairman of EMMAR Properties in the UAE. However, industry professionals have noted that as the FII increasingly adopts the characteristics of Davos, the presence of China at FII has gradually diminished. Industry professionals have pointed out that in the early years of FII, Chinese companies had high levels of participation and enthusiasm, to the point where some even made a living off attending FII. However, this year, the participation of Chinese companies at the FII conference has noticeably declined. After consulting industry experts with years of experience attending the event, three main reasons were identified. Firstly, there is the rising costs of attending the conference. In addition to adopting a Davos-like format in terms of its agenda and organizational structure, FII introduced a membership model in 2023. This model selectively invites elite thinkers, investors, and business leaders handpicked by the FII Institute, with the aim of enhancing the quality of both the participants and the event itself, thus strengthening the international influence of FII. Members not only gain access to the annual flagship FII conference in Riyadh each October, but also to four international summits held throughout the year, exclusive research reports from the FII Institute, and unique investment opportunities available on the FII platform. However, becoming an FII member requires an annual fee, with basic attendance costs for both companies and individuals set at USD 15,000. It is worth noting that while Chinese investment in Saudi Arabia reached a new peak in 2023, the overall pace of business cooperation between Chinese companies and Saudi Arabia has been relatively slow this year. For these companies, the high cost of attending FII may make it difficult to justify spending tens of thousands of dollars to participate. Secondly, there are differences in management systems. In terms of annual fees, for top Chinese financial institutions and large construction companies, this would not be an astronomical figure. However, due to existing financial regulations, it is challenging to find a suitable expense category for allocating these funds. In contrast, Western investment banks and consulting firms are keen to explore opportunities within public investment fund (PIF) offices to grow their businesses, while the approach of Chinese companies is notably different. Experts say that these leading Chinese institutions, whether financial organizations or large construction companies, are mostly state-owned entities, and the approval process for overseas business trips follows public management procedures. Specifically, at least one month or 45 days in advance, approval is required before departure. If there are any changes in the itinerary, a letter of clarification may need to be written, and the approval process might even need to be restarted. Even if the trip proceeds as planned, for example, in the Gulf Arab countries, according to current regulations, the maximum duration of a visit to one country is 5 days (including international travel time), and to two countries is 7 days. Under such a management system, it would be difficult for Chinese companies to replicate the operational models of Western institutions. Furthermore, there is a deep divergence in cooperation philosophies. Saudi Arabia's international economic and trade cooperation philosophy is largely a continuation and development of the ideas from Western countries like the U.S. and Europe. This can be seen from the development of the FII, which has been deeply influenced by Davos. This reflects the widening, rather than narrowing, gap in the cooperation philosophies between China and Saudi Arabia, as well as other Gulf Arab countries. FII does not directly generate cooperative projects, hence when approval is sought for Chinese companies' participation, the approval departments often question its tangible outcomes. Similarly, when hosting forums and exhibitions in China, there is always a requirement to arrange project matchmaking and outline the results achieved. This results-oriented approach has its clear limitations. Looking back at the evolution of FII's topic selection, it is clear that FII, as a high-end showcase promoted by Saudi Arabia, is not focused on specific projects but rather aims to lead trends or create concepts and standards. Whether it is trends, waves, or ideas and standards, they are not converted into concrete projects at the present moment, but instead lay the conceptual foundation for future projects or categories of projects to emerge. The biggest difference between Chinese companies and Western firms in exploring the Gulf market is that Chinese companies tend to focus on 'projects', while Western companies focus on 'markets', leaving the former to lag behind even at the earlier conceptual design stage. The information from FII shows that during this conference, Saudi Arabia's renowned energy developer ACWA Power announced on October 29, 2024, that it would invest USD 54 million to jointly establish a new energy technology research and development center in Lujiazui, Shanghai, in partnership with the Lujiazui Administration. Additionally, it will invest USD 800 million to co-develop Morocco's wind power market with Gotion High-Tech. Private enterprises have demonstrated significant advantages in their efforts to attract Saudi capital, showing great flexibility and strength, and their vitality and practical impact should not be underestimated. Final analysis conclusion: In the past two years, cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia, as well as other Middle Eastern countries and capital, has been continuously strengthened. Recently, Saudi Arabia announced its agreement to establish a Saudi-China Special Economic Zone, which is seen as a sign of deepening cooperation. However, at Saudi Arabia's most prestigious economic forum, the presence of Chinese enterprises has been shrinking, which is not a positive sign for China's future influence and interests in the broader Middle East-Gulf region. Meanwhile, private enterprises have shown clear vitality in expanding cooperation with Gulf capital, and this is something that should be recognized.

Indonesia: Case Against Ex-Minister Seen As Gauge Of Democratic P...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus For many Indonesian democracy activists, a former trade minister’s upcoming corruption trial will test whether Prabowo Subianto, the new president, upholds the rule of law or uses legal mechanisms to suppress political criticism. They are concerned that the 53-year-old ex-minister, Thomas Lembong, a Prabowo opponent, was arrested and charged for political reasons. The Oct. 29 arrest came just nine days after Prabowo was sworn in as president. Who is Thomas Lembong: The former trade minister, popularly known as Tom Lembong, had backed an opponent of Prabowo in the 2024 presidential election. He was also an outspoken critic of policies of Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, Prabowo’s immediate predecessor who had backed his presidential run. Lembong, who became known for reportedly writing some of Jokowi’s celebrated speeches, including the memorable 2018 'Winter is Coming' address that evoked the 'Game of Thrones' TV series, will stand trial for corruption in a controversial sugar import case. On Tuesday, a Jakarta district court rejected Lembong’s pre-trial motion challenging his arrest, and ruled there was sufficient evidence to bring him to trial nearly 10 years after his alleged offense. Why the issue matters: Indonesia transitioned to democracy in 1998 after more than three decades of authoritarian rule. Jokowi, who served two terms as president until Oct. 20, was criticized for curbing opposition voices. Some fear that stifling criticism of the government could worsen under Prabowo, a former general accused of human rights abuses during his time in the military. Democracy watchers see the case against Lembong as a potential bellwether for Indonesia’s democratic trajectory under the new administration. A Harvard graduate, businessman and former investment banker, Lembong served as trade minister under Jokowi in 2015-2016, and was his close ally until 2019. Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in his 2020 autobiography, in fact credited Lembong as helping him build a close bond with Jokowi, The Sydney Morning Herald reported last month. Lembong later turned into a fierce critic of Jokowi’s policies and towards the end of 2023 joined then-presidential candidate Anies Baswedan’s campaign team as 'co-captain.' Analysts believe Lembong’s outspokenness and his close association with Anies make him a target. The charges: The attorney general’s office has accused Lembong of authorizing the import of 105,000 metric tons of raw sugar through a private company while he was trade minister (2015–2016), despite a domestic surplus of the commodity. This decision allegedly caused state losses totalling 400 billion rupiah (U.S. $25.19 million). The attorney general’s office further claims that Lembong’s actions violated regulations stipulating that only state-owned enterprises could import the commodity. Lembong said during a pretrial hearing that he had consistently consulted with then-President Jokowi on import policies, including those for sugar. The ex-trade minister’s lawyer, Ari Yusuf Amir, said the prosecution’s case lacked the foundation to move forward, and specifically questioned the source of the 400 billion rupiah number. What the pundits say: Political analysts note that Lembong’s arrest comes amid strong buzz about Anies launching an organization that will morph into a political party ahead of the next general election, with a key role for the ex-trade minister. Anies is seen as the most viable presidential hopeful in the 2029 polls and Lembong, his right-hand man, is perceived as indispensable to him. Ambang Priyonggo, of Multimedia Nusantara University, said the arrest suggests an attempt at weakening Anies’ candidacy by leaving him without his prime asset. 'I believe the political undertones behind Tom Lembong’s arrest cannot be dismissed,' Ambang said. He added that other ministers who adopted similar policies as Lembong is being faulted for have not been investigated. 'This certainly gives the appearance of a witch hunt,' Ambang told BenarNews. He warned that selective enforcement of the law could fuel perceptions of Prabowo’s authoritarian tendencies. A political analyst at the National Research and Innovation Agency, Poltak Partogi Nainggolan, concurred. Limiting the investigation to Lembong risked damaging the credibility of Prabowo’s administration, he said. '[A]ny facts that emerge must be acted upon, including the potential investigation of the other five trade ministers [after Lembong] who were allegedly aware of the questionable practices now labeled as corruption,' he told BenarNews. 'The continuation of [Jokowi’s] repressive political and legal practices will only hinder the creation of an environment conducive to economic progress,' Partogi said. What the government says: Attorney General Sanitiar Burhanuddin dismissed claims that the case was politically motivated. 'There is absolutely no political agenda in the case of Tom Lembong,' he said during a parliamentary hearing on Nov. 13. 'It is purely a legal matter, and that is the basis on which we are proceeding.' What’s next: Lembong was ready to seek justice, he said in a handwritten statement published by the Indonesian media on Wednesday. 'I remain committed to uncovering the truth and upholding justice. I love Indonesia, and my determination to dedicate my life to this country is stronger than ever,' his statement said. He just may seek inspiration from the Avengers, comic book superheroes referenced in another speech he penned for Jokowi, which the ex-president delivered in 2018 at a forum in Hanoi.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YWTUo6Khsq2P	2024-11-30T15:52:37-08:00	
Atlanticists Mobilize To Salvage NATO As Russia Toughens Its Stan...	The American film maker and philanthropist who created the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, George Lucas, once said, 'Fear is the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.' Within a week of Russia 'testing' the Oreshnik hypersonic missile in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, against which the NATO has no defence, the Western alliance is already transiting through the Dark Side from fear to hatred and hurtling toward unspeakable suffering. The Russian Defence Ministry has disclosed that since the Oreshnik’s appearance in the war zone, Ukraine carried out two more attacks on Russian territory with ATACMS missiles. In the first attack on November 23, five ATACMS missiles were fired at an S-400 anti-aircraft missile division near the village of Lotarevka in Kursk Region. The Pantsir missile defense system, which provided cover for this division, destroyed three of them while two missiles reached the target damaging the radar. There are casualties among the personnel. In the second attack by 8 ATACMS missiles at the Kursk-Vostochny airfield on Monday, seven were shot down while one missile reached the target. The falling debris slightly damaged the infrastructure facilities and two servicemen suffered minor injuries. The Russian MOD stated that 'retaliatory actions are being prepared.' The Russian military experts estimate that the attacks were planned for sometime and the Americans handled the targeting. On November 25, White House acknowledged for the first time the shift in policy allowing the use of ATACMS to attack Russian territory. Admiral John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the White House National Security Council, revealed during a press gaggle on Monday, inter alia, saying that 'well, obviously we did change the guidance and gave them [Kiev] guidance that they could use them, you know, to strike these particular types of targets.' Following the attack on Monday, Ukraine sought an emergency meeting of the NATO–Ukraine Council in Brussels at the level of permanent representatives. Oreshnik was the main topic, and the need to strengthen air defence system. The NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said later, 'Our support for Ukraine helps it fight, but we need to go further to change the trajectory of this conflict.' No doubt, NATO is very concerned about the emergent situation but still won’t accept a Russian victory. Hotheads in the West are once again talking about the deployment of troops by NATO countries to Ukraine for combat operations, which was originally mooted by French President Emmanuel Macron in February. But plainly put, unless the US is willing to put boots on the ground, the rest of NATO simply run around like a headless chicken. The UK with a 80000-strong army has very few combat units; the 175,000-strong German army has forgotten how to fight; and France is in deep political and economic crisis. As for the US, the public opinion opposes wars and president-elect Donald Trump cannot ignore it. However, petrified that Trump may turn his back on the war, there is a school of thought in Europe that they could offer something interesting to incentivise him other than the carrot of Ukraine’s vast stores of critical minerals that Americans lack — eg., more trading incentives for America; greater spending on NATO; more pressure on Iran; 'peacekeeping boots on the ground' inside Ukraine; help in Trump’s upcoming economic skirmishes with China and so on. Meanwhile, much brainstorming is going on in the US too as to how to save NATO from Trump’s scalpel. A Guardian columnist wrote, 'If the EU and UK seize the $300bn of Russian state assets sitting in Euroclear, money Putin has long written off, we can bring serious funding to the table. Trump does not need to spend any more money on Ukraine – we can buy the weapons. America can even make a profit while securing peace in Europe. Trump would be able to show how he got those parasitic Europeans to cough up, prove his detractors wrong by rebooting America’s most traditional alliances – all while putting 'America first'.' All this testifies to the angst in the European mind that Oreshnik has forced a paradigm shift in the Ukraine war. The triumphalist betting that Russia would be bluffing on nuclear deterrence has given way to fear, since Russia now may not need nuclear weapons to retaliate against attacks on its territory. Oreshnik is a non-nuclear weapon, it is by no means a weapon of mass destruction but is a high-precision weapon of immense destructive power that annihilates its targets — and Europeans have no means to defend against it. Succinctly put, if Biden’s plan to 'Trump-proof' the Ukraine war has put Europe and Ukraine in a royal fix making them a punch bag for Russia. Make no mistake, Oreshnik will soon make sure that there won’t even be a proxy regime in Ukraine for the West to 'support'. It is humiliating to watch the proxy’s nose being rubbed in the dust. A punishing Russian retaliation is imminent for the two latest ATACMS attacks. The sharp deterioration in Russia’s ties with the UK suggests a high probability that Britain could be in Moscow’s crosshairs. The station chief of the British intelligence in the embassy in Moscow has been expelled; western reports cite significant supplies of Storm Shadow missiles (numbering 150) to Ukraine lately after the election of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The top Russian military expert Alexei Leonkov told Izvestia newspaper, 'Here is the fact of the US targeting, here are the fragments of the ATACMS missile, by which it can be clearly identified. We have the right to strike back. Where and how will be decided by the Ministry of Defence and the Supreme Commander—in-Chief. He [Putin] said that they would be warned about the impact. Our enemies must prepare for an answer. The big question is at what point Russia may strike the NATO military hubs in Romania and Poland. The former Russian President and Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said yesterday that all bets are off. 'If the conflict develops by the escalation scenario, it is impossible to rule out anything, because the NATO member states have effectively got fully involved in this conflict,' he said in an interview with Al Arabiya. Medvedev added in chilling words, 'The Western states must realise that they fight on Ukraine’s side… Meanwhile, they fight not only by shipping weapons and providing money. They fight directly, because they provide targets on Russian territory and control American and European missiles. They fight with the Russian Federation. And if this is the case, nothing could be ruled out… even the most difficult and sad scenario is possible. 'We would not want such scenario, we have all said that repeatedly. We want peace, but this peace must take Russia’s interest into consideration in full.' Indeed, the only logical explanation for Biden’s brinkmanship in collusion with the Atlanticists in Europe in the lame duck phase of his presidency is that Oreshnik has upstaged his best-laid plans. Saner voices in Europe are speaking up. In a hugely symbolic act of defiance, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico disclosed on Wednesday that he has accepted an official invitation from Putin to the events in Moscow in May commemorating the 80th anniversary of Victory in World War II. Slovakia is a member country of both EU and NATO. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer in a telephone conversation with Trump, reaffirmed Austria’s readiness to serve as a platform for international peace talks on Ukraine. During the conversation, Trump reportedly evinced interest in Nehammer’s previous exchanges with Putin on Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YQpyW97guT9A	2024-11-30T15:50:59-08:00	
An Austrian Perspective On Tariffs – OpEd	Tariffs have been a key instrument in government trade policies for centuries. For instance, one of the wealthiest ancient countries, Khazaria (7th-10th centuries CE), did not tax its citizens directly but instead imposed tariffs on all passing caravans due to its strategic location along major trade routes. In the United States, before introducing the federal income tax (1913), the government generated revenue primarily through tariffs. The role of tariffs is widely debated today, especially during election periods. What Are Tariffs? A tariff is, in essence, a tax imposed by a government on goods and services imported from other countries. The main purpose of tariffs is to make imported goods more expensive, thereby protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, to raise government revenue, and/or to influence trade policies. Tariffs can be broken down into two main types:Specific tariffs: a fixed fee imposed per unit of imported goods (e.g., $100 per ton of imported steel) Ad valorem tariffs: a percentage of the value of the imported goods (e.g., 10 percent on imported electronics). Historically, tariffs were one of the primary sources of revenue for governments. Today, although their revenue-generating role has diminished, they are still used to protect domestic industries, control trade balances, and as leverage in international negotiations. How Tariffs Work When a company imports goods subject to tariffs, it must pay the tariff at the border, typically to customs authorities, before the goods are cleared. This means companies often pay the tariff upfront before selling the goods in the domestic market. When a tariff is imposed, it raises the cost of imported goods at the point of entry, which has several effects on the economy: Raising Prices for Consumers The most direct effect of tariffs is that they often make imported goods more expensive. Importers—facing higher costs because of tariffs—typically attempt to pass these costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. For instance, if a 10 percent tariff is placed on imported cars, the price of those cars may rise by a similar amount. However, this increase is not always guaranteed, as market dynamics often prevent the transfer of the additional costs to consumers. Protecting Domestic Producers By making foreign goods and factors more expensive, tariffs create a protective barrier for domestic industries. Domestic producers can try to increase their prices, as the cost of imported alternatives rises. For instance, if tariffs are imposed on imported steel, domestic steel manufacturers benefit because the higher price of imported steel makes their products more attractive, even if they are more expensive than they would be in a fully open market. Retaliatory Tariffs and Trade Wars Tariffs can also spark retaliatory measures from trading partners, leading to trade wars. When one country imposes tariffs, affected nations may respond by placing tariffs on goods exported by the initial country, which escalates the situation. Trade wars can disrupt international supply chains, raise costs for businesses and consumers, and reduce economic growth. Market Dynamics and Tariffs: Passing on Costs Often, however, the costs of tariffs cannot be truly passed on to consumers. The extent to which the burden of tariffs is transferred depends on market dynamics, such as competition and consumer demand. In highly-competitive industries, companies may absorb the costs of tariffs to maintain their market share, sacrificing profit margins rather than risking losing customers to competitors. This pushes up production costs, hampers market dynamics, and may even push firms out of business. The Austrian Approach to Tariffs and Comparative Advantage The Austrian School of economics advocates for minimal government intervention in markets, promotes free trade, and supports individual liberty. Austrian economists view tariffs as detrimental to the natural efficiency of the market, because they distort price signals and lead to the misallocation of resources. Murray Rothbard explained that 'Tariffs injure the consumer with the ‘protected’ area, who are prevented from purchasing from more efficient competitors at a lower price.' The Austrian critique of tariffs is heavily rooted in the concept of comparative advantage, which argues that countries should specialize in producing goods where they are relatively more efficient. Even if a country is more efficient at producing all goods than another country, both can still benefit from trade if each specializes in goods for which it has a comparative advantage. This principle—originally developed by David Ricardo—emphasizes that trade allows for a more efficient allocation of global resources, lowering production costs and increasing prosperity for all participants. In the context of comparative advantage, consider two countries—Country A and Country B—both of which produce electronics and textiles. Suppose Country A requires 8 hours to produce 1 unit of electronics and 4 hours for 1 unit of textiles. Country B, however, requires 10 hours to produce 1 unit of electronics and 8 hours for 1 unit of textiles. Even though Country A is more efficient in producing both electronics and textiles, the principle of comparative advantage suggests that each country should specialize based on where they have a relative advantage. For Country A, the opportunity cost of producing 1 unit of electronics is 2 units of textiles (8/4). For Country B, the opportunity cost of producing 1 unit of electronics is 1.25 units of textiles (10/8). Thus, even though Country A is absolutely better at producing both goods, it is relatively better at producing textiles, while Country B is relatively better at producing electronics. If both countries specialize accordingly—Country A in textiles and Country B in electronics—and then trade, they can both enjoy more of each good than if they tried to produce both themselves. However, if Country A imposes a 20 percent tariff on imported electronics from Country B, the cost of those imported electronics increases, making them less competitive in Country A’s market. This could cause Country A to shift resources inefficiently back into electronics production, even though it is less cost-effective than focusing on textiles. This illustrates how tariffs can disrupt the natural efficiency of trade and specialization, leading to suboptimal outcomes for both countries. In general, from an Austrian perspective, tariffs distort price signals, which are essential for the efficient allocation of resources in a market economy. Prices in a free market reflect the underlying scarcity of goods, consumer preferences, and production costs. Tariffs, by artificially inflating the price of imported goods, disrupt these signals and lead consumers and producers to make inefficient choices. Imposing tariffs for the sake of addressing a trade imbalance will not resolve the underlying cause, which is typically a loss of competitiveness in the entire industry or in specific goods. Tariffs make these industries even less competitive than they were before tariff imposition. Moreover, creating a 'protective area' will force other companies to flock into protected industries, essentially depriving established firms of their initial monopolist benefits while leaving the overall misallocation of production and harm to consumers intact. Rothbard explained, 'In the long run, therefore, a tariff per se does not establish a lasting benefit even for the immediate beneficiaries.' Austrian Approach and National Security Concerns While Austrian economists emphasize the efficiency of free markets and the advantages of comparative advantage, the case for free trade becomes more nuanced when national security concerns arise. Unfortunately, when national security is at stake, economic priorities often yield to political and strategic imperatives. Throughout history, political instability and conflicts have led governments to emphasize self-sufficiency over market efficiency, particularly in industries vital to defense. During such times, the state assumes its primary role—to defend the nation—and under this pretext, interference in the economy becomes profound and widespread. There is no perfect strategy for managing a wartime economy; any approach will inevitably diverge from the Austrian preference for minimal intervention. However, it is hard to imagine that war preparation would go unnoticed, and if a nation depends completely on a particular resource from an unfriendly country, the market price of that product would skyrocket. This, in turn, would signal entrepreneurs to either stockpile large quantities of the resource at current prices, seek alternative suppliers that were previously ignored because of prohibitive costs, or seize the opportunity to revive domestic production. To lessen the challenges posed by such shifts, countries should carefully select their trading partners. For instance, trade with authoritarian or totalitarian regimes should be limited, and dependencies on these nations should be avoided to reduce strategic risks. Trade relations should primarily focus on allies who share similar values of open markets, respect for private property, and sound economic principles. When such alignment exists, political relationships tend to support the economic efficiency that the Austrian School advocates, fostering a more resilient and mutually beneficial trading environment. The reliance on administrative measures often stems from a belief that market forces cannot respond quickly or effectively to crises, leading to policies that distort incentives and stifle innovation. By undermining price signals, governments often create monopolies or grant undue privileges to certain industries, consolidating power in ways that harm overall economic efficiency. This skepticism of market mechanisms reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of their adaptability and the profound role they play in dynamically coordinating resources, even under the pressures of wartime.

IAEA Warns Of Impact On Nuclear Safety Of Attacks On Ukraine’s En...	International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said that Ukraine's three operating nuclear power plants have had to reduce their electricity generation as a result of attacks on the country's energy infrastructure. In the agency's latest update it said that the nuclear power plants - Khmelnitsky, Rivne and South Ukraine - had to lower their power levels on Thursday for the second time in two weeks as a precautionary safety step. The three plants have a total of nine reactors between them. One reactor at Rivne was disconnected from the grid and all three plants continued to receive off-site power, although Khmelnitsky lost connection to two of its power lines. Grossi said: 'Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is extremely fragile and vulnerable, putting nuclear safety at great risk. Once again, I call for maximum military restraint in areas with major nuclear energy facilities and other sites on which they depend.' IAEA teams visited seven substations located outside the nuclear power plants in Ukraine in September and October to assess the situation after strikes on the energy infrastructure in August. Grossi reported to the IAEA board of governors earlier this month that there had been 'extensive damage' and concluded that the reliability of off-site supply to nuclear power plants had been 'significantly reduced'. In his statement issued on Thursday, he said: 'The IAEA will continue to assess the extent of damage to facilities and power lines that are essential for nuclear safety and security. The IAEA will continue to do everything in its power to reduce the risk of a nuclear incident during this tragic war.' The IAEA has had teams stationed at each of Ukraine's nuclear power plants, and it said there had been no reports of direct damage to nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants need to have an electricity supply to ensure necessary safety functions can take place as well as reactor cooling, and they also need reliable connections to the grid to be able to distribute the electricity they produce. In addition to Ukraine's three operating nuclear power plants, Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been under Russian military control since early March 2022. Its reactors are all shut down and it has had to rely on emergency diesel generators on occasions when it has lost all access to off-site power. The IAEA has set out its seven rules for nuclear safety and security during the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which have been adopted by the United Nations Security Council. They include the core principles that no-one should fire at, or from a nuclear power plant, or use a nuclear power plant as a military base.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YQ7v6L8moPO_	2024-11-30T15:48:04-08:00	
Greater Energy Levels By GOP Produce Victories Over Democrats – O...	Over thirty years ago, Republican historian and political analyst, Kevin Phillips, remarked that the 'Republicans go for the jugular while the Democrats go for the capillaries.' This serious disparity in political energy levels is rarely taken into account to explain election turnouts. The voluntary enfeebling of the Democratic Party started long ago. In 1970, writing in Harper’s Magazine, economist John Kenneth Galbraith, a co-founder of Americans for Democratic Action, wrote an article 'Who Needs Democrats? And What It Takes to be Needed?' He argued that if the Democratic Party does not take on the corporate and political establishment, it has no purpose at all. In 2001, long after the 1980 Reagan landslide of Jimmy Carter, Labor Secretary under Clinton, Robert Reich, wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post which declared, '…The Democratic Party. It’s Dead.' In the following years, while the Democrats were accelerating their abandonment of half the country as 'red states,' and became more out of touch with blue-collar workers and unions, whom they took for granted, the Republicans were becoming more energized by the year. Their mouthpieces dominating talk radio – e.g., Rush Limbaugh – were directly sowing unrebutted discord, day after day, among blue-collar workers against the Democrats. Why? It’s because the Democrats essentially gave up on Talk Radio and didn’t bother listening to how these corporatist radio bloviators were turning hard working listeners into Reagan Democrats. While the GOP was eroding the core base of the Democratic Party and taking total control of red state legislatures, governorships, and courts, the Democrats, starting in 1979, were plunging into enticing and taking corporate PAC money, as urged by then Rep. Tony Coelho (D-CA). This reliance on corporate campaign money weakened the Party’s positions and actions on behalf of workers, consumers, the environment, and the need for an expanded social safety net for the populace. Western nations have provided their citizens superior health care, family support and education programs for decades. The comparative energy levels were exhibited in the 2010 state gerrymandering drive. While the Democrats were snoozing, a laser beam effort in several states, like Pennsylvania, took the Dems to the cleaners. The result: majority GOP Congressional delegations for a decade even though the Democrats won the popular vote there. (See: Ratf**ked: The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America’s Democracy by David Daley.) Recall, in 2009 Obama had a large majority Democratic advantage in the House and Senate as a result of his win over John McCain in November 2008. Instead of going forward full throttle with this mandate, Obama chose extreme caution. He focused on Obamacare, after giving up right at the beginning the crucial 'public option' allowing people to opt out of the corporate health insurance grip. He gave it up unilaterally before negotiations began with the obstructive GOP. For the rest of his term, Obama appeared to be resting. He promised a $9.50 federal minimum wage in his 2008 campaign but didn’t lift a finger for it during his first term. It is still at a poverty wage of $7.25 per hour to this day. He didn’t really put up a grassroots fight for his stimulus bill following the Wall Street collapse and the great recession starting under George W. Bush, (the war criminal against the Iraqi people.) Obama even declined to prosecute the Wall Street crooks. In the meantime, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, managed to lose the House to a reactionary GOP in the 2010 elections, the 2012 elections, the 2014 elections and the 2016 elections, straightjacketing any possible Obama agenda in the Congress. The Dems had the popular New Deal agenda update in their grasp, but let it slip through their fingers while the GOP had a corporatist anti-worker, consumer, and women’s agenda and with ferocious energy blocked improvements supported by a majority of people in the US. Even more inexplicable was the Democratic Party’s refusal to strongly support the galvanizing political civic movement to cancel the Electoral College (see NationalPopularVote.com). This organizing effort has led so far to the passage of state laws (California, New York, Illinois, etc.) handing the Electoral College vote to the presidential candidate who wins the national popular vote. The Democrats won the popular vote in 2000 (Al Gore) and 2016 (Hillary Clinton) but lost the Electoral College vote to G.W. Bush and the surprised Donald Trump. Still, the Democrats stay on the sidelines though this movement already has enabled state laws totaling 215 Electoral College votes, needing only to get to 270 to neutralize this anti-democratic vestige from the historic era of slavery. Almost everywhere you look you see this huge disparity in energy levels. Compare the smaller Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives with the Pelosi-toady Progressive Caucus. The difference is that between thunder and slumber over the years. Compare the Tea Party’s slamming impact on the established GOP in Congress with the tepid attitude of most labor unions and the AFL-CIO deferring to the Democratic Party. Compare the over-the-top corporate judges to the so-called liberal judges, as relating to federal cases against Trump. Compare the comprehensive ghastly Heritage Foundation’s 900-page 2025 blueprint directed toward the GOP expansion of the corporate state and the stripping away of services to the people and their rights with the agenda advanced by the progressive citizen groups. No comparison. The media notices this difference in energy levels which is one reason it gives more coverage to the right-wing messianic bulldozers who show in every way that they are hungrier for taking power as they take no prisoners. Partisan energy disparities even extend to the right-wing vs. left-wing media. The former has the brazen Fox News network. The left has nothing like that. Bill Moyers told me he urged mega-rich George Soros and allies to start a competing progressive network after Fox became quickly formidable. No way. The right-wing magazines cover the actions of their right-wing allies, plus those gatherings and books. While the progressive media mostly ignores reviewing progressive books and what citizen groups are driving for against corporate power in Washington, DC, and at the state level. The Progressive media prefers publishing their opinions and exposé pieces. That’s one reason why there are more non-fiction right-wing corporatist books which become best sellers, while progressive tomes gather dust. Further weakening the energy gap in favor of the GOP are the Democrats who look for scapegoats like the Greens to account for their disgraceful losses. They rarely look at themselves in the mirror. Democrats like Norman Solomon (See, Roots Action) issue 'autopsy reports' following Party defeats. The 2017 report documented the Democratic Party’s arrogant, entrenched leadership which ignores the progressive base. After the November 5th debacle, have you heard about mass resignations by Democrats responsible for this victory by the convicted felon, chronic liar, bigot, corrupt, phony promisor Trump? Well, the DNC chair, Jamie Harrison is resigning but that is pro forma. Other Democratic leaders are still on board at the state and federal level, in addition to, astonishingly enough, the failed corporate political/media consultants who enriched themselves while wasting away the biggest flood of campaign money in American history on the Kamala Harris campaign. Younger Democrats who raise the need to displace the failed Democratic apparatchiks, and who want popular vigorous progressive agendas, as espoused by the naturally popular Senator Bernie Sanders, get ignored or worse pushed out of contention, visibility and, importantly, respect. The Party’s losing elders have assured the absence of farm teams, of successors. Speaker Pelosi and her deputy Rep. Steny Hoyer are experts at this geriatric supremacy despite their track record of losing to the aggressive Republican plutocrats. Energy counts, matters and wins the political battles. There isn’t even any adrenaline around the Dems’ capillaries.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YSms0NF0o9qz	2024-11-30T15:45:58-08:00	
Russia Increases Ties With Iran’s Axis Of Resistance – Analysis	On November 19, Israel announced it found a large cache of Russian arms at the hand of Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. Reports show that many of the weapons were initially owned by the Syrian military, to which Russia has supplied weapons for years (Times of Israel, November 19). This indicates growing cooperation between Russia and the militias across the Middle East (see EDM, September 18). While Russia has been opportunistic in the Middle East, it does not have a blueprint for an overarching peace in the region, nor does it genuinely strive to achieve it by portraying itself as a substitute for the United States (see EDM, October 7). Russia seeks a measured increase in its geopolitical influence via bilateral deals with key Middle East actors. These are enhanced through close military, security, and economic ties and are especially valuable in the age of Russia-West rivalry following the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia turned to the Middle East and wider Asia to withstand the pressure of sanctions by seeking alternative trade routes and sources of foreign investments. One such enhanced relationship is Russia’s ties with Iran in the international consequences of the war in Ukraine (see EDM, November 4). Yet what largely fell out of focus is how this alignment allowed Moscow to deepen relations with Iran’s so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' a network of militias across the Middle East that the Islamic Republic operates. From Houthis to Hezbollah to Hamas, Russia has increased its diplomacy and, in some cases, military cooperation over the past couple of years (see EDM, August 8). Russia has been actively engaged in expanding security and military ties with the Houthis, including providing weapons to the organization. Media reports indicate that Russian intelligence officers were spotted in the Houthis-held territory, and Moscow has even considered sending significant military support to the Iran-backed militia (Iran International, September 25). Moreover, political contacts became more common, with Houthi and Russian officials holding regular meetings (TASS, July 2). In Gaza, where Israel has waged a massive military campaign, Russia has considered Hamas as a legitimate ruler (see EDM, October 16, November 1, 2023). This February, Moscow hosted an intra-Palestinian conference where officials from Hamas, along with those from Fatah and Islamic Jihad, participated (Al Jazeera, August 13). Russia also abstained from criticizing Hamas for the attack on Israel and was somewhat critical of the latter throughout the past year (see EDM, October 23, 2023). Moscow knows the limits of its power in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and especially in internal Palestinian affairs. Its response, however, is about how it will be perceived internationally, presenting itself as a reliable and, most of all, largely pro-Arab power in the Middle East (see EDM, February 22, October 15). This fits into Moscow’s overall strategy of pivoting to Asia and the Middle East, especially closer ties with the Arab states. This posture concerns messaging that the United States has failed as a responsible actor in the Middle East (see EDM, October 21). Hezbollah is another critical player within Iran’s Axis of Resistance with which Russia has maintained close contact. Russia has been critical of Israel’s campaign of targeting high-ranking Hezbollah leaders. When Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukr was killed in late July, the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry issued concern that Israel’s attacks would complicate the regional situation (Atalayar, September 15). Moscow has also been vocal about how resilient Hezbollah has been in the face of the Israeli onslaught (MEMO, October 9). There is also a security and military aspect to the Russia-Hezbollah engagement. Both Hezbollah and Russian forces cooperated during the civil war in Syria. The two were instrumental in helping Bashar al-Assad to retain power from 2015 onwards. In addition to Israel’s claim about finding extensive caches of Russian arms supplied to Hezbollah on November 19, some media outlets have previously suggested, however unlikely, that Hezbollah sent fighters to Ukraine to aid Russia’s war effort (Israel Hayom, March 27, 2022). Moscow sees these contacts as a powerful leverage not only against the United States but also the regional countries such as Saudi Arabia and Israel. In the case of the Houthis, close cooperation allows Moscow to acquire a powerful leveraging tool against Riyadh if the latter chooses a more pro-US position. This is especially pertinent as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term is eagerly anticipated among the Arab states, which expect more transactional relations with the United States (Anadolu Ajansı, November 6; Middle East Eye, November 7). The Houthis also allow Moscow to put pressure on the collective West and distract it from the war in Ukraine. Similarly, close ties with Hamas and Hezbollah enable Russia to signal to Israel that should it shift its approach over Ukraine or attack Iran’s nuclear program, Moscow is ready to increase cooperation with the two militias (see EDM, February 22). This approach is a result of cooling in Moscow-Tel Aviv relations since the war in Ukraine began and especially so after the hostilities in Gaza. Russia is an opportunistic power in the Middle East. It benefits from the United States’ failure to bring an end to the war in Gaza and conclude the normalization process between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Moscow equally recognizes the limits to what it can do in the region, but over the past couple of years, Russia’s posture in the Middle East has increased, and a big part of it is due to the close ties with Iran’s Axis of Resistance.

Rapid Collapse Of Syrian Forces Around Aleppo Stuns Many	By Edward Yeranian The rapid collapse of Syrian government forces inside and around the country's second-largest city, Aleppo, has caught many observers by surprise and is causing a domino effect on many parts of the country. Rebel fighters, who oppose Syrian President Bashar Assad and include those from the terrorist Jabhat al Nusra group, fired weapons Saturday inside Syria's northern 'economic capital' of Aleppo after the withdrawal of government forces from the city. Amateur video showed rebel fighters in control of Aleppo's central Saadallah Jabari Square, in addition to Aleppo University and the city's provincial government headquarters. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV reported that Syrian government forces also withdrew from Aleppo's civilian and military airports. Abu Dhabi-based Sky News Arabia showed amateur video of rebels apparently in control of the military airport. Britain-based Syrian analyst Rami Abdulrahman, of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told Arab media that Iranian forces and their proxy militia allies have withdrawn from many positions in and around Aleppo. Abdulrahman said that Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces withdrew from the region after a drone attacked them and their allies, including Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite militia fighters, who pulled out alongside them. Arab media reported that the entire region between Aleppo and the rebel-controlled province of Idlib had fallen and that large towns south of Aleppo on the main Aleppo-Damascus highway, including Saraqib and Maarat al-Numan, also were captured. It was not clear if other large Syrian cities would fall, but Joshua Landis, who heads the Middle East studies program at the University of Oklahoma, told VOA that all eyes are now on Hama, which is Syria's fourth-largest city. Landis said he believes it is possible the capital of Damascus may fall, because government supporters are dispirited and have lost the will to fight. Despite Turkish government denials, Landis says the entire operation has 'Turkish fingerprints written all over it,' since 'all the arms and food and money that enter Idlib come from Turkey.' 'I'm sure Turkey wanted to give Assad a slap in the face and bring him to the [negotiating] table,' Landis said, 'but it's clearly set off dominoes that I don't think anyone expected [to fall].' Landis said there are several reasons for Assad's weakness, including Israel's 'pulling the stuffing out of [his ally] Hezbollah' and the 'relentless Israeli pounding of Syrian government positions' and those of their allies inside the country since the outset of the Gaza conflict on October 7, 2023. Syrian analysts also told Arab media that the Iran-Syria axis 'has been weakened since the road from Tehran to Beirut is no longer open and arms are no longer able to reach Iran's proxy militia allies. In addition, Syrian ally Russia 'has its hands tied at the moment because of its conflict with Ukraine.' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan denied that his government had any responsibility in the Syrian rebel onslaught on Aleppo. 'Turkey is playing an increasing role in trying to achieve peace in the region.' Russian forces reportedly pulled out of several strategic positions in the region overnight, but Russian and Syrian warplanes bombed rebel forces in Aleppo and other parts of the region, causing numerous rebel casualties, according to the Syrian military.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YWNJ3VIbb4xz	2024-11-30T15:41:41-08:00	
M23 Rebels ‘Version 2’ Seeks To Build Stronghold In DRC	Heavily armed M23 rebels sat in trucks and on motorcycles at a checkpoint along the Sake-Kilolirwe-Kitshanga road in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They stopped every traveler, took stock of their inventory, demanded a tax payment and issued a hand-written receipt. In a recent report, a cohort of researchers estimated that M23’s extortion of civilians along this single trade route could amount to $69,500 per month. 'Control of roads is a significant strategic issue for obvious military reasons, but also for financing armed groups,' the authors wrote. 'The M23 made significant progress in 2022 along major roads and sought to occupy key crossroads, bridges and commercial hubs in North Kivu. In 2023, the group occupied such crucial commercial centers as Kilolirwe, Kitshanga and Mushaki.' Economic control has been one of the hallmarks of the M23 rebel group as it has seized large swaths of land in the eastern provinces of the DRC. In conducting investigations and surveying locals, the researchers sought to label what they say has been an evolution of the insurgent group, calling it 'Version 2' of the M23. A report published in April by the International Peace Information Service (IPIS) and the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) was based on 57 interviews conducted by the Goma-based civil society organization Association pour le Développement des Initiatives Paysannes. 'The current M23 crisis … is seen as an extension of a war based on the objectives of occupying land and undermining power, particularly customary power,' the report stated. 'In addition to external support from the Rwandan army, the M23 uses several revenue-generating activities within North Kivu.' The researchers concluded that the M23 rebel group is seeking long-term local political power in eastern DRC using historical land disputes, political marginalization and illicit taxation schemes to expand and solidify their authority. Those interviewed included members of M23, as well as Congolese Soldiers, members of armed groups fighting the M23, local chiefs, teachers, traders and farmers who live on the conflict’s frontlines. The United Nations on October 30 reported that 6.9 million people have fled the conflict in eastern DRC, making it one of the world’s largest displacement and humanitarian crises. After lying dormant for 10 years, a unified and resurgent M23 rebel group launched sustained attacks in 2022 in the province of North Kivu and has since fought against Congolese troops, local militias and multinational forces. M23 officials have said their attacks were designed to seize control of and protect land acquired by the ethnic Tutsi community. 'M23, however, has been accused of not just human rights abuses by groups like Human Rights Watch but has also on at least one occasion attacked U.N. peacekeepers who had been tasked with protecting civilians,' security analysis website Geopolitical Monitor wrote in an October 30 situation report. In addition to detailing M23’s elaborate tax scheme in their report, IPIS researcher Ken Matthysen and DIIS senior researcher Peer Schouten examined the insurgent group’s practices of forced labor and illegal exploitation of natural resources, such as timber and charcoal trafficking. 'M23’s disruptive strategy aims to replace Congolese authorities and overhaul local governance in areas it controls in eastern DR Congo,' they wrote in an October 26 article for The Conversation Africa magazine. 'Many Congolese we spoke to perceive M23’s main aim to be control of power at the local level — undermining the existing authorities. 'The group has indeed sought to replace customary authorities with M23-appointed ones, at times assassinating Congolese chiefs. Local sources said M23 even burnt chiefdom archives, destroying evidence of claims to customary authority.' The researchers warn that instability in eastern DRC has deepened since M23’s revival in 2022, as more tribal and ethnic groups have gotten involved. In fighting against M23, the Congolese military has aligned with and given new life to a host of local armed groups under the banner of 'Wazalendo, which is Swahili for 'patriots.' But these fragmented groups also interfere in local governance and extort citizens. 'Instead of curbing the rise of these armed groups, the DRC government has rather legitimized the Wazalendo phenomenon,' the report stated. 'These trends have led to a militarization of the local governance context, which risks jeopardizing future disarmament efforts and pacification in eastern DRC, beyond the current crisis.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YS4bcCK3KK5Z	2024-11-30T15:39:07-08:00	
Georgian President Calls Parliament ‘Illegitimate’ As US Suspends...	(RFE/RL) -- Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, an ardent critic of the ruling Georgian Dream party, called the nation’s parliament illegitimate and vowed to remain in office when her term ends next month, while Washington said it was suspending its 'strategic partnership' with the country. Georgia has been thrown into turmoil since parliamentary elections in October -- in which Georgian Dream secured 54 percent of the vote -- with the opposition and Western governments arguing that the poll was marred by violations and Russian influence. Zurabishvili on November 30 said the 'illegitimate' chamber does not have the right to choose her successor following the end of her term in December and vowed to remain in office. 'There is no legitimate parliament, and therefore, an illegitimate parliament cannot elect a new president,' Zurabishvili said. 'Thus, no inauguration can take place, and my mandate continues until a legitimately elected parliament is formed,' she added, setting up a likely showdown over the office with Georgian Dream. Separately, Washington blasted the security measures used against Georgians who have taken to the streets following the disputed elections and after a November 28 announcement by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze that his government was suspending EU accession talks and would reject budgetary grants from Brussels 'until the end of 2028.' 'The United States condemns the excessive use of force by police against Georgians seeking to exercise their rights to assembly and expression, including their freedom to peacefully protest,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. 'By suspending Georgia’s EU accession process, Georgian Dream has rejected the opportunity for closer ties with Europe and made Georgia more vulnerable to the Kremlin,' he said. 'Georgian Dream’s various anti-democratic actions have violated the core tenets of our U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership, which was based on shared values and commitments to democracy, rule of law, civil society, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and anti-corruption efforts. As a result, the United States has suspended this mechanism.' 'We reiterate our call to the Georgian government to return to its Euro-Atlantic path, transparently investigate all parliamentary election irregularities, and repeal anti-democratic laws that limit freedoms of assembly and expression,' Miller added. More than 100 people were detained in a massive pro-EU rally in Tbilisi on November 29 as Georgian police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters. Georgia's Interior Ministry said protesters had 'verbally and physically' assaulted police officers and had thrown various objects at security forces. Various videos from the rally showed police officers beating protesters. Reacting to the crackdown, Kobakhidze suggested on November 30 that there were 'isolated' incidents of police brutality but 'systemic violence' against security forces by protesters. 'On one side, there was violence, on the other side there were incidents,' he said in a press conference. The opposition called for renewed protests on November 30, with several thousand demonstrators gathering near the parliament waving EU and Georgian flags. Officials said protesters damaged walls of the legislative building using stones and other objects. Police in riot gear used water cannons and tear gas to subdue the crowd shortly after midnight on December 1. Fires were also reported at the parliament grounds. On the first night of protests, some 43 demonstrators were detained 'as a result of illegal and violent actions,' according to the Interior Ministry. Kobakhidze on November 30 said that a 'difficult' few months lay ahead of Georgia but added that he expects relations with the West to 'reset.' Zurabishvili, who has long sided with the protesters, condemned the 'brutal and disproportionate attacks on the Georgian people and media,' likening the crackdown on November 29 to 'Russian-style repression.' The next day, she urged the Georgian diaspora to 'wake up' and help protesters by speaking to the media and appealing to the authorities where they live. '[You] can no longer be silent and pretend nothing is happening in the homeland,' she wrote on Facebook. On November 28, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for new legislative elections in Georgia and sanctions on senior members of the Georgian Dream party. In its resolution, the European Parliament said the election result election did 'not serve as a reliable representation of the will of the Georgian people.' It also called on the European Union, which froze Georgia's EU membership application last month, to place sanctions on key officials within the ruling party, including Kobakhidze, Georgian Dream Chairman Irakli Gharibashvili, billionaire power broker and party founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, and Tbilisi Mayor Kakha Kaladze.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YZl7ON-xCkAw	2024-11-30T15:35:43-08:00	
Trump’s Already Rewarding Fossil Fuel Executives For Funding His ...	During his campaign, Donald Trump publicly promised to reward oil and gas executives handsomely in exchange for funding his campaign. Within weeks of winning the election, he’s making good on his promise by tapping oil and gas executive Chris Wright to lead the Department of Energy. Wright has zero experience in running a federal agency. And as the Associated Press reports, he’s 'been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change.' To lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Trump has picked another crusader against the climate: former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin, who voted in lockstep with fossil fuel interests during his time in Congress. Poll after poll shows a majority of Americans believe climate change is real, human-caused, and needs to be urgently addressed. Trump’s billionaire oil buddies — who will shape national energy policy for the next four years — offer precisely the opposite. Trump has promised to make fuel and energy more affordable for consumers by steering massive profits to energy producers — but those profits will come at our expense. He’s pledged to end federal subsidies for electric vehicles, even though many Americans want zero-emission vehicles but can’t afford them yet. And he’s vowed to bring gas prices under $2 a gallon — a wild claim that economists don’t buy. Oil profits and production are already sky-high under President Biden and haven’t led to lower gas prices. Indeed, Biden has been more of a friend to oil and gas than to climate justice groups. In spite of the White House’s boasts about historic climate policies, Biden’s actions have been relatively toothless. Among them are setting goals posts to reduce emissions years from now — anywhere between 2030 and 2050 — well after he leaves office. He’s touted his signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, as a historic victory for the climate. The law did make significant climate investments, but the majority of it tinkered around the edges of what’s truly needed. And it ended up giving away billions to the fossil fuel industry for unproven technologies such as 'carbon capture.' Indeed, if Trump wants to 'drill baby, drill,' he could thank Biden for paving the way. Biden has overseen the transformation of the U.S. into one of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers, both during his presidency and during the Obama years, when he was vice president. According to the Energy Department, the U.S. has 'produced more crude oil than any nation at any time… for the past six years in a row.' So the last thing the fossil fuel industry needs is more favors. Consumers will pay the price if Trump makes EVs and renewable energy more expensive, lets oil companies dismantle regulations, and accelerates the climate crisis. But he’s relying on ordinary Americans not noticing he’s throwing them and their planet under the bus because of the chaos he’ll bring with mass deportations, anti-LGBT bigotry, and other madness. With the time he has left, Biden could still declare climate change a national emergency — a step many environmental groups are begging him to take, but which he’s resisted throughout his presidency. They’re also calling on him to stop the expansion of export infrastructure for liquefied natural gas. If Biden wants to make any sort of claim to be a climate champion, he’ll take those steps. But ultimately, it will be up to the rest of us to watch what Trump is doing and fight for better climate policies in our own states and communities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YUnurwHCmMdU	2024-11-30T15:33:48-08:00	
Turkish Energy Markets: 2025 Forecasts – OpEd	Turkey's energy sector has witnessed remarkable growth as of 2024. According to data released by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Turkey's installed energy capacity reached 115 MW by the end of November 2024. This reflects the continuous expansion and diversification of the country's energy production capabilities. Distribution of Resources and Energy Plans As per the National Energy Plan, the distribution of installed capacity by source as of July 2024 is as follows: Hydropower: 28.5% Natural gas: 21.9% Coal: 19.3% Wind: 10.9% Solar: 15.6% Geothermal: 1.5% Other sources: 2.4% This distribution underscores the increasing reliance on renewable energy sources while fossil fuels, although declining, still play a significant role. Additionally, landslides in the Afşin-Elbistan coalfields have disrupted operations at the A and B thermal power plants, causing setbacks in coal-based energy production. International Energy Events One of the most significant international energy events of 2024 was the Enlit2024 energy conference and exhibition, held in Milan in November. Despite limited participation from Turkish firms, their expertise in thermal power plant construction provided valuable contributions to the event. The upcoming Enlit2025 will take place next year in Bilbao, Spain, from 18–20 November. Meanwhile, the COP29 Climate and Environment Conference in Baku faced criticism for prioritizing fossil fuels, drawing attention to the urgent need for global energy policies to shift towards sustainability. Notably, COP30 will mark its debut in an Amazonian city, as it is set to take place in Belém, Brazil. Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant and Energy Independence A cornerstone of Turkey's energy strategy, the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, holds significant potential to reduce energy dependence. However, concerns about potential security threats in the region necessitate enhanced safety measures. Moreover, delays in the procurement of critical equipment due to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the European Union have adversely impacted project timelines. While nuclear energy offers significant advantages, the associated risks must be carefully evaluated. Turkey's Natural Gas Supply and the Ukraine War The war in Ukraine has had a direct impact on Turkey's energy relations with Russia. With approximately 40% of Turkey's annual natural gas demand of 56 billion cubic metres supplied by Russia, payment disruptions caused by the conflict have raised energy security concerns. This situation has underscored the necessity of exploring alternative supply routes. Future Outlook The forecasts for 2025 indicate that developments in the energy market will extend beyond production resources, linking directly to the following areas: Energy efficiency Energy storage systems Digitalisation, smart grid technologies, and artificial intelligence applications With its dynamic and innovative structure, Turkey is poised to maintain its position as a strong regional player in energy markets. Increased investments in renewable energy and the acceleration of digital transformation will further strengthen the country's standing on the international energy stage.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YR2gyrfXWndR	2024-11-30T15:27:59-08:00	
China Probes Top Military Official For ‘Serious Violations’	By Qian Lang The ruling Chinese Communist Party has placed Miao Hua, a high-ranking defense official, under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline,' a phrase often used to denote an internal party corruption probe. 'Miao Hua, member of the Central Military Commission and director of the Political Work Department of the Military Commission, is suspected of serious violations of discipline,' defense spokesperson Col. Wu Qian told a news conference in Beijing on Thursday. 'After research by the Party Central Committee, it has been decided to suspend Miao Hua from his duties pending investigation,' Wu said. The announcement came a day after the Financial Times newspaper reported that Admiral Dong Jun, who was named as successor to Li Shangfu in December 2023 after Li was fired for corruption, was himself being investigated for graft. Wu dismissed the report on Thursday as 'pure fabrication and rumor with ulterior motives.' 'China does not accept such reports,' he said, but gave no further details of the investigation into Miao Hua. Current affairs commentator Cai Shenkun said Miao was taken away for investigation on Nov. 9, adding that Dong Jun is his former subordinate. 'Dong Jun was put forward [for defense minister] by Miao Hua, who recommended him to Xi Jinping,' Cai told RFA Mandarin in an interview on Thursday. 'There was a lot of controversy over his appointment, because he had only ever served in the navy, and had never fought on the front line.' He said any corruption on Dong Jun’s part was unlikely to be serious. 'He has never worked in a particularly lucrative department, and naval cadres don’t have that much power anyway,' Cai said. He said if Dong was assisting party investigators with their inquiry, it would like be in the role of Miao’s former subordinate, and that close associates of Miao could fall with him. Refused to meet Austin A former admiral and commander of the Chinese navy, Dong was appointed minister of national defense in December 2023, replacing Li Shangfu who was removed in October 2023 after just seven months in office. The last time Dong appeared in public was on Nov. 21 when he attended the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus in Vientiane, Laos. While holding talks with the defense chiefs of New Zealand, India, and Malaysia, as well as the ASEAN secretary-general, Dong refused a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Beijing blamed it on Washington for undermining China’s 'core interests' by providing weapons to Taiwan. A native of Shandong province from where Xi’s wife Peng Liyuan also hails, Dong –- as well as his predecessor Li Shangfu -– was believed to be appointed by Xi. Yet Dong wasn’t promoted to the Central Military Commission, the top military leadership of the Communist Party, nor was he appointed to the State Council, or the national cabinet. In China, defense ministers are usually members of both those bodies and Dong’s non-appointment had raised questions about his position. Former ministers Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe were expelled from the Communist Party for 'grave discipline violations' such as taking bribes and causing great damage to the images of the party and its senior leaders, according to official statements. Series of sackings The investigation into Miao follows a slew of sackings at the highest levels of the People’s Liberation Army in recent months. Just after Dong was appointed, China expelled nine military officials from its parliament, including three former commanders or vice commanders of the PLA Rocket Force, one former Air Force chief and one Navy commander responsible for the South China Sea. Analysts said they believed that the expulsions were related to the corruption over equipment procurement by the rocket force. But they also link the purges to ongoing dissent within the Chinese military about its readiness to stage an invasion of democratic Taiwan, which has said it has no wish to submit to 'peaceful unification' under Beijing’s territorial claim on the island. An academic who gave only the surname Song for fear of reprisals said Xi’s enthusiasm for an invasion may not be shared by actual military commanders, who fear China may not win such a war. 'Even if the current boss [Xi] wants to attack Taiwan and work with Putin to change the global order for a century to come, real soldiers and generals know whether or not such a war can be won,' Song said. 'The actual military commanders are the ones who know whether their forces are up to the fight, and whether the morale is there.' 'The last two defense ministers, Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu, were removed because they knew it couldn’t be won, and mustn’t be fought,' he said. 'That, I think, is the most important reason.' China froze top-level military talks and other dialogue with the U.S. in 2022 after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the highest-ranking U.S. official in 25 years to visit Taiwan. The island has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, nor formed part of the People’s Republic of China, and its 23 million people have no wish to give up their sovereignty or democratic way of life to be ruled by Beijing, according to recent opinion polls. China, which hasn’t ruled out an invasion to force reunification, was infuriated by the Pelosi visit and canceled military-to-military talks, including contacts between theater-level commanders. President Joe Biden persuaded his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to resume contacts in November 2023, when they met on the sidelines of an APEC summit in Woodside, California.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YWaXoVfxaADz	2024-11-30T15:23:48-08:00	
A Path Towards Unity: Pope Francis Proposes Joint Catholic-Orthod...	Pope Francis has proposed celebrating the 1,700th anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea together with Orthodox leaders, in a personal letter to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. The letter, published by the Vatican on Saturday, was delivered by Cardinal Kurt Koch — who heads the Dicastery for Promoting Christian Unity — during a visit to Istanbul for the patronal feast of the Orthodox Church. 'The now imminent 1700th anniversary of the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea will be another opportunity to bear witness to the growing communion that already exists among all who are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,' Francis wrote in his message dated Nov. 30. Reflecting on six decades of Catholic-Orthodox dialogue while looking ahead to future possibilities for unity, the pope acknowledged the progress made since Vatican II’s Unitatis Redintegratio decree marked the Catholic Church’s official entry into the ecumenical movement 60 years ago. Speaking to EWTN News about this anniversary on Nov. 21, Cardinal Koch emphasized that unity efforts must focus on 'the innermost center of self-revelation in Jesus Christ.' The Swiss cardinal also highlighted what he called an 'ecumenism of blood,' noting that 'Christians are not persecuted because they are Catholic, Lutheran or Anglican, but because they are Christians.' Building peace in a time of war While celebrating the 'renewed fraternity' achieved since Vatican II, Pope Francis noted in his message that full communion, particularly sharing 'the one Eucharistic chalice,' remains an unfulfilled goal. In a pointed observation about contemporary global tensions, the pontiff connected ecumenical efforts to peace-building. 'The fraternity lived and the witness given by Christians will also be a message for our world plagued by war and violence,' he wrote, specifically mentioning Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, and Lebanon. The pope also highlighted the recent participation of Orthodox representatives in October’s Synod on Synodality. The traditional exchange of delegations between Rome and Constantinople occurs twice yearly, with Catholic representatives traveling to Istanbul for St. Andrew’s feast on Nov. 30, and Orthodox delegates visiting Rome for the feast of Saints Peter and Paul on Jun. 29. Cardinal Koch led this year’s Vatican delegation. He was accompanied by Archbishop Flavio Pace, Secretary of the Dicastery, Monsignor Andrea Palmieri, Undersecretary, and Archbishop Marek Solczyński, Apostolic Nuncio to Turkey. The delegation participated in the Divine Liturgy at the Patriarchal Church of St. George, Phanar, and held discussions with the synodal commission charged with relations with the Catholic Church.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YcLHTWZQzrvG	2024-11-30T15:20:51-08:00	
The Birmingham Blade: World’s First Geographically Tailored Urban...	AI design specialists EvoPhase and precision metal fabricators Kwik Fab Ltd have unveiled the world’s first urban wind turbine designed by AI, and tailored to the unique wind conditions of a specific geographic area. The team has called it the Birmingham Blade. The collaboration between EvoPhase and Kwik Fab provides a solution to one of the most pressing issues in the green energy landscape – how to produce small-scale, affordable, generators of clean wind energy. EvoPhase used its AI-driven design process to generate and test designs for their efficiency at wind speeds found in Birmingham, which, at 3.6 metres / second are substantially lower than the 10 metres per second rating for most turbines. 'We needed a turbine that could capture Birmingham’s relatively low wind speeds while managing turbulence caused by surrounding buildings,' explained Leonard Nicusan, Chief Technology Officer of EvoPhase. 'The design also had to be compact and lightweight to suit rooftop installations.' EvoPhase found the optimal design for curved blades which spin around a central point, and confirmed that that it will be up to seven times more efficient than existing designs used in the Birmingham area. Leonard explained why it was necessary to use AI to generate the design: 'Using AI was essential for breaking free from the long-standing biases that have influenced turbine designs for the past century. AI allowed us to explore design possibilities beyond the scope of traditional human experimentation. We were able to generate, test, and refine over 2,000 wind turbine designs in just a few weeks, significantly accelerating our development process and achieving what would have taken years and millions of pounds through conventional methods.' 'Our evolutionary simulations have confirmed the Birmingham Blade is up to seven times more efficient than existing designs in Birmingham’s wind speeds and urban environment. The final design is not just a prototype — it is a predictive solution that is ready for real-world use.' Developed by a research group led by Dr Kit Windows-Yule at the University of Birmingham, EvoPhase’s AI-led evolutionary design process mimics natural selection, this approach allows for simultaneous optimisation of many different parameters, avoiding traditional trade-offs between performance factors. Kwik Fab produced the first iteration of the Birmingham Blade to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing the design. An aluminium version will be sited on a roof space in Birmingham for evaluation and testing, and the final product is expected to be available by late 2025. The EvoPhase – Kwik Fab collaboration provides a rapid design and prototyping service, and the team is now working on another design for the very different conditions in Edinburgh. Paul Jarvis from Kwik Fab is confident that there is sufficient talent and space in Birmingham to deliver quick turnaround from design to prototyping for wind turbines that are geographically tailored to specific local conditions around the rest of the world. He said: 'We can take a complex design, and manufacture and ship a prototype for testing within weeks. We’d like to work with organisations that want to make the most of wind power, a source of sustainable energy that is free, and present in every country.' Since its launch in 2023, EvoPhase has expanded its AI-powered evolutionary design approach to industries beyond wind energy, including the optimisation of equipment for mixing, blending, and storing granular materials in the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical manufacturing sectors. EvoPhase’s collaboration with Kwik Fab demonstrates the broad applicability of their predictive designs. It was made possible in part by the Manchester Prize which named the team as a finalist in the inaugural year of the prize in May 2024. The Manchester Prize is a multi-million-pound challenge prize from the UK’s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology to reward UK-led breakthroughs in artificial intelligence for public good.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YWqHR2pT8OjE	2024-11-30T15:19:49-08:00	
Scientists Reveal Possible Role Of Iron Sulfides In Creating Life...	An international team of scientists recently published a study highlighting the potential role of iron sulfides in the formation of life in early Earth’s terrestrial hot springs. According to the researchers, the sulfides may have catalyzed the reduction of gaseous carbon dioxide into prebiotic organic molecules via nonenzymatic pathways. This work, which appeared in Nature Communications, offers new insights into Earth’s early carbon cycles and prebiotic chemical reactions, underscoring the significance of iron sulfides in supporting the terrestrial hot springs origin of life hypothesis. The study was conducted by Dr. NAN Jingbo from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dr. LUO Shunqin from Japan’s National Institute for Materials Science, Dr. Quoc Phuong Tran from the University of New South Wales, Australia, and other researchers. Iron sulfides, abundant in early Earth’s hydrothermal systems, may have facilitated essential prebiotic chemical reactions, similar to the function of cofactors in modern metabolic systems. Previous studies on iron sulfides and the origin of life have focused primarily on deep-sea alkaline hydrothermal vents, which provide favorable conditions like high temperature, pressure, pH gradients, and hydrogen (H₂) from serpentinization—factors thought to support prebiotic carbon fixation. However, some scientists have proposed terrestrial hot springs as another plausible setting for life’s origins, due to their rich mineral content, diverse chemicals, and abundant sunlight. To explore the role of iron sulfides in terrestrial prebiotic carbon fixation, the research team synthesized a series of nanoscale iron sulfides from mackinawite, including pure iron sulfide and iron sulfides doped with common hot spring elements such as manganese, nickel, titanium, and cobalt. Their experiments showed that these iron sulfides could catalyze the H₂-driven reduction of CO₂ at specific temperatures (80–120 °C) and atmospheric pressure. Gas chromatography was used to quantify the methanol production . The study found that manganese-doped iron sulfides exhibited notably high catalytic activity at 120 °C. This activity was further enhanced by UV-visible (300–720 nm) and UV-enhanced (200–600 nm) light, suggesting that sunlight might play a role in driving this reaction by facilitating chemical processes. Additionally, the introduction of water vapor boosted catalytic activity, further supporting that vapor-laden terrestrial hot springs may have served as key sites for nonenzymatic organic synthesis on early Earth. To further investigate the mechanism behind the H₂-driven CO₂ reduction, the team conducted in-situ analyses using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Results indicated that the reaction likely proceeds via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) pathway, in which CO₂ is first reduced to carbon monoxide (CO), which is subsequently hydrogenated to form methanol. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided additional insights, revealing that manganese doping not only lowered the reaction’s activation energy but also introduced highly efficient electron transfer sites, thereby enhancing reaction efficiency. The redox characteristics of iron sulfides make them functionally analogous to modern metabolic enzymes, providing a chemical foundation for prebiotic carbon fixation. This research underscores the potential of iron sulfides to catalyze prebiotic carbon fixation in early Earth’s terrestrial hot springs, opening new directions for exploring life’s origins and supporting efforts to search for extraterrestrial life.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4Yc7LdlTCiexP	2024-11-30T15:19:06-08:00	
A New Approach To Predicting Malaria Drug Resistance	Researchers at University of California San Diego analyzed the genomes of hundreds of malaria parasites to determine which genetic variants are most likely to confer drug resistance. The findings, published in Science, could help scientists use machine learning to predict antimalarial drug resistance and more effectively prioritize the most promising experimental treatments for further development. The approach could also help predict treatment resistance in other infectious diseases, and even cancer. 'A lot of drug resistance research can only look at one chemical agent at a time, but what we’ve been able to do here is create a roadmap for understanding antimalaria drug resistance across more than a hundred different compounds,' said Elizabeth Winzeler, Ph.D., a professor at UC San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Department of Pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine. 'These results will be useful for other diseases as well, because many of the resistant genes we studied are conserved across different species.' Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease that affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, is a major public health threat in many tropical and subtropical regions. Despite considerable progress toward controlling the disease, malaria remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in Africa, where 95% of malaria deaths occur according to the World Health Organization. First-line drugs have repeatedly failed due to the spread of drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria. 'The need for new, more effective malaria treatments is urgent, but funding for malaria research and drug development is very limited,' said Winzeler, who in addition to her role at UC San Diego is director of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Malaria Drug Accelerator. 'However, the malaria research community is organized and highly collaborative, and our study was able to leverage these strengths to create a resource that will make the process of identifying and prioritizing new malaria treatments significantly easier.' The researchers analyzed the genomes of 724 malaria parasites evolved in the lab to resist one of 118 different antimalarial compounds, including both established treatments and new experimental agents. By looking for patterns in the mutations that were associated with resistance, the researchers were able to identify unique features of these genetic variants, such as their physical location within genes, that could be used to predict which variations are likely to contribute to drug resistance. 'Our ultimate goal is to use machine learning to help us understand which compounds have the most risk of being compromised by resistance so that we can streamline the early drug development process and ultimately get treatments into clinical trials faster,' said Winzeler. 'This study gives us the data needed to train these new tools.' 'The study also uncovers how networks of genes come together to mediate resistance across chemical classes, and provides a road map as we search for resistance-refractory compounds,' adds David Fidock, Ph.D., coauthor and a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. While the findings have significant implications for the development of new antimalarial drugs, the researchers also highlight that their approach could be relevant across different diseases. This is because the genetic machinery driving drug resistance is consistent across different pathogens and even within human cells. For example, many of the resistance-driving mutations identified in the study were from a protein in P. falciparum parasites, called PfMDR1, that can move substances between various parts of the cell, including transporting drugs away from their site of action. PfMDR1 has an exact counterpart in humans, and mutations in the human version are one of the key drivers of treatment resistance in cancer. 'The potential impact of this study is huge and extends well beyond a single disease,' said Winzeler. 'Studying malaria gave us the opportunity to put this resource together, and we hope that these findings will help change the way we study drug resistance as a whole, not just in malaria.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcw1e2xT8e4YWR-gT2ZIAJz	2024-11-30T15:18:02-08:00	
EU-Turkmenistan: New Strategic Partners	Central Asia is increasingly drawing the attention of Europeans, particularly in the aftermath of the energy crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war. Since 2022, European countries have been striving to diversify their energy partners, among which are the nations of Central Asia. One of the key players in this gas-rich region is Turkmenistan. This country has the potential to become a major gas exporter to Europe. This is precisely why interactions between the EU and Turkmenistan are growing, especially in Brussels, the heart of the European Union. The EU frequently meets with Turkmen representatives, including the ambassador, to strengthen cooperation in the energy sector. This Central Asian country has the potential to supply large volumes of gas in all directions in the coming years. The South Yolotan gas field, believed to be the second-largest in the world, boasts reserves of 21 trillion cubic meters. According to Ibrayeva et al. (2018:152), Turkmenistan is the only Central Asian source capable of exporting significant amounts of gas to Europe. Furthermore, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that the region will become a major gas exporter, with total production rising from 143 billion cubic meters in 2009 to 265 billion cubic meters by 2035 (Gas Trade Flows in Europe, 2010; Teleuyev et al., 2017).

Statistical Review of World energy Turkmenistan: A Strategic Energy Partner for the European Union Turkmenistan pursues a multi-sector diplomacy strategy, with the European Union being one of its many partners. In the coming years, this Central Asian nation is poised to supply significant quantities of gas in various directions. The South Yolotan gas field, with estimated reserves of 21 trillion cubic meters, is regarded as the second-largest gas field in the world. Revenue from gas exports constitutes a significant portion of Turkmenistan’s national budget, prompting Ashgabat to seek diverse energy partners while bypassing Russian territories. Since its independence, Turkmenistan has worked to reduce its reliance on Moscow’s energy policies, initially exporting gas to Iran and subsequently to China. The government remains proactive in diversifying its partnerships. Ambassador Palvanov presented NE Global with various examples of the growing cooperation between his country and the EU, starting with trade, connectivity and energy. Speaking about the level of bilateral cooperation this year, the Ambassador wished to highlight the recent visit of Rashid Meredov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan to Brussels and his meetings with EU leaders, as well as a round table with the participation of European businesses and various institutions. These interactions led to the launch of a working group on energy in April and increased interest of European businesses and investments in the Turkmen market. According to Sapar Palvanov: Turkmenistan and Europe have significant potential for cooperation in many key areas, such as sectors from energy to transport and regional security. Turkmenistan is actively working on diversifying its energy policy. That is why Turkmenistan wants to intensify its exchanges with Europe on the topic of green economy (Grandesso, F. 2024, June 4). A Strategic Energy Partner for the EU On May 26, 2008, Andris Piebalgs, then European Commissioner for Energy, signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Turkmenistan in the presence of the country’s then-President, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov. The agreement aimed to strengthen mutual cooperation in the energy sector. 'Turkmenistan can be an attractive destination for EU investments in the development of new oil and gas fields, while the EU offers an appealing consumer market for Turkmen energy products. Today’s agreement clearly demonstrates the mutual benefits of a constructive and mutually beneficial energy relationship,' said Mr. Piebalgs. EU-Turkmenistan: Multilevel Cooperation Under its Central Asia strategy, the EU collaborates with Turkmenistan across various fields, including education, environmental protection, and economic development. The EU’s Central Asia Strategy of June 2019 and the accompanying Council Conclusions provide a comprehensive framework for regional engagement. Bilateral relations between the EU and Turkmenistan are governed by the Interim Trade Agreement, which came into effect in August 2010. The European External Action Service (EEAS) highlights the EU’s intention to deepen its dialogue and cooperation with Turkmenistan. Interparliamentary relations are conducted through EU-Turkmenistan Inter-Parliamentary Meetings, the latest of which (7th) was held in Brussels on November 14, 2024. Neutrality as a Tool for Regional Stability The Status of Permanent Neutrality as a Regional Stabilizer Turkmenistan’s status of permanent neutrality has significantly contributed to its role in promoting regional stability and combating shared threats such as terrorism, drug trafficking, violent extremism, and transnational organized crime. On December 12, 1995, the United Nations General Assembly officially recognized this neutrality through a resolution. This status has enabled Turkmenistan to maintain positive relations with major powers, becoming a cornerstone of its foreign policy. It allows the country to navigate complex international dynamics with a degree of independence. Cooperation in Sustainable Development The Turkmen government, fully aware of the urgency of climate action, is committed to advancing environmental and climate initiatives in collaboration with the European Union. For example, the EU launched the 2024-2028 Political Dialogue and Climate Action initiative for a greener Turkmenistan following a meeting in Ashgabat. In his opening remarks, Borislav Dimitrov, Program Director at the EU Delegation to Turkmenistan, highlighted the Turkmen government’s dedication to climate agendas. He expressed confidence that this mutually beneficial project would foster dialogue and establish a strategic partnership. The European Union is committed to supporting Turkmenistan’s transition to a sustainable, green economy while simultaneously improving its business environment. This commitment is reflected in the EU-Turkmenistan Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters, which has been in effect since August 2010. This agreement lays the groundwork for the anticipated ratification of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) by the European Parliament. Climate Commitments Turkmenistan recognizes the importance of the global climate agenda and has implemented measures at national, regional, and international levels, as noted by the Green Central Asia initiative, launched by Germany in 2020. Internationally, Turkmenistan has ratified key climate-related conventions, supported the Paris Agreement, and committed through its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels under a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario. The Ambassador said that Turkmenistan and the European Union aim to attract advanced European technologies to Turkmenistan to diversify and modernize their economy. During an interview for neglobal.eu, Turkmen Ambassador Sapar Palvanov stressed that Turkmenistan considers the EU Green Deal as an important and commendable initiative that is in line with their commitment to sustainable development and environmental protection. He said that his government recognizes the importance of the transition to green energy and is actively investing in renewable energy projects, especially hydrogen and solar energy (Grandesso, F. (2024, June 4). Interview: EU and Turkmenistan are getting closer. Retrieved from Conclusion In July 2019, the European Union established a full-fledged delegation in Turkmenistan, signaling mutual strategic interest in enhancing relations. Since then, the number of business and official delegations visiting Turkmenistan has grown significantly, reflecting the strengthening ties between the two. In summary, energy relations between the European Union and Turkmenistan have intensified over the past decade. Amid the Russo-European 'energy chess game,' the EU has recognized Turkmenistan as a strategic partner for developing economic relations. Since the Russia-Ukraine war, Turkmenistan has emerged as a potentially decisive player in supplying gas to the EU. BIBLIOGRAPHY Admin. (2024, September 16).

Post-Hasina Bangladesh: Realigning Parties? – OpEd	Configurations of political parties in Bangladesh now carry multiple drifts---they are still inchoate after a long hiatus under an authoritarian stretch of fifteen plus years. But the parties got a new lease of life since a populist revolt ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s (Hasina) repressive regime. Now they are optimistic, alive, and thrusting. The expected contestants are mobilizing resources for the future electoral race. Bangladeshis love politics, even though their success in institution-building fell short of expectations on multiple occasions. Historically, parties 'formed 'with a great ease in colonial and post-colonial Bengal; then bulk of those outfits did not grow for long. Factional and personal rivalries are still so strong in Bengali political culture. Single party domination, personalistic hegemony and the familiar dynastic claims characterized the rise and fall of parties in the past. Among the squirming parties in post-Hasina Bangladesh, I sense an ideological jolt. The Awami League (AL)-centric secular-liberal nationalism, with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Mujib) as the 'Jatir Pita' has lost its pitch since the July-August’s tectonic discontent.A fresh sense of patriotism is, however, yet to come out lucidly ---it is even short of catchy slogans and rhetoric to attract public attention. Anti-Indian and anti-AL postures are the twins in the new mood in Bangladesh, which, of course, have their challengers—both internal and external. India is important to Bangladesh; on the other side, Bangladesh is too crucial for Indian security in the Northeastern states. So, New Delhi might try to reinstate Hasina or her AL allies back in Bangladesh. Nostalgia for the bygone Hasina regime among her surviving beneficiaries is still amongst the AL leftovers, anxious to return to power by hook or crook. The troubled AL will really have its own existential crisis if a band of its leaders, not directly associated with Hasina’s tyrannical regime, would jettison the old guards---the Mujib family, and recycle themselves as the new-fangled AL. Neither the caretaker regime nor the BNP or Jamaat is ruling out such possibilities. AL gained its historic thrust in 1971, which, of course, went adrift after the 1975 violent coup. Much later, it regained vigorously first since the 1996 election victory and then more solidly after the 2008 electoral triumph. Has the one-time mighty AL lost its previous momentum? Hasina’s prolonged autocracy destroyed a large and established party from within itself. Neither Mujib nor Hasina fully trusted the party though both used the party to climb the ladder of power. Mujib stabbed the party on the back by creating the BKSAL single party system, and Hasina preferred to rule by creating an oligarchy of corrupt businesspeople, crony politicians, sycophants, politicians, politicized bureaucrats, police, and henchmen. Will post-Hasina Bangladesh wipe out the Mujib-Hasina brand of politics? In that case, the AL might lose its deceptive Indian patronage. India is the dominant power in the region and the regional actors are careful in dealing with the neighborhood juggernaut. The BNP, now buoyant about its impending return to power, would avoid any direct confrontation with the next-door giant. Even the Jamaat-e-Islami (Jamaat) has sent 'soft' messages to India. None of the leaders of those two major parties aggressively demanded AL’s ban. Rumors floated that the AL leadership would change, and it was willing to connect with the BNP for certain areas of common concerns. The BNP wanted legal actions and punishments for Hasina, and her associates for their tyrannical intransigence, and wanton deaths and destruction in July-August 2024. So far, the BNP did not strongly demand for the AL’s ban, but the leaders of the unbridled civil unrest denounced AL as a fascist outfit that did not deserve a slot in a democracy. A disconnect exists between the majority Bangladeshi parties and the student leaders who steered the furious anti-Hasina crusade---they want a radical change with a 'revolutionary' zeal by upending the entire post-1971 political narrative including its historiography and the sense of identity. They condemn the AL’s exclusionary path and its alleged collusion with New Delhi to turn Bangladesh into a 'vassal state' of India. The timeworn Bangladeshi consensus, so long defined by the AL-delineated post-1971 Chetona that deified late Sheikh Mujib and sustained Sheikh Hasina’s prolonged tyranny is all but shattered since the July-August revolt. The conventional parties, including the BNP, the Jamaat and the lessor parties, would prefer to return to power soon by a majoritarian party rule or by sharing power by a coalition of like-minded parties. The smaller parties, however, want a proportional representation, which ordinarily gives better power-sharing opportunities to the minor parties. The protest leaders and the smaller parties also want the proportional representation (PR) as a tool to fight against the single party hegemony in Bangladesh. But the larger parties, both the BNP and the AL, are reluctant to give up the existing majority-style voting system. If Bangladesh switches to a proportional representation, the world of political parties will change substantially. The student leaders of the July-August upheavals opposed the main parties’ dynastic leadership, which turned them against both the ousted AL and the BNP. Both the parties carry the family names at their highest echelon. The simmering encounter between the BNP and the protest leaders was clear recently when the BNP turned down the student leaders’ demand for the Bangladesh president’s immediate resignation. Senior BNP leaders are trying to establish the party’s relevance to post-Hasina Bangladesh politics. BNP’s front runners are active in the media. Out of her contrived jail sentence, Begum Khaleda Zia (Khaleda) is looking for a better health care abroad and Tarek Zia, the BNP’s president-in-charge is more visible on social media. More prospective candidates are lobbying for the BNP tickets in the next election, for which no date came out, so far. Will the Samannayyakari (coordinating) student leaders float a party, as the rumor goes on? Neither the student campaigners nor Dr. Mohammad Yunus’s cabinet, so far, produced a clear political vision about their future. Spectacular political changes resulted from the student-led protests in the bygone. I remember the massive events that goaded East Pakistan Chief Minister Abu Hossain Sarker’s government to resign in 1956; it was the AL leader Ataur Rahman Khan who headed the succeeding government. Now, the caretaker authority is running the administration until the next election. There was a time when the digits of '1971' carried the 'short-handed' message for pruning Jamaat out of politics, as I read this in the past. Now, Jamaat’s greatest achievement is that the party, as a movement, could survive undercover, when necessary, and still explode as a big blow to its political adversaries. Jamaat’s student front, the Shibir has a place in the student Samannya committee that has worked with Dr. Yunus. BNP has maintained its unity during its trying times. And now, it is the largest party in Bangladesh with bright electoral prospects ahead. No longer, dependent on the BNP’s mercy, Jamaat has moved from the periphery to the center of Bangladesh politics. Islamic politics is not the monopoly of Jamaat, although it is the largest party upholding political Islam in Bangladesh. Few can predict now if Jamaat will go to the poll alone or as a coalition of the Islamic parties. Smaller parties also hope for its share in the Bangladeshi arena of politics. Evolving configuration of the BNP and Jamaat will substantively impact the future Bangladeshi party politics. What happened earlier this year ripped through the Bangladeshi psyche while people feel empowered by the populist stump that ejected the Hasina rule. That colossal uprising worked like a referendum against Hasina’s unbending authoritarianism and crimes against humanity. But the main discourse of the revolt is yet to appear as a coherent institutional expression. Which of the established parties would embrace the July-August protest’s counter-narrative? The perceived relief is that the AL’s archaic single party ascendency is not on its brutal rampage in Bangladesh now. And the rhetorical temperature against the Jamaat and the old fearmongering about Islamic terrorism have significantly subsided. Bangladeshis, however, still acknowledge that parties are the essential vehicles for the parliamentary democracy that they cherish so much. The lingering polarization, periodic lawlessness, disagreements and discontent over constitutional and institutional reforms and the absence of a roadmap for the next election are creating a chasm between the parties and the interim regime. Fear of internal instability and external interference on different pretexts wrestles a necessary consensus before the return of an elected and stable governance.

VIT Bhopal University Hosts An international Conference On Humani...	A two-day international conference on 'Humanities and Beyond Humanities: A Critical Approach to Language, Literature, Media, and Management Studies (ICHBH - 2024)' was organized by the School of Advanced Sciences and Languages (SASL), English Division, VIT Bhopal University, M.P, India, in collaboration with AAB College, Prishtina, Republic of Kosova, academic partner Emerald Publishing, media partner Conference Alert. The Conference took place on the main campus of VIT Bhopal University on 21-22 November 2024. This intellectually inspiring event encompassed speeches and statements by University Professors coming from South America and other regions of India. A highlight of keynote speeches, discussions follow: Prof. Benjamin Fernandez Bogado, a journalist and university Professor, Republic of Paraguay, addressed the growing concern of new technologies and how the world has become smaller and isolated, challenges faced by people along with the need of comprehending the sense of humanism and even more by excelling, going beyond humanities to live in a society. In his speech, Prof. Benjamin Fernandez Bogado, stated: 'The world has become even smaller, and people are more isolated in their individualism, and it must restore a reinvention of socialization, which is the only human experience that is new and distinctive from other living species. Fascinated by technology, we have lost closeness and social proximity. We must recover interpersonal communication and face-to-face dialogue, for the social good and for the very human dimension of these times.' According to Fernandez Bogado, 'Our life, in many cases reduced to algorithms capable of recognizing our tastes and tendencies, has served well to place commercial products and some politicians with greater success, in our daily lives. We have become spies of ourselves, as Byung-Chul Han, a South Korean-born philosopher and cultural theorist living in Germany, has defined very well. We are feeding a monster that, with artificial intelligence, is nothing other than the accumulation of data and information, but that has no feeling, does not project itself onto others, but rather strengthens the individual experience that does not require anyone else to develop this knowledge. An artificial intelligence that does not need anyone else to understand and to project itself. This indeed is a mistake.' Fernandez Bogado noted that, 'As never before, the failure of commercial globalization must lead us to reinvent a world with deeply ingrained values where we recognize ourselves in other people. Let us achieve what Hannah Arendt, a German American historian and philosopher, has stated: otherness. Putting ourselves in the dimension of the other in order to be the other. The new globalization cannot be reduced to the trade of products, it must be the human conquest in its projected dimension associated with the other.' In the keynote session, Prof. Peter M. Tase, Chief Guest and Keynote speaker, from National University of the East (Universidad Nacional del Este), Ciudad del Este, Republic of Paraguay, addressed the challenges faced by humanism and social sciences, asserting that such international conferences revitalize research and promote understanding of these fields. He attended in present this conference. Dr. Amitabh Kodwani, IIM Indore, emphasized the importance of integrating humanities and engineering. He explained that while both embrace different approaches to problem-solving, their convergence fosters new perspectives and better ways of living. Dr. Sumit Narula, Emerald Publishing House, highlighted the growing significance of digital humanities, emphasizing its bright future. He stressed the need for humanities professionals to acquire coding knowledge, given the changing dynamics of education. Prof. K.M. Pandey, BHU, Varanasi, delved into the philosophical and practical aspects of life, underscoring the importance of self-inquiry and balance. Prof. Dr. Robert H. Bishop, Vice Chancellor for Engineering, The Texas A&M University System and Dean of Engineering (Texas A&M University), USA, was the Guest of Honor who joined (Online). Other keynote speakers were Dr. Jeton Kelmendi, Convener of the Conference from AAB College, Prishtina, he is also Academic Professor, AAB College, Pristina, Kosovo, (joined Online); Venera Kabashi – Llunji (Vice Rector for International Affairs and Cooperation and Assistant Professor at AAB College, Prishtina, Kosova).

Engaging North Korea: Prospects And Challenges Of Another Trump-K...	The potential for President-elect Donald Trump to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un presents a unique opportunity to tackle two critical global issues: North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its expanding military alliance with Russia, which has significant implications for both the Ukraine conflict and stability in Northeast Asia. This essay examines the challenges and prospects of such a meeting, juxtaposing Trump's direct engagement approach with President Biden's multilateral strategy. It also considers the roles of South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia in shaping outcomes, arguing that Trump’s use of 'carrot and stick' diplomacy must be carefully balanced to achieve meaningful progress. Success hinges on harmonizing incentives with firm deterrence while addressing North Korea’s destabilizing actions, particularly its military support for Russia. The results of this engagement could reshape U.S.-North Korean relations and influence broader regional security dynamics in 2024 and beyond. Background: U.S.- North Korea Relations and Current Challenges Historical Context The U.S. relationship with North Korea has fluctuated between periods of heightened tension and cautious diplomacy. Trump's historic summits with Kim Jong-un in 2018 and 2019 aimed to establish trust and negotiate denuclearization. However, the absence of substantive agreements and North Korea’s continued weapons development highlighted the limitations of these discussions. North Korea’s Strategic Shift North Korea has increasingly aligned itself with Russia, supplying military aid—such as ammunition and troops—to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. This partnership enhances Pyongyang’s access to resources and advanced technology, undermining international sanctions. North Korea's military activities, including missile launches and advancements in satellite technology, further threaten regional stability. The Significance of Trump Engagement Trump’s diplomacy offers a chance to reframe negotiations. His readiness to directly engage with adversaries distinguishes him from Biden’s focus on building multilateral alliances and applying pressure. However, critics warn that Trump’s approach risks legitimizing Kim’s regime without securing meaningful concessions. The Problem: Risks and Barriers to Progress North Korea’s Role in Global Conflicts North Korea’s military partnership with Russia complicates diplomatic efforts. By providing ammunition and personnel, Pyongyang not only supports Russia’s campaign in Ukraine but also strengthens its military-industrial complex. This dual advantage empowers North Korea to resist international pressure while advancing its nuclear ambitions. The Deadlock on Denuclearization Achieving denuclearization remains a significant challenge. North Korea views its nuclear program as essential to the survival of its regime and as a means to counter perceived U.S. aggression. Previous negotiations have stalled due to Pyongyang's refusal to dismantle its substantial arsenal without first obtaining sanctions relief. Regional Concerns and Mistrust U.S. allies in the region, particularly South Korea and Japan, worry that unilateral U.S.-North Korea discussions may overlook their security priorities. Both nations emphasize the necessity of a coordinated approach that bolsters deterrence and maintains regional stability. Opportunities: The Potential of a Trump-Kim Meeting Reopening Dialogue A meeting between Trump and Kim could revitalize stalled negotiations, establishing a platform for discussions on denuclearization and regional security. Trump's strategy of direct engagement may ease tensions and create opportunities for gradual progress. Economic Incentives Trump's 'carrot and stick' approach could provide North Korea with tangible incentives, such as partial sanctions relief or economic aid, in exchange for verified steps towards disarmament. These measures may address Pyongyang’s urgent economic issues and promote goodwill. Weakening the North Korea-Russia Alliance By addressing North Korea’s military support for Russia, Trump could undermine this partnership, reducing Pyongyang’s reliance on Moscow and limiting its access to essential resources. Emphasizing the risks associated with continued isolation might spur North Korea to reassess its strategic alliances. Stakeholder Perspectives South Korea South Korea advocates for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and condemns North Korea’s provocations. Seoul highlights the importance of U.S. commitments to its defence and insists that any agreements with Pyongyang must preserve regional stability. Japan Japan's primary concern is North Korea’s missile capabilities, which pose a direct threat to its security. Tokyo supports a firm stance on denuclearization and insists that any concessions be contingent upon concrete actions from Pyongyang. China China's relationship with North Korea is complex, as it balances economic support with a desire to prevent regional instability. While Beijing opposes North Korea’s military provocations, it also views Pyongyang as a buffer against U.S. influence in Asia. Russia Russia benefits from its alliance with North Korea, gaining critical military support while providing Pyongyang with food and resources. Moscow’s role complicates efforts to isolate North Korea and underscores the interconnectedness of global conflicts. Recommendations for Trump Strategy Confront Military Ties with Russia Trump should address North Korea’s arms transfers to Russia, highlighting the global repercussions of these actions. By offering targeted incentives, such as food or economic relief, he could potentially weaken the Pyongyang-Moscow partnership. Clear Incentives and Penalties A balanced approach that combines economic incentives with enforceable penalties for non-compliance is crucial. Clear benchmarks for progress, such as a freeze on missile tests should guide negotiations. Reinforce Regional Alliances Involving South Korea and Japan in the negotiation process will ensure regional support and strengthen collective security. Maintaining transparency and coordination with allies is essential for building trust and deterring North Korean aggression. Engage Multilateral Stakeholders Involving China and Russia in discussions could help reduce their support for North Korea and encourage compliance with international norms. Multilateral forums provide a platform to address the broader implications of North Korea’s actions. Conclusion Trump’s proposed meeting with Kim Jong-un presents a unique opportunity to tackle some of the most urgent security challenges for 2024. By utilizing his personal diplomacy style and adopting a balanced 'carrot and stick' approach, Trump can work towards reducing tensions, promoting denuclearization, and undermining North Korea’s destabilizing alliance with Russia. Success will depend on careful coordination with regional allies, strategic engagement with China and Russia, and a commitment to actionable outcomes. The stakes of this engagement are significant, but with a clear strategy, it could represent a pivotal moment in U.S.-North Korea relations and overall regional security.

Growing Hindu-Muslim Tension In Bangladesh Widens Rift With India...	Since the issues involved have domestic implications, domestic politics in the two countries tend to vitiate the atmosphere and exacerbate the tension. Relations between Bangladesh and India, which nosedived following the ouster of the Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August, appears set to deteriorate further. A sharpening of Muslim-Hindu conflict in Chittagong, the second most important part of Bangladesh after capital Dhaka, has exacerbated tension with India further. The Hindu-Muslim conflict, which is at the root of the tension now, is embedded in the domestic politics of both Bangladesh and India. That has its own dynamics, exacerbating tension and making it doubly difficult to solve. The port city and trading centre of Chittagong has been a hotbed of ethnic, linguistic and religious conflict for decades. Earlier, the fight was between Bengali Muslims and the indigenous Buddhist Chakma tribe in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). Now it is a fight between the Bengali Muslim majority (87%) and the Bengali Hindus (11%) in the whole of Chittagong. While Muslims are seen by Hindus as being backed by the Bangladeshi State, the Hindus are perceived by the Muslims to be backed by Bangladesh's neighbour and regional power, India, where an aggressive Hindu nationalism is ruling the roost. During the violent mass movement of July-August this year which ousted Sheikh Hasina, agitators attacked numerous Hindu properties as Hindus were seen as Hasina's support base. These attacks instilled mortal fear among the Hindus whose population had already dwindled from about 30% in 1947 to about 8% due to continuous State-backed Islamic intolerance over the years. However, the communal situation in Bangladesh as a whole calmed down in November and this year's Durga festival of the Hindus went off without any incident. But trouble was brewing in Chittagong, which has traditionally been a bastion of Islamic radicalism and also Hindu assertion, according to Afsan Chowdhury, a Bangladeshi social and political commentator. The headquarters of the Hefazat-e-Islam (Protection of Islam) with its large network of Madrasahs, are in Chittagong. The Hefazat stands for Sharia in Bangladesh. Because of its control of the Madrassahs it has been wooed by Hasina's Awami League as well as Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Hefazat for example made Hasina cut off Hindu authors from Bangladeshi school text books. Islamists of Chittagong have been looking at the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) as a proselytizing organization with a strong base in India and Western countries. In the popular imagination, ISKCON is seen as an arm of India. The Hefazat and the Jamaat-e-Islami have even called for a ban on it. The Bangladesh High Court has refused to ban the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). On their part, militant Hindus had recently organized massive demonstrations and threatened to march to Dhaka if the Interim Government failed to protect the community from Islamists and anti-Hasina forces. The recent trouble was sparked off when the Hindu organization Sammilito Sanatan Jagaran Jote held a demonstration in which its flag was seen flying above the Bangladeshi national flag. For this, monk Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari of the Sammilito Sanatan Jagaran Jote was arrest amidst a skirmish between his followers and the police. In the clash, Assistant Public Prosecutor Sayful Islam Alif was killed. Sayful is said to be a Jammat-i-Islami man who had sought a ban on ISKCON. However, ISKCON made it clear at a press conference that monk Chinmoy had been expelled from ISKCON earlier for misbehaving with a child. Therefore, the organisation would not shoulder any responsibility over his statements. ISKCON Bangladesh's general secretary Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari, in a written statement, said that Leelaraj Gour Das, head of Prabartak Sri Krishna Mandir, Gaurang Das, and Chinmoy Krishna Das, head of Sri Sri Pundarik Dham in Chattogram, were expelled from ISKCON Bangladesh for breaching discipline of the organisation in July. That's why any actions of these individuals do not represent ISKCON Bangladesh, the statement said. However, the allegations stuck to ISKCON and created waves in India. Sayful Islam Alif's funeral was attended by leaders of the students' movement which ousted Sheikh Hasina in August. Hasnat Abdullah, convener of the Students Against Discrimination (SAD), demanded the arrest of ISKCON persons allegedly involved in the killing of the lawyer within the next 24 hours. Hasnat Abdulla also demanded a ban on ISKCON, saying: 'There will be co-existence of all religions in our country, and we will work to protect the rights of all. But if an extremist organisation is run in the name of religion, they will not be given space here. My brother Sayful has been murdered brutally. ISKCON must be banned as a terrorist organisation.' Hasnat Abdullah alleged that ISKCON was in favour of the fallen Hasina regime. 'We did not forget how the ISKCON created anarchy in Bangladesh, in favour of dictator Awami League as per the prescription of India. The people of Bangladesh will resist whatever conspiracies are hatched from India. We want to say categorically that Awami League will never be rehabilitated in Bangladesh,' he thundered. As per media reports, Chinmoy is a radical leader too. Speaking at a mass rally in Chittagong's Laldighi ground he had said: 'If anyone wants to evict us (the Hindus) from this country and live in peace, it will become Afghanistan or Syria. There will be no democratic force. Bangladesh will become a sanctuary of communalism.' The arrest of Chinmoy produced reverberations in New Delhi. The Indian External Affairs Ministry (MEA) expressed 'deep concern'. In a statement it said: 'This incident follows multiple attacks on Hindus and other minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh'. The MEA called upon the interim government of Bangladesh to 'ensure safety and security of Hindus and all minorities.' New Delhi is annoyed by regular declarations from the leaders of the Interim government, including Chief Advisor Dr.Muhammad Yunus, that Hasina would be brought back from refuge in India, to face trial. However, till date, Dhaka has not formally asked for her extradition, perhaps not to put New Delhi in a fix. Responding to New Delhi's remarks, Dhaka said Delhi's statement was 'contrary to facts.' A statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh said that India had remarked 'on a matter concerning the internal affairs of Bangladesh', and said, 'such unfounded statements not only misrepresent facts but also stand contrary to the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two neighbouring countries'. The Bangladesh government also described the killing of advocate Sayful Alif as 'brutal'. With the Indian media being spiteful about the peoples' movement against Hasina, linking it to Islamic extremism and Pakistan's machinations, and the Bangladeshi media harping on alleged Indian conspiracies to dominate Bangladesh, relations between the two countries have little or no chance of improving in the foreseeable future. However, right thinking Bangladeshi intellectuals rue the turn of events and see the disadvantages of an India-Bangladesh conflict to both countries. They are aware of the geographical location of Bangladesh which is surrounded on three sides by India and on one side by the Bay of Bengal. They also known that Bangladesh is heavily dependent on trade with India. It depends on India for river waters too. India too needs Bangladesh's cooperation to prevent Islamic militants and the North Eastern tribal militants from securing hideouts in Bangladesh to plan attacks on India. Friendship with Bangladesh is also needed to minimize the threat from China which is expanding its footprint in South Asia. Since the issues are deep and formal relations are cold, informal contacts (track-two diplomacy) could help heal the deep wounds inflicted by the cataclysmic events of this year and set the stage for a formal rapprochement. But since domestic political interests influence foreign relations, communal politics in Bangladesh and India will continue to vitiate bilateral relations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd4-Qflw7hjL-OUGFZEdowZ	2024-11-29T21:35:14-08:00

Hezbollah Proclaims Tenuous Cease-Fire With Israel ‘Divine Victor...	(RFE/RL) — The leader of Hezbollah has claimed that its cease-fire deal with Israel is a 'divine victory' for the Lebanese political party and militant group. In his first address since the cease-fire took effect on November 27, Naim Qassem said on November 29 that the Iran-backed group had 'won because we prevented the enemy from destroying Hezbollah' and weakening the Lebanese 'resistance.' Hezbollah, which controls much of southern Lebanon and has representatives in parliament, is designated in its entirety by the U.S. as a terrorist organization but the EU has blacklisted only its military wing. The cease-fire ended nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel ramped up the pressure by launching a ground offensive in southern Lebanon in October and carrying out massive aerial bombardments of Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut and elsewhere. The truce ends the presence of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Israel, too, must withdraw its ground forces from Lebanon within 60 days of the deal going into force. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on November 26 warned Hezbollah that Israel would take action if it suspected that Hezbollah had violated the agreement. On November 29, hours before Qassem made his speech, Israel said it had struck a Hezbollah rocket launcher in southern Lebanon after detecting militant activity. The United States and France are overseeing the implementation of the truce, which includes provisions for thousands of Lebanese soldiers moving into southern Lebanon to work with UN peacekeepers and keep Hezbollah away from the Israeli border. Hezbollah had been launching rockets at northern Israel since the start of the Gaza war in October 2023. It said it would stop its attacks only after Israel ended its war in Gaza. Over the past 14 months, Israel killed nearly the entirety of Hezbollah's leadership, including Qassem's predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, and decimated the group's military arsenal. Israel has vowed to ensure Iran cannot continue to fund and arm the group, and has warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against facilitating Iranian aid for Hezbollah.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYXku3DGK1llN	2024-11-29T21:30:23-08:00	
China Tests Bilateral Waters With US Prisoner Exchange	By Qian Lang Three Americans who Washington says were wrongfully imprisoned in China have landed back on U.S. soil as part of a rare prisoner swap with Beijing, in a move analysts said could signal China’s willingness to do further deals with the incoming Trump administration. Mark Swidan, of Houston, Texas, Kai Li, of Long Island, New York, and John Leung, a permanent resident of Hong Kong, have been reunited with their families for the first time in years in time for Thanksgiving, Nov. 28 this year, ABC News reported. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he spoke to Li, Leung and Swidan while they were en route back home. 'I told them how glad I was that they were in good health and that they’ll soon be reunited with their loved ones,' Blinken said via his X account. While the State Department didn’t reveal more details about the deal, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning confirmed that three Chinese citizens had also been returned. 'Three Chinese citizens who were wrongly detained by the United States have returned to their motherland safely,' Mao told a regular news conference in Beijing on Thursday. 'China has always firmly opposed the U.S.’s suppression and persecution of Chinese citizens for political purposes and will, as always, take necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens,' she said. Accused of spying Reports named one of the Chinese nationals as Xu Yanjun, an official in the Chinese Ministry of State Security who became the first Chinese spy to be extradited to the United States following his arrest in Belgium in 2018. A jury found Xu guilty in 2021 of attempting to steal designs for an engine fan from Ohio-based GE Aviation. Department of Justice officials said it was part of an organized effort by Beijing to 'modernize' its own economy by stealing U.S. technology. Another was identified as Ji Chaojun, a former graduate student was sentenced in Chicago to eight years in prison for spying for China in January 2023, according to multiple media reports. Mao declined to identify the returned Chinese nationals, but said a 'fugitive' from Chinese justice had also been returned to the custody of the Chinese authorities, warning that the ruling Communist Party would 'continue to pursue fugitives ... to the end.' Sending a signal? Yang Haiying, a professor at Japan’s Shizuoka University, said such prisoner exchanges are rare for China, and could be intended to send a signal to the incoming Trump administration. 'Maybe China is trying to test Trump, whether he will want to do various kinds of deals with China in future,' Yang said, describing the swap as a form of 'hostage trading.' If that works, then maybe China and the United States can make bigger deals in future, including trade deals, political deals, and agreements on international issues like the South China Sea,' he said. 'I think they are sending that signal.' Current affairs commentator Guo Min said the swap was undoubtedly in Beijing’s interest at this time. 'China regards some of its people as so-called patriots for propaganda purposes, saying that the Chinese government has made great efforts to protect patriots and successfully returned them to China,' Guo said. 'Everything the Chinese government does is based on political considerations,' he said. The U.S. State Department on Wednesday downgraded its travel advisoryfor China from Level 3 (reconsider travel) to Level 2 (exercise extreme caution). The advisory now warns U.S. citizens of the possibility of 'arbitrary enforcement of local laws' in mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong, with the possibility of exit bans in mainland China.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYff6SFsl4cye	2024-11-29T21:21:15-08:00	
Jemaah Islamiyah’s Disbandment Appears Irreversible – And Real – ...	By Zachary Abuza At an event orchestrated by Indonesia’s counter-terrorism agency (BNPT) in late June, Abu Rusydan and 15 other senior Jemaah Islamiyah members read out a statement announcing that their militant group was disbanding. Many people, including victims of Jemaah Islamiyah’s past terrorist acts – foremost among them, the 2002 Bali bombings – reacted with suspicion. Abu Rusydan, Para Wijayanto, and JI military chief Khoirul Anam are all currently imprisoned, leading some to speculate whether this decision was coerced or done in the hopes of having their sentences reduced. Yet, evidence gathered in the months that followed suggests this decision was both real and irreversible. There are six reasons for this. First, although institutionally resilient, Jemaah Islamiyah had been militarily dormant since 2011 and weakened by arrests, including the December 2020 takedown of Zulkarnaen (also known as Aris Sumarsono), their head of military operations. His arrest decimated what was left of JI’s training apparatus. The government legally banned JI in 2008, but gave the group space to involve itself in education, charitable work, businesses and other activities, as long as it refrained from violence. Following Para Wijayanto’s 2019 arrest, attitudes towards Jemaah Islamiyah hardened among Indonesian security forces. They saw a well-resourced JI poised to resume violence after a tactical lull. That year, only 8% of total terrorism arrests were of JI members. As many JI suspects were arrested in 2021 and 2022 as were suspected members of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah. In 2023, suspected JI members accounted for 53% of terrorism arrests, including several next generation leaders, Wijayanto’s son amongst them. There was a political rationale as well. There are over 1,000 sharia codes throughout the country. Violence has achieved nothing towards implementing Islamic law, compared to democratic politics. Second, this was a deliberative process that was years in the making. Wijayanto approached Densus 88 following his 2019 arrest and requested a meeting with Abu Rusydan, a former emir of the group who was at large, but the police wouldn’t commit to not arresting him. Wijayanto had already penned a 500-page tract explaining his 42 reasons for disbanding the group. Even after Rusydan’s arrest in 2021, it still took nearly three years for the police to organize the meeting. But this past March, both men concluded that violent jihad was unnecessary because Muslims in Indonesia were not under attack, and the state itself was not holding back the establishment of the sharia. This built on a 2016 ruling by JI’s Fatwah Council that the national ideology, Pancasila, was not anti-Islamic in nature. The two leaders then requested a meeting with Khoirul Anam, who was also incarcerated, and Bambang Sukirno, a party elder and disciple of JI’s founder, Abdullah Sungkar. A video of that May meeting, with their decision to disband based on Rusydan’s 'Conclusion 642' theory, was then shared by Sukirno, who was not incarcerated, with other senior JI members. In a separate video, Koirul Anam announced that JI would immediately end 'tanzim siri' (clandestine organization) and 'tanzim askary' (military organization). That resulted in a gathering of the JI leadership in Solo, on June 29, with party elders and representatives of each of the 42 madrassas controlled by JI. The official disbandment announcement went forward the following day. Third, while deliberations unfolded, Abu Fatih started to build up trust by turning in weapons and explosive stocks, as a show of good faith. Fatih admitted that not all weapons had been turned in or located – unsurprising given the geographic spread of the organization and its cellular structure. A spokesman for Densus 88 acknowledged that while the process was still ongoing, 'The guns and explosives that they kept, including other materials that still reflect the strength of JI, were handed over.' Fourth, as of mid-November, many of the 5,500-6,000 members had attended one of the 42 ceremonies, where they pledged their allegiance to the 'Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia.' The size of the ceremonies has varied depending on the region, focusing on JI’s strongholds. The Java ceremonies have been the largest: Bekasi (400), Kudus (280), Semarang (230), Banyumas Raya (300), Karesidenan Pekalongan (152), Madiun (150), and in Depok. These ceremonies have been held across the archipelago, including in Central and South Sulawesi, Balikpapan, Palembang, Riau, the Malukus, and elsewhere in Sumatra. Almost all of these ceremonies have been attended by several of the 16 senior JI leaders, including Sukirino, Wijayanto, Abu Fatih, Abu Rusydan, Khoirul Anam, Zarkasih, Ustad Hasan Partono, and witnessed by Ustad Imtihan Syafi’i, the former chairman of the JI Fatwa Council and one of JI’s top Islamic law scholars. While not everyone is on board, there’s hope that more will be brought in as the decision and its justifications are disseminated more broadly. Fifth, there has been some initial progress in instituting curriculum reform at JI’s 42 madrassas and boarding schools. This will be the hardest piece, and will involve the constant supervision of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Religion, as well as the BNPT and Densus 88. The rejection of takfiri ideology and an acceptance of Islamic pluralism will be key to this. As important as curriculum reform, will be the commitment of the school leadership and the teachers, because the real radicalization and recruitment took place in after-school sessions. To date, the government has reported no pushback in their talks with the school leaders about curriculum reform. Sixth, Wijayanto opened up a channel to JI members still in Syria, who joined Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a militant group tied to al-Qaeda, to both share the announcement and to work with Densus 88 to bring them home. While not taking away from these positive developments there are reasons for continued concern. While JI leaders have apologized to victims and acknowledged that they went down the wrong path, the denouncement of violence has not been robust enough. One thing that is noticeable from the videos and photographs of the 42 ceremonies is just how old the members are. As such, many younger militants who are committed to using violence to achieve their political aims are likely to defect to other groups. With JAD decimated and leaderless, security forces have recently been focusing on Negara Islam Indonesia (NII), including making two more arrests in November 2024. We also don’t know the stance of prominent JI members who’ve recently been arrested or are currently on trial, including Farid Okbah, Fitria Sanjaya, Anung Al-Hamat, and Ahmad Zain An-Naja. But for now, the onus is on the state to better fund their disengagement programs and work with NGOs and other state actors to secure livelihoods. Thousands of former JI members have pledged allegiance to the Republic of Indonesia, and its 'unity in diversity.' Now, the question is, can the state deliver?

Israel Criticized For ‘Provocative Actions’ In Lebanon Despite Ce...	By Najia Houssari Israel was criticized on Friday for provocative actions in Lebanon, despite the ceasefire agreement currently in force. The Israeli military said Lebanese residents were prohibited from moving south to a line of villages and their surroundings until further notice. The army continued its operations in the border area it had advanced into and where it is still present, continuing actions which included uprooting olive trees, damaging structures, and even firing on mourners at a funeral. On the third day of the ceasefire, security reports — primarily from the Iran-backed Hezbollah — highlighted what were described as 'provocative Israeli violations.' The US general tasked with leading the ceasefire monitoring committee and its members began meetings in Beirut on Friday with the commander of the Lebanese Armed Forces Gen. Joseph Aoun to discuss the implementation of the agreement. Meanwhile, Al-Manar TV reported that Israeli forces 'advanced into the town square of Markaba … and began bulldozing operations and blocking roads.' The Israeli army also opened fire on residents in Khiam, who said that they had obtained permission from the Lebanese military, in coordination with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, to enter the town for a funeral. Footage captured by the mourners, who numbered no more than five or six, showed two of them injured in their legs by Israeli gunfire. The mourners said that they left a woman’s body on the ground after an artillery shell struck nearby. The incident forced them to flee. They also reported that the Israeli army seized the vehicles they had traveled in. Israelis fired machine guns toward Aitaroun and demolished a playground in Kfarkela. The army claimed on Thursday that the areas it had moved into in southern Lebanon were not included in the ceasefire agreement. The deal, which was approved by both Lebanon and Israel on Tuesday, went into effect on Wednesday morning. The Israeli army called on the Lebanese 'not to cross into a line of towns specified by name to enter the border area, extending from Shebaa through Habbariyeh, Arnoun, Yohmor, Qantara, Shaqra, Baraashit, Yater, and Mansouri,' as anyone crossing these towns would endanger themselves. The Israeli army said that it had 60 days to accomplish a 'complete withdrawal from these areas' under the agreement. The Israeli army has advanced into settlements extending 3 km from the border, an area which includes about 20 villages and Bint Jbeil. Israeli forces have also prohibited Lebanese residents in the restricted area from moving around between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m. Eyewitnesses spoke of attacks on 'olive groves in Kfarkela, where bulldozers are uprooting olive trees near the Al-Abbara area.' Meanwhile, four Israeli tanks ventured into the western neighborhood of the town of Khiam. An artillery shell fell on the town and the Israeli army conducted occasional sweeping operations with machine guns. Israeli artillery shelling also targeted the outskirts of the towns of Markaba and Tallousa in the Marjayoun district while Israeli drones continued to fly over the western and central sectors. The Lebanese army, which continues to deploy in the areas south of the Litani River and away from the Israeli incursion, blocked the roads leading to the restricted area. Samir Geagea, head of the Lebanese Forces Party, said that 'Hezbollah’s war in support of Gaza destroyed both Gaza and Lebanon,' and criticized the 'unity of battlefields that Hezbollah called for.' He was speaking after a meeting held by the Lebanese Forces’ parliamentary bloc and executive body. Geagea added: 'Hezbollah usurped the Lebanese people by starting this war and took Lebanon to war while the majority of the people were against it. 'Hezbollah committed a great crime against the Lebanese people. We could have avoided the martyrdom of 4,000 people and all the displacement and destruction. '(But) despite all these disasters, Hezbollah MPs are still claiming victory, which is a strange and completely unrealistic logic.' Geagea said that the ceasefire approved by Hezbollah 'is the biggest proof of the illegitimacy of the party’s weapons,' and called on Hezbollah to 'meet with the army command and develop a plan to dismantle its military presence north of the Litani River. Meanwhile, the municipality of Mays Al-Jabal has warned residents returning to their town of the presence of 'landmines, explosives and unexploded shells.' It confirmed that it 'is following up with the Lebanese army and relevant authorities to facilitate the safe return of people on time.' The municipality warned that 'entering the town at present is dangerous as the enemy is firing and launching artillery shells into the town’s neighborhoods and streets to target any civilian movement in the area.' It added: 'Due to the presence of landmines, explosives, and unexploded shells in homes and neighborhoods, and given that some houses are still rigged with explosives and might detonate at any moment, as well as the town’s streets being blocked with rubble and obstacles, we urge you and rely on your awareness to refrain from heading to our town at this time, and await further instructions.' The Israeli army published a summary and data on Friday about the military operations carried out in the last two months against Hezbollah on the northern front. It added that 'orders preventing the return of residents to open areas north of Western Galilee and Upper Galilee remain in effect.' The Israeli army claimed that more than 12,500 targets were attacked, including more than 1,600 military headquarters and more than 1,000 ammunition depots. The Israeli operations included 'more than 14,000 flight hours for fighter jets and about 11,000 targets for attacks.' The army’s statement claimed that 'more than 1,500 offensive infrastructures, about 160 military headquarters, and about 150 ammunition depots were destroyed in the operation against the Radwan Force. 'About 2,500 high-ranking fighters were eliminated, causing significant damage to Hezbollah’s force.' The Israeli army added that it estimated that Hezbollah had less than 30 percent of the drones it had possessed on the eve of the conflict.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYVpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-29T21:10:24-08:00	
Iran Refutes Allegation Of Violating Chemical Weapons Convention	Iran’s UN mission dismissed the accusation that Tehran has violated the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) by enhancing its chemical weapons capabilities. In a post on its X account on Thursday night, the permanent mission of Iran to the United Nations rejected the accusation that Tehran has contravened the Chemical Weapons Convention. 'A victim of Western-donated chemical weapons employed by the Saddam regime, Iran stands as a responsible member of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),' the mission said. 'Over the past several decades, not a single instance of Iranian violation has been recorded,' it added. 'The current unfounded reports are merely an outgrowth of psychological warfare propagated by the Zionist regime in the wake of its recent defeat on the Lebanese front,' the mission stated. It came after the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) cited a November 26 report by the Institute for Science and International Security, alleging that Iran has been focusing on how to produce and deliver pharmaceutical-based chemical agents (PBAs) for use in military attacks, using a variety of delivery systems, including drones.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYUAjpzy0NvCI	2024-11-29T21:07:27-08:00	
Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s Speech At Legislative C...	President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan delivered a speech at the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis, emphasizing environmental protection and the green economy. Shavkat Mirziyoyev highlighted the importance of combating climate change and its devastating effects on the environment and public health. This speech takes on particular significance in the aftermath of COP 29. At the COP 29 Summit (Conference of Parties, which are the most important meetings on the international climate agenda), President Mirziyoyev called for global cooperation on climate change. On November 12, 2024, he described climate change as an urgent global threat, calling it a major driver of geopolitical tensions and a direct challenge to sustainable development. In his speeches, it is clear that the Uzbek president is aware of the severity of climate-related consequences. It is useful to emphasize the term 'consequences' because it is not climate change itself that poses a problem to humanity, but rather its dangerous impacts, such as desertification and drought. President Mirziyoyev stressed in his address to the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis that these consequences must be addressed by tackling the root cause: the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuel combustion releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, which is the primary driver of global warming. The president also highlighted climate and environmental issues specific to Uzbekistan, such as the Aral Sea disaster, which occurred decades ago. He stated that his government has made the development of the green economy a national priority, supported by a program aimed at improving the ecological conditions in regions suffering from environmental degradation in Uzbekistan. Another key point in his speech was the importance of regional and international collaboration. He showcased a major initiative taken by Uzbekistan to launch a regional climate strategy, which includes the creation of the Central Asian University for Environmental Studies and Climate Change in the capital. According to various academic studies, such as that of Shukhrat & Zebo (2023), Uzbekistan plans to increase the share of green energy to 40% by 2030. This goal was confirmed by Energy Minister Zhurabek Mirzamakhmudov during the 'Russian Energy Week' forum (Ismailov, September 27, 2024). To achieve this, the Uzbek government is focusing on using efficient and energy-saving technologies in the design, reconstruction, and construction of buildings to enhance energy efficiency (reducing energy consumption per building) and renewable energy projects. Finally, a key message of the speech was President Mirziyoyev’s proposal to declare 2025 the 'Year of Environmental Protection and the Green Economy' in Uzbekistan. This proposal is well-founded, as he outlined the government’s plans, led by the newly elected Prime Minister, to develop a comprehensive state program addressing the major environmental challenges identified for the year. The program will prioritize implementing green technologies, responsible water resource management, significantly increasing green spaces, mitigating the consequences of the Aral Sea disaster, waste management, and, most importantly, improving public health. Once again, this conclusion is not without foundation. As academic studies show, such as Akhinjanovna’s (2023), the government has prioritized large-scale energy projects in recent years and made significant investments in green energy, including funding for photovoltaic solar power plants. For example, a project financed by the World Bank Group, Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC (Masdar), and the Uzbek government involves a 250-megawatt (MW) photovoltaic solar power plant with a 63 MW battery energy storage system (BESS) (IFC.org). In conclusion, the Uzbek government is prioritizing energy transition and investing at all levels (environmental protection, education, building insulation, transition to green energy, cooperation with neighbors, the EU, and internationally) to achieve its climate goals. It would be ideal for all countries to work together to combat global warming, which affects people around the world. BIBLIOGRAPHY Akhinjanovna, K. K. (2023).

Why Is Sidestepping Kazakhstan’s Constitution To Suit Minister, P...	In early November, Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev paid a state visit to France at Emmanuel Macron's invitation. On this occasion, EURACTIV's Théo Bourgery-Gonse, in a piece entitled 'Kazakhstan president to visit France to talk all things nuclear' ('Le président du Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokaïev, attendu à Paris pour parler nucléaire'), quoted Catherine Poujol, a professor of History and Civilization of Central Asiaat French university Inalco (the National Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilizations) and director of the French Institute for Central Asian Studies from 2016 to 2020, as saying: 'There is a ‘Kazakhstan moment,’ which France has been quick to seize'. It's about one of those conventional journalistic accounts, which are usually made ahead of one of the visits by these or those leaders of the developing countries to Paris and to which few mainstream French media outlets and political experts normally pay attention. So, it hardly drew much attention and interest from the French reading public. And we of Kazakhstan, too, might pass by such piece, particularly since it appears to be written in a way that makes it like the publications in pro-government Kazakhstani media about Tokayev's activities domestically and in his country’s foreign relations, if not for its emphasis on the Kazakh President's linguistic talent and his allegedly caring attitude towards the state language of Kazakhstan. Because even the pro-regime Kazakhstani media do not often dare praise Mr.Tokayev in the context of the Kazakh language theme if they ever do. But first things first. The piece by Théo Bourgery-Gonse stated, 'Kazakhstan, finding itself on a thin line, is trying to walk a tightrope' between Russia, China, and the Europeans, eager to engage with all [of them], but wishing to avoid critical dependencies with each, explains Euractiv Catherine Poujol, a French historian and specialist in Central Asia at the National Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilizations (INALCO). Astana’s ties with China are also ‘excellent’, she adds. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who speaks perfect Mandarin, was even the first leader to welcome Xi Jinping in September 2022, after Chinese restrictions imposed in the context of COVID-19 had been lifted... Due to the geographical reality and the economic, cultural, and military ties that unite the two countries, 'Kazakhstan is beholden to Russia by nature, but [the president] wants to distance itself from it', emphasizes Catherine Poujol'. When in words, everything sounds good. But this is so only because Théo Bourgery-Gonse and his speaker, Catherine Poujol, a leading French expert on Kazakhstan, promote President Tokayev's image as a Kazakh patriotic-minded statesman and yet a shrewd diplomat and a polyglot who can perfectly speak his native language which, as implied, goes without saying, and also Mandarin, and a few other languages, and at the same time, it was as if they did not notice the fact that he carried out talks not only with Putin but also through interpreters, Xi Jinping, Emmanuel Macron, and other Western leaders just in Russian, but not in Kazakh. The last line in the piece by Théo Bourgery-Gonse is formulated as follows: 'Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's speech in Paris on Tuesday is expected to be symbolically read in Kazakh rather than Russian'. Such an approbation expressed in advance looks like an attempt to gloss over the above-cited fact. But reading seems to be the only thing Mr.Tokayev is capable of where there is а need to use his native and Kazakhstan’s state language. He can also say a few basic welcoming or opening phrases in Kazakh without reading from a piece of paper. Yet the truth is, Kazakhstan’s President Kasym-Jomart Tokayev hasn’t given a single press conference in Kazakh for over 5 years of his being in office and has never been seen speaking at length the state language while talking with his co-citizens in public. He usually favors Russian and, as stated in the above piece by Théo Bourgery-Gonse, 'speaks perfect Mandarin', though knowledge of these languages, unlike Kazakh, is not binding on the one who is in office in Akorda (the residence of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan). Hence, the fact of being a Russian and Chinese speaker does not excuse Mr.Tokayev, as Kazakh President, from the constitutional obligation to be fluent in Kazakh. That may be so according to the mere letter of the law, but in fact, it doesn't look to be. Below's what's happening in real life. How Was Berik Uali Trying To Justify The Fact That Mr.Tokayev Had Not Given An Interview In His State Language? Shortly after the 2022 protest events, now known in Kazakhstan as 'Bloody January', in late January 2022, Kassym-Jomart gave a 50-minute television exclusive interview to Vera Zakharchuk, an ethnic Russian journalist. Such a solution was felt as an oddity. Even more strange appeared the first televised interview given in Russian by the Kazakh president to an ethnic Russian journalist following the January 2022 unrest in Kazakhstan, if one considers the fact that those mass protest rallies involved only ethnic Kazakh people, in particular the Kazakh-speaking youth who had come to the cities from rural areas in search of work and earnings. Here is the comment by Catherine, an ethnic Russian woman who lives near the central square of Almaty (that is, just off the city hall), where the worst of the unrest took place, on the situation in those days: 'As for the very protests, only Kazakhs participate in them. There are no Russians among them'. Before these people, Kazakh President Tokayev spoke in Russian and through the mediation of an ethnic Russian journalist in the wake of the January 2022 unrest. This got the Kazakh-speaking audience wondering why he had made that choice. His press secretary, Berik Uali, had to stand out and speak in explanation of why a choice in favor of the Russian language had been made. He claimed that the global viewers had been meant to be the main audience of that interview. The implication was that the Russian language is recognized and spread throughout the world, unlike Kazakh. Such an explanation only fueled more questions. Dos Koshim, a Kazakh political analyst, said: 'An interesting response. Does this mean that the world community has switched to Russian[?]… Well, one cannot cast aspersions on the entire world community trying to justify the fact that our president did not give an interview in his state language'. It was then announced that Tokayev would soon give a television interview in Kazakh. On February 17, Kazakhstan TV broadcasted an interviewwith President Tokayev in Kazakh. Here is how it was commented on in a video material entitled 'The question is whether Tokayev wasn't 'reading' his interview?' by Radio Azattyk's Nurgul Tapayeva and Yerzhan Amirkhanov: 'Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has given his first ever Kazakh-language interview since taking office. The interview mostly focused on the [2022] January events. However, some viewers are questioning the authenticity of the questions and answers. The [text of the] interview held at the Akorda residence was written in advance. After watching it, the audience began to speculate that the President read the answers to the journalist's questions from a screen like this one [Radio Azattyk's Nurgul Tapayeva points at a rather small monitor]. Journalists call it a teleprompter… Radio Azattyk asked the journalist of the Kazakhstan TV channel, Zhaina Slambek, who had conducted the interview, whether the questions were or were not in advance sent to the President. The journalist refused to answer'. The latter's status as a journalist enables her not to disclose the terms on which she has been granted consent to the interviews. Is There Another Such High-Ranking Official In The World Who Is Not Fluent In His Country's State Language? It's quite a different thing when it comes to the press secretary of the Kazakh President, Berik Uali, who preliminarily announced this very interview of Tokayev in the Kazakh language and most probably, in one way or another, participated in organizing and arranging it. By the way, on February 14, 2022, three days before the interview by his chief, President Tokayev, was due to be aired on the Kazakhstan TV channel, he was elected as that TV company's chairman of the board of directors. That is, at the moment of that interview's airing, Berik Uali simultaneously represented Kazakhstan's President's Staff and the Kazakhstan TV channel. But, be that as it may, he was a public officer at that time. And his oath of office, with the words, 'I solemnly swear to uphold the country's Constitution and laws', requires him not to allow any action or inaction that may be perceived as deviating from the constitutional model and the constitutional norms. Paragraph 2 in Article 41 of the present Constitution of Kazakhstan states that not only the incumbent President but any Kazakhstani citizen who wants to try to run for presidential office must be 'fluent in the state language', which means that Mr.Tokayev needs, first of all, to speak Kazakh fluently and not just to read it. So, even now, it is not too late for the Kazakh journalists to ask Berik Uali, who is still Mr.Tokayev's press secretary, whether there was any basis for speculations that 'the president read the [prewritten] answers to the journalist's questions from a screen' during 'his first ever Kazakh-language interview since taking office'. Should he fully refute such speculations and assure them that the incumbent Kazakh Kazakh President speaks fluently the state language of Kazakhstan, he will immediately have to face the need to arrange and hold a press conference with the participation of Mr.Tokayev. Otherwise, his assurances will remain words. As it here is a question of a constitutional matter, he, as a state official, is supposed not to make any statement that may be perceived as deviating from the constitutional model and the constitutional norms. Yet, the question of the Kazakh President publicly proving his state language proficiency at the level of the requirements of Kazakhstan's Constitution has long been on the agenda. It has become particularly pertinent following Mr.Tokayev's first-ever Kazakh-language interview, and it still is. Ethnic Kazakhs, who make up more than 70 percent of Kazakhstan's population, want their president to be able to speak Kazakh in public without reading from a piece of paper. The requests from the public then sounded appropriate and regular: the incumbent Kazakh President should give a live interview on Kazakhstan television or, better yet, give a multi-hour press conference to domestic and foreign journalists in the same way as Russian President Putin and Belorussian President Lukashenko usually do. But none of these was ever done. Hence, the conclusion is begged that, contrary to the requirement of Paragraph 2 in Article 41 of the present Constitution of Kazakhstan, the incumbent Kazakh President is not 'fluent in the state language'. That is, his Kazakh, to be polite, leaves much to be desired. To judge this by actual observation, with his knowledge of the state language of Kazakhstan, he may probably be compared with a first-year student learning some foreign language. It turns out that he can read Kazakh but cannot lead a spontaneous and fluent conversation with the audience in his nation's state language. Not only that, he began promoting people without sufficient knowledge of the State language to ministerial posts. Here is just one example of how this is being done. On April 11, 2023, Lenta.ru, in a piece entitled ‘In Kazakhstan, Russian-speaking minister is being compelled to learn Kazakh’, reported: 'On April 6, [Almassadam] Satkaliyev [who had been appointed the new Minister of Energy of Kazakhstan just two days earlier] was presenting the bill ‘On Heat Power Engineering’ to the members of the Majilis [lower chamber of the Parliament of Kazakhstan]. MP Bakytzhan Bazarbek remarked that the minister had to speak the official state language of Kazakhstan. 'If you cannot speak Kazakh, you must have an [Kazakh-speaking] assistant', he said'. What Is The Difference Between Russian Coach Cherchesov And Kazakh Minister Satkaliyev? After the remark by the MP, the head of the Energy Ministry was not at a loss and promised to learn the Kazakh language in 6 months [i.e. by October 6, 2023]. For more than a quarter of a century, Almassadam Satkaliyev had been working for state companies and in the civil service. In the fifty-third year of his age, he promised to engage seriously in learning the official State language of Kazakhstan. Now, when it has been not just 6 months but a year and a half since then, let's see what has come out of Mr.Satkaliyev’s pledge to make himself fluent in Kazakh for half a year. Ulysmedia.kz, in a report entitled 'Arrogance or unprofessionalism? The Energy Minister refused to answer a journalist in Kazakh' and published on November 25, said: 'A Ulysmedia journalist asked the Minister to comment on the situation in Zhanaozen, where workers have been on strike for more than 10 days. It should be noted that all residents of Zhanaozen speak mainly Kazakh. Therefore, the official was asked to answer in Kazakh, as well, so that the striking workers could listen to the Minister's answer without misunderstanding. In a dismissive tone, the Minister declined to answer the question posed in the state language. The behavior of the head of the Ministry of Energy surprised the media representatives present. It must be said that Satkaliyev has been holding the post of minister for 1.5 years already, and in that time, he still apparently has not learned Kazakh'. Honestly, in conformity with his country's Constitution and laws, he was supposed to have already been fluent in Kazakh at the time of his nomination to his current post, as, according to Article 7 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan, 'the state language of the Republic of Kazakhstan shall be the Kazakh language'. As for his refusal to answer the question posed in the state language, according to Article 7 of the Law 'On Languages in the Republic of Kazakhstan', 'actions of officials that impede the functioning of ... the state language... entail liability under the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan'. Yet this actually seems not to be working in the case under consideration. Otherwise, what else could be the explanation for what a Ulysmedia journalist saw? How could one be a member of the Cabinet of Ministers in a country without being fluent in its state language and, at the same time, showing disregard for it? The matter probably would become clearer only when one compares the above case with what had earlier happened with Stanislav Cherchesov. The latter, too, encountered a question in Kazakh at a news conference. But he didn't refuse to answer. Instead, he tried to laugh off the awkward situation. This story caused a great resonance in the local and international media. Cherchesov was fined 738,400 tenges ($1,500) and underwent counseling about the importance of respecting the state language. In a similar situation, Kazakh Energy Minister Almassadam Satkaliyev 'dismissively declined to answer the question posed in the state language'. This story did not cause excitement among the local media. And nobody seems to have noticed it outside Kazakhstan. Thus, in the context of critical assessments of the state language's unenviable situation in Kazakhstan, the elites who run the country find themselves untouchable by default. So, why Is sidestepping Kazakhstan's Constitution to suit the minister and the President not a reason for Sasha Baron Cohen to call it Borat country?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYTSrnr1-fvTf	2024-11-29T20:56:51-08:00	
Eni: Agreement In Côte d’Ivoire To Protect And Restore 14 Forests...	Eni signed Friday an agreement with the Côte d'Ivoire's Ministry of Water and Forests to launch a project to preserve and restore forest areas in the country. The initiative, which follows the feasibility study launched in September 2022 with the participation of local stakeholders, will cover 14 forests, identified in close cooperation with the competent authorities, over an area of 155,000 hectares, in the Lagunes and Comoé regions, located respectively in the south and south-east of the country. The agreement focuses on two areas of intervention. The first aims to conserve the remaining existing forest heritage and biodiversity by strengthening the control measures already in place to prevent the risk of deforestation, fires and poaching, and it is based on an extensive awareness-raising and training programme involving local communities and relevant institutions. The second foresees the restoration of some 130,000 hectares of forest area through the planting of some 12 million trees of local species in abandoned and degraded areas, accompanied by agro-forestry initiatives to promote more sustainable farming practices and improve the productivity of cultivated land for the benefit of local farming communities. The project, defined in partnership with the Ivorian authorities, is in line with the country's National Development Plans and the Ivorian strategy to reduce deforestation and related emissions, including by leveraging forest area restoration. It also aligns with Eni's decarbonisation plan, contributing to the achievement of zero net upstream emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in the Baleine development.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYfFjyohAmdc3	2024-11-29T20:54:10-08:00	
Turkey’s Natural Gas Dependency On Gazprom And US Sanctions: Poss...	Following the US sanctions on Gazprombank, Turkey's request for an exemption from these sanctions to continue importing natural gas from Russia has brought energy dependency issues back into focus. The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources' request reflects Turkey's efforts to safeguard energy supply security while also highlighting gaps in its energy independence. Gazprom's Share in Turkey's Energy Market Gazprom, which accounts for 40% of Turkey's natural gas imports, has been targeted by US sanctions. The US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Gazprom and six foreign subsidiaries, prompting Turkey to seek diplomatic solutions to avoid disruptions. Meanwhile, some European Union member states continue to import gas from Russia, raising questions about Turkey's position in the face of these sanctions. According to data from Turkey's Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK), the country's natural gas consumption for 2024 is expected to fall below the projected 56 billion cubic meters. However, this situation underscores the need to ensure energy supply security and intensify efforts to diversify energy sources. Dependency in Energy Policies and Alternatives Requesting exemptions from the US exposes Turkey's reliance on external energy sources. To reduce dependency and enhance energy independence, the following steps can be considered: 1. Alternative Suppliers: Increasing LNG imports from countries like Qatar and Algeria could diversify energy sources. 2. Renewable Energy: Investments in wind, solar, and hydroelectric energy should be accelerated. 3. Domestic Resources: Newly discovered natural gas reserves in the Black Sea and Mediterranean should be rapidly brought into production. 4. Increasing Storage Capacity: Expanding natural gas storage capacity can strengthen supply security. Reducing reliance on Russia has become a strategic priority for Turkey's energy independence. US sanctions serve as a warning to address this dependency. Investments in renewable energy and diversification of suppliers will play a critical role in ensuring energy security. In the short term, however, diplomatic efforts will be necessary to prevent interruptions in energy imports.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcjnd1r1kyAYaL4tGz8p_DK	2024-11-29T20:49:45-08:00	
Winter Blackouts In Kashmir: A Crisis Of Power And Productivity –...	Kashmir and other locations amply indicate that energy may be utilized in the same way as a weapon to manipulate people’s activities. Interrupted electricity supply, especially in winter, has significant impacts on people’s everyday activities in Occupied Kashmir; the students’ studies are disrupted as well as the industrial sector, where both employers and employees are tested. These power outages might be considered a constructive approach by which the state can control and put pressure on the people with an aim of altering their attitudes and habits. The availability of reliable power services limits productivity as well as increases the already very high living standards; therefore, discontent and greater unrest among the population. These strategic tactics of energy expose more of the worldwide politics and power supply management in the conflict zones. Winter is the time of numerous problems in Kashmir. Life is made very hard because of power outages. Blackouts disturb daily life and economic activities. Families cannot get electricity, and students cannot study. The industrial sector also suffers as machines stop working. It is a major cause of worry for everyone because power supply is unreliable and leaves people in the dark for long periods. More power cuts further worsen the problems that accompany winter, and life becomes worse for people of Kashmir. According to Kashmir Power development cooperation Limited (KPDCL) officials, power demand in the Valley has risen to 2200 MW, whereas the supply remains at only 1500 MW. This is leaving Kashmiris deprived of this crucial life resource since electricity being produced in Jammu and Kashmir is being supplied elsewhere. The situation with power outages increases the problems that small and medium enterprises, already grappling with economic challenges, have to face during the limited daylight hours of winter. Daily life is constantly disrupted, and the progress of economic activities is obstructed, while the entire populace of Kashmir faces difficulties with added intensity, which has heightened the urgent need for better resource distribution. Despite significant infrastructure investment and the installation of smart meters, power cuts remain commonplace in Kashmir, leading to growing dissatisfaction and frustration among its residents. The people of Kashmir are increasingly questioning why these enormous investments in the energy sector are unable to deliver constant, uninterrupted electricity as promised. The Indian government has been systematically involved in denying basic rights that would help ensure the dignified lives of Kashmiris. One of the collective punishments is the denial of electricity to Kashmiris when the severest winter comes sucking the resources and hydroelectric potential of the region, further increasing people's hardship. It reminds people of never-ending fights for basic needs. The electricity shortage has strangulated the economy in Kashmir, badly affecting business and daily life. In such a situation, heavy bills are burdening Kashmiris, an unequal treatment that increases their hardships further. Power demand in the Valley has increased to 2200 MW, whereas supply is only up to 1500 MW. This creates a contradiction with India's statement that all is well in the Valley and that peace and development are on the move there. The constant power cuts disturb economic activities, hinder students' education, and challenge the industrial sector. India's denial of reliable electricity to Kashmiris during harsh winters, while exploiting the region's resources, is a form of collective punishment that highlights the continued oppression and marginalization of the Kashmiri people. The United Nations (UN) and other international actors must force India to end state-sponsored miseries of the Kashmiris and fulfill its international obligations for a just and rightful resolution of the Kashmir issue as mentioned in the UN resolution of self-determination. A fair and impartial referendum is needed so that the people of Kashmir can determine their future. This constant subjugation and denial of elementary rights in Kashmir is weakening Indian claims about democracy and justice. Of course, it is essential that international opinion takes substantive measures to coax peace, stability, and the protection of human rights in the area.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLberM2PaZovz2oFCvJ_OI	2024-11-29T20:42:34-08:00	
A Planet On The Brink: The Imperative For Comprehensive Climate A...	Climate change is no longer a distant threat but an immediate, multidimensional crisis challenging ecological, economic, and social stability across the globe. The indicators are unambiguous: rising sea levels, melting ice caps, and intensifying weather extremes underscore the stark reality that our climate is in a state of rapid transformation. Global in scope yet acutely local in impact, climate change threatens to reshape economies, strain public health, and destabilize entire communities. As global temperatures rise, exacerbating climate-related catastrophes, the pressing question is no longer whether to act, but how swiftly and effectively humanity can marshal resources and mobilize innovative solutions to avert potentially irreversible damage. The Unrelenting Pace of Climate Change: A Clear, Quantifiable Threat Data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveals that the global average surface temperature has risen by 1.1°C since the late 19th century, a seemingly small change with monumental implications. The year 2023 was one of the hottest on record, with multiple temperature extremes pushing global averages dangerously close to the 1.5°C threshold—a limit scientists emphasize is critical to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. Already, warming oceans have expanded by approximately 0.12 inches per year since 1993 due to thermal expansion, causing sea levels to rise. In 2022 alone, the Greenland ice sheet lost around 286 billion metric tons of ice, enough to cover the entire state of California in four feet of water. In economic terms, the impact is staggering. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, climate-related disasters in 2023 cost the global economy over $300 billion, with damages projected to reach as much as $2 trillion annually by 2050 if no substantial mitigation efforts are undertaken. Climate change is poised to disrupt not only economies but also labor markets: a 2019 report by the International Labour Organization projected that rising heat levels could result in a 2.2% reduction in global working hours by 2030, equivalent to a loss of 80 million full-time jobs and $2.4 trillion in global economic losses. Human Cost and Climate Injustice: The Disproportionate Burden on Vulnerable Communities The social cost of climate change often falls hardest on communities with the least capacity to adapt. Vulnerable regions are not only more susceptible to extreme weather events, but they also face significant structural challenges in recovering from them. In 2022, the Pakistani floods—described by the World Bank as 'biblical in scale'—displaced over 33 million people, leaving large swathes of agricultural land unfit for cultivation and pushing the country’s economy to the brink of collapse. In the same year, Sub-Saharan Africa experienced its worst drought in four decades, leaving 36 million people across the Horn of Africa in immediate need of humanitarian assistance. This climate-induced suffering underscores a glaring injustice: those least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions are bearing the brunt of climate impacts. Although Africa accounts for less than 4% of global emissions, over 100 million Africans could be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to climate shocks, according to the African Development Bank. The burden also falls disproportionately along gender lines. Studies from the United Nations show that women—especially in rural regions—are 14 times more likely to die during climate-induced disasters than men. Their roles in water collection and agricultural labor, particularly in low-income regions, expose them to the direct impacts of climate-induced resource scarcity and make them especially vulnerable to displacement. The Consequences of Inaction: Climate Migration and Global Security Risks The climate crisis is projected to trigger unprecedented levels of human migration. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, climate change could force 216 million people across six global regions to migrate within their countries. This climate-driven migration is not just a humanitarian issue; it has profound implications for global security, as regions under stress from climate impacts may become hotspots of political instability. For instance, the 2023 Pacific typhoon season, intensified by climate change, displaced thousands across Southeast Asia, sparking tensions over land and resources. Environmental migration is likely to strain international systems and exacerbate existing conflicts. Climate-related water scarcity, predicted to impact up to 1.8 billion people by 2025, has the potential to ignite transboundary disputes, particularly in regions with historically contentious water sources, such as the Nile Basin, the Jordan River, and the Tigris-Euphrates. In recognizing the intersection of climate and security, the United Nations Security Council recently highlighted climate change as a 'threat multiplier' in conflict zones, particularly in regions like the Sahel, where resource scarcity fuels armed conflict and extremist activities. Advances in Technology: A Pathway to Climate Mitigation Despite the overwhelming data underscoring the gravity of the climate crisis, emerging technologies provide a pathway to mitigate its impacts. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are becoming economically viable alternatives to fossil fuels. Solar energy costs, for example, have dropped by 89% since 2010, making it more affordable than coal in many parts of the world. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), renewable energy could account for up to 86% of the global energy mix by 2050 if current investment trends continue, with the potential to reduce carbon emissions by 70%. Moreover, innovative approaches to carbon management are gaining traction. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, while costly, has the potential to capture up to 90% of carbon emissions from industrial facilities and power plants. Breakthroughs in this area, such as the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act, which allocates $369 billion toward climate and energy policies, are incentivizing further development of CCS and other green technologies. Yet, rapid scaling is essential to make a measurable difference. Investment in electric vehicles (EVs) and the electrification of transportation systems is also crucial. The transportation sector alone contributes to approximately 14% of global carbon emissions. However, recent advances in battery technology and government incentives have contributed to a 54% increase in EV sales in 2023. Leading economies such as China and the EU have set ambitious targets to phase out combustion-engine vehicles by 2035, highlighting a shift toward electrified transportation that, if implemented globally, could cut transportation emissions in half by mid-century. International Cooperation and Policy Commitment: A Pivotal Role for Political Will Although technological advancements are promising, they must be matched by strong policy commitments and international cooperation. Initiatives such as the Paris Agreement aim to limit global warming to below 2°C, yet countries are currently not on track to meet these targets. The 2023 Global Carbon Budget report highlighted that current policy trajectories could lead to a 2.7°C increase by the end of the century—a catastrophic outcome. One of the most promising yet challenging aspects of international cooperation lies in establishing a 'loss and damage' fund, compelling wealthier nations to compensate those hardest-hit by climate impacts. The 2023 UN climate conference (COP28) took a step toward institutionalizing this fund, though its effectiveness will depend on binding commitments and timely disbursements. If adequately implemented, the fund could provide much-needed financial support for countries facing the immediate impacts of climate change, such as rebuilding infrastructure and investing in climate adaptation. Individual and Collective Action: Building a Resilient Society While systemic change is essential, individual and community-level actions remain significant. Studies by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions show that if every household reduced its energy consumption by 10%, the United States could avoid releasing over 60 million tons of CO2 annually. Grassroots movements, from youth-led environmental advocacy to local conservation efforts, play an instrumental role in demanding policy shifts and raising awareness. Education is also a crucial component of climate resilience. By integrating climate education into school curricula, society can prepare a generation to understand, mitigate, and adapt to climate challenges. A well-informed public will not only support sustainable policies but will also engage in behaviors that reflect a deeper commitment to environmental stewardship. A Call for a Paradigm Shift: Reshaping Humanity’s Relationship with Nature The climate crisis represents not only a technical challenge but a moral imperative that calls for a profound shift in humanity's relationship with nature. Addressing climate change requires that we transcend the traditional boundaries of nations, sectors, and industries to form a unified global response. For those of us with the privilege of education, resources, and influence, there is an ethical duty to advocate for policies that prioritize the long-term health of our planet over short-term economic gains. As global citizens, we must recognize that the choices we make today will define the world for future generations. We are at a pivotal moment where action—or inaction—will determine the resilience of ecosystems, the stability of economies, and the survival of communities worldwide. In the words of environmentalist David Attenborough, 'The future of humanity and indeed all life on Earth now depends on us.' The time to act is now.

Outer Space Weaponization and Potential Gaps within PAROS – OpEd	The growing militarization of outer space reflects a shift from its earlier perception as a protected, peaceful domain to an arena where nations are actively advancing their strategic and military capabilities. What was once considered a neutral space reserved for exploration and scientific endeavors is now a key frontier in national defense, with various countries developing satellite-based weapons, anti-satellite (ASAT) systems, and other technologies aimed at asserting dominance and protecting their interests in orbit. Yet, the debate on which PAROS stands does not address contemporary issues of space weaponization, leaving gaps in debate regarding the rapid development of ASAT capabilities and other weaponized technologies. This transformation highlights the increasing strategic importance of space, where geopolitical rivalries are extending beyond Earth's atmosphere. Key treaties like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1979 Moon Agreement are central to the legal debate. Article III of the OST mandates that space activities comply with international law and the UN Charter, emphasizing peaceful usage. Article IV is nuanced: it bans weapons of mass destruction in orbit but allows for military use, stopping short of comprehensive demilitarization. Specifically, Article IV (2) enforces a strict prohibition on military activities on the Moon and other celestial bodies, underscoring their exclusive peaceful use. The Moon Agreement reiterates this, banning any hostile acts on the Moon. Overall, while the OST sets some boundaries on space weaponization, the current regulatory environment remains permissive, providing ample scope for military activities and development. This leeway, coupled with emerging security threats like cyberattacks and the deployment of space-specific military assets, suggests a gap in international law as it pertains to evolving security dynamics in space. Despite these frameworks, current space laws permit extensive military activities. Conventional weapons and intelligence-gathering are permissible, while recent actions—such as ASAT (anti-satellite) tests conducted by China, the U.S., and India—illustrate the trend of increased militarized maneuvers. India, for instance, demonstrated its ASAT capabilities on 27 March 2019 through 'Mission Shakti,' successfully striking a satellite in low Earth orbit with a kinetic kill vehicle. The test created hundreds of pieces of debris in low Earth orbit, increasing the risk of collisions with other satellites and space missions. This debris can persist for years, heightening the potential for incidents that could damage crucial space infrastructure and disrupt global services such as communications, navigation, and weather forecasting. Such actions contribute to an arms race in space, shifting the focus from peaceful exploration to conflict preparedness Additionally, nations like the U.S. and France have established dedicated military space forces, underscoring a commitment to space defense. These forces, such as the U.S. Space Force, have developed capabilities like satellite jamming to prevent enemy access to satellite communications, and strategies emphasize the need for military superiority and defense in space. Gul Qaiser Sarwani, a Pakistani delegate to the UN, warns that any conflict originating from outer space could have far-reaching effects beyond space itself, impacting all aspects of life on Earth—even in countries without space capabilities. He emphasizes the lack of progress in international negotiations to prevent an arms race in space (PAROS), despite the goals set by the Outer Space Treaty of the 1960s. Sarwani notes that divisions among countries on how to secure space have widened, with conflicting approaches and competitive agendas complicating efforts. To address these challenges, Pakistan advocates for a 'holistic approach' to space security, calling for actions that address dual-use technologies (those with both civilian and military applications) and explicitly warfighting-oriented space capabilities. Sarwani reinforces Pakistan’s long-standing support for a legally binding treaty on PAROS and its contributions to non-binding initiatives like Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures (TCBMs). Historically, such measures have often paved the way for binding agreements, and Pakistan believes they hold similar potential for space security. An updated PAROS, aligned with current realities, could play a critical role in reducing and managing the growing array of space-based threats that pose risks to global stability. Unlike in the past, where space was predominantly a domain of exploration and scientific advancement, the modern space environment faced issues stemming from weaponization, militarization, and dual-use technologies. There needs to be a PAROS agreement that would address these threats by establishing clearer limitations on military activities in space, providing frameworks for transparency in ASAT weapon development, and setting international norms against the deployment of destabilizing technologies, including those that could interfere with satellite communications or navigation systems. To move PAROS beyond the decades of stalled negotiations within the UN Conference on Disarmament (CD), there is an urgent need for a robust debate on establishing a legally binding treaty and regulatory regime that aligns with international law. While the CD has been instrumental in bringing attention to the risks of an arms race in space, its limitations in producing actionable outcomes have prevented PAROS from adapting to contemporary challenges. By shifting the focus to a treaty-based approach, member states could work toward creating enforceable legal mechanisms that prevent space weaponization, prohibit offensive uses of space assets, and ensure transparency in the development of space technologies with dual-use potential.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfU2ghE2_Vf5ApyW97guT9A	2024-11-29T20:32:03-08:00	
The Fallout Of July Jailbreak And Looming Civil War In Bangladesh...	Bangladesh, a nation lauded for its steady economic growth and social advancements, finds itself at a critical crossroads. The July uprising has ushered the country towards new hope to build a discrimination free society. But, on July 19, a meticulously orchestrated jailbreak saw over 2,241 inmates, including 88 on death row, escape from prisons across the country, including the high-security facility. Among the escapees were militants affiliated with extremist groups such as Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT). This brazen act, which also resulted in the looting of weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition, has plunged the nation into an unprecedented security crisis. The jailbreak is emblematic of a broader set of challenges threatening not just Bangladesh's internal stability but also the regional equilibrium in South Asia. India's growing concerns about militant spillovers and its hints at taking harsher measures underscore the gravity of the situation. Meanwhile, the potential for punitive international actions, particularly from the United States under the influence of Donald Trump's strategic priorities, adds further complexity. The events of July 19 marked a watershed moment in Bangladesh's recent history. The escape of over 826 prisoners, including nine militants, was part of a broader coordinated attack that targeted not only prison facilities but also over 400 police stations across the country. These attacks were meticulously planned, resulting in the theft of hundreds of weapons, bullet-proof jackets, and other critical supplies. The jailbreak revealed deep vulnerabilities in Bangladesh's law enforcement and prison management systems. The militants, already known for their operational sophistication, capitalized on these weaknesses to secure their freedom. With this newfound liberty, they have become a significant threat to national security, capable of launching devastating attacks and undermining public confidence in the state's ability to protect its citizens. The aftermath of the jailbreak has introduced a new era of uncertainty for Bangladesh. The escapees, particularly the militants and top criminals, are now a looming threat to the country's national security. Their likely targets include minority communities such as Hindus and organizations like ISKCON, which have historically been vulnerable to extremist violence. This raises fears of communal unrest, which could spiral into a larger conflict. The regional implications of this instability are equally alarming. Given Bangladesh's proximity to India, the risk of cross-border militant activities has heightened tensions between the two neighbors. India's increasing vigilance reflects its apprehension about the potential for spillover effects. Furthermore, the resurgence of terrorism in Bangladesh could destabilize the entire region, complicating efforts to maintain peace and security in South Asia. The effort to destabilize Bangladesh appears to be driven by a complex interplay of motives, encompassing both individual and ideological objectives. For many of the escapees, creating chaos serves as a strategy to avoid rearrest. By fostering an environment of anarchy, they divert law enforcement resources and attention, making it harder for the authorities to track them down. Ideologically, extremist groups see instability as an opportunity to propagate their radical agendas. In a nation grappling with disorder, they can recruit followers, train militants, and expand their operations with relative ease. For criminal gangs, instability is a means of survival. In the absence of effective law enforcement, these groups can continue their illegal activities, from drug trafficking to extortion, without fear of consequences. Moreover, political and social upheaval provides a fertile ground for extremism, threatening to turn Bangladesh into a hotbed of radical activity with far-reaching implications. Unfortunately, these all are now a common day to day issues in Bangladesh. In the face of these mounting challenges, the role of Bangladesh's patriotic armed forces is crucial. As protectors of the nation's sovereignty, they must act decisively to restore order and prevent further deterioration of the security situation. Securing the country's borders is a vital first step to prevent the escapees from fleeing into neighboring countries and to stop any cross-border movement of militants. Within the country, the armed forces need to collaborate closely with law enforcement agencies to launch targeted operations aimed at capturing the fugitives and dismantling their networks. Protecting vulnerable communities is another essential task. Militants often target minorities and religious organizations to incite fear and chaos, and the armed forces must take proactive measures to safeguard these groups. In the event of prolonged political instability, the military may also need to step in as a stabilizing force. It has become evident that the interim government led by Yunus was unable to effectively manage the prevailing circumstances. In such a scenario, it may be essential for the Bangladesh Armed Forces to intervene decisively in state affairs to prevent the nation from descending further into chaos and anarchy. On the international front, Donald Trump's strategy toward Bangladesh could significantly influence the country's future. Known for his hardline policies, Trump may consider imposing punitive tariffs on Bangladesh's exports, particularly in the lucrative textile sector, as a response to the ongoing atrocities towards minorities. Such measures would severely impact the nation's economy, which is already under strain. Additionally, Trump could target key figures in Bangladesh's interim government, including members of the civil-military administration, with sanctions. These punitive actions would further isolate Bangladesh on the global stage, complicating its efforts to restore stability. However, Trump's administration may also extend conditional support to Bangladesh if the armed forces take decisive steps to combat militancy and restore order. This support would likely be contingent on aligning with U.S. interests in countering extremism and maintaining regional stability. Bangladesh stands at a perilous juncture, grappling with an unprecedented security crisis in the aftermath of the July 19 jailbreak. The escape of over 2,241 inmates, including militants and top criminals, has exposed deep vulnerabilities in the nation's security apparatus and highlighted the urgent need for action. The stakes are high, and the consequences of inaction could be catastrophic. Only through the decisive and patriotic intervention of the Armed Forces can Bangladesh hope to navigate this crisis and emerge stronger on the other side.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfU2ghE2_Vf5CBMFh7WUnkK	2024-11-29T20:22:37-08:00	
Pakistan Refinery Takeaways From Analyst Briefing	Pakistan Refinery (PRL) held its corporate briefing session on Friday to discuss FY24 financial results and provide insights on the future outlook. Key takeaways are as follows: Company posted topline of PKR306 billion in FY24 as compared to PKR262 billion in FY23, up 17%YoY, led by volumetric growth. Earnings for the year came to PKR4.1 billion (EPS: PKR6.45) as compared to PKR1.8 billion (EPS: PKR2.90) for the same period last year. Total HSD production for the year was reported at 660,180 tons, with the highest average daily production recorded at 2,013 tons. MS-92 also saw growth in output, with an annual production of 265,710 tons and a peak average daily production of 830 tons. MS-95 production totaled 16,005 tons, of which 1,940 tons were EURO-V compliant. Management stated, that crude intake is continuously adjusted to optimize yields and select crudes that better align with the refinery's configuration. Throughout FY24, Aramco crude intake remained the highest. Management also focused on reducing furnace oil output in the production mix, while increasing the share of High Speed Diesel and Motor Spirit (MS), as margins for furnace oil are unfavorable. Refinery Expansion and Upgradation Project (REUP) aims to achieve: 1) production of EURO V compliant HSD and MS/ Petrol, 2) installation of advanced deep conversion refinery technology to reduce the production of HSFO, and 3) expanding the refinery's capacity from 50,000 bpd to 100,000 bpd. Company has already spent US$50 million for feed study for the upgradation and expansion project. Upgradation project aims to change the shape of the product barrel Feed study completion is expected by 2QFY25, followed by submission of EPC-F bids in 3QFY24, selection of EPCC-f contractor in 4QFY25, and the award of the EPC contract and financial close by 2QFY26. Once financial closure is obtained, the construction and EPC phase, along with project commissioning, is expected to be completed by 4QFY28. Regarding the refining policy, PRL has already signed it, but the process may be delayed as other refineries are still in the process of signing. However, PRL is already receiving incentives under the Refinery Policy, which are being allocated to the Special Reserve head and will be accessible after achieving financial close. The deadline set by SIFC for resolving issues related to the refinery upgradation policy has passed. However, management stated that SIFC remains fully involved in addressing the issue. The delays are due to the policy being announced in the budget, and removing it would require parliamentary action or a mini-budget. As a result, discussions are ongoing regarding alternative options to compensate or facilitate refineries. Management stated that under the Refinery Policy 2023, their dividend-paying capacity is neither capped nor restricted. The scrip is not in formal coverage of AKD Securities, but the brokerage house believes that the company's production is immune to subdued demand amid adoption of solar powered tube wells and the increasing acceptance of EVs and hybrid cars in the country, due to heavy reliance of country on imports. With the expansion, the company’s plan to phase out its furnace oil production aligns well with the country's shift in its power mix. However, smuggling of diesel remains to be a key threat to the refining sector.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfU2ghE2_Vf5AE5gLTSm6nv	2024-11-29T20:14:47-08:00	
PSX Closes The Week At Historic High Despite Volatility – OpEd	Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) remained volatile throughout the week ended on November 29, 2024. The volatility stemmed from acceleration in political instability amid opposition party reaching to protest in the country’s Capital, creating uncertainty amongst the investor, leading to a major fall in benchmark index, marking a decrease of 3,506 points on Tuesday. However, the market regained its momentum on Wednesday after the protestors started to back off from Islamabad and the momentum was further fueled by a circular from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), removing the MDR requirements on deposits held by Commercial banks of financial institutions and public sector enterprises. This led to the KSE-100 index registering its highest ever intra-day gains of 4,695 points on Wednesday, and closing at a record high of 101,357 points on Friday, marking an increase of 3.6%WoW. Major contributing sectors to this rally were commercial banks, contributing 1,675 points, followed by Technology & Communication with 349 points, and Oil & Gas Exploration, which added 283 points during the week. However, with another circular from the SBP revising its guidelines for profit sharing on saving deposits for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs), which resulted in MEBL eroding 439 points during the week. Secondary market yields on the 6-month bill decreased to 12.12%, dropping to the lowest levels seen in over 2.5 years. Foreign exchange reserves held by SBP increased by US$131 million WoW, ending the week at US$11.4 billion as of November 22, 2024. Average daily trading volume remained higher, up by 39.8%WoW, rising to 1.4 billion shares, as compared to 990.7 million shares traded a week ago. PKR witnessed a meagre depreciation of 0.1% against the greenback during the week to close at 278.05PKR/US$. Other major news flow during the week included, 1) SBP receives US$500 million from ADB under climate resilience program, 2) IT Ministry released incentive plan for semiconductor industry, 3) Pakistan, Belarus announced to boost ties with 8 MoUs, and 4) the GoP formed a body to oversee Reko Diq deal. Property, Leather & Tanneries, Oil & Gas Marketing Companies, Technology & Communication and Exchange Traded Funds were amongst the top performing sectors, while Jute, Woollen, Transport, Automobile Assembler & INV.Banks/ INV.Cos/ Securities Cos. were amongst the worst performers. Major selling was recorded by Foreigners with a net sell of US$15.1 million. Insurance Companies absorbed most of the selling with a net buy of US$10.6 million. Top performing scrips of the week were: BOP, AKBL, HBL, JVDC, and MEHT, while laggards included: MEBL, FABL, PSEL, SAZEW, and GHGL. Continuation of monetary easing due to disinflationary environment and improving macroeconomic environment would make investment in equities more appealing, currently trading at P/E of 4.9x and DY of 10.2%. Aforementioned factors, along with declining external financing requirement under the IMF program, would keep foreigners’ interest alive. AKD Securities recommends sectors that benefit from monetary easing and structural reforms. However, modest economic recovery may limit the upside for cyclicals. The top picks of the brokerage house include, OGDC, PPL, MCB, FFC, PSO, LUCK, MLCF, FCCL and INDU.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfU2ghE2_Vf5OcLJFo2FbkV	2024-11-29T20:00:33-08:00	
Shadow Wars At The Durand Line: Unmasking The Threat	The unchecked rise of cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghanistan has become a pressing concern for Pakistan and the broader region. Recent incidents along the Durand Line, including armed incursions, improvised explosive device (IED) attacks, and the kidnapping of Pakistani security forces, expose the Taliban’s glaring failure to maintain control over Afghan territory. These developments not only undermine regional stability but also signal the dangerous potential of Afghanistan becoming a hub for extremism once again. In this context, the statement from US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller, acknowledging the threat posed by terror bases in Afghanistan, is a significant endorsement of Pakistan’s long-standing concerns. For years, Islamabad has warned the international community about the operational capacity of militant groups thriving under the Taliban’s watch. The US’s recognition of this issue affirms the validity of these concerns and dismantles the illusion that Pakistan’s warnings were overstated. The Taliban’s takeover in August 2021 came with promises of peace and stability, but the reality on the ground tells a starkly different story. The resurgence of groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) has cast a long shadow over Afghanistan’s purported stability. Despite repeated assurances, the Taliban’s inability to neutralize these factions exposes critical vulnerabilities in their governance model. The rise in militant activity near the Durand Line underscores the Taliban’s inability—or unwillingness—to confront extremist elements. These groups not only pose a direct threat to Pakistan but also jeopardize the security of Central and South Asia. The Taliban’s continued denial of these realities reflects a dangerous delusion that risks escalating into larger conflicts if left unaddressed. Recent incidents along the Durand Line highlight the operational prowess of militant networks operating in Afghanistan. Cross-border attacks, kidnappings, and explosions are not isolated events; they are part of a larger strategy to destabilize Pakistan and exploit the porous border for terror activities. These incidents debunk the Taliban’s claims of maintaining complete control and reveal a governance vacuum that militant groups are exploiting with impunity. The implications of such activities extend far beyond Pakistan. The Durand Line is a critical artery for trade, diplomacy, and security in the region. Its destabilization has the potential to disrupt vital economic corridors and worsen already tense relations between regional powers. Afghanistan’s inability to address cross-border threats has transformed the Durand Line into a volatile flashpoint, endangering both regional and international interests. The evolving collaboration between the US and Pakistan to address cross-border terrorism represents a crucial step in the fight against extremism. Both nations have a shared interest in dismantling terror networks that threaten stability in South Asia and beyond. This partnership reflects a recognition of the seriousness of the issue and the need for a coordinated response. For Pakistan, this collaboration is not just about security—it is about survival. As a frontline state, Pakistan has borne the brunt of terrorism for decades, making its counter-terrorism efforts a matter of national importance. The US’s acknowledgment of these challenges reinforces Pakistan’s role as a key player in regional security and highlights the importance of its contributions to global counter-terrorism initiatives. The unchecked growth of militant networks in Afghanistan poses systemic risks to the entire region. Beyond the immediate threat of terrorism, these groups could disrupt critical infrastructure, destabilize governments, and exacerbate existing geopolitical rivalries. The consequences of inaction are dire: a region plagued by violence, economic stagnation, and political instability. The international community must recognize the gravity of these threats and act accordingly. This includes pressuring the Taliban to take decisive action against extremist groups and providing support to countries like Pakistan that are on the frontlines of this fight. Ignoring these risks will only embolden militant networks and create new challenges for global peace and security. Addressing the threats posed by Afghanistan’s terror networks requires a multi-faceted approach. Military action alone cannot solve the problem. Instead, it must be complemented by diplomatic engagement, economic development, and efforts to address the root causes of extremism. For Pakistan, this means maintaining a delicate balance between counter-terrorism operations and constructive engagement with Afghan leadership. While military action is necessary to neutralize immediate threats, long-term stability will require fostering cross-border development projects, promoting inclusive governance, and ensuring that Afghanistan does not revert to being a global hotspot for terrorism. The threat posed by cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan is neither an isolated issue nor a hypothetical concern—it is a pressing reality with far-reaching implications. The acknowledgment of this threat by the US marks a critical turning point, validating Pakistan’s concerns and highlighting the need for urgent, coordinated action. As Afghanistan’s instability continues to ripple across the region, Pakistan’s role as a stabilizing force becomes increasingly vital. By fostering collaboration with international partners and addressing the root causes of extremism, the region can work toward a more secure and peaceful future. However, the success of these efforts will depend on the international community’s willingness to confront the realities of Afghanistan’s governance challenges and take decisive action.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfU2ghE2_Vf5A7v6L8moPO_	2024-11-29T19:58:10-08:00	
The Role Of Sports In Regional Harmony: Lessons From South Asia –...	Pakistan stands as a example of how sports can unify a nation and serve as a bridge between countries, even amidst political tensions. Its rich history in cricket, squash, hockey, and other sports has not only fostered national pride but has also exemplified the spirit of inclusivity and fair play. Over the years, Pakistan has consistently demonstrated its commitment to keeping sports above politics, contrasting sharply with India's approach, which has often been marred by politicization and selective participation, particularly in its interactions with Pakistan. A glaring instance of this divergence can be seen in India's refusal to participate in the Asia Cup 2023, hosted by Pakistan. This decision ignored Pakistan’s well-documented efforts to provide a secure and welcoming environment for international events. By boycotting the tournament, India not only undermined the regional spirit of sportsmanship but also deprived millions of fans of one of the most thrilling rivalries in cricket. In contrast, Pakistan has shown remarkable sportsmanship by consistently participating in Indian-hosted events, such as the ICC World Cups in 2011 and 2023, despite similar political tensions and security concerns. Cricket diplomacy has historically been a tool for easing tensions in South Asia. Pakistan has often taken the lead in this regard, as exemplified by General Zia-ul-Haq’s bold visit to India during a cricket series in 1987, amidst heightened political tensions. This gesture was not only an act of goodwill but also a testament to Pakistan’s belief in the unifying power of sports. Unfortunately, India has not reciprocated this sentiment, refusing to engage in bilateral series or participate in Pakistan-hosted tournaments. Such actions not only sideline the potential of sports as a bridge for dialogue but also diminish the broader regional significance of these events. Pakistan’s inclusive approach extends beyond cricket. The nation has regularly granted visas to Indian athletes for a variety of sports events, including squash, wrestling, and tennis. These gestures underscore Pakistan’s commitment to fostering regional harmony and mutual respect. India, on the other hand, has frequently denied Pakistani athletes the opportunity to participate in events on its soil, citing political differences or security concerns. This selective engagement not only hampers the growth of sports in the region but also denies athletes valuable opportunities to compete and showcase their talent. The economic implications of India’s boycotts are also worth noting. Organizing international sports events requires significant investment in infrastructure, security, and logistics. India’s refusal to participate in these tournaments results in financial losses for the host country, affecting sponsorships, broadcasting revenues, and tourism. Pakistan, however, has proven resilient, hosting successful events like the Pakistan Super League (PSL), which has gained international acclaim for its organization and competitiveness. The PSL’s success demonstrates Pakistan’s ability to overcome challenges and deliver high-quality sporting events. India’s approach also alienates fans, who eagerly anticipate high-stakes matches between the two nations. Cricket, in particular, holds a unique cultural significance for both countries, and matches between Pakistan and India transcend mere sport to become moments of shared passion and history. By politicizing sports, India deprives fans on both sides of the border of these cherished experiences, eroding the unifying potential of such events. In contrast, Pakistan’s consistent participation in Indian-hosted tournaments highlights its commitment to preserving the spirit of the game. The broader implications of India’s politicization of sports are troubling. By boycotting Pakistan-hosted events, India sets a dangerous precedent for other nations to prioritize politics over the unifying potential of sports. This not only threatens the cohesion of international sporting organizations but also undermines years of efforts to promote sports as a neutral ground for fostering peace and understanding. Pakistan’s proactive stance, on the other hand, exemplifies how sports can be used as a tool for peacebuilding and regional cooperation. In conclusion, Pakistan’s inclusive approach to sports stands as a testament to its commitment to unity, fairness, and regional harmony. By prioritizing sportsmanship over politics, Pakistan continues to set an example for the international community. India’s politicization of sports, in contrast, highlights a missed opportunity to leverage the unifying power of athletics for the betterment of the region. As the world looks to sports as a means of bridging divides, Pakistan’s efforts serve as a reminder of what can be achieved when the spirit of competition is allowed to thrive unimpeded.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWec3svNa7Yp1adKckWFjHSX	2024-11-29T19:56:05-08:00	
The Political Earthquake Amidst Manipur’s Religious Rift – OpEd	The violence in Manipur, India, has brought the growing tide of religious persecution in the country to the forefront. Since May 2023, the state has witnessed violent clashes between the Hindu Meitei and Christian Kuki communities, with over 415 lives lost and tens of thousands displaced. However, what is truly alarming is not only the violence itself but also the failure of India’s leadership to take decisive action in curbing the rising tide of religious intolerance. The indifference shown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government has allowed the persecution of religious minorities, particularly Christians, to flourish unchecked. Manipur’s unrest is rooted in complex ethnic and religious tensions. The Meitei, a predominantly Hindu community, have been demanding Scheduled Tribe status, a move that has been fiercely opposed by the Kuki community, which is largely Christian. The demand for Scheduled Tribe status is seen by many as a means of securing affirmative action benefits, which would favor the Meitei population over other groups in the state, including the Christian Kukis. This has led to violent clashes, with the Kuki people bearing the brunt of the attacks. The violence has been particularly devastating for the Christian community in Manipur. Over 360 churches have been destroyed, and more than 7,000 homes and properties have been looted and burned. This destruction is not just an attack on property; it is an attack on the very identity of the Christian community in the region. The demolition of churches and the displacement of Christian families have left deep scars that will take years to heal. Despite the scale of the destruction, Prime Minister Modi and his government have failed to offer more than a cursory response to the crisis. The silence of the Indian government has been deafening. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Congress party, has been outspoken in his criticism of Modi’s failure to visit Manipur or even acknowledge the scale of the violence. Gandhi’s calls for action highlight the political nature of the violence, which has been exacerbated by the growing influence of Hindutva ideology. Hindutva, which promotes the vision of India as a Hindu nation, has increasingly driven policies that marginalize religious minorities, particularly Muslims and Christians. This ideological shift has not only fueled violence but also deepened the ethnic and religious divisions in Manipur. The impact of Hindutva-driven policies is evident not only in Manipur but across the country. Christians in India have faced increasing attacks on their places of worship, harassment, and forced conversions. According to reports from civil society organizations, there were 161 incidents of violence against Christians between January and March 2024, with a significant concentration in Chhattisgarh. The attacks on Christians in India are not isolated incidents but part of a larger pattern of religious persecution that has worsened under Modi’s government. Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scholar, has argued that Hindutva policies are weaponizing affirmative action and exacerbating ethnic and communal divisions. The elevation of Hindu Scheduled Castes in Manipur, a move designed to benefit the Meitei Hindu community, has only intensified the persecution of Christians in the region. The government’s reluctance to address the root causes of the violence in Manipur reflects a broader failure to protect the rights of religious minorities in India. As the situation in Manipur continues to deteriorate, the international community must take a stand. The United States and other global powers have a responsibility to speak out against the religious oppression in India and pressure the Indian government to address the crisis. The silence of the international community in the face of these atrocities is deeply troubling. Human rights organizations, particularly those focused on religious freedom, must raise their voices in solidarity with the persecuted Christian community in Manipur and across India. In conclusion, the violence in Manipur is a reflection of the broader religious persecution sweeping through India. The silence of Prime Minister Modi and his government in the face of this violence is unacceptable. The international community must act to hold the Indian government accountable for its failure to protect the rights of religious minorities. The growing influence of Hindutva extremism in India threatens not only the country’s social fabric but also its commitment to secularism and democracy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWec3svNa7Yp1c3nVjrvG_lg	2024-11-29T19:51:24-08:00
