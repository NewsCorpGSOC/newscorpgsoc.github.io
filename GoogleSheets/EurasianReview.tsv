Bangladeshis Rise Against Mounting Lawlessness, US Intelligence E...	Mounting lawlessness in Bangladesh has triggered widespread street protests against the inaction and incompetence of the Muhammad Yunus-led Interim Government. US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard has expressed America's concern in no uncertain terms. Neighbouring India is helplessly watching the deterioration in governance at its very doorstep. While Bangladeshi politicians are interminably debating post-Hasina political reforms, elections, and ways to neutralize ousted Premier Sheikh Hasina, the average Bangladeshi is worried about the near-complete breakdown of law order, seen in a spate of mob lynching and mounting cases of rape and gender violence since the Interim Government led by Dr.Yunus took over in August 2024. According to the Human Rights Support Society of Bangladesh (HRSS), at least 119 people were killed and 74 injured in 114 mob lynching cases in seven months since the Interim Government took office. In January and February alone, there were 30 cases of mob lynching, resulting in 19 deaths and 20 injuries, the report added. The HRSS Executive Director Ijazul Islam, said that those lynched were suspected thieves, muggers, child kidnapers and violators of Islamic codes for females. Cases were filed, but few were fully investigated, with the result, the perpetrators went unpunished, Ijazul Islam added. Though mob lynching has been a long-standing issue in Bangladesh, it has intensified now given the deterioration in political conditions since August last year when there was a sudden change of regime. More groups are feeling empowered to take the law into their hands. Given the inherent weakness of the Muhammad Yunus- led Interim Government, a manifest disorganization in the police, judiciary and the bureaucracy, and with the army playing a mute spectator, it is now a free for all. 'Might is Right' in this state of anomie. As per the HRSS report again, in January and February 2005, there were 107 cases of rape, amongst which, child rape numbered 66 and gang rape 27. There was one murder after rape. However, the problem of rape is not new. Quoting statistics from the Law and Arbitration Centre, Reuters said that 3,438 child rape cases were filed in Bangladesh in the last eight years. Actually there were many more child rape victims than reported. At least 539 of them were under the age of six, and 933 between the ages of seven and twelve. Research showed that in most cases, children were sexually abused or raped by people they knew. Be that as it may, some of the recent cases are shocking. In Chittagong, a 52-year-old man was apprehended for raping a 10-year-old girl. In Dhaka, a 13-year-old child was admitted to the One-Stop Crisis Centre at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) following a brutal sexual assault by her close relations. The girl died in hospital. A father was accused of raping his own daughter. A pregnant woman was gang-raped in Keraniganj. A stepfather in Narayanganj was arrested for filming and attempting to rape a teenage girl. According to police headquarters data, put out in the media, the cases of violence against women and children had surged by 19.5% from December 2024 to January 2025. Harassment of Modern Women On March 1, a man, Golam Mostakim Rintu, took offence to two young women smoking at a tea stall in Dhaka's Lalmatia area and abused them. An altercation that followed led to an assault on the women by the self-styled moral policeman and his gang. Golam Mostakim Rintu had grabbed the women's hair, slapped and kicked them. A bystander who had rushed to the aid of the girls, was beaten black and blue. A 11-second video footage of the incident went viral. What was more shocking, was the authorities' response to the incident. Instead of condemning the mob attack, Home Advisor Gen. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury focused on the 'offence of smoking in public spaces.' Mahiya Tabassum of The Daily Star pointed out that according to the Smoking and Use of Tobacco Products (Control) Act, 2005, the location where the incident took place—a roadside tea stall—did not qualify as a 'designated non-smoking public place.' Gen.Chowdhury's attempt to shift the focus from the violence to the act of smoking in a public place was but a blatant effort to justify the assault and absolve the perpetrators, Tabassum wrote. Chowdhury's stance only bolstered those who would use the religious card to 'justify' the moral policing of women. Tabassum wondered if religious sensitivities could be used as an excuse to harass and curb women's freedom to choose their lifestyle? She charged that the Interim Government of Muhammad Yunus is more interested in placating its religious fundamentalist partners (like the Jamaat-i-Islami and the Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh) than in protecting the rights of Bangladesh's women. Compromise Agreement Despite the clear violations of the law, no legal action was taken against Rintu and others who attacked the women smokers. Instead, the victims were pressured into entering into a 'compromise agreement.' The agreement was signed by the victims' parents and not the victims themselves, undermining their autonomy and legal standing as adults, Tabassum pointed out. The media also reported that 'someone identifying himself as a powerful individual' had called the father of one of the victims and coerced him into signing it, further complicating the issue. The fact that law enforcement agencies had facilitated this agreement instead of proceeding with legal action reflected a gross misuse of discretionary power, Tabssum said. She went on to say that police are resorting to such 'compromise agreements' to cover up Gender Based Violence (GBV) cases. The reluctance to hold male perpetrators of GBV accountable reinforces the prevailing culture of impunity, where women are expected to endure harassment and violence without any recourse to justice, she pointed out. Misogyny runs deep in Bangladesh and in the Indian subcontinent in general. 'The entire ecosystem—spanning government officials, the media, law enforcement, and political parties—continues to perpetuate abuse,' Tabassum noted. She also highlighted the nefarious role of the media in diverting attention from the crime to something else only to save the perpetrators. For example, some media outlets reported that the protests staged by women against the spate of rapes was an 'Indian conspiracy.' Laws Disregarded Bangladesh has strong laws to protect women, including the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act (2000) and the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act (2010). But commentator Farzana Hoque asked, 'What good are laws if they are not enforced?' She points out that women who report rape, harassment, or domestic abuse often find that police do not take them seriously. Court cases drag on for years and many criminals walk away free. Survivors who seek justice are often shamed, threatened, or pressured into staying silent. Justice delayed is justice denied but in Bangladesh, justice is often never rendered at all, Hoque submits. Nothing explains the problem of gender bias better than what happened at Dhaka University (DU) recently. A female student was harassed just because her dupatta (scarf) was not in the 'right place.' The harasser, one Arnob Sardar, felt it was his right to police what she wore. But the girl student stood up for herself and filed a police complaint. Sardar was arrested, but only to be let off on bail soon. The rise of digital platforms has also created new dangers. Women now face cyber harassment, online threats, and blackmail. Here too, instead of taking action, authorities often advise victims to 'just ignore it,' Hoque points out. Public Outcry The case of an 8-year-old girl being raped by her relations set off a huge public outcry. Student groups organised protests and human chains to demand justice and greater protection for women. Several groups demanded the resignation of Home Affairs Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury. In response, the police launched a special hotline to address cases of domestic violence, sexual harassment, and rape. Collection of statistics is important, but if no action follows the exercise will be futile. The 'Bangladesh against Rape and Abuse,' a platform consisting of female activists and concerned citizens, had burned an effigy of the Home Affairs Adviser Gen. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury condemning the inaction against Golam Mostakim Rintu. US Concern The Director of US National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in New Delhi on Monday that the situation in Bangladesh is a 'major area of concern' for the United States, citing the persecution of religious minorities. In an interview with NDTV World, when asked about the situation in Bangladesh, she said, 'The long-time unfortunate persecution, killing, and abuse of religious minorities—Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Catholics, and others—have been a major area of concern for the US government, President Trump and his administration.' 'The talks are just beginning between President Trump's new cabinet coming in and the Government of Bangladesh but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern. The threat of Islamist terrorists, and their overall effort, the global effort of all of these different groups, are rooted in the same ideology and objective — which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate. This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they chose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.' She further said, 'President Trump remains committed to identifying the ideology that drives Islamist terrorism, and working to defeat this ideology and their ability to exact that terror on people, the American people and others.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jRTRL8PLYtsU	2025-03-18T09:48:41-07:00	
Fragmentation Of Media Reality – OpEd	By Steve Clemons There is a hubris and inappropriate self-confidence among mainstream media that their practices and approaches to media are sound, and new entrants are unsound. They purport to present fact-checked truths while pointing to new media as promulgators of disinformation, poor journalism, AI-assisted deep fakes, and propaganda. My ‘provocation’ for those of you today attending the OSCE’s conference on the state of journalism and media broadly is that progress in assuring a healthy, socially responsible media consistent with democratic norms cannot come from just clinging to past platforms and norms. Let me offer some perspective on the fragmentation of media and what it means for society. First, the fragmentation of media has been a multi-decade phenomenon, driven not only by new digital tools and platforms but, particularly in the United States, by changes in law that previously guaranteed 'fair use' of airwaves so that anything that gave air to one political party’s perspective required fair time for the other political party. The Supreme Court and U.S. legislators gutted those provisions of fair use requirements long ago, and thus the harnessing of TV, Cable and Radio airwaves, and later blogs, and even leading newspapers and journals by political perspectives took hold. This has helped fuel the tribalization of perspectives and has driven the 'filter bubble' phenomenon of individuals being surrounded and inundated by views that they want to have around them, rather than the generally objective, occasionally uncomfortable form of news that used to inform the body politic. Similar patterns seem clear in the rise of populist news platforms, blogs, and social media networks in Europe. Second, the eruption of social media networks, video, and digital tools enhanced not only by artificial intelligence that has been around for some time, but by generative AI, that has created a strategic leap in the power content creators has changed the power relationship between news providers and news consumers. Now many more players, many untutored in the skills and norms of journalism, have become content providers, and that content often seems like or mimics news. I started a successful political blog, The Washington Note, in early 2004, and my target was the mainstream news media as I saw them largely as homogenized, lazy, often missing key stories — and thus my blog at the outset was designed to shame and blame major news media for their own inadequacies and to provide better news and service to my own readers. Many blogs did this, and thus 20 years ago, the fragmentation of media, in my view, helped improve mainstream media which had to compete and re-establish itself as providers of quality news — a responsibility for which they had been lazy and inattentive. However today, the challenges to mainstream media are messier as the challengers do not necessarily fill the gaps left by a poorly performing mainstream media — they instead often create fake or ‘unreal’ media, deep fakes, memes, or engage in outright propaganda or perpetuate mistruths. Not all new media do this, but there is no doubt that lots of new media are up for sale, up for political harnessing, up for attention and celebritization of their platforms and content. So what to do? I feel that too many governments, think tanks, and public private foundations concerned with news quality have been clutching their pearls too much, lamenting the eroding quality of journalism and news rather than competing head-to-head with new content providers and low-quality new media outlets. It seems clear to me that for media to return to a healthier place and to become part of the solid social contract in democratic societies, they need to evolve. My belief is that the deep fake creations of some media are worrisome but only have impact on vulnerable societies if there is no competition with them. How are old media investing in new tools of story-telling? How are they embracing a less centralized approach to who their story tellers might be? How could they be promulgating and inculcating a younger generation of content makers with norms about sourcing, about real facts, about objectivity, about the importance of uncomfortable news and not just opinion-reaffirming news or perspectives? How are they experimenting with all of the new waves of technology coming online to make themselves the more attractive news and content option — thus stealing space and oxygen from those who are faking it and deceiving society. My sense is that some states, Russia being just one, are taking advantage of this gap between old and new media — and they are exacerbating the negative impacts created by a lack of modernization and vision of traditional media platforms. My sense is that for the old media to grow and compete, they need to be part of the media fragmentation wave, and rather than over-centralizing need to figure out how to disseminate quality news across a fragmented sphere of options. This is hard to do - and it challenges the way newspapers and TV networks of record organize their work. But I believe that the fragmentation is not going away, and thus news organizations that want to assure their place in healthy civil society need to adapt.

Idols & Idealism: Swami Dayanand Saraswati, The Militant Monk Of ...	Swami Dayanand declared (in the first Charter of the Arya Samaj) ‘the well-being of the whole humanity will be the objective of the Samaja’. Two years later, in 1877, he expressed among the principles of the Arya Samaj that of doing good to the whole world, while improving the physical, spiritual, and social conditions of humanity. April 2025 will mark 150 years of the founding of the Arya Samaj Kathiawad, the peninsular region distinguishing India’s western coast at its farthest north end, continues to remain in the news for Dwarka and Somnath, its ancient temple-towns and temples. In 19th century CE, Kathiawad is where several champions of Indian nationalism were born: namely, Swami Dayanand Saraswati (1824-1883), Pandit Shyamaji Krishnaverma (1857-1930) and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948). Each one of them spent their lives working for ‘freedom’ from colonial rule and oppressive policies towards education, law and human rights. The impact they made has. without doubt, shaped and molded not only contemporary India but the modern world till date. A 150 years ago, on 10 April 1875, Swami Dayanand established in Bombay the ‘Society of the Men with Higher Principles’ or the Arya Samaj that was to spread out its influence across India. As a preacher-teacher-public speaker, Swami Dayanand was passionate as his ideological predecessors in Bengal - Raja Rammohun Roy and Keshub Chunder Sen, driven by a universal kindness of the kind which is rarely experienced in our globalized world. Swami Dayanand Saraswati Swami Dayanand declared (in the first Charter of the Arya Samaj) ‘the well-being of the whole humanity will be the objective of the Samaja’. Two years later, in 1877, he expressed among the principles of the Arya Samaj that of doing good to the whole world, while improving the physical, spiritual, and social conditions of humanity. And in the Satyartha Prakash (The Light of the Truth) he wrote: 'I believe in a religion based on all-embracing universal principles, that have always been accepted as truths by mankind and will continue to be obeyed down the ages to come. I call this the Eternal Primitive Religion: because it is above the hostility of all human beliefs. This alone I hold to be acceptable and worth believing by all people and down all times.' Satyartha Prakash was written in Sanskrit. When Dr Prithwindra Mukherjee – a poet, historian, musicologist, translator – was writing his magnum opus The Intellectual Roots of India’s Freedom Struggle (1893-1918), he highlighted that most people believe India’s struggle for independence to have begun with Mahatma Gandhi. 'Little credit goes to the proof that this call for a mass movement did not arise out of a void. For the past century and more, historians have overlooked the phase of twenty-five years of intense creative endeavour preceding and preparing for the Mahatma’s advent. The reason for this systematic omission has been the fundamentally radical nature of the revolutionary programme put to practice by Indian leaders of late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,' it stated. Dr Prithwindra’s study carefully detailed the origins – philosophical, historical and religious and intellectual, so to say – of Indian nationalism. From Raja Rammohun Roy (1772-1833), Mahatma Rajnarain Basu (1826-1899), Bankimchandra Chatterjee (1838-1894), Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856-1920) to Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941), Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), and Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950). Swami Dayanand was one among these intellectual giants, who stood on each other’s shoulders and acquired a ‘very sophisticated understanding of the contemporary political reality’. They became emblems of their epoch, its aspirations. Eternal truth: The chapter on Swami Dayanand is titled ‘The Quest of the National Soul’ and it takes the reader through the life, times and teachings of the militant monk: 'At a very young age, disillusioned by abuses of idolatry, by social practices based on ignorance of the true spiritual life and on colonial exploitation, Dayanand put at the people’s service all his encyclopedic learning of the Hindu scriptures to revive Vedic teachings in order to solve contemporary problems, religious, social, political, and cultural. Having sworn not to borrow anything from Western thought, Dayanand never learned any European language. This permitted him to define the true nationalist existence inspired by the principles of a strictly Indian tradition and to go beyond the ritualistic and mytho-centric interpretations of the Vedas. Dayanand chalked out the general principles sufficient to regenerate the Indian nation. He considered the Vedas as ‘something more: the very speech of the eternal Truth on which can be founded—in a sure and justified manner—the human knowledge of God and man’s relationship with the divine being as well as with the like.' The challenge for Swami Dayanand was to show the compatibility of spiritual life and the science of national government. It may seem strange for modern global netizens but the Swami in his ‘Introduction to the commentaries of the Rigveda’ (Rigvedadi-bhashya-bhumika), interpreted a section of the Vedic verses in the light of burning political issues of the time. Wrote Dr Prithwindra, 'Uniting, thus, the innate intuition of Aryan spirituality with an acceptable rational methodology by dialectic mentality, Dayanand established the fundamental unity of the Indian people where the plurality of languages, of sects, of behaviours and of customs only assumed a superficial but enriching role. According to Dayanand, whatever the excellence of a foreign government, it could never replace the qualities of a self-management. To acquire the political independence of India as a nation chosen to reveal a new spiritual light to humanity, Dayanand undertook a programme of fierce struggle. This struggle would require: The exclusion of all ideological debt to foreign sources and the institution of an obligatory educational system for all children and teenagers (boys and girls), based on the residential academies of Vedic type (gurukula). ‘Be they princes and princesses or children of beggars, they will be submitted to the same food, sartorial regime, to the same absolute law of continence.’ The teaching would be physical, aesthetic (music, dance, theatrical art and authentic diction of the Vedic hymns), ethical, intellectual and spiritual.' The arduous programme of intellectual studies that Swami Dayanand recommended, has been reconstituted by B.B. Majumdar, a scholar who dedicated his life deepening the understanding Indian political thought. Spread over twenty-two years, the academic programme included: a) Phonetics; the grammar of Panini, the Mahabhasya of Patanjali (3 years); (b) The Vedic lexicon as established by Yaska in the Nirukta (8 months); (c) Prosody by Pingala (4 months); (d) The Laws of Manu, the Epics (the Ramayana, entirely and important portions of the Mahabharata); (e) The six orthodox Schools (darshana) of Indian philosophy and the ten main Upanishads (2 years); (f) All the four Vedas and the supplementary Brahmanas (6 years); (g) The science of life (Ayurveda) including medical and surgical treatises (4 years); (h) Music, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, geography, geology and astronomy (3 years); (i) Economics and policies, containing civil and military protections (2 years). Vedic scholars believe that as strength and the physical activity grow, the intellect of students becomes subtle enough to seize the most abstruse and profound subjects, hence they should have access to the highest knowledge. As citizens and parents of future citizens, they would be able to discharge their responsibilities. National character: On the subject of degradation of national character caused by the centuries of slavery, there is considerable unity of thought between these iconic intellectuals of the 19th century CE from Raja Rammohun Roy to Swami Vivekanand, Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi. With Swami Dayanand Saraswati, his insistence was on: (1) The personal integrity and health of the teachers. Each of them by his or her example should awaken among their subjects ‘qualities required such as truthfulness in words, in acts and in thought, decorum, the self-control, sweetness of conduct’. Among the gurukula institutions which strived to develop education in India, Sabarmati (the educational community founded by Gandhi), at Santiniketan and the Vishvabharati (school and university founded by Tagore), at Pondicherry (the International Centre of Education founded by the Mother based on Sri Aurobindo’s teachings) exemplify these standards. (2) The acceptance of Hindi as the national language and of the Vedas as the source of the people’s religious life. (3) A conversion of the strata of population, unjustly oppressed by the ignorance and the intolerance of Hindu orthodoxy. (4) The end of all foreign government in India: Swami Dayanand would raise his voice to endeavour to fight, humiliate, and destroy unbelievers, even if they were sovereign over the world, even if they were powerful. (5) Electing a president of the sovereign republic by universal suffrage, since the people are sovereign. Fiercely opposed to the autocratic reign, conscious of the fallibility and corruptibility of an individual propelled to the supreme command, Dayanand insisted on the vast learning and on the human qualities of the future president. According to Vedic injunctions, the State should be composed of three colleges of elected citizens, all of them known for their integrity: (a) the legislative college; (b) the religious college; (c) the college of fine arts and sciences. As per the Arya Samaj website, there are approximately 2500 schools, colleges and universities in operation under the Arya Samaj; 400 Gurukuls running on residential education system; several orphanages are being managed for upbringing of more than 20000 orphans; almost 1500 hospitals and dispensaries are serving the people. Besides there are training centres, homes for the aged and sick, training centres for women and residential centres for the youth studying in colleges and universities. The vision of Swami Dayanand Saraswati has become a reality. Prime Minister Narendra Modi remarked, on 200th birth anniversary of Swami Dayanand Saraswati on 11 February 2024, 'Swami Dayanand was a saint who envisioned a bright future for Bharat. The belief that Swami ji had in Bharat, we must transform that same belief into our self-confidence during our ‘Amrit Kaal’. Swami Dayanand was a harbinger and a guide of modernity. Inspired by him, all of us need to lead Bharat towards modernity in this ‘Amrit Kaal’, to make our country a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (Developed India).'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jSCPTXDW2KOw	2025-03-18T09:41:47-07:00	
A National Asbestos-Exposure Registry Of Veterans Could Combat Mi...	Many U.S. veterans are suffering from asbestos-related illnesses due to past military exposure, highlighting the urgent need for a national asbestos-exposure registry to improve early detection, diagnosis, and access to VA benefits. In 1922, the U.S. Navy identified the naturally occurring asbestos mineral as the most efficient and cost-effective insulation, gaskets, and shipbuilding material. During World War II, asbestos was critical to the U.S. military, especially the Navy and the Air Force. Shipping and shipbuilding were essential, and parts of military aircraft and incendiary bombs also contained asbestos. Even as demand exceeded supply, in 1942, a presidential order banned the use of asbestos for non-military purposes until 1945. The application of asbestos-based material by the military and most U.S. industries continued to increase until the 1970s, when its carcinogenic nature came to light. The use of asbestos started to be regulated but was not banned. The extensive application of asbestos by the U.S. armed forces led to asbestos-caused conditions, such as mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer, among veterans who were exposed to asbestos dust during their service years. As asbestos-related malignant illnesses can take between 20 and 50 years to start showing symptoms, the number of asbestos-caused deaths in the U.S. has been increasing in the past decades, and veterans are disproportionately affected. This is well illustrated by medical reports, which show that about one-third of mesothelioma patients are veterans. Mesothelioma is a deadly and aggressive cancer that is exclusively caused by asbestos exposure. Timely and appropriate diagnoses are the only option to find suitable treatment, alleviate symptoms, and prolong life expectancy when it comes to conditions caused by asbestos contamination. Unfortunately, the misdiagnosis of asbestos illnesses, especially mesothelioma, is far too common in the U.S. According to a medical study, about 14 to 50 percent of mesothelioma diagnoses are incorrect. The problem could be alleviated by having a national database enlisting military members with known and suspected asbestos exposure during their service years. Such a database would be an excellent tool for veterans' referrals to regular and specialized medical check-ups. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) need to consider setting up such a registry. Early Detection Is Crucial Mesothelioma and asbestosis are exclusively caused by asbestos exposure when people inhale airborne asbestos fibers. The microscopic mineral particles attack the lungs and the membranes around them in the first place, causing permanent damage and, eventually, cancer. While asbestosis is a type of pulmonary fibrosis, the scarring of lung tissues, mesothelioma is a cancer that develops in the membrane around the lungs, abdomen, heart, or reproductive organs. Mesothelioma poses a significant challenge to the medical community. It is hard to diagnose because its initial symptoms resemble more common lung diseases. Moreover, it progresses rapidly after the first symptoms appear, which happen at a later stage of the cancer. Medical studies show that exposure to all types of asbestos increases the risk of lung cancer, the second most common cancer in the U.S. Similar to mesothelioma, its symptoms do not appear before the cancer is already at an advanced stage. However, if it is detected early, it can be treated successfully. The VA urges veterans to get tested for asbestos-related diseases, especially mesothelioma. However, a more systematic approach is needed because many veterans might not even be aware that their health is deteriorating due to exposure, which happened decades ago. Based on a national asbestos-exposure registry, veterans could be regularly reminded and called for specialized health check-ups, such as chest X-rays, CT scans, and pulmonary function (breathing) tests to reveal any damage caused by inhaled asbestos particles. The number of U.S. veterans has been declining and continues to do so. For example, in 1980, about 18 percent of the adult population were veterans, but by 2022, their proportion was only 6 percent. The decline in the number of veterans is primarily due to the overall veteran population aging, and many passing away. Illnesses, such as respiratory conditions and cancers, contribute to this process. Asbestos Takes Many Veteran Lives in All U.S. States While the number of asbestos-caused deaths has been increasing nationwide, some states are affected more than others. California is among the top three states with the largest veteran population in the U.S., with over 1.48 million veterans in 2023. California also has the most military installations in the country, with the Navy having a strong presence in the coastal state. Considering the military's decades-long extensive use of toxic asbestos, it is not surprising that California had 27,080 asbestos-caused deaths between 1999 and 2017, which is the most in the country. Many of these people whose lives were taken by asbestos-related illnesses were veterans. California used to mine and produce large amounts of asbestos, which was then used at its military bases. For instance, the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard, located northeast of San Francisco, was the first Navy base on the West Coast. During WWII, it was one of the busiest naval shipyards in the world. Over 500 naval vessels were constructed, and thousands were overhauled at the Mare Island yard while it operated. Los Angeles County had the most asbestos-related deaths between 1999 and 2017 (around 4,979 victims). The County was home to Long Beach Naval Shipyard (1943-1997), an important site for maintaining U.S. Navy surface ships. As of 2023, Texas had the highest veteran population in the country, with more than 1.5 million. Between 1999 and 2017, Texas was also among the top three states with the most asbestos-related deaths, with 15,348 individuals. Currently, the state is home to 15 active military installations, some of which are among the largest military facilities in the U.S. Approximately half of the Navy's strike pilots are trained in Texas at Naval Air Station Kingsville and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. Veterans Should Know About Existing VA Support The military, as well as manufacturers, were aware of the hazards posed by asbestos years before its use started to be regulated and still exposed millions of veterans to its danger. Policymakers and some manufacturers have been trying to compensate for the harm caused by setting up asbestos trust funds and VA disability benefits and health care for veterans diagnosed with asbestos-linked conditions. The disability compensation application process with the VA has been more straightforward since 2022 when Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson's Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act (PACT Act) was passed. Asbestos and asbestos illnesses have been added to the list of presumptive conditions, and more than 1.4 million veterans have been approved for benefits nationwide thanks to the Act. Having a national asbestos-exposure registry to rely on would significantly improve not only the diagnostic outcomes, but also more veterans could receive the well-earned benefits. Having a disability, especially at an older age, is an enormous burden, not only mentally and physically, but financially, too. Veterans should claim what is rightfully theirs and offered by the VA and the trust funds. Our veterans who sacrificed so much for our country deserve all the effort and support they can get.

Neutral Paths To Peace: Alternative Peacekeeping Solutions For Uk...	In 2025, the geopolitical landscape surrounding Ukraine has grown increasingly complex as Russia categorically rejects the involvement of the United Kingdom and French peacekeeping forces in the region. This refusal, driven by longstanding historical grievances and current strategic interests, forces the international community to seek alternative avenues for stabilizing Ukraine. The thesis of this article contends that a successful peacekeeping solution in Ukraine requires the integration of neutral, multinational forces with the endorsement of both the United Nations and alternative regional organizations, as well as the careful incorporation of non-aligned nations whose military capabilities have been increasingly documented in the International Institute Peacekeeping Database of 2025. At the heart of this debate is the need for a peacekeeping mission that balances the imperatives of neutrality and legitimacy. The United Nations, with its decades of experience in deploying peacekeeping missions in complex conflict zones, offers one of the most viable options. The UN’s history of impartial mediation and the diverse composition of its peacekeeping contingents have often served as a stabilizing force in regions characterized by intense external rivalries. The International Institute Peacekeeping Database of 2025 highlights that missions sanctioned by the UN have achieved a success rate exceeding 65 percent in conflict de-escalation and ceasefire implementation. However, the necessity for approval from the UN Security Council, where Russia wields significant veto power, complicates this approach. Russia’s ability to influence the structure and the composition of such a mission may force the UN to consider a more inclusive and flexible mandate to secure consensus among all key stakeholders, including those who might be predisposed to oppose Western military involvement. An alternative to a UN-led mission is the deployment of forces under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE has already played a monitoring role in Ukraine, and its existing framework provides a platform for expansion into a more robust peacekeeping initiative. The OSCE’s membership, which includes both Western and Russian-aligned states, creates an environment where decisions are based on consensus, and mutual accountability is expected from all parties involved. Data from the 2025 Peacekeeping Efficiency Report indicates that missions operating under multilateral frameworks such as the OSCE tend to foster trust among conflicting parties by emphasizing balanced participation and transparency in operational mandates. Despite these strengths, the OSCE is hampered by limited enforcement mechanisms and relies heavily on diplomatic engagement rather than military might, which could be problematic if the situation in Ukraine escalates further. The involvement of non-aligned nations, such as India, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa, Egypt, and Argentina, presents a third pathway to building a credible and acceptable peacekeeping force. These nations, known for their strategic non-alignment and historical contributions to global peacekeeping efforts, offer a less controversial alternative to Western-led contingents. The International Peacekeeping Database of 2025 reveals that these countries have consistently contributed to peacekeeping missions with operational effectiveness comparable to traditional Western forces, yet their participation is often viewed as a gesture of neutrality that can appeal to both Russia and Ukraine. In practice, a coalition of non-aligned nations could circumvent the deep-seated mistrust associated with NATO’s historical interventions, thereby reducing the likelihood of escalation. Nonetheless, the formation of such a coalition is not without its challenges. Coordination among nations with diverse military doctrines, logistical capabilities, and political interests could lead to operational inefficiencies. Moreover, the absence of a centralized command structure may further complicate rapid response efforts in volatile situations. The notion of a BRICS-led peacekeeping initiative, involving influential members such as India, Brazil, China, Indonesia, and South Africa, has also garnered attention in policy circles. While BRICS has played a key role in proposing alternative models of international cooperation, including China in this group may be counterproductive. Ukraine is particularly concerned about the indirect influence of major powers with competing interests. The data from 2025 underscore that while BRICS nations have robust military capabilities and extensive peacekeeping experience, the political dynamics within the group can result in divided strategic objectives. This inherent tension may impede the formation of a unified command structure, thereby reducing the operational effectiveness of any proposed mission. In addition to these alternatives, the idea of a joint peacekeeping force with rotating leadership deserves attention. This force, made up of multinational contingents with leadership roles rotating among neutral countries, could help reduce the perception of any single nation dominating the operation. The 2025 Global Peacekeeping Assessment indicates that rotating leadership models have proven effective in maintaining operational neutrality and promoting a sense of shared responsibility among participating nations. However, implementing such a model requires overcoming significant bureaucratic inertia and ensuring that all parties adhere to the agreed-upon rotation schedule without compromising the mission’s strategic objectives. Despite the potential benefits of these alternative frameworks, several problems and challenges persist. The primary challenge lies in achieving a consensus among a diverse group of international actors, each with its own strategic priorities and historical sensitivities. Russia’s entrenched opposition to Western-led initiatives continues to be a major impediment, and any alternative must be carefully structured to avoid perceptions of partiality or undue influence. Logistical challenges also abound; deploying a multinational force from countries with disparate levels of military technology, training, and operational readiness could result in inefficiencies that undermine the mission’s credibility. Furthermore, financial constraints and the need for sustained international commitment pose additional hurdles, as peacekeeping operations often require long-term investment beyond initial deployment. In conclusion, the evolving conflict in Ukraine demands a rethinking of traditional peacekeeping paradigms. With Russia firmly rejecting the participation of the United Kingdom and French forces, alternative approaches that incorporate the neutrality of UN-led missions, the inclusive framework of the OSCE, and the balanced involvement of non-aligned nations emerge as the most promising solutions. Each option, however, brings its own set of challenges—from the intricacies of UN Security Council negotiations to the operational complexities of multinational coalitions. The International Institute Peacekeeping Database of 2025 serves as a critical resource in guiding these decisions, providing empirical evidence of the efficacy of various models. Ultimately, a successful peacekeeping mission in Ukraine will depend on the willingness of all involved parties to compromise and commit to a collective vision of peace and stability, ensuring that the region is safeguarded against further escalation and that the voices of all stakeholders are given due consideration.

Balochistan: The State Is Inactive, The Terrorists Are Taking Con...	On March 16, 2025, a bomb explosion near a bus carrying security forces in the Noshki district of Pakistan's Balochistan province killed at least five officers and injured dozens of people, according to police authorities. The attack comes less than a week after a deadly train hijacking incident in the southwestern province. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility on Sunday for the attack in the Noshki area of Balochistan. This separatist terrorist group, known for its terrorist activities aimed at enforcing Islam, was also behind the train hijacking that killed dozens of people. Police officer Zafar Zamanani said the explosion caused severe damage to another nearby bus. The dead and injured were taken to a nearby hospital. Balochistan's Minister of State, Sarfaraz Bugti, condemned the attack and expressed his sorrow over the loss of lives. 'Those who play with the peace of Balochistan will meet a tragic end,' Bugti said in an official press statement. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shahbaz Sharif, also condemned the attack, which comes as Pakistan faces an increasing security crisis in its border areas with Afghanistan. Kamal Haider, a journalist for Al Jazeera, stated that the attack occurred on a convoy of at least eight buses transporting security personnel from Noski to Taftan, near the border with Iran. 'First, there was an improvised explosive device, and then a burst of gunfire from the attackers.' Local sources say they fear the death toll may rise, he added. The incident comes less than a week after the BLA ambush on the Jaffar Express, where they held approximately 400 people hostage and killed 26 of them, including soldiers, before security forces launched an operation and killed all 33 attackers. In recent years, the country has seen an increase in attacks, including those carried out by the TTP, which is ideologically aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Last year, there were more than 1,500 deaths in the country due to these attacks. The Taliban have denied any role in the attacks. What exactly is happening right now with the army of the terrorist organization BLA that continuously carries out attacks in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, and who is behind it? Pakistan, engaging in false propaganda, stated on Friday that the train hijacking last week was carried out by 'terrorists' who were communicating with 'handlers in Afghanistan,' while claiming that India was the mastermind behind it. However, to get to the truth, we need to take a more substantive reading of the tense situation in Balochistan, which, due to Pakistan's flawed policies, operates as a haven for terrorists who cause terror in the surrounding areas. Initially, the issue of China's involvement in Pakistan must be addressed, as China is using it to promote its economic interests through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan has been a significant economic and trade hub in China's effort to dominate Southeast Asia through the BRI. While the cooperation between China and Pakistan could have benefited the economies of both countries, in the end, Pakistan, as the weaker member of the equation, became a pawn in China's expansionist policy without receiving corresponding economic benefits as a country. A similar situation was experienced by other countries in crisis, such as Greece in 2011, which gradually sold its ports to the Chinese, but ultimately only the Chinese side benefited from this agreement, not the Greek. The situation in Balochistan, which has become a stronghold for Islamist terrorists, is largely a response from its dissatisfied residents to the continuous state indifference they feel. Living in poverty and lacking access to education, they are the most fertile primary material for being radicalized by the fanatical Islamist terrorists of the BLA. The living conditions in Balochistan are so dire that the deadlock experienced by the people easily turns into fanaticism. Despite being the most resource-rich province of Pakistan, Balochistan's natural wealth is primarily exploited for the benefit of the central government and other provinces, leaving the local population deprived of basic services. The persistent practice of enforced disappearances, targeting Baloch activists, students, and citizens, has drawn condemnation from international human rights organizations. This systematic oppression has intensified the sense of injustice among the Baloch. Ongoing military actions against the Baloch population, including indiscriminate killings and severe bombings, have driven many in the region towards armed resistance. The continued reliance on military force, rather than dialogue, has only exacerbated the bitterness and turmoil. Especially regarding women's rights, the police often refuse to record cases of violence against women while civil society in Pakistan remains indifferent. On the other hand, feminist movements in the country, such as the well-known Aurat March, rarely acknowledge the unique struggles of Baloch women. In this context, the Baloch Unity Committee (BYC), the leading civil rights movement in Balochistan, stands out from the dominant feminist movements in Pakistan. What needs to happen in Balochistan, in order to stop the vicious cycle of violence and terrorism, is for military operations in Balochistan to cease, as well as enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions. A substantial dialogue between the state and Baloch leaders must be initiated immediately so that human rights protection for the people of Balochistan can begin. While the Pakistani government often tries to shift the blame for its shortcomings, the crisis in Balochistan undoubtedly stems from its flawed policies. If the state truly aims to restore stability, it must prioritize political, economic, and social justice over military solutions. Without such reforms, Pakistan will continue to struggle with a destabilizing crisis in Balochistan. Linguist Noam Chomsky stated, 'Everyone is concerned about the elimination of terrorism. Well, there is a very easy way. Stop participating in it.' To implement this saying, Pakistan must give the necessary importance to this province.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jTz6UQInD2wU	2025-03-18T09:37:07-07:00	
Robert Reich: How To Fight The Trump Regime’s Use Of Fear And Int...	The major weapon of the Trump-Vance-Musk regime is fear that causes people to be intimidated into silence and submission. The regime is using fear — of being deported, job loss, loss of federal contracts, loss of access to sources of news, of arrest and imprisonment — to intimidate potential critics. This is what all tyrants do, but we are unaccustomed to it in the United States. I want to share with you three rules for fighting tyrannical fear and intimidation, gleaned from discussions I’ve had with a number of people who have lived in repressive regimes. 1. If at all possible, do not give into it. Fear works only if people are intimidated. Intimidation is effective only if people surrender to it. I cannot presume to tell anyone how to balance their personal well-being against their obligations to the nation or the world. I’m in no position to suggest that anyone sacrifice their livelihood or freedom to make a point. So if you’re a civil servant in the U.S. government, especially an attorney in the Justice Department, I can understand your fear that speaking out or refusing to follow Trump’s orders will get you fired. If you’re a journalist or editor, you may be justifiably fearful that if you report the truth you’ll be barred from Trump press briefings or may even lose your job. Likewise, if you’re in America on a student visa or even hold a green card, you may be understandably reluctant to speak your mind now. Trump has threatened that the recent arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University grad student who is a permanent resident of the United States and who peacefully spoke out against Netanyahu’s policies in Gaza, will be the first of 'many to come.' On the other hand, if you’re the president of Columbia University, you’re in a different position altogether. I can understand your concern that your institution will suffer loss of federal funds if you allow full freedom of speech on your campus, yet that doesn’t mean you should surrender to Trump’s tyranny. If you do not stand up to it, you and your institution and other American universities will sacrifice far more over the long term. If you’re a Republican lawmaker, you have every reason to worry that if you vote against Trump, you’ll be primaried in the next election. But that doesn’t justify your silence in the face of Trump’s tyranny, either. What’s the point of being in politics if you have no principles? If you’re a Democratic lawmaker, you might worry that if you speak out — as did Congressman Al Green during Trump’s address to Congress — you’ll be tagged by Trump as a radical 'left-wing' troublemaker. Good! Make good trouble, as Congressman John Lewis used to say. Stand up and speak out! Americans want to know there’s a loud and vital Democratic opposition to Trump. If you’re a partner in a law firm that Trump has targeted for punishment because your firm has represented clients he deems his enemy, you should not be intimidated from representing others he considers enemies. To the contrary, hold a press conference and announce that you will represent even more people Trump hates, and you’ll do it pro bono. At a time like this, people who occupy positions of power and visibility — members of Congress, university presidents, top editors and CEOs of major media enterprises, senior partners in major law firms — must not cow to Trump’s threats. Now is the time for them and their institutions to stand up to his tyranny — and be seen and heard by the public as exemplars of democratic courage. Giving in to intimidation only invites more intimidation. If the Trump regime can 'detain' a graduate student with a green card for peacefully protesting the policies of the Netanyahu government, what’s to stop the regime from 'detaining' full citizens who engage in such protest or in any protest against the Trump regime? If the regime can silence Republican lawmakers by threatening to finance opponents in primary contests, what’s to stop it from trying to silence Democratic lawmakers by threatening to finance opponents in Democratic primaries? If Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic senators so easily surrender to Trump and Republicans on a continuing resolution to fund the government, how can they hold the line against Musk and Trump’s illegal impoundments and mass firings? If the Trump regime can intimidate law firms that have helped Democrats or other clients Trump considers to be his enemies, what’s to stop the regime from trying to intimidate anyone who funds Democratic candidates? If the Trump regime can remove money from New York City’s own bank account with Citibank, rescinding funds that Congress appropriated to house refugees (as has been recently reported), what’s to stop the regime from threatening to remove funds from your bank account if you criticize the regime? The fear and intimidation must be stopped. The most direct way to stop it is not to give in to it. 2. Join with others who are similarly situated to sue the regime and speak out. Sometimes there’s safety in numbers. When the Trump regime targets one institution or one group or one person, it may be difficult for that target to respond on its own. But when joined with others who are potentially threatened, the targets can fight back. Rather than Columbia University fighting the Trump regime solely on its own, Columbia should also join with other universities that have been targeted and sue the regime for violating their rights and the rights of their students under the First Amendment to the Constitution. The group should also sound the alarm about the regime’s attack on higher education and freedom of speech. (The American Association of University Professors would be one obvious vehicle for this.) Individually, public servants who lose their jobs or who are threatened with job loss have very little power. But when joined together under the auspices of, say, the American Federation of Government Employees, the UAW (which represents many public employees), or the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, they have considerable clout. Together, they should sue the regime for violating the law and mount a major campaign to alert the public to what is happening. Individual law firms and individual attorneys are more likely to be intimidated than the American Bar Association, which should now be an active vehicle for uniting many firms and attorneys against the Trump regime’s threats. Individual journalists or media companies are more easily threatened than the American Society of Journalists, the Society of Professional Journalists, or PEN America. Now is the time for these groups to be heard as well. In sum, now is the time for a concerted and organized public response to the regime’s attempts to sow fear and intimidation. National organizations with the necessary breadth and status must stand up to the Trump regime — loudly and clearly rejecting his brazen attempts to sow fear and intimidate opposition. 3. The rest of us must support these efforts. All of us have a stake in stopping the regime’s fearmongering and intimidation. All of us can help targeted individuals, institutions, and organizations take a stand. To the extent we are able, for example, we can contribute to the legal defense of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, here. We can ensure that students and faculty know what to do if ICE comes to their campus, here. We can contribute to other universities now under the Trump regime’s gun — and encourage these institutions to stand up to Trump’s tyranny rather than submit to it. We can contribute to groups such as the PhD project, a nonprofit that helps students from underrepresented groups earn doctoral degrees in business — which the Trump regime absurdly claims violates the Civil Rights Act by discriminating against white students. We can support the American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause, Indivisible, and other groups that are showing the leadership and courage needed these days to take on Trump. We can buy subscriptions to media organizations that are helping to lead the charge against the tyranny of the Trump regime (such as the nonprofit I helped launch and continue to work with, Inequality Media Civic Action). We can show up at town halls where our senators and representatives are appearing, tell them exactly what we think of the Trump-Vance-Musk regime, and ask them to join us in opposition. Finally, we can — and must — protect people who are being targeted by the regime. In addition to university students, this includes hardworking members of our communities who are being hunted down for not having the right documents to prove citizenship; LGBTQ+ people who are being demeaned and discriminated against because of their sexual identities or orientations; and public servants — public prosecutors, judges, and government workers — who are being hounded because they have done their duty. Tyranny is possible only if people submit to it. The Trump regime cannot control us through fear and intimidation if we’re energized, mobilized, and organized. This is a time for all of us — and every institution in America — to stand up to Trump’s tyranny.

Bangladesh Interim Govt Reacts To Tulsi Gabbard Interview – OpEd	Muhammad Yunus-led interim government in Bangladesh has reacted furiously over the remarks of Tulsi Gabbard, Director of National Intelligence for the US, on the situation in Bangladesh. In an interview with NDTV, Gabbard said the 'longtime unfortunate persecution, killing, and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and others has been a major area of concern' for the Donald Trump administration. She also reiterated Trump's commitment to fight Islamist terrorism in the world, including countries like India and Bangladesh. A spokesperson of Bangladesh's interim government said in a social media post: 'We note with deep concern and distress the remarks made by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, in which she alleged 'persecution and killing' of religious minorities in Bangladesh and that 'the threat of Islamic terrorists' in the country is 'rooted' in the 'ideology and objective' to 'rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate'. 'This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism.' The interim government spokesperson said Gabbard's comments are 'not based on any evidence or specific allegations'. 'They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges of extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts,' the spokesperson said. The interim government spokesperson said, 'groundlessly linking Bangladesh to the idea of an 'Islamist caliphate' undermines the hard work of countless Bangladeshis and their friends and partners around the world who are committed to peace, stability, and progress'. 'Bangladesh strongly condemns any efforts to link the country to any form of 'Islamist caliphate',' he said. 'Political leaders and public figures should base their statements, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions. In support of our shared global efforts to combat extremism and terrorism, the Interim Government of Bangladesh remains committed to engaging in constructive dialogue based on facts and on respect for the sovereignty and security of all nations,' the interim government spokesperson said. Tulsi Gabbard's comments involving Bangladesh seems to have been influenced by three factors, says sources privy to her discussions with Indian leaders like Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. One of those factors includes the release of convicted Islamist terrorists by the Yunus administration during the last seven months it has been in power, of which 290 Islamist militants, convicted for heinous crimes, have been released so far. This does not include militants who were freed forcibly or escaped through jailbreak. Inspector General of Prisons Brigadier General Syed Mohammad Motaher Hossain told a press conference sometime ago that while nearly 2,200 inmates broke out of different jails across the country, 700 of them are still roaming free and the rest returned to prisons to serve their terms or were rearrested by law enforcement agencies. 'Out of the 700-odd (jail breakers), 70 are extremists and death row convicts,' Hossain told a media briefing. The prisons chief said 174 known figures, including 11 top listed criminals, gangsters and extremist group leaders, obtained bail from courts after August 5, though police said they kept a vigil on their tracks. Indian leaders have conveyed their deep concern to Tulsi Gabbard during their discussion, insisting that the Islamist militants, freed or released, posed a 'direct threat' to India because the groups they are affiliated with groups that have sworn India to be their enemy. Gabbard's reiteration of Trump's commitment to fight Islamist radicalism was as much a statement of American policy as to placate raw nerves in India. But it came as a boost to secular forces in Bangladesh who are worried over the free run enjoyed by Islamist radicals in the country since Yunus took charge. Gabbard's flagging the issue surely puts the Yunus administration under increased pressure to rein in the Islamist radicals who have not only stepped up attacks on religious minorities ,but also Muslim women who don't follow orthodox religious norms like purdah and hijab. Some say Gabbard's lashing out was in response to the freedom of assembly enjoyed even by banned Islamist groups like the Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which recently organised a public rally in Dhaka. 'If this is not a clear evidence of Yunus administration's patronage of Islamist radicalism, what is,' said Awami League spokesperson Dr Selim Mahmud. Dr Mahmud said that the government spokesperson was recounting Bangladesh's counterterrorism efforts which is misleading. 'The counterterrorism efforts they are talking about happened when the Awami League government was in power. Our government had zero tolerance to terrorism, but Yunus are patronising the very elements we tried to crush,' said Dr Mahmud. He welcomed Tulsi Gabbard for 'calling out Yunus' bluff' and went on to allege that 'Yunus is deliberately trying to stay on power illegally by using the Islamist street power which has turned Bangladesh into a vendetta Republic ruled by mob power.' Major political parties in Bangladesh are calling for early elections to the national parliament since the interim government has no legal basis in the Bangladesh constitution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jQ8K4AmYGLKA	2025-03-18T09:32:01-07:00	
Baloch Rebellion Poses New Challenges To Pakistan – OpEd	The long-drawn out armed secessionist movement in Balochistan (Pakistan's largest and poorest province) is evolving into more dangerous and sophisticated forms, posing a significant challenge to the country's stability. In a daring and novel attack last Tuesday, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) hijacked the Quetta-Peshawar Jaffar Express, carrying nearly 400 passengers, near a series of mountain tunnels 160 km from Quetta. A firefight with security forces resulted in the death of 21 civilians and four paramilitary personnel. The rebels used passengers as human shields The year 2024 was particularly violent for Pakistan, with the BLA carrying out more than 150 attacks. However, Tuesday's incident was unprecedented, involving hijacking, hostage-taking, and prolonged combat. It was the first case of hijacking and hostage taking by the BLA. Political commentator Najam Sethi described the attack as a wake-up call for the Pakistani State, urging the military and political leadership to set aside differences and formulate a united strategy to eliminate the BLA. He also accused foreign powers of aiding the group and suggested Pakistan adopt an 'offensive-defensive' strategy, targeting BLA bases and supply routes in Afghanistan and Iran. To curb suspected Indian support for the BLA, he urged the restarting of 'Jehadist' (Islamic militant) infiltration into the India's Kashmir region. But Sethi regretted that despite frequent accusations, Pakistan has failed to provide credible evidence of Indian involvement, reflecting the incompetence of its military establishment. He acknowledged the political and economic roots of the Baloch rebellion but insisted that military suppression must come first before any political or economic concessions. Otherwise, he warned, the rebels would perceive negotiations as a sign of weakness. Afghanistan Factor The BLA's funding sources remain unclear, though analysts suggest extortion, smuggling, and drug trafficking from Afghanistan play a role. According to The Khorasan Diary, the BLA also benefits from weapons left behind in Afghanistan after the US withdrawal from that country in 2021. However, Pakistan's strained relations with Afghanistan limit its ability to take counter action. The trigger for the souring of Pakistan's relations with Afghanistan was Pakistan's air attacks against hideouts of armed groups including the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan. The TTP has been wreaking havoc in Pakistan by its attacks against the Pakistan army and civilians. A report by the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) said that terrorist attacks killed around 500 civilians and a similar number of security forces in 2023. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces bordering Afghanistan accounted for most of the terror attacks and the resulting casualties. Pakistan has repeatedly demanded from the Taliban government in Afghanistan effective management of 2,600-kilometer border. But so far, the situation has not been brought under control. In October 2023, Pakistan decided to expel illegal Afghan nationals staying in Pakistan. This decision further damaged the goodwill that some Afghans had for Pakistan. Iran Factor There have been military hostilities between Pakistan and Iran too. Iran's Shia theocratic regime has felt ideologically discordant with Sunni-majority Pakistan. Pakistani leadership has also at times viewed the relationship through a sectarian lens. Iran has had a negative perception of Pakistan due to its strong relations with geopolitical forces opposed to Iran: such as the US and the Gulf powers, especially the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. For Pakistan, Iran has been a difficult and not very useful neighbour due to its bad relations with the US. Iran has also had a close relationship with Pakistan's arch rival India. Pakistani leaders have long suspected Iran of supporting and providing haven to anti-Pakistan ethno-nationalist groups on its soil. Internal Causes While external factors have had a role to play, the Baloch rebellion is primarily rooted in local factors. Though rich in natural resources like coal, gold, copper, and gas, Balochistan remains Pakistan's most underdeveloped province. Despite being home to the strategically important Gwadar port and the US$ 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Balochistan sees little benefit from these projects. Since the mid-1970s, its share of the national GDP has declined from 4.9% to 3.7%. The province also suffers from the highest infant and maternal mortality rates, the highest poverty levels, and the lowest literacy rate in the country. The royalties from its natural resources are disproportionately lower than those received by politically powerful provinces like Sindh and Punjab. Moreover, economic opportunities in Balochistan are monopolized by non-Balochis, fuelling local resentment. A History of Rebellion Balochistan's struggle for autonomy dates back to Pakistan's formation in 1947 when it attempted to remain independent but was forcibly annexed. Since then, the province has witnessed at least five major separatist uprisings. The BLA, however, emerged only in the late 1990s, led by Baloch Marri, son of veteran nationalist Nawab Khair Bakhsh Marri. The BLA showed its teeth in 2006 after the military, under Gen. Pervez Musharraf, killed prominent Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Bugti. Unlike moderate Baloch nationalist groups seeking autonomy, the BLA has never pursued a middle ground and remains committed to an armed struggle for independence. Suicide Attacks, Educated Militants In 2010, the BLA launched its suicide squad, the Majeed Brigade. In 2018, BLA leader Aslam Baloch sent his own son on a suicide mission targeting Chinese engineers in Dalbandin. Later that year, the BLA attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi, killing four locals. In 2022, the group gained global attention when a female suicide bomber, Shari Baloch, targeted Chinese nationals at Karachi University, killing four, including three Chinese. Malik Siraj Akbar, a researcher on the Baloch separatist movement, told Al Jazeera that the BLA's leadership has shifted from tribal chiefs figures to educated middle-class youth, many of whom were once part of the non-violent Baloch Students Organization (BSO). The group now attracts young, educated recruits who see armed struggle as the only path to survival. Many of the BLA's new recruits include professionals such as IT specialists and data analysts, allowing the group to expand its digital and strategic capabilities. Historical Mistrust and Military Suppression Government repression, enforced disappearances, and poor governance have further fuelled the insurgency. Mistrust between the majority Punjabi population and the Baloch minority was exacerbated by the 'One Unit Scheme' introduced by military ruler Gen. Ayub Khan in 1955. The plan merged Pakistan's four Western provinces into a single entity to counterbalance the larger Bengali population in East Pakistan. Baloch nationalists resisted, fearing reduced representation and resource exploitation. The One Unit scheme ended in 1970, but tensions persisted. In 1973, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto dismissed Balochistan's National Awami Party (NAP) government, accusing it of conspiring with foreign powers. This sparked a fresh violent insurgency. A temporary truce was established under military ruler Gen. Zia-ul-Haq in 1977, but autonomy demands remained unaddressed. Under the rule of Gen. Pervez Musharraf, military operations intensified. In 2009, Baloch militants carried out 792 attacks, resulting in 386 deaths. Violence escalated in 2010, with 730 attacks and 600 fatalities. No End in Sight Balochistan remains locked in a cycle of violence and repression. The Pakistani state continues its heavy-handed approach, while the BLA grows increasingly sophisticated. Without addressing the deep-rooted grievances of the Baloch people, Pakistan is unlikely to see lasting peace in its most restive province.

The Role Of Private Sector In Creating A Prosperous, Dynamic Viet...	The private sector in Vietnam has not only helped expand production, trade, and services but also made an important contribution to improving labour productivity, promoting innovation, and increasing national competitiveness, the Nhan Dan website reported. The strong rise of many Vietnamese private enterprises has not only enabled them to dominate the domestic market but also gained a foothold in international markets. General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee To Lam has written an article about the development of the private economic sector, considering it as a lever for building a prosperous Vietnam. The Party chief said that the strong growth of many Vietnamese private enterprises has exceeded the domestic market to establish their brands on a global scale. 'This proves that with a favourable development environment, Vietnamese businesses can truly thrive and compete fairly with the world,' Lâm wrote. After nearly four decades of Đổi Mới (Renewal), Việtnam has transformed from a centrally planned, inefficient economy with an average income of only US$96 per capita in 1989, to the 24th largest economy in the world in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). By the end of 2025, the country is expected to enter the group of countries with upper-middle income, equivalent to over $5,000 per person per year. Việtnam’s economic growth rate has always been twice the average of developing countries, despite global economic fluctuations. According to the Vietnam News website, Party General Secretary Lâm underscored that this achievement is not only the result of the development policies under the Party’s leadership with bold and decisive reforms in institutions, policies and integration, but also the result of the hard work, creativity, determination and tireless efforts of the entire nation. The private economy plays a significant role in these achievements, said the Party chief, adding that the private sector has become one of the key pillars of the national economy and has proven to be the most important driving force for the country’s economic growth. With nearly one million enterprises and around five million local businesses, the private economy now contributes about 51 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) and more than 30 percent of the State budget. The private sector has also created over 40 million jobs, accounting for more than 82 percent of the total labour force in the economy, and contributes nearly 60 percent of total social investment. However, the private economy still faces multiple barriers that hinder its development, preventing it from achieving breakthroughs in terms of scale and competitiveness, Lâm said in the article. He explained that the majority of Vietnamese companies are small and micro-sized, with limited financial capacity, management skills and innovation, as well as limited connections with each other and with foreign direct investment (FDI). Heading towards a vision for the country's growth, the private economy also needs to be conscious of its mission, according to Party General Secretary Lâm. He wrote: 'The private economy must be the pioneering force in the new era, successfully carrying out the mission of industrialising and modernising the economy, enhancing national competitiveness and embracing social responsibilities. 'A prosperous economy cannot rely solely on the public sector or foreign investment, but must be based on the internal strength of a robust private sector, which plays a leading role in innovation and national development,' Lam said. The goal is that by 2030, the private economy will account for about 70 percent of national GDP. The Party leader also stressed that the political system must re-position its viewpoint and awareness of the role of the private economy as the leading growth driver for the country. This requires a fundamental change in policy-making, overcoming limitations and leveraging the advantages of the market mechanism to support the private sector in improving productivity and fostering innovation, he wrote. The State also needs to develop and implement a strict legal framework for protecting property rights, including intellectual property and intangible assets, minimising legal risks and reducing sudden policy changes that could pose harm to businesses, the Party chief wrote. According to the Vietnam News, we are living in a historic moment, witnessing unprecedented technological advancements and a rapidly changing international landscape filled with both cooperation and competition where opportunities and challenges go hand in hand. Yet, with unwavering resilience, determination, and a burning ambition, Vietnam is fully capable of achieving new miracles in socio-economic development! The Party leader also stressed that the political system must re-position its viewpoint and awareness of the role of the private economy as the leading growth driver for the country. Party leader Lâm noted that private enterprises should actively embrace social responsibility, not just in terms of financial contributions or charity but also through responsible business policies that improve the living standards of workers, support community development and practice transparent and efficient governance. A strong economy is taking shape, led by a generation of bold, innovative, and passionate Vietnamese entrepreneurs filled with the business acumen and patriotism, writing new chapters of success. A bright future - a socialist Vietnam standing shoulder to shoulder with global powers, as envisioned by President Ho Chi Minh - is gradually becoming a reality in the near future. With the right policies and a favourable business environment, the private economy will not only help Việtnam achieve its high growth targets, but also turn into a high-income economy in the next two decades, the Party chief stated. 'This is the moment to act, to create a prosperous, dynamic Việtnam that will increasingly elevate its position on the global stage,' he wrote. The private sector in Vietnam has been contributing a lot for the country’s economy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jUc9vuLKzxCG	2025-03-18T09:27:22-07:00	
Diplomacy Or Deception? The Fragile Truce On The LAC – OpEd	In October 2024, India and China announced a landmark agreement to de-escalate tensions along their disputed Himalayan border, the Line of Actual Control (LAC). This pact, reached ahead of a rare formal meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was seen as the most significant diplomatic breakthrough since the deadly 2020 Galwan Valley clashes. The agreement outlined measures such as troop withdrawals, dismantling temporary infrastructure, and restoring pre-2020 patrolling patterns in contested regions like Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh. However, months later, the supposed breakthrough appears to be more symbolic than substantive. While both nations publicly advocate peace, their actions on the ground reveal a different reality—one of continued military preparedness and strategic maneuvering. Despite the agreement’s promise of de-escalation, both India and China continue their aggressive military build-ups along the LAC. China’s 'dual-use' infrastructure strategy has seen the construction of villages and military outposts near the disputed border. Though presented as civilian settlements, these facilities enhance China’s ability to quickly mobilize troops, reinforcing its hold over contested areas. India, too, has ramped up its infrastructure efforts. The construction of the Sela Tunnel, which ensures year-round access to northeastern border regions, is a clear indication of India’s determination to bolster its strategic positioning. Rather than a move toward genuine disengagement, these developments suggest that both nations are preparing for potential future conflicts. A critical flaw in the agreement is the fundamental difference in how India and China interpret the LAC. Previous attempts to clarify the boundary have failed, leaving room for both nations to claim adherence to the pact while continuing their strategic pursuits. The lack of a transparent and enforceable mechanism to verify troop withdrawals and patrol rights renders the agreement little more than political theater. For instance, the restoration of pre-2020 patrolling rights raises questions. If India and China cannot agree on where the LAC lies, how can they ensure mutual compliance? This ambiguity enables both sides to maintain their positions under the guise of following the agreement while making strategic gains on the ground. Beyond military tensions, China’s recent plans to build the world’s largest hydropower dam on the Brahmaputra River add another layer of geopolitical rivalry. The project, located near Arunachal Pradesh, gives China significant control over water flows that sustain millions of people in India’s northeastern states. Once operational, this dam could serve as a strategic tool for China, allowing it to exert pressure on India through water management. India has expressed concerns and is planning countermeasures, but the project underscores China’s growing leverage in South Asia’s water politics. The border dispute is just one facet of the broader India-China rivalry. Both nations are engaged in a wider strategic contest that extends beyond the Himalayas. India’s deepening ties with the West, particularly through initiatives like the Quad (comprising India, the US, Japan, and Australia), are seen by Beijing as part of a broader effort to contain China’s rise. Meanwhile, China’s expanding influence in South Asia, including its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments in neighboring countries, is viewed with suspicion in New Delhi. As China consolidates its position in the region, India finds itself navigating a complex diplomatic landscape, balancing cooperation with its strategic partners while managing its contentious relationship with Beijing. The unresolved border tensions have also taken a toll on economic relations between the two nations. Bilateral trade remains significant, with China being India’s largest trading partner. However, the deteriorating political climate has led to growing calls within India to reduce economic dependence on China, particularly in critical sectors such as technology and infrastructure. India has imposed restrictions on Chinese investments and banned several Chinese apps, signaling its intent to counter China’s economic dominance. Yet, despite these measures, India continues to rely on Chinese imports, particularly in electronics and pharmaceuticals, highlighting the complexities of economic disengagement. At its core, the October 2024 agreement is a diplomatic maneuver rather than a genuine effort toward reconciliation. While it provides a temporary pause in hostilities, it does little to address the deep-rooted mistrust and strategic differences that define India-China relations. Real peace requires more than symbolic agreements—it demands actions that foster mutual confidence and address underlying grievances. Without a clear roadmap for conflict resolution and enforceable verification mechanisms, the agreement is unlikely to bring lasting stability to the Himalayan border. The India-China border pact of 2024 highlights the fragile nature of diplomatic efforts in an environment of deep strategic competition. Both nations remain locked in a precarious coexistence, with agreements serving as temporary bandages rather than genuine solutions. As long as both sides continue their military buildups and pursue conflicting geopolitical ambitions, the LAC will remain a flashpoint for potential conflict. Until a truly binding and enforceable agreement is reached, India and China’s uneasy truce will persist, shaped by a mix of diplomatic engagements and strategic posturing. For now, peace along the Himalayan frontier remains a distant dream, overshadowed by the harsh realities of geopolitical rivalry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jfjtOoivvswD	2025-03-18T09:25:21-07:00	
Pakistan: Hostage Nation – Analysis	By Ajit Kumar Singh 'The bickering nation'. This one sentence aptly describes the current state of Pakistan, where the two major terrorist/insurgent formations - the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an umbrella group of 56 terrorist outfits, and the Baloch insurgents - have created havoc. A third terrorist group - the Islamic State - is also on a rampage. Meanwhile, the political landscape is turbulent, while the economy is in complete disarray. Indeed, within a span of a week, between March 10 and March 16, 2025, Pakistan recoded at least 38 terrorist attacks, resulting in 104 confirmed deaths [including 14 civilians, 45 Security Force (SF) personnel and 45 terrorists). Unconfirmed reports, however, put the death toll to 406. In the deadliest attack during this period, one that was brazenly audacious even by the Pakistani standards, on March 11, militants hijacked a train, the Jaffar Express, with over 400 passengers-onboard, after they blew up the railway track between Quetta, Balochistan, and Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which took responsibility for the attack at Dhadar in the Bolan area of Balochistan, according to varying media reports, freed around 80 passengers, mostly women and children, but held hundreds of other passengers, most of them Pakistani Army personnel, hostage. They were demanding that authorities release jailed militants. On March 12 the Pakistan Army launched an operation to end the crisis. On March 14, the Army declared that the operation had ended with the killing of all 33 militants involved in the attack. It further disclosed that 26 hostages, including 18 SF personnel, three railway officials and five civilians, were killed by the terrorists before the start of the Army operation. During the operation, apart from 33 terrorists, five Frontier Corps (FC) soldiers were also killed. The Army stated that a total of 354 hostages were rescued, including 37 injured passengers. The BLA, on the other hand, claimed that its fighters inflicted a 'devastating and unforgettable defeat' on the Pakistani military as it has executed all 214 Pakistani military hostages taken during the seizure of the train. Some of the other major attacks (involving three or more fatalities) during this week included: March 10: Seven FC soldiers were killed when Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) targeted their vehicle with improvised explosive device (IED) in the Mehnaz area of Buleda tehsil (revenue unit) in the Kech District of Balochistan. While claiming responsibility for the attack, the BLF reiterated its determination to continue targeting Pakistani SFs and state-backed projects, declaring, 'We reaffirm our commitment to continue our struggle until Balochistan's liberation is achieved.' March 10: Three non-local people from Sindh were shot dead when unidentified assailants opened fire at a barbershop in Katagari area of Panjgur District in Balochistan. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, so far. March 14: SFs thwarted a terrorist attack on a check post and killed 10 militants, following a suicide attack in the Jandola area of South Waziristan District in KP. March 16: Three FC personnel were among five persons killed when a vehicle-borne BLA suicide bomber targeted an FC convoy in the Rakshani Mill area of the Regional Corporate Development N-40 Highway in the Nushki District of Balochistan. However, the BLA claimed, 'Immediately after the attack, the Fateh Squad of the BLA advanced and completely surrounded another bus, systematically eliminating all military personnel on board, bringing the total number of enemy casualties to 90.' According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), Pakistan has already recorded at least 849 fatalities (120 civilians, 277 SF personnel and 452 terrorists) in 2025 (data till March 16). During the corresponding period of 2024, 369 persons (120 civilians, 115 SF personnel, 130 terrorists and four Not Specified, NS) were killed. Through 2024, there was a total of 2,236 fatalities (582 civilians, 754 SF personnel, 896 terrorists, four Not Specified). Significantly, terrorism-related fatalities are again surging in Pakistan since 2020, with 365 in 2019; 506 in 2020; 664 in 2021; 971 in 2022; and 1,513 in 2023. Though violence has been reported from across Pakistan, KP and Balochistan accounted for the maximum number of fatalities. According to SATP data, of the 849 fatalities recorded in 2025, 504 were reported from KP, followed by 336 in Balochistan, six in Sindh and three in Punjab. In 2024, KP recorded 1,363 fatalities, followed by Balochistan, 774; Punjab, 59; Sindh, 38; and the Islamabad Capital Territory and Gilgit-Baltistan, one each. The surge coincides with the ascendency of the Afghan Taliban since the February 29, 2020, Doha deal, and the subsequent capture of power in Kabul. Significantly, the return of Afghan Taliban has helped TTP regroup and has strengthened the outfit, which had been on a decline due to successive military operations that followed the June 8, 2014, attack on the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, Sindh. With violence on a rise in KP, SFs had to divide their focus between Balochistan and KP, creating opportunities for the Baloch insurgents to intensify their operations as well. Reports indicate that efforts were also made to form some sort of 'working arrangement' between TTP and the Baloch separatists. Speaking during the United Nations Security Council briefing on Afghanistan in New York on March 10, 2025, Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Munir Akram claimed that TTP was collaborating with other terrorist groups present in Afghanistan, including BLA and the Majeed Brigade, the BLA's 'special forces unit', adding that the latter sought to destabilise Pakistan's ties with China. Earlier, on June 26, 2024, the Balochistan government claimed that TTP and BLA were trying to establish a joint base for terrorist operations in Balochistan, but the attempt was foiled. During a press conference, Zia Lango, Balochistan Home Minister, observed that Nasrullah alias Maulvi Mansoor and 'Commander' Idris alias Irshad, who had come to Balochistan to plan terrorist acts in collaboration with BLA, had been arrested. Former Balochistan Chief Minister and President of the Balochistan National Party, Akhtar Mengal, wrote on X on March 12, 2025, There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority. They have lost this war-completely and irreversibly. It is over. We warned them, just as those before us warned them. But instead of listening, they mocked us. They dismissed our words as empty threats, while they fueled a system of oppression, looting, and bloodshed. Every single government-without exception-has played its role in the systematic genocide of the Baloch people. This is the one issue where every institution, every administration, every so-called leader has always stood united-against us. And rather than acknowledge their crimes, they have done what they do best: shift the blame onto others. But today, I want to make something very clear. To the federal government, to the political parties, to the judiciary, to the establishment-you have brought Balochistan to the brink of destruction with your own hands. But this time, it is beyond our control. And it is beyond yours as well. Further, on March 14, National Party lawmaker, Phullain Baloch, claimed that the BLA is so heavily stocked with potential suicide attackers that it has suspended further recruitment. He warned that the security situation in Balochistan has deteriorated to the point where elected representatives can no longer visit their constituencies safely. He asserted that 'the voices of Balochistan's representatives are not heard,' and lamented that without genuine electoral and governance reforms, Balochistan's ongoing conflict will only intensify. Meanwhile, the Islamic State continues to operate in Pakistan as well. The Islamic State-Khorasan Province/Islamic State-Pakistan Province (IS-KP/IS-PP) claimed 29 attacks in the country in 2024, in which 58 persons, including SF personnel, were killed and 105 were injured. IS-KP/IS-PP have already claimed three attacks in 2025, in which one person has been killed and two injured. Meanwhile, the country's socio-economic condition remains dire. According to the World Bank's latest updates, Over one-third of school-age children across Pakistan were found to be out of school; nearly two-thirds of those in school in Financial Year (FY) 24 were learning deprived; and alarmingly high rates of stunting - 40 percent in FY23 - persist. Critical constraints, including recurrent fiscal and current account deficits, protectionist trade policies, unproductive agriculture, a difficult business environment, a heavy state presence in the economy, and a financially unsustainable energy sector, have remained largely unaddressed, leading to slow and volatile growth… The estimated lower-middle income poverty rate is 40.5 percent (USD 3.65/day 2017 PPP) for FY24 with an additional 2.6 million Pakistanis falling below the poverty line from the year before. And further, Downside risks to the outlook remain high, with the recovery expected to continue but predicated on the new IMF-EFF [International Monetary Fund/Extended Fund Facility] program remaining on track and on additional external financing inflows. Continued fiscal restraint will dampen aggregate demand, income, employment, and poverty alleviation. Heavy banking sector exposure to the sovereign, domestic policy uncertainty, federal-provincial government political misalignments and geopolitical instability pose significant risks. Political volatility continues as well, with the puppet civilian government, which came to power after heavily rigged elections and direct involvement of the Military Establishment in forming post-elections alliances. Meanwhile, the 'people's choice', Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Imran Khan continues to languish in jail. Summing up the current situation in a tweet on January 9, 2025, Imran Khan stated, 'There is a plan to impose a ten-year dictatorship in Pakistan, of which two years have already passed. Judges or police officers who become a party to oppression are rewarded with promotions here… Economic prosperity requires investment, which is impossible without institutions adhering to their boundaries and responsibilities as defined by the Constitution. Surging terrorism in the country is causing irreparable damage to the confidence of the investors.' In an apparent reference to the military, Khan added, 'Tragically, those responsible for countering terrorism are using all their resources and energy to corner our party.' Pakistan is hostage, not only to multiple terrorist groups, but to the Military Establishment as well, which, unhinged by its weakening grip over the public, has intensified political manipulation and repression. Under the prevailing circumstances, the country can only look forward to a future in chaos.

Why Proposed Revisions To Indonesia’s Military Law Alarm Democrac...	By Tria Dianti Indonesia’s legislature has fast-tracked discussions on a bill to revise the country’s military law with provisions that may expand the armed forces’ role in civilian governance – a move critics warn could erode decades of democratic progress. The legislature, largely controlled by allies of President Prabowo Subianto – a former general with ties to Indonesia’s authoritarian past – has prioritized advancing the bill. Proposed revisions may expand the roles of active-duty military officers in civilian government agencies. BenarNews could not verify a Reuters report, which quoted the defense minister as saying that any military appointee would have to retire from the service to take a civilian position. Analysts and activists say the proposed changes could entrench military influence in bureaucracy, undermining civilian supremacy and weakening institutional checks on military power. Here’s what you need to know about the proposed changes and why they’re drawing strong reactions. What does the new bill propose? The proposed amendment to the 2004 Law on the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) introduces several changes aimed at expanding the military’s role beyond defense. The 2004 law itself was a landmark reform that reduced the military’s role in civil affairs. It stripped the armed forces of their political representation in parliament and formally ended the long-standing 'dual function' (dwifungsi) doctrine, which had allowed the military to intervene in civilian governance.Prabowo Subianto, then an Indonesian presidential candidate, greets army chiefs during celebrations for the 67th anniversary of the Indonesian Army Special Forces in Jakarta, April 24, 2019. (Willy Kurniawan/Reuters) The revision expands the roles of active-duty military officers in civilian government agencies, adding institutions such as the Attorney General’s Office and the National Counterterrorism Agency to the list of eligible placements, according to a draft bill shared by Amnesty International Indonesia. However, Reuters quoted Defense Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin as saying that a new provision had been added to draft bill, according to which any military officer assigned to a ministry or state agency must retire. 'We could only propose them to [be assigned to] a ministry or state agency after their retirement,' he told reporters, according to Reuters. Currently, military personnel are permitted to serve in only 10 specific ministries and state institutions, such as the Ministry of Defense, the National Intelligence Agency and the Search and Rescue Agency. A new clause would also grant the president the authority to appoint military personnel to other ministries as needed, according to the draft. It broadens the military’s non-combat functions, allowing members to serve in institutions that deal with cybersecurity, narcotics enforcement, and other domestic affairs. Why is this controversial? Indonesia has spent the past 25 years limiting the military’s involvement in politics and civilian governance. Under the late President Suharto’s New Order regime (1966–1998), the armed forces exercised a 'dual function' (dwifungsi), controlling both security and administrative affairs. Post-Suharto reforms sought to dismantle this structure, ensuring that military officers remained within the defense sector and under civilian oversight to prevent abuses of power. Critics argue that the proposed bill risks reviving military dominance in governance by giving active-duty officers more influence over civilian institutions. The proposed changes could affect military conduct or human rights violations cases where impartiality is crucial to ensuring justice, indicated Virdika Rizky Utama, a researcher at the Jakarta-based think-tank PARA Syndicate. 'How can active-duty officers in the Attorney General’s Office remain impartial when they are still bound by military command?' he asked. 'If the military gains influence over the justice system, who will hold them accountable?' Opponents also argue that the bill would increase military control over non-defense sectors, including food security and national infrastructure projects. How does this affect Indonesia’s democracy? The bill raises concerns about civil-military relations in a country that has worked hard to transition to democracy. Human rights groups warn that increased military involvement in governance could weaken civilian control and blur the lines between defense and law enforcement. A report by a Jakarta-based security and human rights watchdog group Imparsial found that, even before the bill’s revision, at least 2,569 active-duty officers were serving in civilian roles, some of them outside the legal framework. The concern is that formalizing this trend will make it harder to roll back in the future. 'This risks weakening the principle of civilian supremacy in governance and could lead to military dominance within the civil bureaucracy,' said Dimas Bagus Arya, a coordinator at the human rights group KontraS. Why is the bill being criticized for lack of transparency? One of the biggest criticisms of the bill is the way it has been discussed – behind closed doors, with little public input. The latest draft was introduced less than a month ago, following a letter to the House from President Prabowo endorsing the bill. Lawmakers fast-tracked discussions, meeting last Friday and Saturday at a luxury hotel in Jakarta – an unusual move given the government’s ongoing austerity measures. 'What’s the urgency?' asked Muhammad Isnur, chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation. 'Why rush it? And why discuss it at an expensive hotel? People have every right to be suspicious.' During a protest on Saturday, two activists were forcibly removed from the hotel after attempting to disrupt the meeting. Amnesty International Indonesia condemned the incident, saying it violated the right to peaceful protest. ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR) said on Monday that it had received accounts of security personnel at the hotel reporting some activists to the police for allegedly disturbing public order and resisting state officials on duty. 'APHR was also informed that the office of KontraS – one of the member organizations in the Civil Society Coalition for Security Sector Reform was subjected to terror tactics, actions that undermine democratic debate and erode public trust in government institutions,' the organization comprising Southeast Asian lawmakers said in a statement. On Sunday, a coalition of 186 civil society organizations started collecting signatures for a petition against the bill, gathering nearly 7,500 within 24 hours. How is the government justifying the bill? Minister of State Secretariat Prasetyo Hadi denied that the proposed amendments would roll back democratic gains. 'No, absolutely not. We can assure you that the revisions to the TNI Law will not bring back the dual function,' Prasetyo told reporters. The government and the House of Representatives argue that the bill is necessary for national security and modernization. The Ministry of Defense has said it is necessary to adapt to modern threats, such as cyber warfare and transnational crime. Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, deputy speaker of the House of Representatives (DPR), insisted that concerns over expanded military influence in civilian affairs were misplaced. 'The objections I’ve seen on social media misrepresent the actual content of the bill,' Sufmi told reporters on Monday. 'There’s been speculation about a revival of the military’s dual function, but if you look at the revisions, it’s clear that we at the DPR remain committed to upholding civilian supremacy,' he said. What happens next? Lawmakers plan to finish reviewing the bill before its recess on March 21, ahead of the Eid al-Fitr holiday. With the legislature largely controlled by Prabowo’s allies, critics worry it will sail through with little opposition. Civil society groups suspect the timing is deliberate, pushing the bill through when public attention is likely to be elsewhere. For many Indonesians, the debate is about the future of their democracy. Bivitri Susanti, a constitutional law expert at the Center for Law and Policy Studies, said that the proposed revisions allowing military personnel in civilian governance could reduce accountability and concentrate power. 'Placing a military mindset within a system meant to be democratic will inevitably have serious consequences,' Bivitri told BenarNews. 'It would lead to authoritarianism.'

Budget Scoring Of Legislation To Extend The Auction Authority Of ...	By Harold Furchtgott-Roth Wireless spectrum is an asset whose value has increased rapidly in the past few decades. But transferring control of spectrum from one entity to another has proven difficult. Coordination of wireless spectrum in the United States is divided between two federal agencies: the NTIA for federal spectrum, and the FCC for non-federal spectrum. Before 1993, the vast majority of spectrum was federal, used by federal agencies, and coordinated by the NTIA. Much spectrum remains either exclusively federal or shared between federal and non-federal users. Some federal spectrum has been efficiently used; other federal spectrum has not. Auctioning federal spectrum licenses to non-federal users was one of the most important innovations in spectrum policy. From 1994 through 2023, the FCC conducted approximately 100 auctions and raised hundreds of billions of dollars of receipts for the US Treasury. Beyond the revenue generated by these receipts, the auctions’ greatest economic contribution has been distributing wireless spectrum to higher-valued uses. Markets’ main benefit is their ability to allocate assets to the highest-value uses. Through FCC auctions, private entities bid billions of dollars for spectrum that previously was used by federal agencies. By willingly taking the auction receipts in exchange for spectrum, the federal government reveals that it values the receipts more than the spectrum. Private entities reveal that they value the spectrum more than the auction receipts. All parties to the auctions are better off. The greatest winners from FCC spectrum policy in recent decades are American consumers—and, indeed, consumers around the world. Over the past three decades, Americans have benefitted from a wide range of new services that rely on spectrum previously under federal control. Wireless service providers can offer new products thanks to both greater spectrum access and decreased government regulation. Other countries, seeing the enormous value of wireless services, have followed suit both by implementing spectrum auctions and limiting regulation. Imitation is not merely the sincerest form of flattery; it is also the basis for exporting innovative American technologies and innovative forms of American regulation. But American innovation both in wireless technology and wireless regulation has slowed. By 2021, the FCC had practically exhausted the supply of federal spectrum that was ready for transition to non-federal use. Despite substantial and growing demand for commercial wireless spectrum, the NTIA has added little, if any, to the pipeline for auction in recent years. So even if the FCC restarted auction authority today, there is little federal spectrum available. Some causes are below: Federal agencies are protective of the spectrum they use and generally lack incentives to free up frequencies for more efficient uses. The federal government has no market mechanism to assess which federal spectrum is worth keeping and which would be better transferred to non-federal use in exchange for auction receipts. On the other hand, non-federal customers pay annual spectrum fees, which continually demonstrates the value they ascribe to their spectrum use. Even when it receives federal spectrum, the FCC may decide not to auction it. The commission can instead allocate this spectrum for uses that are not assigned by auction, such as satellite services and unlicensed devices. Competing interests in the same band may cause substantial delays in auction decisions and substantial reductions in auction receipts. For example, the FCC recently initiated a notice of inquiry (NOI), rather than a notice of proposed rulemaking, for an FCC decision in the Upper C-Band. That entire band is currently under FCC control, but the NOI will delay the FCC’s decision. Moreover, the FCC is considering options for the Upper C-Band that may result in few to no auction receipts. If federal spectrum allocations become fixed and inflexible, FCC auctions will generate fewer receipts even if Congress extends FCC auction authority. More importantly, American consumers suffer when spectrum is not put to its best and highest-valued use as revealed through auctions. Alternative Legislative Language for Better Budgetary Results Congress is considering two approaches to restarting FCC auction authority. Under one approach, FCC auction authority would simply be restarted. But the NTIA would not be required to reallocate any spectrum from federal use, the FCC would not be required to auction any spectrum for full-power use, and neither agency would need to meet any timeline. The FCC has some non-federal spectrum ready for auction: the returned DISH spectrum and the Upper C-Band. But it is unlikely that the commission will transfer any federal spectrum to non-federal use. Under the other approach, as in S.3909, the Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2024,1FCC auction authority would be combined with the following requirements: Minimum threshold amounts of spectrum to be transferred to the FCC for auction. Under S.3909, the NTIA would identify 1,250 megahertz of spectrum currently allocated for exclusively federal or shared federal use between 1.3 gigahertz and 13.2 gigahertz to be transferred to the FCC for non-federal use. In the past four years, no spectrum has been transferred from federal to non-federal use. In the four years prior to that, as little as 100 megahertz of spectrum (3.45 to 3.55 gigahertz) were transferred to non-federal use. Without minimum requirements, the NTIA is not likely to transfer a meaningful amount of federal spectrum to the FCC for auction in a timely manner. A bill similar to S.3909—meaning, a bill requiring a defined minimum amount of spectrum to be auctioned under a specific timeframe—can expect substantially higher receipts in the next 10 years than a bill without required minimum amounts. Minimum threshold amounts of spectrum to be auctioned for full-power use.Of the spectrum transferred to the FCC under S.3909, at least 1,250 megahertz would be auctioned for full-power use. The FCC has the authority—and in recent years has preferred—to allocate spectrum for low-power purposes, unlicensed purposes, or satellite services. These are worthy allocations, but they generate fewer, if any, auction receipts. A bill similar to S.3909 would generate substantially higher receipts in the next 10 years than a bill without minimum threshold amounts of spectrum to be auctioned for full-power use. Tight timelines for the NTIA and the FCC. S.3909 would set tight timelines for the NTIA to identify federal spectrum to be transferred for non-federal use and for the FCC to auction much of that spectrum. Without these timelines, the NTIA might belatedly or never identify federal spectrum to transfer to the FCC. For the past eight years, it has identified little spectrum. The timelines would give the administrator of the NTIA substantial leverage to force recalcitrant agencies to identify spectrum in a timely manner. The timelines would also require the FCC to auction the spectrum within a few years. A bill similar to S.3909 would generate substantially higher receipts in the next 10 years than a bill without timelines for actions by NTIA and the FCC. Taken together, these provisions mean that a bill similar to S.3909 should receive a substantially higher budget score than a bill that would simply extend FCC auction authority.

Thomas Aquinas And The Subjective Theory Of Value – Analysis	By Federico Silva Thomas Aquinas is, without doubt, the greatest Roman Catholic philosopher and theologian when it comes to the depth of his thought and the degree of his influence. Although this is the case, it might seem strange at first to see him mentioned in relation to the history of the subjective theory of value. It was Rothbard nonetheless who first pointed out that the direct ancestor of the Austrian School is the Salamanca School, a Roman Catholic school of Scholastic philosophy and theology, rooted in and deeply indebted to Aquinas. It is necessary to keep in mind that Aquinas was not doing legal theory, nor economics (which did not even exist as separate disciplines by then), but rather moral theology and theory of justice. Under that light, commerce only appears as a subordinate topic to justice. In spite of this fact, I shall prove that we can extract some valuable insights regarding the history of the theory of value from the Thomistic theory of right. It is also somewhat useful, for the sake of the following discussion, to remember that the first Austrian. Carl Menger, was a lawyer, not a mathematician. The Austrians never forgot that the normative and positive aspects of our economic reality are deeply intertwined, although it was still necessary to distinguish between them. Normative disciplines, such as ethics or law, presuppose the validity of praxeological claims. Praxeology, as the general theory of human action, is therefore the real missing link between economics and law. This is my personal assessment that underlies everything I have to say about the relationship between Aquinas and praxeology. The Thomistic Theory of Right and Praxeology Aquinas definitely understood 'right' as involving some kind of human action. Some even argue, like the Thomistic philosopher Massini Correas, that 'right' belongs to the metaphysical category of action. Laws are not 'right' proper, but are a certain 'definition' of right (aliqualis ratio iuris), meaning that they establish certain rights and obligations, commands and prohibitions, to all the subjects involved, and therefore, they are a rule and measure of human acts. In his theory of right (ius), Aquinas takes 'right' as being synonymous to 'what is just' (iustum), and defines it as 'certain action (opus) adequate to another according to a certain mode of equality.' He then differentiates between natural right and positiveright. In another place, Aquinas explains that some positive laws are a direct application of natural law principles by way of mere logical deduction (per modum conclusionis), which is beyond the scope of this article. What I do want to focus on instead is his conception of 'positive right' as the regulatory domain that natural law leaves human freedom to determine (per modum determinationis), which is by far the biggest area to explore. Contrary to what some might expect, for Aquinas it is crystal clear that there is a positive right when 'somebody considers himself satisfied if he receives a certain amount' (aliquis reputat se contentum, si tantum accipiat). In other words, the primordial criterion to determine the 'fairness' of such commercial transactions, besides natural law itself, is the satisfaction of individual subjective preferences. This can be divided into two categories. There can be private right by private agreements (privatum condictum), when a contract is signed between private parties to have something 'adequate' and 'commensurate' to one another, or by public agreement (ex condicto publico), when all the people consents to having something adequate and commensurate to one another, or what the king (princeps) mandates. I do not believe it is forcing the interpretation if we assert that there is a praxeological truth implicit in his notion of contracts. He says that there is a private right if A considers himself satisfied with what he receives from B and B considers himself satisfied with what he receives from A. This does not simply point to the subjective theory of value, but also to the ordinality of subjective preferences. Both give up something to receive another thing that is subjectively more valuable according to their individual preferences. They give up a good that they value less for something that they value more. There is a mutual consent in giving up something in order to go from a less satisfactory situation to a more satisfactory one. Praxeological Aspects of 'Fair Price' When discussing 'fair price' (iustum pretium), Aquinas even goes on to say, following Aristotle’s Politics, that essentially 'buying and selling seem to have been introduced for the common benefit (communi utilitate) of both [parties], namely when one desires [indiget] the thing of the other, and vice versa.' Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, he is completely blind to the law of supply and demand, not only because it was not yet discovered at the time, but because what he strives to prove in the referred section is that selling overpriced goods is a violation of 'commutative justice' (i.e., commercial fairness). The praxeological element to 'fair price' is mainly that price in general, and fair price in particular, is always established by the common utility of market participants. Exchanges, Aquinas argues, 'should not be more of a burden to one party than to another,' because there should always be a 'proportion' (aequalitas, lit. 'equality') between the quantity of the thing offered and its respective price. This might seem strange for people coming from a common law context, where freedom of contract reigns everywhere (at least in theory), and judges usually do not interfere with the content of contracts, even when one of the parties evidently made a 'bad deal.' In the civil law tradition, nevertheless, it is customary for judges to consider 'inequality of consideration' in contract law, especially when the initial conditions were unilaterally modified, making the contract disproportionately more burdensome for the party considered 'weak.' With this fact in mind, we have to distinguish what an exchange is, economically speaking, from what it should be from a moral or legal criterion. In other words, fair price for Aquinas is related not only to subjective preferences but to justice and common good as well. But the fact stands that the 'common utility' in the exchange is defined mostly by the subjective preferences of each party, as we have seen above. This is an important praxeological precedent found in proto-market thought. The Bottom Line The important takeaway here is that Aquinas says that I have a right to some other good when I agree with someone else to exchange some good of mine for some good of theirs, but only if both of us feel satisfied by the exchange, which matches the Austrian definition of market exchange almost verbatim. It is remarkable to go back to a 13th-century thinker and find insights reminiscent of modern praxeology.

The Other Side Of Success: The Suicide Pandemic In South Korea – ...	The sudden death of popular South Korean actress Kim Sae-ron on February 16 has drawn attention to one of South Korea’s biggest societal, and arguably general, problems—suicide. Despite South Korea’s extraordinary economic progress in recent decades and a relatively stable political system (with some exceptions, such as the recently ousted President Yoon Suk-yeol), the high number of suicides reveals that even successful nations have significant shortcomings. This alarming negative trend, unfortunately, is not abating but rather becoming more pronounced. Grim Statistics According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2024, South Korea has the fourth-highest suicide rate in the world and the highest among the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). While the global suicide rate is declining, South Korea is experiencing the opposite trend—the number of suicides has nearly doubled over the past two decades. Specifically, approximately 13,000 South Koreans take their own lives violently each year. Government statistics indicate that an average of 37.5 people die by suicide daily, meaning one violent death occurs every 39 minutes. With 25 deaths per 100,000 people, suicide is the sixth leading cause of death, just behind cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, the suicide rate is highest among the elderly. The annual rate among those in their 80s is 69.8, while for individuals in their 40s and 50s, it stands at 48.6. However, the biggest concern is the rise in suicides among young people. Since 2011, suicide has been the leading cause of death for individuals aged 10 to 24. Suicides Among Celebrities The issue of high suicide rates among young people, including young celebrities, was highlighted by the death of actress Kim Sae-ron. Although detailed statistics are lacking, South Korea appears to lead the world in celebrity suicides. Due to the global success of the South Korean entertainment industry, news of suicides involving famous actors, singers, and other entertainers reaches every corner of the world. A few notable figures who have taken their own lives in recent years include Jonghyun, the lead vocalist of the boy band SHINee (aged 27, December 2017); singer and actress Sulli (aged 25, October 2019); singer and actress Goo Hara (aged 28, November 2019); and actor Lee Sun-kyun (aged 48, December 2023), best known for his lead role in the Oscar-winning film Parasite. Even politicians are not immune. In 2009, former President Roh Moo-hyun (aged 62) died by suicide when his family and he were under investigation for corruption. Similarly, prominent politician Roh Hoe-chan, founder of the liberal Justice Party, died by suicide in 2018 at age 61 while facing a scandal over illegal fundraising. The Case of Kim Sae-ron The death of Kim Sae-ron at just 24 years old is particularly tragic. The actress rose to fame as a child at the age of 10 in the 2010 film The Man from Nowhere and later starred in South Korean TV dramas (K-dramas). She was hailed as South Korea’s most promising actress, but everything changed overnight. In May 2022, she caused a car accident while driving under the influence, instantly becoming one of the most despised figures in the country. Kim was driving drunk in the Gangnam district of Seoul when she crashed into multiple objects, including a transformer, guardrails, and street trees. The accident caused a power outage for three hours at 57 locations, including various stores. Although she expressed deep remorse the very next day and paid a fine of 20 million won (approximately $13,900), the media and public never forgave her. On the contrary, they relentlessly attacked her. She became a target of media and online harassment, which continued until her recent suicide. She was forced to use almost all of her earnings from acting to compensate those affected by the accident, while her film production company, Gold Medalist, also had to pay damages. Film companies refused to offer her roles, and she was forced to work as a waitress for some time. Her attempts to make a comeback through theater led to more online abuse. In essence, Kim's suicide was the result of a public lynching. From the time of her accident until her death, the media published approximately 2,000 articles about her. Her father blamed YouTube for her death. Causes of the Media Lynching of Celebrities It is evident that South Korean society has certain shortcomings that contribute to the brutal public shaming of celebrities, which often leads them to see self-destruction as the only way out. Celebrity culture in South Korea is ruthless, with actors, singers, and models facing harsh scrutiny from both their managers and the public. While famous individuals have devoted fan bases, those same fans can turn against them overnight. There is a noticeable tendency among South Koreans to harbor jealousy and envy. However, there are somewhat rational explanations for these highly negative human tendencies. Professor of Sociology Huh Chang-deog from Yeungnam University in Gyeongsan stated: 'Due to the social problems currently present in Korea, such as high living costs, many Koreans tend to develop a feeling of being poor and wanting more, comparing themselves to celebrities. This puts celebrities at the center of admiration, but ironically, it also breeds jealousy and hatred toward them.' Another sociology professor, Choi Hang-sub from Kookmin University in Seoul, noted that the attention and popularity celebrities receive in Korea are a 'double-edged sword,' as emotions linked to jealousy can intensify when a celebrity makes a mistake. Following the deaths of major stars in 2019, politicians intended to introduce laws in the National Assembly to discourage online lynching. The proposed regulations would have required social media commenters to use their real names and be punished for spreading misinformation. However, such laws were never passed. The reason is clear—clicks on news portals generate revenue for their owners. Female celebrities face even harsher public scrutiny than their male counterparts. Professor Seol Dong-hoon from Jeonbuk National University observes that there is a significant difference between holding someone accountable for their wrongdoing and subjecting them to relentless harassment over a single mistake. He wisely concludes: 'Every individual deserves a chance at redemption, but South Korean society often refuses to grant it to those who have fallen from grace. Instead, it continuously amplifies their past misdeeds, making it nearly impossible for them to move forward.' Material Success Does Not Bring Happiness Unlike celebrities, ordinary people do not commit suicide, or rarely do so, as a result of social media lynching. However, 99% of suicides in South Korea are the deaths of more or less average citizens. This raises the question: why? Their country is one of the most successful nations in the world in terms of economic and technological development. From the 1960s to today, Seoul has made an impressive transition from a war-torn, impoverished country to an Asian economic powerhouse (G11). The secrets of its success lie in well-executed industrialization and privatization, continuous innovation, and a high-quality education system. Today, South Korea is a global leader in technology, electronics, and the automotive industry, while its soft power—K-pop and the film industry—is also strong. Politically, South Koreans have built stable democratic institutions and pursue a prudent foreign policy. Seoul has become an influential player in international relations, particularly concerning North Korea. Given all this, one would expect prosperity for ordinary people, reflected in happy lives. Yet, that is not necessarily the case. Causes of Suicide Among Ordinary People According to official data, in 86% of cases, the primary health conditions leading individuals to suicide are mental health disorders such as depression, addiction, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Family problems account for 61% of suicides, while marital issues contribute to 53%. About 59% of suicides are linked to economic difficulties, including an inability to pay off loans, income reduction, and poverty. Approximately 57% of suicides are associated with workplace problems (interpersonal conflicts, excessive expectations). In contrast, only about 31% of suicides are connected to physical health issues. The Background of South Korea’s Suicide Epidemic Given these statistics, the main reasons behind South Korea’s suicide crisis are: the negative effects of rapid economic development, societal pressure to achieve success, social inequality, increasing poverty, and rising youth unemployment. The mental health of the population has deteriorated due to the rapid national transformation from a traditional rural society to a modern urban society within a single generation. Despite economic prosperity, social challenges such as loneliness and an imbalance between work and private life have become serious problems. The intense societal pressure stems from a culture obsessed with competition and achievement. Long working hours and high competition in education and the job market have led to increased stress and depression. A culture that does not tolerate failure has contributed to alarmingly high suicide rates among teenagers and young adults. According to a 2023 study, nearly 43% of elementary and high school students in South Korea had considered suicide due to school-related stress. Social inequality is another significant factor driving the high suicide rate. The stark divide between the rich and the poor and limited access to stable employment create a sense of hopelessness among those unable to keep up with societal expectations. Many elderly citizens, lacking adequate social support, face financial insecurity and social isolation, which drives them to take fatal actions. This issue is compounded by rising poverty levels. In 2021, the relative poverty rate among elderly South Koreans exceeded 39%—the second highest among OECD countries. The most common reasons for suicidal thoughts among older adults were health and financial problems. Even working-age individuals struggle with financial pressures (e.g., debt) and an unstable job market, leading to stress and depression, which increase the risk of suicide. A Problem That Must Be Addressed Since the South Korean government launched its first suicide prevention program in 2004, both the government and NGOs have implemented various campaigns to reduce the country’s exceptionally high suicide rate. However, these efforts have not yielded significant success. While positive measures such as restricting access to lethal medications, installing safety barriers on railways and bridges, and improving mental health services have been introduced, societal and economic pressures remain powerful triggers for suicide. What should be done next? Systematic reforms are needed to reduce inequality, ensure social security, and promote a better work-life balance. Without structural changes, suicide will remain a severe challenge for South Korean society in the future—just like its record-low birth rate.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdlwqxCPKbaWr9UNBIUD0HN	2025-03-17T17:15:48-07:00	
Hegseth Meets With Irish MMA Fighter McGregor, Discuss Impacts Of...	By C. Todd Lopez Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor today in the Pentagon. The two discussed, among other things, how the U.S. and Ireland are both struggling with the effects of illegal immigration. McGregor described the illegal immigration problem in Ireland as 'a threat of destruction from within.' 'That's what we feel is happening in Ireland at present. There's no support for the people of Ireland,' he said. 'It's almost like we're witnessing the destruction of Ireland in real time. It's being harbored by our own government. The illegal immigration racket is the biggest money racket that has ever been in Irish history.' McGregor said many rural towns in Ireland have become inundated with illegal immigrants, changing the character of those towns forever. With some 40 million Americans of Irish descent living in the U.S., he expressed concern those Americans would find their ancestral homes unrecognizable if they returned to Ireland for a visit. 'They take great pride in their Irish heritage,' McGregor said. 'Sooner or later ... there will be no place for these Irish Americans to come home and visit their native country, where they are from.' Hegseth highlighted U.S. efforts to get after the same problem. 'Now you look at what this president is doing ... last night they sent 250 Tren de Aragua gang members out,' Hegseth said. 'There's no other way to handle it.' 'Breathtaking,' McGregor said. 'There are Americans all over the country, the length and breadth of this country, who are breathing a sigh of relief because of President [Donald J.] Trump's administration efforts.' The U.S. has sent the military to the border to partner with the Department of Homeland Security to stop the flow of illegal immigration into the country, Hegseth said. 'We've spent 20 years defending other people's borders all around the world,' he added. 'And we let the world come in through our southern border – 20 million people, we have no idea who they are.' Like in Ireland, Hegseth said, it's not just big cities in the U.S. impacted by illegal immigration. It's small towns and cities as well. 'There are entire small towns that have been transformed by illegal immigration,' he said. One of Hegseth's priorities is increasing the lethality of the force by making troops stronger, fitter and more suited for defending the nation. As a mixed martial artist, McGregor knows something about preparing for a fight. 'You've got to train, you've got to train hard, you've got to be committed and dedicated every day,' he said. 'Mentorship every single day on defense and on security and on leadership.' Prior to his meeting with Hegseth, McGregor visited the White House and participated in a press conference there in the briefing room. Following his visit to the Pentagon, he returned to the White House for a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office. Before leaving the Pentagon, McGregor recorded a message to service members across the military. 'This is a message to the great troops of the United States of America,' he said. 'I'm here with your Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. You're in good hands. Men, women, keep fighting the good fight. Fight, fight, fight, as the big man says. Let's go, troops of America. God bless.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdlwqxCPKbaWnV8grC4GBnn	2025-03-17T17:14:30-07:00	
Riyadh And The New Halls Of Mediation – OpEd	By Mauricio D. Aceves Mediation has shaped diplomacy, from the Peace of Westfalia or the Congress of Vienna to the Taif Agreement or the Joint Trilateral Statement of Saudi Arabia, Iran and China. In the last decade, the Gulf states have emerged as pivotal actors in conflict resolution, leveraging economic strength, cultural acumen, and diplomatic neutrality. Their engagement in high-stakes negotiations reflects the shifting dynamics in an increasingly multipolar world and the redefinition of power structures. In this new order, 'Either you are with us or against us' is a phrase that no longer belongs to geopolitical realities or conflict resolution developments. Leaders who have worked with conflict know that each conflict is unique, shaped by its causes, duration, external support, and several other factors.[1] Peace processes are not immediate remedies but ongoing and complex endeavours. However, specific lessons can be identified and are worth analyzing. After a decade of direct conflicts between Ukraine and Russia since the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014, a fresh round of talks began in Riyadh on February 28, 2025. Only two corners of the room were occupied. High-level delegations from Russia and the U.S. discussed various issues, including prospects for normalising bilateral relations and the war in Ukraine.[2] This event represents a milestone in finding an emergency exit from a labyrinth that has shaped international security understanding, including the conflict in Ukraine and the global domino effect of the geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and Russia. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House and held talks with a biagreement,delegation from the U.S. Senate.[3] Afterwards, the U.S. Department of State announced a round of talks with Ukrainian counterparts in Jeddah on March 10-12.[4] There, representatives of the U.S. and Ukraine agreed to enact an interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by Russia.[5] Certainly, the absence of Ukraine in the first round decreases expectations of the outcomes, reminiscent of the time in 2023 when Russia did not attend the two-day National Security Advisors in Jeddah.[6] Effective mediation necessitates a balanced approach that considers all parties’ perspectives—much as the Camp David Accords, the Oslo Accords or the Good Friday Agreement. Even so, the rounds in the Kingdom have been pragmatic and parties have demonstrated will to reach an agreement. The talks in Riyadh and Jeddah are simultaneously a messenger and a message. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States have strategically positioned themselves as neutral players, leveraging strong relations with the great powers, including the U.S., Russia, China, and Europe. Some examples include several mediations regarding prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Russia brokered by Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, as well as the Jeddah Declaration of Commitment to Protect the Civilians of Sudan.[7] The ongoing talks in Riyadh are not isolated events but part of a chronology that is keeping up its pace. Multipolarity is a trend, diplomacy is its mirror, and the Middle East is now at the heart of it. Qatar’s role as host of the U.S.-Taliban negotiations in Doha[8] and mediator between Israel and Hamas,[9] Oman’s discreet diplomacy in facilitating discussions between the U.S and Iran that led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and the UAE’s contributions to the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace agreement in 2018,[10] as well as its hosting of the COP28 summit in Dubai,[11] exemplify the diverse and strategic diplomatic engagements of Gulf states. These efforts highlight the region’s growing influence as a bridge for dialogue. Just as Middle Eastern literature, as The Assemblies of al-Hariri, weaves intricate narratives of resilience and negotiation, the region’s diplomacy reflects a complex evolution where alliances shift, and history is rewritten. The diplomatic leverage can be explained by the neutral stance of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries since the outbreak of the two recent wars. Even when Saudi Arabia consistently voted against the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the United Nations General Assembly[12] and contributed more than $400 million in aid to Ukraine,[13] a diplomatic balance was built, maintaining early ties and dialogues with Russia through the OPEC+ platform on energy security and trade, subjects that keep open communications channels and cooperation opportunities. The wars also offered a new way for the aspirations of third countries to become visible as actors capable of mediating international conflicts and the impassé of UNSC resolutions or the vacuum of influence in country desks in New York, Olso, Geneva, Vienna or Paris. Traditional mediation efforts rely on formal, structured, legalistic processes and sometimes with the military intervention of third parties as tools. In contrast, contemporary mediation needs and uses more flexibility to adapt to fluid actors, intentions, and communication complexities – far from the standard carrot-and-stick negotiation manuals. Sometimes, decision-makers and diplomats forget conflicts are about people more than nations. The novel As Long as the Lemon Trees Grow[14] by Zoulfa Katouh reminds us that Syria is a country, but more essential than that, it is a home for many. Using this lens, the Gulf states’ approach to conflicts has been strategic and culturally sensitive to consensus-building. This understanding of mediation has reinforced the probability of success projection. In this realm, respect and confidentiality will always be the core principles of reputation, both challenged by an era filled with mass media and disinformation operations. The humanitarian situation in Gaza, the normalisation of ties with Israel, peacemaking and peacebuilding efforts in Iraq, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a reconfiguration of governance in Beirut and Damascus, are all pivotal issues for the Middle East. On this path do challenges to diplomacy lie, as well as to reputation-building for mediation and conflict resolution. First are the mediation efforts that are guided by self-interest, particularly in scenarios where ties with one of the conflicting parties are significant. Second, given the complex regional web and an environment full of actors inside a competitive dynamic, mediation initiatives could be seen as an extension of rivalries rather than impartial peacebuilding efforts. Third is maintaining national stability and regional proficiency to make joint decisions with a shared compass of regional security with a long-term perspective. An oft-quoted Swahili proverb[15] says, 'You cannot turn the wind, so turn the sail'. Turning the sail is now, more than ever, in the hands of each nation, particularly when strategic autonomy is the new setting for foreign policies in the Middle East and beyond.

Renewed Turkey-Kurd Peace Push Presents Opportunities For Regiona...	By Mohammed A. Salih (FPRI) -- A renewed peace effort between the Turkish government and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) has reignited hopes for a resolution to the four-decade-long Kurdish insurgency and the broader Kurdish question in Turkey. In a historic announcement on February 27, PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan, imprisoned on Turkey’s Imrali Island since 1999, called on the PKK and all affiliated factions to lay down their arms and dissolve themselves. The PKK, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, has waged an armed struggle against the Turkish state for Kurdish rights since 1984. The stakes of this renewed peace initiative are high. After a decade of intense conflict, its success or failure will have profound implications for Turkey’s domestic stability and regional dynamics, particularly in Syria and Iraq. This moment presents a critical opportunity for Washington to engage constructively and encourage Ankara, Damascus, and Kurdish groups to pursue a path toward lasting peace. Renewed Peace Efforts This is not the first time the Turkish government, the PKK, and the broader Kurdish movement in Turkey have attempted to reach a peace deal. Previous peace efforts between 2009 and 2015 ultimately failed, leaving Kurdish grievances unresolved and prompting Turkey to launch military campaigns against PKK positions in Iraq. The latest signs of renewed dialogue emerged last October when Devlet Bahçeli, leader of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), hinted at negotiations and suggested that Öcalan might be allowed to address the Turkish parliament or be moved from Imrali to house arrest. This is particularly notable given that Bahçeli’s MHP is an ultranationalist party in a governing coalition with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP). Unlike in the early 2010s peace talks, Erdoğan has not taken a leading role in this round of negotiations. Instead, he has largely remained silent, though he recently offered a cautious endorsement of the peace talks, warning that a breakdown would result in Ankara 'eliminating' the last PKK guerrilla. Challenges to the Process Several obstacles could derail the peace process. On the Kurdish side, it remains unclear whether the PKK leadership in Iraq’s Qandil Mountains will comply with Öcalan’s call to disarm and dissolve. While the PKK announced a unilateral ceasefire on March 1, it conditioned full disarmament on the establishment of a 'legal framework' for peace — without specifying what such a framework would entail. Öcalan himself reportedly told pro-Kurdish parliamentarians who visited him in prison that legal and democratic assurances would be necessary for his initiative to succeed. While some sources say Turkey is willing to introduce legal measures or constitutional amendments to formalize a peace deal, as of now, there is no clear indication that it would actually do so. Additionally, despite ongoing peace efforts, the Turkish military continues to bomb PKK and SDF positions in Iraq and Syria, which could lead the Kurdish parties to question Turkey’s commitment to a peaceful resolution and prompt them to abandon the fragile process. Another major challenge is the political calculus of the AKP-MHP coalition. Erdoğan’s primary motivation for pursuing negotiations could be to extend his presidency beyond 2028. He would need the support of over 60 pro-Kurdish parliamentarians to pass constitutional amendments allowing him to seek another term. At the same time, deeper strategic factors may be influencing Ankara’s calculations. The shifting regional landscape following the October 7 attacks by Hamas, the increasing dominance of Israel, and Iran’s declining regional influence have all altered Turkey’s strategic outlook. Peace with the PKK — and, more broadly, with Kurdish factions in Syria — would allow Ankara to consolidate its regional gains over the past decade. Stabilizing Syria The collapse of the 2015 peace talks between Turkey and the PKK led to an escalation of Turkish military operations in Syria. Ankara views the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as an extension of the PKK, even though claims of direct organizational links between the PKK and the SDF remain, at best, contested. The SDF’s core unit, the People’s Protection Units (YPG), and its political wing, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), are both part of the Kurdistan Democratic Communities Union (KCK), an umbrella organization of which the PKK is the main component. In his late February message, Öcalan called for 'all factions' and 'all groups' affiliated with the PKK to lay down arms. SDF General Commander Mazloum Abdi rejected on February 27 the notion that Öcalan’s call for the PKK has any bearing on the SDF. The SDF is America’s primary on-the-ground partner in Syria in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS) and controls nearly one-third of the country’s territory. However, Turkey and the Syrian factions it backs have launched multiple military offensives since 2015, capturing significant areas previously held by the SDF or its affiliates in northern Syria. On March 10, Abdi and Syrian Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa signed an eight-point agreement in Damascus, calling for the integration of the SDF and its governing institutions into the Syrian state. Syria remains a crucial arena for Turkey. Having been deeply involved in the country’s crisis since the early days of the uprising, Ankara now wields significant influence over opposition groups and aims to secure the long-term benefits of its involvement. Turkish businesses stand to gain substantially from Syria’s eventual reconstruction, which is expected to require between $250 billion and $400 billion in investment. At the same time, resolving its conflict with the PKK and SDF would enable Turkey to prevent rival actors — especially Iran and Israel — from forging alliances with Kurdish groups in Syria and Iraq that could challenge Ankara’s regional ascendance in recent years. Stabilizing Iraq A peace deal between Turkey and the PKK would also have far-reaching effects on northern Iraq. Turkey has conducted military operations against PKK positions in Iraqi Kurdistan since the early 1990s, and since 2015 these operations have intensified. According to Community Peacemaker Teams, a local conflict-monitoring group, Turkish forces launched over 2,100 attacks on alleged PKK targets in Iraqi Kurdistan throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024. Hundreds of Iraqi Kurdish border villages remain abandoned due to the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, in recent years, Sinjar in Iraq’s Nineveh province has become a major flashpoint. The PKK established a presence there in 2014 after playing a key role in rescuing Yazidis from ISIS, but since then the area has been occasionally targeted by Turkish airstrikes. The continued hostilities between Turkey and the PKK have added another layer of instability to Iraqi Kurdistan at a time when the autonomous region is already under pressure from Iran and its allied militias. The United States, which has historically maintained strong ties with both the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Baghdad, has a vested interest in reducing tensions in northern Iraq. Recommendations for U.S. Policy Turkey is a key U.S. ally and a NATO member, with an important role in the shifting geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East, southern Caucasus, and Eastern Europe. A lasting peace between Ankara and the PKK would eliminate one of the longest-running conflicts in the region that has the potential to undermine Turkey along its southern borders. Although Turkey is unlikely to accept direct foreign mediation in its negotiations with the PKK, the United States can play a constructive role by publicly supporting the peace process. The PKK’s leadership has significantly reduced its demands to broader democratization in Turkey, no longer calling for statehood or even decentralization. Washington should press Ankara to capitalize on this historic opportunity and reach a dignified and fair settlement with the Kurdish movement. In Syria, the United States has a more direct role to play. As the primary backer of the SDF, Washington facilitated recent negotiations between the SDF and the new Syrian government. On March 11, Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed Washington’s support for the recent deal between Sharaa and Abdi. Ensuring a fair agreement on the SDF’s integration into the Syrian security apparatus and the recognition of Kurdish rights in Syria would help build a unified and more stable state. However, Washington must tread carefully. While Ankara and Damascus may favor integrating SDF elements individually rather than as a cohesive unit into Syria’s new military and security apparatus, this approach risks allowing the more radical armed factions within the new government to gain dominance. The recent massacres of local Alawites and some Christians in western Syria underscore that Damascus’ security forces cannot yet be trusted. This was reaffirmed in Rubio’s March 9 statement, in which he condemned the violence and vowed to protect minority communities in Syria. Fully disbanding the SDF within Syria’s new apparatus would eliminate the last major barrier to more radical and unruly elements seizing control of the new Syria. Even if the United States fully withdraws its troops from Syria, it should leverage other available tools and incentives — such as the removal or imposition of sanctions — to prevent post-Assad Syria from becoming a hub of regional instability and a magnet for extremist elements from across the region and beyond. Hence, a more prudent strategy would be to preserve the SDF’s military structure as much as possible within the emerging state. On this issue, a divergence of interests exists between Washington and Ankara, which American policymakers must recognize and manage. In a worst case scenario, the United States should carefully dissect the Turkey and Syria cases to ensure that if peace efforts within Turkey fail, it does not automatically weaken the SDF’s position in Syria or derail SDF-Damascus negotiations. In Iraq, Washington should also encourage an end to Turkish-PKK clashes and push for the full implementation of the Sinjar Agreement signed in 2020, which calls for the removal of PKK-affiliated forces and factions allied with Iran from the area and strengthens the position of its allied KRG. It should be kept in mind that failure to achieve peace between Turkey and the PKK, as well as between the SDF and Turkey-backed Damascus, and a return to intense conflict in Iraq and Syria would create an opportunity for Iran to further destabilize Syria and northern Iraq as a means of retaliating against Turkey. Iranian officials, already angered by the new regional dynamics following Bashar al-Assad’s fall last December, could exploit renewed hostilities to advance their strategic interests and undermine a nascent regional order that might otherwise align with U.S. interests. Iran is well positioned to do so through Iraqi armed factions aligned with Tehran, leveraging Iraq’s long shared border with Syria to its strategic objectives. About the author: Mohammed A.

India: Border Challenges In Tripura – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum Tripura remains free of terrorism. The year 2024 marked a milestone achievement in the state of Tripura, where Chief Minister Manik Saha announced the state 'insurgent-free or zero insurgency' with the signing of the peace agreement, the Memorandum of Settlement (MoS), on September 4, 2024, between the Government of India (GoI), the Government of Tripura, the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and the All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF), in the presence of the Union Home Minister (UHM) Amit Shah, at North Block, in New Delhi. The agreement followed the laying down of arms ceremony on September 24, 2024, where the 'presidents' of the Biswamohan Debbarma faction of the NLFT (NLFT-BM), Biswamohan Debbarma; the Parimal Debbarma faction of the NLFT (NLFT-PD), Parimal Debbarma; NLFT Original (NLFT-ORI), Prasenjit Debbarma; and ATTF's Alindra Debbarma handed over their AK series rifles. Also, a total of 584 cadres of NLFT and ATTF laid down their arms: NLFT-BM, 261 cadres; NLFT-PD and NLFT-ORI, 100 cadres each; and ATTF, 123 cadres. The weapons handed over included 89 country-made guns, 13 pistols, nine AK series rifles, eight factory-made guns, seven land mines, one revolver and one rifle. According to official figures, between September 24, 2024, and December 11, 2024, a total of 902 cadres of NLFT, ATTF and other groups abjured violence and joined the mainstream of society. No further surrenders have taken place thereafter. On May 20, 2024, before these developments, an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) Tribunal had declared NLFT and ATTF and their factions, wings, and front organisations, unlawful associations, stating that their cadres were involved in kidnapping for ransom, extortion, etc. The notification highlighted that the two groups sought to create an independent nation by secession of Tripura from India through armed struggle, in alliance with other armed secessionist organisations of Tripura, and to incite the indigenous people of Tripura. It further noted that NLFT had been working in close nexus with other North-East insurgent organisations having their bases in Bangladesh, including the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), Kanglei Yaol Kanba Lup (KYKL), Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO), National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC). The ATTF had connections with the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K) and Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO). For long years, since the inception of NLFT on March 12, 1989, and ATTF in 1993, which was originally named All Tripura Tribal Force (formed on July 11, 1990), the two militant outfits have been involved in violent activities, with the common objectives of deporting all foreigners who entered Tripura after 1956 and restoring alienated tribal lands. The present agreement is, however, an example of militant outfits choosing a peaceful path to resolve the issues surrounding the indigenous population of Tripura. The decline in the number of insurgent-related incidents and fatalities in Tripura was one of the factors that made this possible. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), since 2010, fatalities have been recorded in single digits for eight of the 15 years, while no fatality was reported in the remaining seven years (data till March 16, 2025). There was a total of 13 insurgent-related killing incidents in which 16 fatalities were recorded [five civilians, seven Security Force (SF) personnel and four terrorists] from 2010 to March 16, 2025. Of these, NLFT was involved in 10 incidents, including two NLFT-BM-related incidents in 2021 and 2022, while ATTF was involved in only one incident, on January 4, 2023, which also resulted in the last reported insurgent-related fatality in Tripura. Of the remaining, two incidents involved the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF), while the third could not be attributed to any identified militant group. Moreover, since March 6, 2000, a total of 3,824 militants have surrendered in the state. 2024 and 2025 (to date) have not reported any arrests associated with particular insurgent outfits. The trends of arrest, in recent times, have been associated with the possession of firearms. Some of the incidents of this kind in 2025 include: February 13: Police arrested Rajkumar Debnath and Palash Pal from South Jagatpur in Sidhai, Tripura's West District, in connection with a case registered under the Arms Act in December 2024. Police recovered a 7mm pistol along with an empty magazine from the residence of Rajkumar Debnath on February 15. February 7: In a joint operation with the Border Security Force (BSF), Police arrested Anjan Das from Konaban Radhanagar in Sepahijala and recovered a pistol and three live rounds from his possession. January 25: Police carried out an operation and arrested two persons, Niraj Kumar and Indar Mukhia, in possession of a pistol, from the Dharmanagar Sub-division of North Tripura District. At least 13 insurgents were arrested in six separate incidents in 2023. The last insurgent-related arrest was on December 16, 2023, when the Tripura Police arrested three NLFT-PD militants - self-styled 'major' Ganaram Rang aka Baileng, Rai Bahadur Reang and Rai Taingha Reang - from the Khasnam Para Bru Settlement Camp in North Tripura District. A total of 1,114 militants have been arrested in Tripura since March 6, 2000. The MoS of September 2024 is accompanied by aid, rehabilitation and relief packages. In the latest agreement, the Centre approved a special INR 2.5 billion package for the development of the tribal population in Tripura. A monthly stipend of INR 6,000 and a fixed deposit of INR 400,000 for each of the rebels who renounce violence, with the deposit accessible after a three-year lock-in period, were also promised. However, the likelihood that packages announced and promises made at the time of the agreement being fulfilled remain bleak. On February 21, 2025, Tripura United Indigenous Revolutionary Peoples' Council (TUIRPC) leader Daniel Borok Debbarma announced a protest aimed at pressing their 21-point charter of demands, with support from all surrendered militant organisations. On February 25, 2025, the organisation staged a daylong blockade on the Assam-Agartala National Highway at Hatai Kotor in West Tripura District, which is the fifth protest of such kind over the past years. The demands included rehabilitation, land allotment, housing, and economic assistance for surrendered militants. The group claimed that the Government failed to fulfil its promises and had not done anything for surrendered militants over the past 30 to 35 years despite assurances. TUIRPC leader Daniel Borok Debbarma stated, The government made numerous promises, but none have been realised. Many of our demands remain pending, which is why we have resorted to this road blockade as a form of protest. This is the fifth time we are taking such an action. Our key demands include the withdrawal of all court and police cases against us. Even now, we are being summoned by the police for various cases. We were promised pucca houses, but none have been provided. We also demand the use of the Roman script for the Kokborok language, replacing the current Bengali script. Additionally, the government must ensure proper infrastructure, including water, electricity, and roads, in rehabilitation areas. Free education for our children from Class 1 up to the university level must also be guaranteed. In response, Minister of Tribal Welfare Department Bikash Debbarma met with representatives of TUIRPC on March 4, 2025, and assured them of the Government's support, adding, 'The government is committed to addressing the issues of surrendered militants. We will work towards resolving their grievances at the earliest.' Meanwhile, the porous international border with Bangladesh (parts of Tripura's 856-km-long border with Bangladesh are still unfenced due to local disputes) remains a hindrance, with numerous infiltration attempts by Bangladeshis and Rohingyas owing to the tumultuous conditions in the neighbouring country. As reported on November 3, 2024, Chief Minister Saha urged UHM Amit Shah to take steps to complete the unfenced border. Saha observed, in this regard, We are all keeping watch on the situation in Bangladesh and it may take time to practically see its possible impact on our ties with the country. But since we have seen an increase in influx, we have raised the matter with the Centre and sought complete fencing of the border. According to an official release by the Border Security Force (BSF) on December 1, 2024, a total of 675 illegal immigrants, including 55 Rohingyas, 620 Bangladeshi nationals and 260 Indian nationals, were apprehended by the BSF's Tripura Frontier in various operations, from January 1 to November 30, 2024. The BSF added contraband worth more than INR 46 crore was seized, including substantial quantities of narcotics. The seizures included 66,316 bottles of Phensedyl, 9,203.24 kilograms of cannabis, 605,334 Yaba tablets, 1,222,894.5 kilograms of sugar, 496.26 grams of gold, 381.01 grams of brown sugar, one pistol and 210 rounds of ammunition. Both the border guard organisations, BSF and Bangladesh Border Guard (BBG), collaborated in addressing the security challenges of the two nations. However, the political situation in Bangladesh has had a ripple effect in Tripura. On December 2, 2024, a protest was launched in front of the Bangladesh Assistant High Commissioner in Agartala, focusing on atrocities against Hindu minorities and a demand for the release of Hindu leader and ISKCON member Chinmoy Das Prabhu. The protest was also joined by a right-wing organization, called Hindu Sangharsh Samity. In response to the protest, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) took up security measures and emphasised that 'diplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstances.' As Tripura reached its milestone in achieving the zero-insurgency status, with a larger vision of the Government of India's policy towards 'insurgency-free, peaceful and prosperous North East', the issue of addressing the grievances of surrendered militants lingers on. The Government must revisit its surrender cum rehabilitation programme and address the protracted failures of implementation. Moreover, the state is crippled by other challenges, particularly along its international border with Bangladesh. The influx of illegal migrants along the border, part of the larger border crisis across India's Northeast, needs to be addressed at the earliest, as it constitutes a serious security threat.

Armenia At Constitutional Crossroads – OpEd	By Maroš Cuník (Eurasianet) -- Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s success in finalizing a peace treaty with Azerbaijan is a major achievement. But Pashinyan’s next challenge may prove even tougher to accomplish – convincing Armenians to embrace an overhaul of the county’s political, economic and social culture through the adoption of a new constitution. Pashinyan outlined his vision for the country’s transformation, which he frames as 'Real Armenia,' in late February. It stresses the need for entrepreneurship and a new understanding of the meaning of patriotism, focusing on the future and letting go of the past. From Pashinyan’s standpoint, strategic necessity dictates a need for a new constitution: Armenia’s long-standing partnership with Russia has crumbled, undermining Armenian security. Now, Armenia must adapt to become 'more viable in the new geopolitical and regional conditions.' Old thinking has kept Armenia in 'constant conflicts with our neighbors,' he has stated. He believes a new approach that sets aside old grievances can usher in an age of economic prosperity and security. 'Peace is the most reliable guarantee of security,' Pashinyan’s Real Armenia doctrine states. 'The most important components of ensuring security are the interdependence of the countries of the region, ensuring the country's place in the regional and global supply chain and trade.' The prime minister is willing to make compromises that many other Armenian politicians are not willing to risk, especially concerning the future of Nagorno Karabakh. The first step for the government in implementing the Real Armenia agenda will be amending the preamble of the Armenian constitution, which indicates that Karabakh is a constituent component of historical Armenia. Azerbaijan, which reconquered the territory in late 2023, has made the adoption of an amendment to unequivocally recognize Baku’s sovereignty over the territory a prerequisite for the signing of the peace treaty. Given that Armenia and Azerbaijan have finalized the treaty text, it would seem the two governments have agreed on a mutually acceptable resolution concerning Karabakh’s place in the Armenian constitution. But Pashinyan and other government officials have so far not revealed the substance of the compromise. To date, Pashinyan has been cagey, stating that the constitution as presently written does not make any territorial claims against Azerbaijan. Any move to amend the constitution is sure to fuel a highly emotional debate in Yerevan. For nationalists, relinquishing claims to Karabakh is seen as a betrayal of national interests. Many also contend that conceding on the Karabakh matter would encourage further Azerbaijani claims, particularly concerning the so-called Zangezur corridor, a proposed land connection between the Azerbaijani mainland and the Nakhchivan exclave. Bowing to Baku’s demand for unhindered movement along the corridor would be an unacceptable infringement on Armenian sovereignty in the view of many Armenians. Only after Pashinyan can finesse the Karabakh preamble issue and get the peace treaty with Azerbaijan signed, can his government focus on selling the Real Armenia doctrine to a hesitant population. At that point, geopolitical pressure on Armenia could grow intense. Given that Pashinyan’s government has lost all trust in Russia as a security guarantor, the Real Armenia doctrine calls for the country’s geopolitical reorientation away from Moscow toward the United States and European Union, as reflected in Yerevan’s recent decision to embark on the EU accession process. This places Armenia in a difficult position because the country’s economy remains dependent on Russia as a trading partner and energy supplier. The Kremlin is not likely to stand by and do nothing as Pashinyan proceeds with his geopolitical pivot. At the same time, it is unlikely Armenia can receive any serious security guarantees or transformative economic support from the US and EU soon. Currently, Western support is more symbolic and rhetorical rather than practical. Pashinyan has indicated that he wants to put a new constitution that embodies his Real Armenia vision up for approval in a popular referendum before the country’s next scheduled parliamentary election in late 2026. That does not give the government a lot of time to win over the large number of domestic skeptics while at the same time being buffeted by outside forces intent on seeing him fail. Considering the domestic tensions and external pressures, one of three possible outcomes is likely. The chances for Armenia’s rapid strategic realignment seem low at present, given that Pashinyan appears to lack a critical mass of popular support for the Real Armenia doctrine. Achieving a geopolitical transformation in such a short timespan without triggering a domestic or external crisis is a tall order. It is also possible that domestic and foreign opposition, from Russia and/or Azerbaijan, may prove too much for the Armenian government to overcome. Russia could apply economic and diplomatic pressure, and Azerbaijan could seek additional territorial or economic concessions from Yerevan to paralyze Armenian governance and, potentially, topple Pashinyan. Another scenario involves the incremental adaptation of Pashinyan’s vision. If he can get Azerbaijan to sign the peace treaty, Pashinyan can buy himself some time. He may have to push back his timeline for a new constitution, but the fact that domestic forces opposed to the government’s agenda currently lack unity gives Pashinyan what looks to be a decent chance of securing reelection in 2026. He could then work to recalibrate relationships with Russia, Azerbaijan, the United States and EU while building domestic consensus for the Real Armenia program. The process would involve economic diversification, careful engagement with Azerbaijan and deepening ties with the US and EU without triggering regional destabilization. Armenia now stands at a constitutional crossroads with a peace agreement awaiting signatures. There is no way of telling how Pashinyan’s ambitious initiative to remake Armenian society and secure the country’s sovereignty will turn out. The process over the coming months and years will test the limits of Pashinyan’s political and diplomatic skills and will shape Armenia’s future to better or worse for decades to come.

Americans Go Egg Hunting In Europe	By Magnus Lund Nielsen (EurActiv) -- As Americans keep wringing their hands over skyrocketing egg prices, the United States has been reaching out to European producers to chip in – but Europeans have little help to provide. 'The US have asked virtually every country in Europe,' said Danish industry representative Jørgen Nyberg Larsen. Larsen said suppliers and industry groups in Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Italy and fellow Nordic countries have received similar requests. The requests come amid a growing Trump-driven trade riff between the US and its European partners. In late February, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) office in The Hague reached out to European countries regarding potential supplies, Larsen said. By early March, the USDA followed up with a request to assess the quantities each country could provide. 'Since then we haven’t heard anything,' Larsen says. Market flooding US consumers experienced a sharp rise in the cost of everyday essentials, and eggs in particular, fuelling economic discontent that played a key role in the US election outcome last year. Furthermore, a spike in bird flu in North America has pushed prices upwards. Egg prices were a frequent topic during the campaign, and have remained a politically charged issue in the US since Donald Trump was sworn in as president in January. Last week, Trump stated that the egg prices were down – despite Associated Press reportsthat eggs prices in the US are actually the highest since the turn of the millennium. While Finland has declined to send eggs, other countries are willing to assist. Turkey has agreed to provide the US with 15,000 tonnes of egg to curb prices. Other countries remain primarily focused on ensuring supply for consumers within the EU. 'We don’t have a lot to offer,' said Larsen. Another major hurdle potential hurdle for would-be exporters is that the US washes its eggs, a practice that is uncommon in most EU countries and even illegal in parts of the bloc. As a result, any EU egg exports would have to undergo additional processing before reaching US consumers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdlwqxCPKbaWj46oU3y27m3	2025-03-17T16:55:42-07:00	
Government Efficiency And DOGE Government Efficiency – OpEd	The Social Security Administration (SSA) announced that it was reversing plans to eliminate the option of providing service over the phone. This was a response to a public outcry over the proposed policy. The reason for the outcry was that many older people (the type most likely to get Social Security benefits) are distrustful and uncomfortable with the Internet. They therefore rely on telephone service for things like arranging direct deposit of their Social Security benefits. (SSA is still not allowing changes to direct deposit over the phone, contrary to what I wrote in an earlier version.) SSA should be applauded for reversing an obviously wrongheaded policy, but it is worth asking how it ever came up with the idea of eliminating phone service to begin with. Apparently, this was one of the efficiency enhancing measures that the 'super-high IQ' DOGE team developed. This is a great example of how the ostensible 'efficiency' being pushed by Elon Musk and his DOGE team has little to do with actually promoting efficiency in government. There are some simple and obvious points that we can say about government efficiency. First, we have a $7 trillion federal budget. That fact means that we can be absolutely certain that there is some waste, fraud, and abuse. We also can be sure that some of the 2.4 million workers employed by the federal government are lazy and/or incompetent, just as we can be certain that some of the 154 million workers employed in the private sector are lazy and/or incompetent. But moving from these obvious truths to increasing government efficiency is a big step. We actually do have people within the government that have been working for years trying to improve efficiency. Most obviously, there is the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which regularly audits various government departments and makes specific recommendations on how they can increase efficiency. We also have the inspector generals (IG) of the agencies and departments, who review processes and contracts within agencies like USAID and look for fraud and abuse. Many of the widely publicized incidents of fraud or abuse have been uncovered by these IGs. Incredibly, one of Donald Trump’s first moves in office was to fire most of the IGs. While it is questionable whether he even has the legal authority to do this (the law says that they can only be fired with cause), it makes zero sense that a president anxious to get rid of waste in government would fire people who in many cases have decades of experience exposing waste and fraud. One defense of the firings is that the IGs have not been successful in eliminating waste, but this line is just repeated to generate confusion. The IGs only have power to make recommendations, they can’t do anything on their own. If Trump, Musk, and DOGE were actually interested in eliminating waste and abuse, they would review the reports from the various IGs, as well as recommendations from GAO and use these as a guide for eliminating problems that have already been identified. Instead, they have largely run around blindly, making cuts at agencies before they even bothered to learn what the agencies or their workers do. This is exactly what happened when they fired essential staff at the National Nuclear Security Administration before they realized they were needed to ensure the safety of our nuclear weapon stockpile. They subsequently had to rush to rehire them. They had difficulty tracking down some workers because they had deleted their government e-mails. The story is perhaps nowhere more egregious than with Social Security. Elon Musk and his DOGE team have tried to get into our confidential files on our work and benefit history. There is no remotely plausible reason that DOGE needs our personal information to detect fraud and abuse in Social Security. If they want to evaluate whether the records are accurate, they can use deidentified data, where our names are kept confidential. Researchers both inside and outside the Social Security Administration (SSA) have used this data for decades to detect problems in the program. They did not need to get, and possibly alter, confidential data. The other problem with Elon and the DOGE gang’s reckless approach to Social Security is that they haven’t bothered to make any effort to understand the program and instead seem determined to just develop confused propaganda points to attack the program. Their most widely touted point is that Social Security has millions of dead people on their roles, many of them well over 100 years old, some over 200 years old. Contrary to what Musk and Trump have told the country these dead people are not getting benefits. The SSA knows very well that these people are dead. They haven’t removed them from their lists because it would cost millions of dollars to do so, and there seemed no obvious reason to do so. A department actually interested in efficiency might agree with this decision. The other line that Musk has been pressing is that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. This is more than a bit fantastic as a claim. The program has been around for more than 80 years and has paid every penny of scheduled benefits. And we know exactly where money will come from to support the program for the indefinite future. The only sense in which it is a Ponzi scheme is that future benefits will depend on people paying taxes into the system. But government bonds could be said to be a Ponzi scheme in the same way. If no one was paying taxes to the government, government bonds would not be worth anything. But if we want to go to this level of absurdity, even stocks of private companies would qualify as Ponzi schemes, since shares of Tesla and SpaceX probably will also not be worth very much if the U.S. government collapses. Musk clearly has no interest in making Social Security more efficient, he is just interested in trying to undermine the credibility of the program, presumably with the goal of making people more amenable to cuts and/or privatization. DOGE is clearly not about efficiency. Maybe a better acronym would be DOPE, Department of Propaganda Enhancement.

Keeping The Climate Agenda On Track In A Trumpian World – OpEd	The election of Donald Trump in November 2024 has seen the United States, in rapid succession, exit the Paris Agreement on climate change and move to impose punishing tariffs on imports from countries around the world. This is a mighty double hit on the world’s ambitions to deal with the existential problem of climate change. As one of the world’s two biggest carbon emitters, the United States’ desertion of the Paris Agreement directly jeopardises reining back emissions and keeping global climate targets on track. Even more dangerous, Trump’s assault on global trade threatens to undermine the transformation of the global energy system through the trade, technology transfer and investment essential to cutting the growth of greenhouse gases. The United States’ walking away from the Paris Agreement and setting out to trash the global economic order creates a whole new level of uncertainty about the future of the international cooperation that is needed if we are to deal with the climate problem. One thing, however, is certain: the United States will not be a constructive national player on climate change for some time to come. And the United States is no longer a responsible custodian of, or even participant in, the rules based international trade order and will not be for an equally long time. Trust of the kind that the United States has enjoyed at the centre of the global economic and political order takes years to build. It has been destroyed in less than 100 days of Trump’s administration. In the face of the US geopolitical maelstrom, can the rest of the world keep the climate agenda on course? What initiatives might help to achieve this? There are people in every country who would deny or wish away the impact of man-made climate change. The United States, at least for the moment, is exceptional in having a national government that is almost totally dominated by such people — though Australia too once had such a government. Most governments, however, still have strong popular mandates for achieving their declared zero carbon goals. Communities around the world are confronted with intensifying natural disasters and their increasing severity and frequency that are its consequence. These events provide the foundation of support for the global climate agenda, minus national leadership in the United States. The global constituency for addressing climate change still provides incentive to businesses and farmers around the world to invest in a zero-carbon future and the innovation that is needed to make it happen. Elon Musk, and other US entrepreneurs, will hopefully continue to capitalise on the opportunities of a green economy future despite the unfavourable national policy environment they face under the Trump administration. In China and Europe where the policy environment has been conducive to building a renewable energy future, new industries and technologies have dramatically lowered the costs of energy transition and begun to claw back on carbon emissions. China and Europe have spawned comparative advantages in decarbonisation in production and consumption. The cost of solar power has fallen by 85 per cent and the cost of wind energy halved in a decade or so and Chinese capacity is rapidly lowering the cost of electric vehicles. Through open trade, technology embedded in green goods and transferred through investment, these centres of industrial innovation and energy transition are the agents of decarbonisation across the world. As the response to climate change reshapes and alters the global economy and supply chains, it opens opportunities for ambitious, strategic corporate and government players. These players will be able to accelerate the uptake of new technologies and practices that reduce emissions, create jobs and underpin economic growth across a wider range of countries and economies. The scale of resources needed to invest in climate change is daunting. The International Energy Agency estimates that, by the early 2030s, the world will need to invest US$4.5 trillion annually to remain on track for a net zero transition by 2050. Mobilising international public funding will now be harder and new sources of public funding will have to be mobilised. China is well placed to step into the breach. Policy frameworks and settings, and their extension through cooperation across national and regional borders, are essential to encourage private funding of sustainable investments, and now more importantly than ever. The problem is that US withdrawal from international climate cooperation and its frontal attack on the global trade regime could both become contagious. The immediate effect of Trump-induced global economic uncertainty is to undermine investor confidence not only in North America but around the world. Elevated international uncertainty is bad for business. It could be fatal for international climate change and trade cooperation unless the rest of the world doubles down on the multilateral, rules-based trade order and keeps the global climate change agenda on track. Like-minded countries will have to step up in an unprecedented way to leverage existing frameworks that create and keep open the markets for low carbon, sustainable goods and services. In this week’s lead essay, Ma Jun suggests that East Asian partners in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) arrangement have incentives to establish a beachhead of international cooperation on climate change and against protectionism through a regional green trade initiative. An RCEP green trade bloc would help to unlock a sustainable transition and enhance economic growth across a large part of the global economy. An open East Asian green trade arrangement, Ma argues, would ‘reduce the costs of green goods and services in most countries, boost green industries and enable faster and wider adoption of low-carbon practices and technologies’. Cementing and deepening cooperation between Europe, China and East Asia on the development of common financial frameworks (through the Multi-Jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy) for green investment is an important complement to working together on keeping trade and investment open. East Asia has the platform in place and the leverage to make a difference to global outcomes if it moves swiftly on both fronts. Source: This article was published by East Asia Forum.

Merkel Is Right: ‘Putin-Versteher’ Is Misguided – OpEd	Former German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said that discussions about Russia’s interests should not be verboten – silenced. The veteran leader in German politics has criticized the slandering of those who advocate for a greater understanding of Russia's perspective in geopolitical affairs. The term 'Putin-versteher' (Putin understander) has been employed by those seeking to silence others who advocate for a more balanced discussion regarding Russian geopolitics. Merkel has argued that such derogatory terms hinder meaningful dialogue, obfuscates better understanding and undermines diplomacy. In an interview with Berliner Zeitung on Friday, Merkel was asked how she felt about the term, which is often used to label people who address Russian President Vladimir Putin’s concerns over NATO expansion. 'Not good, because there has to be a discussion about it. You have to plan ahead for diplomatic initiatives so that they are available at the right moment,' she said. The former chancellor also rejected the idea that seeking to understand Moscow’s position amounts to supporting it. 'I find the accusation of being a 'Putin-versteher' inappropriate. It is used as a conversation-stopper, a way to shut down debate.' Asked if she has ever been called one, Merkel replied: 'No one has ever called me that – it’s a strange word. Understanding what Putin does and putting oneself in his position is not wrong. It is a fundamental task of diplomacy and something entirely different from supporting him.' Her remarks come amid an ongoing debate in Germany over its policy toward Russia. The term 'Putin-versteher' is frequently used to criticize those who advocate for diplomatic engagement with Moscow, portraying them as sympathetic to the Kremlin. Speaking on European security concerns, Merkel warned that failing to address Russia’s interests could increase the risk of future conflicts. 'There is no justification for him [Putin] invading another country, but the discussion about Russia’s interests must be allowed.' The Wall' fell in ‘89; yet, for 35 years the West has proceeded as though it was still intact. It's time to let go of our Cold War mentality – a foreign policy built on it is contrary to what is in the best interest of the United States as well as Europe. Western democracies seek long-term stability. To achieve this, the West must no longer ostracize Russia as a veritable pariah state. The predicate for such treatment is based on a perception of Moscow as the old Soviet Union, generated through a pre-1989 Cold War lens. This must give way to a new vision of relations between Russia and the West. To understand Russia, its geopolitical concerns and intentions with respect to the West in general and Europe in particular, consideration must be given to the political intrigues which ensued after the fall of the Wall in ‘89. U.S. Secretary of State James Baker’s famous 'not one inch eastward' assurance about NATO expansion in his meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on February 9, 1990, was part of a cascade of unfulfilled assurances about Soviet security. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials received reiteration of these assurances throughout the process of German reunification in 1990 and 1991. Declassified US, Soviet, German, British and French documents posted December 12, 2017 by the National Security Archive at George Washington University attest to this. There appears to be a structural fallacy in the West’s orientation vis-a-vis Russia, today. The view of the USSR as a threat during the Cold War was valid. The Warsaw Pact (created 1955 in response to NATO in 1949) was real and its purpose clear. Today, however, 'the Pact' no longer exists – not even the Russian president sees Russia as athreat to the EU or NATO. According to the reasoning of the Russian president, compared to the EU and NATO, Russia is no threat – and nuclear war is pure insanity, 'absolutely out of the question.' Today, the West must follow a new path, one not dictated by a political view created over 70 years ago and designed to fight a Cold War adversary. President Trump has already begun the journey down a new path. During the recent Saudi-Ukraine Peace Conference, the president indicated his intent to reset the US-Russia economic and political relationship. One such move is to bring Russia back into the economically powerful G-7 group of countries. In addition, the US and Russia are working towards an agreement whereby the US would participate in developing Russia’s substantial mineral deposits. Talks have reportedly focused on natural resource exploration, trade routes, and energy collaboration inclusive of the Arctic region. Moreover, Washington and Moscow are in talks on a major deal that would allow for the resumption of Russian energy exports, German outlet Correctiv reported last week, citing its own investigation. An agreement would involve American companies purchasing some portion of the previously disrupted Nord Stream pipeline infrastructure, as well as stakes in three German refineries currently owned by a subsidiary of the Russian energy giant Rosneft, the report said. These are important first steps towards long-term global geopolitical stability. But additional steps should be taken with regard to the issue of Russia and US security interests to reduce tensions and build mutual trust towards greater stability. The Russia of today (with its market economy and -- prior to February 2022 – a substantial energy source for EU economies) should be considered through the lens of Realpolitik. From the vantage point of Western security interests, Russia should be viewed within an expanded frame of reference – rather than necessarily over against it. Security is built on Realpolitik (not ideology) and that means pragmatism, not emotion. If the aim of Western security policy is to mitigate the potential for future conflicts by fostering long-term stability, then (unpalatable though it might seem) discussions with the Russian 'Bear' must commence. The longer the West delays the inevitable dialogue with Russia, the greater the likelihood of further conflicts. Knowns are better than unknowns. Realistic perceptions are to be preferred to faulty ones. Understanding the terms of Russia’s position (even if peripheral) in a more comprehensive Western security frame of reference is critical to long-term stability. Given the understandable reciprocal lack of trust between Moscow and the West, an exclusively adversarial approach is a 'Mobius twist' in which one ends up back where one started – with conflict and instability. The endless sanctions, military deterrence and strategic containment have failed to achieve their objectives and thereby increased the likelihood of future conflict. The challenge is finding a middle path (mutual understanding) between deterrence and confrontation. Keeping Russia outside will only build suspicion and predispose to instability.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfHSL6ZhmFs3pzty7v1LpQe	2025-03-17T16:46:45-07:00	
Do We All Have PTSD? – OpEd	Just how much mental and psychological trauma exists in the country and world today cannot be quantified, and I would not trust any studies that tried. But this much is clear. We have lost our footing in knowing something that scientists long believed we could know: whether and to what extent an economy is growing and prospering or going the opposite way. Everyone seems just to be winging it these days. Ever since lockdowns utterly broke reporting, it’s been hard to tell up from down. The substantial hits taken by major financial indexes over the last two months seem to have triggered a shift in public sentiment from indifferent to gloomy. Probably this has nothing to do with the vast wealth held in invested retirement accounts. Each refresh of the page seems to deliver more bad news. This has in turn affected the willingness to spend and the outlook generally. And yet there is something strange going on. Inflation in real time is genuinely down from its 4-year trend and showing the best numbers since 2020. Even the CPI reflects this. The jobs outlook for the private sector is slightly improving. Why has consumer sentiment suddenly taken a dive? It’s odd because there is a paucity of evidence for a sudden shift, unless tariffs are to blame, which seems doubtful (to me). One possible theory: the public has a form of economic post-traumatic stress disorder, a clinical name for what was once called battle fatigue and shell shock. It is what happens to the human spirit in the face of something unexpected, terrible, and ultimately traumatizing. There are stages of recovery that move from denial, anger, bargaining, and depression, with acceptance as the last stage. That might be where we are. For years now, the national media and government agencies have claimed that all is well. Inflation is cooling. Job growth is strong. The recovery is upon us. Countless media articles have bemoaned the gap that separates real data and maudlin public perceptions. We are encouraged to believe that 'shutting down the economy' is really no big deal, just something you do before turning it on again. Stop complaining! You are rich! It was the ultimate in economic gaslighting, something about which many of us have been kvetching for five years now. In 2024, Brownstone Institute commissioned a closer look. The study found that the US had been in a technical recession since 2022 and with no real recovery since 2020. The authors got to this conclusion by looking at industry price data rather than the wild underestimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It set that against a realistic output estimate. They show all their work. No one has ever taken issue with the study. This is also the 5th anniversary of the greatest trauma of our lives, the lockdowns that wrecked millions of businesses, shut hospitals and churches, restricted movement, and decimated economic life by force. No one ever thought such a thing was possible. It was a trauma for people on the level of wartime. Even now, people are reluctant to talk about it, just like granddad never spoke about his experiences in World War II. Here we are today, desperately approaching finding normalcy again. With that has come a wake-up call concerning household finances. Real income is down. Savings are down. Bills are up. Cutbacks are necessary. They have been delayed for years as the mass media trumpeted the glories of the Biden recovery that simply did not exist or was otherwise a debt-fueled hologram. Now comes the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index. After three years of showing big gains, oddly timed with the Biden presidency, it is now showing a tremendous plunge, oddly timed with the Trump inauguration. What especially makes it odd is that inflation is actually lower now than in four years. The latest numbers show none of that. I would offer a chart, but the Institute for Social Research of the University of Michigan withholds making its latest data live for fully one month. You have to pay to get it. This is why no public charting service can give you that data. Hey, they have to make a buck, right? Who can fault them for this? Well, there is a problem, one I never expected. I always thought of the University of Michigan data as likely more reliable than a federal agency. It seems like it comes from the 'real' America, a flyover state with actual scientists who are independent. It only took a quick look on Grok to discover that the Institute for Social Research and this survey in particular is one of the top recipients of federal funding. It comes from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Social Security Administration, and elsewhere. It totals as much as $100 million per year, from your pocket to theirs. They then sell their data – which is drawn from a survey of 1,000 people – to the private sector at a profit. This has been largely unknown and truly, no one really thought to question this glorious and objective data from the best data-mongers we have. In the past, it never occurred to me to look at the funding sources for this kind of research. But things are opening up. We now understand the racket. The federal government taxes you, feeds the universities and NGOs, they generate research and propaganda to feed the machine, and the cycle continues. The examples are legion and have resulted in an absolute avalanche of fake science in the last five years. We have no direct evidence that the latest Consumer Sentiment data is fake. It might be entirely real, an indication that people are only now waking up from a four-year dream state of denial and confusion – symptomatic of PTSD or shell shock from the trauma of the Covid lockdowns. On the other hand, one does wonder, given that we now know that this ballyhooed research center is actually a federal cutout. I was at an airport bar the other day, and a man asked about my awareness bracelet. It says, 'I won’t be locked down.' He wondered what that meant. Knowing that he was likely still in the denial stage, I explained that five years ago, all our rights were deleted, the economy deliberately crashed, and life was turned inside out based on edicts, pending the release of a new shot that didn’t work but everyone was forced to get anyway. I tried not to make a show of this or go on too long, so I just left it there. His response: 'Yeah that sucked.' Long pause. He followed up: 'We haven’t really had a kind of reckoning with all that, have we?' 'Nope,' I responded. He went back to his beer and nothing more was said. The days before the lockdown were indeed our last innocent moment.

Peace Between Ukraine And Russia: Is Putin Finally On Board? – Op...	By Dave Patterson In life and war, nothing is for sure. Following the negotiations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between American and Ukrainian representatives, a ceasefire and way forward to peace in the former Soviet state’s conflict with Russia seemed possible. However, amid a dispute between the two warring powers, one bent on survival and the other focused on conquest, an armistice leading to peace is tricky. The Ukraine government agreed to the conditions set out in the 30-day pause in fighting. Russia, however, is just coming to the party. A Ceasefire Between Ukraine and Russia Secretary of State Marco Rubio was guardedly optimistic in announcing the agreement between the US and Ukraine. However, he quickly pointed out that this only works if Russia’s President Vladimir Putin agrees as well. Rubio made it clear, though, that the US has put the onus on the Kremlin to make this peace deal work. Where Russia stands in the near-term had been difficult to determine, and President Putin was surprisingly vague regarding his position. However, in a breaking story from Moscow, the Associated Press reported that he 'agrees in principle with a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but the terms need to be worked out, and he emphasized that it should pave the way to lasting peace.' Before that story broke, Just the News had reported: 'President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, on Thursday rejected a 30-day ceasefire deal proposed earlier this week by Ukraine and United States.' Timely, delicate, and consequential transactions between nations can drive circumstances rapidly, as Mr. Ushakov discovered. In announcing his acceptance of the US-Ukraine proposition, Putin expressed his concern that it would be just an opportunity for Ukraine to rearm forces on the front lines. To show how difficult a negotiating process this is, during previous attempts at peace, particularly in recognition of Christmas, Ukraine was strongly critical of Russia accepting the pause in fighting to resupply and refresh its troops. According to the AP, Putin told a press conference in Moscow, 'So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it. But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.' Meanwhile, President Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, landed in Moscow to provide details of the accord. His job will not be easy. Everything about the fractured relationships between Russia and the US, plus the residual tension between the US and Ukraine, cast a shadow of intense mistrust. Success may be a long-drawn-out effort. Therein lies the problem. Ukraine’s President Zelensky must press for an end to the fighting sooner than later. Ukrainian fighters’ initial successes in moving into and capturing the Russian Kursk region are slipping away. Russian forces have recaptured the area’s largest town, and what Zelensky had hoped to be a territorial bargaining position is evaporating. If the negotiations for lasting peace come down to a discussion about trading territory, losing Kursk puts Kyiv at a disadvantage. Trump’s Sanction Threats Were Important However, the timing of Putin’s tentative agreement to the ceasefire suggests that pressure on him by the recent comments of President Trump may have been compelling. When confirmation of the Kremlin’s willingness to enter into a pause in the fighting was not timely, the US president’s Truth Social megaphone reminded the players: 'Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now before it is too late. Thank you!!!' What Trump’s posts lack in the subtlety of polite diplomacy, they make up for with clarity. During a press availability in the Oval Office Thursday (Mar. 13) with President Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, the latter commented: 'Finally with Ukraine, you broke the deadlock. As you said all the killing and young people dying; cities getting destroyed. The fact that you did that started the dialogue with the Russians and successful talks in Saudi Arabia with the Ukrainians. I really want to commend you for that.' What Trump has shown is that when he makes promises, whether on the campaign trail or as president, he keeps them, and Putin knows this. Compared to this time last month, the first steps in bringing an end to the horrifying destruction and loss of life appear closer. The willingness of Russia and Ukraine to engage in discussions to implement the 30-day ceasefire is a welcomed development. The views expressed are those of the author and not of any other affiliate.

Myanmar: Junta Troops Forcibly Recruit More Than 70 Young Men In ...	Authorities in Myanmar forcibly recruited more than 70 young men from a single town in the south-central Ayeyarwady region, residents said Monday, as the junta launched a new round of training for the country’s draftees. It’s the latest round-up under Myanmar’s military service law, which the junta began implementing last April as a way of shoring up its dwindling ranks amid mounting losses to rebel groups. On March 14, junta troops in Ayeyarwady’s Mawlamyinegyun township arrested more than 70 men — including some as young as 17 years old — and sent them to depots in the Yangon region to take part in the 11th round of military training, residents told RFA Burmese. The arrests were carried out by troops from the junta’s 534th Infantry Battalion based in Mawlamyinegyun, said one resident who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke to RFA on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. 'Young people in the villages are too afraid to sleep at home at night due to fear of conscription,' he said. 'Soldiers are forcibly arresting them. The local battalion is carrying out the arrests, and at times, parents have no idea where to look for their children [after they are taken].' The identities of the young men were not immediately clear, and RFA was unable to independently verify who was taken in the dragnet. Attempts by RFA to contact Khin Maung Kyi, the junta’s spokesperson and social affairs minister for the Ayeyarwady region, for comment on the situation went unanswered Monday. The forced recruitment comes after residents of Ayeyarwady’s Hinthada, Laputta, and Kangyidaung townships last month said that several young men fled the area after they were summoned by name for conscription, instead of an earlier used lottery system. Administrators targeted over draft Under the mandatory military service law, men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 must serve a minimum of two years in the military. Young people have been looking for ways to leave the country ever since the law was enacted. Many new recruits have been sent for training after being detained at gunpoint by junta troops. They face torture or execution if they are caught trying to escape. In late February, rebels in Myanmar’s Bago region assassinated two local administrators who forcibly recruited civilians for military service, residents and other sources said, bringing the number of officials killed for their involvement in carrying out the draft to at least 110. Prior to the incidents, the latest killing of an administrator for their involvement in military recruitment was that of Than Htwe, of Khwet Ma village in Magway region’s Minhla township, who was shot dead on Feb. 15. Between February and September 2024, anti-junta forces killed 108 ward and village administrators involved in recruiting, compiling name lists and extorting money for military service, according to data compiled by RFA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfHSL6ZhmFs3jipWcsIxzxi	2025-03-17T16:37:38-07:00	
Trump Sets Tuesday Call With Putin In Search Of Cease-Fire In Ukr...	(RFE/RL) -- US President Donald Trump said he plans to speak by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18 as he bids to bring about a cease-fire in the war in Ukraine that has drained both sides of soldiers and resources. 'I'll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. A lot of work's been done over the weekend,' Trump told reporters late on March 16 during a flight back to Washington from his resort in Florida. 'We want to see if we can bring that war to an end. Maybe we can, maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance,' Trump said. When asked about possible concessions that might be required to secure a cease-fire, Trump said that 'we'll be talking about land. We'll be talking about power plants.' 'I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.' The Kremlin did not immediately comment. Trump has made a priority during the first months of his second term in office to bring about a cease-fire agreement in the three-year war in Ukraine. After holding talks in Saudi Arabia, Ukrainian and US officials announced on March 11 that Kyiv had agreed to a 30-day cease-fire proposal, contingent on Russia's agreement. Moscow has so far reacted coolly to the idea, with Putin suggesting additional conditions, including a freeze on US weapons supplies to Kyiv. Meanwhile, a top Russian official said Moscow will insist Ukraine not be allowed to join NATO and remain 'neutral' in any peace deal -- conditions Kyiv has long rejected. One of the Kremlin's original grievances in justifying its February 2022 invasion continues to be one of Kyiv's central demands: NATO membership. On March 14, Putin had said any agreement should lead to long-term peace that addresses the 'root' reasons for the war -- an apparent reference to NATO expansion and other developments Putin claims have put Russia's security in jeopardy. In remarks published on March 17, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Grushko told the Russian daily Izvestia that 'we will demand that ironclad security guarantees become part of this agreement.' 'Part of these guarantees should be the neutral status of Ukraine, the refusal of NATO countries to accept it into the alliance,' he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has often stressed that for Kyiv to accept any peace deal it must come with security guarantees for Ukraine from its Western partners, including eventual NATO membership. 'I have insisted [on Ukraine's membership in] NATO, but you know what the answers have been,' he said in February, suggesting that the path to joining the Western military alliance remains obstructed. On March 16, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a CBS interview that a final peace accord would 'involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both Russia and Ukraine,' adding that it would be difficult to even start such talks 'as long as they're shooting at each other.' Separately in March 17, French President Emmanuel Macron and new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met in Paris and 'reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine as it continues to resist Russia’s unjustifiable war of aggression,' according to a joint statement. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy on March 16 shook up his military leadership, appointing Major General Andriy Hnatov as Ukraine's new chief of the General Staff, replacing Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Barhilevych, as Kyiv looks to speed the pace of reform and reorganization. 'We are consistently changing the armed forces to make them even more combat ready. To achieve it, we are changing the management system and introducing clear standards,' Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said The statement said Barhilevych, who was appointed to the post in February 2024, will now serve as inspector general of the Defense Ministry. Barhilevych replaced Lieutenant General Serhiy Shaptala when he took the post on the General Staff in 2024. On the battlefield, Russian forces launched what appeared to be a major drone strike on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on March 16 as explosions were heard in various districts. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said air-defense units were attempting to knock out the drones and warned residents to 'stay in shelters.' In the Sumy region, authorities said one person was killed and two injured when explosive devices dropped from a Russian drone and mortar fire hit an apartment building in the Bilopillia community. In Russia's Kursk region, Russian forces continued their drive to force Ukrainian troops from territory they had captured in a stunning cross-border offensive last August. Latest estimates put the area under Ukrainian control at about 110 square kilometers, down from a peak of nearly 1,400 square kilometers last year. Fierce battles raged in the region, making it difficult to confirm any claims by either side.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfHSL6ZhmFs3qrlxG7vNvOO	2025-03-17T16:34:37-07:00	
Hegseth Says Campaign Against Houthis Will Be ‘Unrelenting’ Until...	By Matthew Olay During a media interview yesterday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the U.S. military will continue to tactically engage Iranian-backed Houthis until they stop acting aggressively against U.S. ships in the region. Hegseth commented on the topic following President Donald J. Trump's order for U.S. Central Command to launch multiple airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen, March 15, 2025. 'Freedom of navigation is basic; it's a core national interest,' Hegseth said, adding that the current campaign is about restoring deterrents in the region in addition to freedom of navigation. 'The minute the Houthis say, 'We'll stop shooting at your ships [and] we'll stop shooting at your drones,' this campaign will end but, until then, it will be unrelenting,' he continued. Hegseth also said the airstrikes were meant to draw Iran's attention. 'The message is clear to Iran … Your support of the Houthis needs to end immediately. We will hold you accountable as the sponsor of this proxy, and I echo [the president's] statement [that] we will not be nice about it,' Hegseth said. The Houthis have been acting aggressively in the Red Sea region since October 2023, when a U.S. Navy destroyer had to intercept three land-attack cruise missiles fired by the Houthis toward Israel. Since then, the Houthis have launched over 100 drone and missile attacks targeting American and allied ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, resulting in many commercial ships having to alter their routes to avoid the region at a tremendous commercial cost. Hegseth likened the severe economic impact of the Houthi aggression in the region to 'being held hostage by a terrorist organization' and then pointed out that the Trump administration has indeed labeled the Houthis as such. 'To the Houthis: [the airstrikes weren't] a one-night thing … This is about stopping the shooting at assets in that critical waterway to reopen the freedom of navigation, which is a core national interest of the United States,' Hegseth said, before again reemphasizing that Iran needs to 'back off' from enabling the Houthis. Hegseth said Iran and its additional military proxies — including Hamas and Hezbollah — are in a 'weakened state.'

Palestine Question A Key Test Of US Foreign Policy – OpEd	It is crucial for any US administration to recognize that, regardless of political agendas, the views of the American public regarding the situation in Palestine and Israel are undergoing a significant shift. A critical mass of opinion is rapidly forming and this change is becoming undeniable. Paradoxically, while Islamophobia continues to rise across the US, sentiments supporting Palestinians and opposing Israeli occupation are steadily increasing. In theory, this means that the pro-Israeli media’s success in linking Israel’s actions against the Palestinian people to the so-called war on terror — a narrative that has demonized Islam and Muslims for many years — is faltering. Americans are increasingly viewing the situation in Palestine as a human rights issue, and one that is deeply relevant to domestic politics. A recent Gallup poll underscored this shift. The poll, released on March 6, was conducted between Feb. 3 and 16. It found that American support for Israel was at its lowest point since polling began 25 years ago, while sympathy for Palestinians had reached its highest level. Having 46 percent of Americans sympathize more with Israelis and 33 percent with Palestinians would have seemed inconceivable in the past, when the plight of Palestine and its people was largely overlooked by the general public. Even more remarkable is that this shift continues to gain momentum, despite the fact that the mainstream media and American politicians are more biased than ever, promoting a dehumanizing discourse of Palestinians and unprecedented, uncritical support for Israel. While the growing shift in favor of Palestine — particularly as a result of the genocide in Gaza, which played a role in influencing the outcomes in several states during the 2024 presidential election — went largely unnoticed by the Biden administration, it is clear that the dissatisfaction with the government’s position remains unchanged since the change of presidency. The previous administration approved significant military aid to Israel, topping $17.9 billion in the first year of the genocidal war on Gaza alone. This blatant disregard for Palestinian lives and rights has persisted under the new administration, who has appointed some staunchly anti-Palestinian, pro-Israel figures to key positions in his government. Trump did this despite making repeated, though often contradictory, promises to end the war and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Instead, the US president has approved the release of a shipment of heavy MK-84 bombs and passed the sale of arms worth nearly $3 billion to Israel. The White House also introduced a new US policy based on 'taking ownership' of Gaza and displacing its population. However, this position was inconsistently articulated and Trump last Thursday seemed to reverse it altogether. This left many wondering whether US foreign policy was truly independent or simply a reflection of the influence of Israel and its Washington lobby. Unlike President Joe Biden, whose support for Israel was consistent, the new administration’s stance has been confusing and contradictory. The US news portal Axios reported on March 5 that direct talks between the US, led by hostage envoy Adam Boehler, and Hamas had taken place in Doha. In an interview four days later, Boehler made the striking statement that US and Israeli foreign policies should be seen as separate. 'We’re the United States. We’re not an agent of Israel,' he said. However, as analysts began mulling over this unprecedented language, it was soon revealed that Boehler had been removed from his position and America’s traditional, unwavering support for Israel quickly returned. As US policymakers continue to swing between their unwavering commitment to Israel and 'America First' rhetoric, they must keep in mind the following four factors. First, the American public is increasingly aware of events in Palestine, so masking Israel’s violations of Palestinian rights under the guise of 'Israel’s right to defend itself' no longer suffices. Second, US and Israeli interests are not identical: the US seeks geopolitical dominance followed by stabilization and so-called containment, while Israel thrives on provocations, destabilization and long-lasting conflicts. Third, Palestine has become a domestic issue in the US and the debate on Palestine and Israel is no longer one-sided. Growing support for Palestine means that more US voters will base their future political decisions on how the country engages with Israel and its disregard for Palestinian rights. Fourth, crackdowns on dissent, arrests of activists and funding cuts will only deepen the polarization around this issue, rather than fostering an open, informed and productive debate on a matter of great importance to millions of Americans. Such actions are quickly eroding the reputation of the US as a democratic state and undermining confidence in its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Palestine may not be the sole measure by which the Trump administration will be judged, nor the only factor shaping future voting patterns. Yet, it is undoubtedly a crucial test. If the contradictions persist and the US continues to provide unwavering military support for Israel, Palestine could become the defining issue that contributes to the unraveling of US foreign policy, not only in the Middle East but around the world. It is not too late for this trajectory to shift or for some degree of balance to emerge. The lives of millions of people are at stake.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfHSL6ZhmFs3ry-EUX16IZ5	2025-03-17T16:30:04-07:00	
North Korean Deployment In Kursk: A Window Into The DPRK Military...	By Lorenzo Fedrigo The direct intervention of North Korea in the Ukraine war represents a test benchmark for the Korea’s People Army, whose battlefield actions are now challenging the traditional Western opinions that have always drawn it as an obsolete and ineffective power.Looking beyond the dominant media’s narrative, North Korean involvement allows us to analyze with a better precision the operative capabilities of an army which is historically shrouded in secrecy. A deepening North Korea-Russia bilateral relationship The Kim Jong-un regime, Moscow’s historical ally, has constantly demonstrated its support for Russian expansionism in Ukraine. In 2017, the DPRK recognized Crimea as part and parcel of the Russian Federation, and then endorsed the invasion of February 2022. A few months later, the North Korean regime recognized the sovereignty of self-proclaimed independent republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The latest significant diplomatic action between the two countries dates back to November 2024, with the ratification of an important military cooperation agreement which includes a mutual protection clause, sealing the strategic agreement we now see in action. In addition to political support, Pyongyang has provided an ever growing and more relevant military contribution. The first military supplies date from the end of 2022, when it appeared clear to Moscow that the conflict would last beyond its initial forecast, requiring external support in order to compensate for the military production shortfalls of Russia’s defense industry. The first North Korean aid included large deliveries of artillery munitions, but, according to data out of Ukraine, about half of the rounds fired were defective. Pyongyang continues to provide a great amount of its own ammunition production to its Russian ally.After the signing of the November 2024 agreements, this output has risen, now including self-propelled howitzers, short-range missile systems, and even soldiers in support of the Russian army – a fact still denied by Moscow and Pyongyang. The strategic rationale behind Pyongyang sending its men to support the Ukraine war resides in various conditionslaid out in the above bilateral agreements. In exchange for what Moscow sees as mere frontline fodder, the North Korean regime gains significant advantages, including access to sophisticated Russian satellite technology and the ability to acquire foreign currency to finance their nuclear and missile programs. In addition, North Korea benefits from Moscow’s sharing of advanced military technology and a reassurance of Russian support in the event of a conflict on the Korean peninsula. Unpacking the composition of the North Korean deployment in Kursk According to reporting out of Ukraine, the North Korean force sent in support to Russia amounts to between 10,000 and 12,000 men in five infantry brigades. After receiving basic training in Vladivostok, the troops were moved by air over 7,000 kilometers to the outskirts of Kursk, placed under the Russian military command, and here they’d have received Russian uniforms and equipment, in addition to forged identity documents that attribute them to the Russian region of Tuva, thereby concealing any evidence of North Korean involvement. The troops are supported by an estimated 500 officers and three North Korean generals, including Kim Yong Bok, commanding 1,500 men from the special operations forces of the People’s Army of Korea (조선인민군 특수작전군) whose presence was also confirmed by the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS). The North Korean deployment in Kursk has been used to launch continuous assaults, keeping Ukrainian forces engaged such that the Russians can concentrate on other critical areas of the front. The first North Korean attack on Ukrainian lines is likely to have been launched on 4 November, confirming Western fears dating back to August, when unit movements from Pyongyang were first detected near Vladivostok. The estimated 10,000 men deployed by the Pentagon at about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian front, were initially considered part of a defensive contingent aimed at guarding the Kursk region, which had been the subject of the Ukrainian counteroffensive a few months earlier. Assessments gathered by Ukrainian forces suggest that these North Korean forces are totally unprepared for modern war. The tactics they employ are obsolete, based on military concepts that are at least four decades old, notably in the advancing of infantry fronts without mechanized support. But above all, these strategies completely neglect the decisive role of drone warfare in modern conflicts, which the North Koreans hitherto had no experience with. Despite the outdated tactical approach, the standard equipment provided to North Korean soldiers appears qualitatively higher than the average Russian. Weapons recovered from the dead confirm the presence of AK-12 assault rifles with a dozen magazines, between five and ten grenades, several mines and an updated version of the Russian tactical backpack containing very scarce water reserves and supplies. The surprising mobility of Pyongyang’s troops, facilitated by the absence of armor and bulletproof vests, makes these fighters particularly difficult targets to hit for drones. On the disciplinary level, North Korean soldiers are distinguished by a physical and mental resistance much higher than the worn-out Russian ranks. Their absolute dedication to the orders received lends itself to treacherous frontal assaults. There are numerous reports of North Korean soldiers who, instead of surrendering, preferred to be blown up with grenades. Ideological indoctrination seems to play a central role in the behavior of these units. According to some testimonies, North Koreans would eliminate the wounded comrades in order to avoid falling prisoners, just as the Russians have opened fire several times on retreating North Koreans, in the fear that capture may reveal their true identity. As part of the role played by propaganda, notes were found on the bodies of the fallen soldiers, in which they extol the superiority of North Korea and the willingness to sacrifice themselves for the glory of their own country at any cost. Offering a counter view to this alleged ideological fanaticism inherent to North Korean soldiers, there are some revelations confirmed by both the NIS and the former National Security Communications Advisor of the White House J. Kirby. It seems that the North Korean soldiers are forced by high command to commit the unthinkable in order to avoid capture, because being taken prisoner by the Ukrainians risks serious reprisals against their families back home. Particularly relevant are some documents found on officers’ bodies, including disciplinary records that outline punishments for crimes such as stealing food from supplies or hesitating to commit suicide attacks. Captured prisoners provide window into the North Korean deployment Although the news that filters through the North Korean regime is scarce, according to the NIS, the five North Korean brigades consist mainly of conscripts called up for military service from the age of 17. The mandatory service period would be around eight years, which would explain the great physical and mental resistance of the troops, as well as the good combat skills reported by the Ukrainians. Precisely because of the poor knowledge about these soldiers and the extreme difficulty in taking them prisoner, Ukrainian troops have been on a mission for over a month to capture at least one North Korean. As reported in an interview with the Kyiv Independent, the operation that led to the capture of two North Korean soldiers in mid-January was plagued by numerous difficulties. The two prisoners had been wounded during the fighting and were lying on the battlefield; the capture operations in both cases proved particularly complex, due to the immediate Russian reaction. Although they had never fired a single shot before, when the Russian command understood that the soldiers were being recovered, they opened fire in a deliberate attempt to prevent their capture. The two prisoners are currently in the custody of the Ukrainian secret services and are subject to numerous interrogations aimed at extracting as much information from them as possible. One of the soldiers, identified as Lee Jong Nam, born in 1999 in Pyongyang, a 25-year-old sergeant, enlisted in 2016, serving in a reconnaissance platoon as a sharpshooter. His first combat mission dates back to 8 January, during which he was wounded in the jaw. All the other members of his seven-man unit were killed in operations prior to his capture. The second prisoner, born in 2005, remains unidentified. Captured by the Ukrainian media in a film from his hospital bed, he stated that he was wounded on the ground for 'three, four or five days.' He also revealed that the name on his Russian military card was false, stating that he did not remember it and that it did not correspond to his real identity. The soldier revealed that he was convinced he was in the middle of a drill. According to a recent statement by prisoners, many of his fellow soldiers were even convinced that they were fighting against South Korean troops. An ongoing learning experience with wider implications According to Seth John, an academic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, North Korean losses are difficult to quantify accurately. However, he estimates that they may be between 30% and 50% of the total, with at least 1,000 men killed in the course of the operations. The figures vary according to the sources: the South Korean NIS, for example, claims that Pyongyang has lost about 300 men, with 2,700 wounded and missing, while for Kyivthe number of casualties is estimated at 4,000. In any case, the losses are substantial, mainly due to the threat posed by drone warfare and the language barrier between North Koreans and Russians, which significantly complicates coordination on the ground. In light of this high human cost, according to Ukrainian reports, the North Korean contingent was temporarily withdrawn from the front to reintegrate personnel and receive further training, probably focused on drone tactics. There are also rumors of a possible new troop deployment by Pyongyang, in compliance with the military cooperation agreements ratified last November. As per an article published by the BBC on 7 February, the North Korean contingent has since returned to combat, however the news remains to be confirmed. Although the North Korean intervention is not essential in determining the outcome of the war, it offers us interesting insights from multiple perspectives, not only for the organization of the North Korean military, but also in the context of a wider geopolitics. The North Korean deployment in Ukraine is already producing significant effects: troops are gaining first-hand experience on the modern battlefield, mitigating against decades of tactical backwardness. At the same time, the use of domestically produced weapons and equipment in a high-intensity conflict allows Pyongyang to assess their effectiveness. Armed with this knowledge, Pyongyang, with strong Russian support, could establish itself as a relevant regional actor in East Asia.

Abortion Tourism On The Rise In Russia As Regions Adopt Different...	The Russian government has been actively seeking to reduce the number of abortions in Russia as it faces increasing demographic problems. Despite the constitutional right to abortion and the decline of abortion operations given improved birth control methods, Moscow has banned pro-choice propaganda and is supporting regional governments’ anti-abortion laws (Window on Eurasia, October 18, December 21, 2024; Garant.ru; ConsultantPlus, accessed March 12). Moscow has not instilled a country-wide abortion ban, a move that would spark criticism in politically-sensitive and sizable population centers such as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Instead of a ban, the government has supported actions by federal subjects to restrict access to abortions, ensuring a difficult process that varies across the regions. This array of regulations has caused abortions to be difficult to access in some regions and easier in others. This in turn has led to the emergence and growth of abortion tourism as women travel from abortion-restricted regions to others, or even abroad, where it is easier to access (Novaya Gazeta Europe, February 7; Veter, March 6). Using this approach, the Kremlin seeks to retain power while shifting responsibility for these restrictions onto individual regions, much as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic (see EDM, April 27, 2020). Such an approach, however, may backfire by lessening Moscow’s authority and demonstrating to citizens that laws can be bypassed. In December 2023, a private clinic abortion prohibition bill was proposed to the State Duma, but the Parliamentary Committee on Health did not support it. Many private clinics, however, have refused to perform abortions, forcing women to turn to government clinics with long wait-times and where staff reportedly pressure women to continue their pregnancy. Although these clinics were said to have voluntarily refused service, it is suspected that it was done under pressure from the authorities (Radio Svoboda, March 9, 2024). The proposal of a full abortion ban in Vologda Oblast, about 400 miles east of St Petersburg, has attracted particular attention. Georgy Filimonov, governor of Vologda Oblast, is pushing for a regional law that would ban all abortions, excluding in the cases of medical complications or rape (Novaya Gazeta Europe, February 7). This display of loyalty to the Kremlin, rather than to the Russian constitution and Russian law, is sending a chill through the region. Even if such a law is adopted, which is improbable given its unpopularity, it is unlikely to survive any subsequent court challenges. Irina Faynman, an abortion rights activist, founder of the Foundation for Emergency Contraception, and author of the Telegram channel 'Whispers of the Blood', is certain no such law will ever pass at the federal level because it would be so unpopular (Russian Feminist Association 'SHE', July 22, 2023; T.me/shorokhi_krovi, accessed March 12). Faynman argues that Moscow is attempting to achieve the same ends by forcing the regions one by one to introduce such measures (Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). Unsurprisingly, under these circumstances, other regional heads seek to continue the approach the Putin regime has long maintained and are looking to adopt regulations in a move to shift the responsibility to hospitals, doctors, and municipalities (Mel, March 8). According to Faynman, some women who are being refused requests for abortions at clinics in Vologda Oblast are now travelling to neighboring Yaroslavl Oblast where there are no such restrictions. At present, this is the easiest option as they can travel there by local train or bus for relatively little money. The total number of women doing so is unknown, she acknowledges, but the hospitals in Yaroslavl are now reporting overcrowding in their obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN) departments. They may soon need to turn women away, not because their region has banned abortion but because there simply are not enough doctors and nurses to accommodate the number of procedures (Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). Due to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s healthcare optimization project, which has cut the number of hospitals and doctors throughout Russia over the last decade, this will be a growing problem (Novyye Izvestiya, May 19, 2024; Novaya Gazeta Kazakhstan, September 16, 2024). The phenomenon of Russian women traveling for abortions has grown to the point that Russians refer to it as 'abortion tourism,' Faynman says (Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). This term is not unique to Russia and has been used in places such as the United States for some time. The term abortion tourism gained popularity in 2023 as more and more women travelled from region to region for abortions. Faynman states that the routes that have attracted the most attention are those from Karelia, Kursk, and Kaliningrad to Moscow and St. Petersburg. While most Russian abortion tourism remains within the borders of the country, Faynman says, an increasing number of women are travelling to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan for medical procedures. Those countries provide good services in this regard and are not expensive for the Russian women who need them (Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). Faynman adds that she and other activists are currently forming groups to educate women on their rights and to access abortions when needed (Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). The Russian government, however, may counter this by charging them with promoting abortion, something now illegal country-wide, or otherwise seek to suppress their activities (Verstka, March 10). In this situation, she says Russian women should not continue to count on being able to access the morning-after pill, as many have in recent years, but rather should instead practice safe sex to avoid being at the mercy of Kremlin policies (Novyye Izvestiya, November 28, 2024; Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). Abortion tourism is only one of the ways in which Moscow’s efforts to restrict or even ban abortions are backfiring. Russian sociologists claim that such moves will do little to nothing to boost the birthrate (Window on Eurasia, February 16). More seriously, however, many Russian women will turn to illegal abortion providers at great risk to their health and lives (Yesli Byt’ Tochnym, July 28, 2023). This latest Kremlin tactic is likely to exacerbate relations between the regions and the center, highlighting how the Kremlin seeks to protect itself by not imposing such restrictions on women in Moscow and St. Petersburg. This tactic, however, also suggests that if the federal subjects hold the right to restrict or even ban abortions, they should have the ability to make decisions on other issues as well. This will affect not only traditional questions such as restrictions on alcohol sales and consumption, but broader political ones as well (The Insider, November 22, 2024; Nakanune.ru, March 6). Consequently, while banning abortions in certain regions may please Russian conservatives, this move may end by undermining and even threatening Putin’s hold on power, hardly the result he or Russia’s conservatives want (Window on Eurasia, August 7, 2023). The growth of abortion tourism is yet another harbinger of the fall of Putin’s regime.

Regional Green Trade Bloc To Fight Both Climate Ahange And Protec...	By Ma Jun US President Donald Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico, and all imports of aluminium and steel has led the world to brace for major trade disruptions and economic confusion. Protectionism has come back into vogue and countries are cultivating critical sectors at home to bolster their economic security. The retreat from free trade will accelerate under Trump, with far-reaching consequences — especially in the fight against climate change. But the world has changed significantly in recent years. A deeper trend visible beyond the posturing and threats includes growing recognition of the urgency of cultivating home-grown green industries to combat climate change. This climate imperative must serve two mutually reinforcing goals — staving off further temperature increases and boosting economic growth and job creation. Green trade is international trade in green goods and services in areas such as renewable energy, green transportation, energy efficiency, waste management, sustainable agriculture, nature-based solutions and environmental professional services. Allowing free green trade — the trading of green goods, services and technologies as freely as possible across nations — will help decarbonise the economy and protect the environment at low cost. A green trade arrangement would involve reductions in tariffs and non-tariff barriers on a carefully selected list of green goods and services that deliver environmental and climate benefits. This will reduce the costs of green goods and services in most countries, boost green industries and enable faster and wider adoption of low-carbon practices and technologies. Introducing green trade policy on a global scale is challenging as one or two nations can obstruct a complex global deal. But it can be built on the foundations of existing regional trade agreements, among a smaller ‘coalition of the willing’. In the Asia Pacific region, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) offers one avenue for freeing up green trade. As the world’s largest trading bloc, by population and GDP, it comprises 15 countries and accounts for 30 per cent of global economic activity. A green trade arrangement could operate within the terms of RCEP, eliminating tariffs and significantly reducing non-tariff barriers on green goods and services ahead of the bloc’s existing eight-year timeline for full tariff removal. Designing the list of green goods and services that should be covered by the green trade arrangement is the first step that is needed. An initial study by the Institute of Finance and Sustainability (IFS) suggests that this list could include a few dozen categories and a few hundred products and services. Demonstrating the economic benefits of a green trade agreement to all member states will be key. Robust design of the arrangement must ensure that all member countries in the bloc benefit economically, accelerating their pace of decarbonisation and advancing the growth of their green industries. Incentives for green foreign direct investment and technology transfers — such as a more stable policy environment, enhanced protection for investors and intellectual property rights — need to be incorporated into the green trade arrangement to increase trade and encourage cross-border green investment and technology transfers and help low-income countries develop green industries and jobs. If RCEP adopts the idea, a larger number of Chinese, Japanese and South Korean electric vehicle and renewable energy equipment manufacturers are likely to invest in supply chain development and license technologies to local producers across ASEAN countries. There needs to be a balance between the need for policy incentives to stimulate green industries and trade-distorting subsidies. Government incentives for the production and consumption of green goods and services are often viewed favourably, but they can lead to trade disputes. Within the RCEP framework, it would be helpful if some no-significant-harm principles and prohibited subsidies could be agreed upon. Non-tariff barriers not only tariffs must be removed or reduced. Under many free trade arrangements, non-tariff barriers are often more significant impediments than tariffs to international trade and investment in green industries. This requires a serious stocktake of all non-tariff barriers, including import and export quotas, quality inspection against domestic standards, customs clearance processes, product traceability requirements, trade finance and export credit insurance and cross-border payment and settlement. Options should be developed to reduce these barriers, including harmonising green product and traceability standards and reducing the cost of trade finance using green finance instruments. A dialogue that considers all these factors will be crucial and larger economies such as China, Indonesia, Australia, Japan and South Korea can play a key role in forming an initial consensus on the economic and climate merit of a green trade initiative within RCEP. A regional green trade arrangement can be an inclusive approach to support a ‘just’ climate transition. It will promote decarbonisation and mutual economic benefits in all member states — via job creation and revenue growth. A multilateral approach will build mutual trust for broader cooperation on climate and trade issues. The case for green trade arrangements is even stronger compared to the approach being embraced by some advanced economies. While the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) favoured by the European Union can reduce carbon leakage from imports, it harms incomes and employment in developing economies exporting carbon-intensive goods. Such unilateral measures are likely to lead to retaliation and yet more protectionism. CBAM amounts to a ‘stick’ that punishes developing countries for not sacrificing domestic growth and development to reduce emissions. In contrast, a green free trade arrangement provides a ‘carrot’ encouraging green production and trade. Aligning climate goals with trade and development objectives rewards all participating economies for making progress on the green transition with mutual gains from trade, an initiative of the type a just green transition demands.

Western Pundits Should Stop Writing Idiotic Nonsense About Russia...	From an extremely small list, Owen Matthews has been one of the more balanced mainstream commentators on the war in Ukraine. Not seeking to take one side over the other, but to step back and look at the bigger picture. I was shocked, therefore, by his article in the Independent this week. ‘The Russian economy is on the brink of collapse, and Putin knows it,’ ran the headline. I’ve read a different version of the same headline over a hundred times since 2014, including while serving as the Economic Counsellor at the British Embassy in Moscow. I am still waiting for it to be proved correct. Firstly, some of the data in Matthews’ article were objectively not correct. The ‘ruble has lost over half its value since Putin invaded Crimea in 2014.’ Wrong. It is around one third of its spring 2014 value. And as I’ve pointed out many times, a weak ruble has been an explicit article of Russian monetary policy since late 2016, to offset the effect of major energy price swings. That helped Russia pull in record tax receipts in 2022 because of the potent combination of sky high energy prices and rock bottom ruble rate. That’s basic economics. ‘Over $600bn of the Kremlin’s foreign currency reserves have been frozen in Western banks,’ Wrong again. The figure is less than $300bn, and Russia still retains the same value of available reserves, that would cover over a year’s worth of imports. I could go on but won’t. Matthews is known as an historian, not an economist. I don’t claim to be an economist either, but I can count. In broad terms, I don’t dispute the economic headwinds that Matthews points to, albeit clumsily. Domestic labour constraints driven by the war and Russia’s secular population decline are a problem. Massive fiscal stimulus is overheating the economy with inflation high. Although I’d argue that 9% isn’t ‘rampant’; one million percent in Venezuela is rampant. However, Russia has been here before. Inflation breached the 9% mark in November 2014 following the oil price collapse, and didn’t fall below that level until early 2016. It peaked again at the start of the war in Ukraine hitting 18%. Interest rates in Russia now are extremely high at 21% but, again, they were hiked to 17% in December 2014. It isn’t incorrect for Matthews to point out these legitimate economic challenges. The point is that neither inflation nor interest rates will ever be a strong enough reason for President Putin to change course in Ukraine. Not now, not in 2014, not at any point since the Ukraine crisis started. He has always chosen to accept economic pain and manage the political consequences of that, to avoid backing down in the face of western economic pressure. Like so many mainstream pundit, Matthews briefly sketches the economic fix Ukraine is in before hurrying along as if there’s ‘nothing to see here’. Conveniently, he doesn’t explore the mathematics of how Europe will pay to keep the lights on in Kyiv while also funding Von der Leyen’s $800bn rearmament programme. Nor has he considered what this would mean for ordinary European citizens who increasingly question the wisdom of funding a forever war that Ukraine cannot win. Or considered the link between self-defeating war policy of identikit globalist European leaders and the rise in the popularity of anti-war nationalist parties all across Europe. Owen Matthews doesn’t touch on Ukraine’s looming sovereign default and the collapse of its currency that would follow. Or the concern that, with a structural current account deficit, Ukraine has no way to exist as an independent, sovereign nation, other than, you guessed it, through western state handouts. Nor how the immense cost of bailing Ukraine out would fall on Europe on top of the contingent liabilities already enumerated above. Rather, Matthews suggests that Europe needs to do more of what is has been doing for the past eleven years without success. More sanctions, even though over 90% of individual sanctions have absolutely no effect. He doesn’t reflect on the fact that Russia has been under sanctions for eleven straight years, is the most sanctioned country on the planet, and yet is still growing faster than Europe, even though that growth is undoubtedly built on fiscal sand. Yet still, finally and irrevocably, he suggests Europe could cut itself off completely from Russian gas. No need to dwell on the obvious economic truth that higher-cost energy in Europe is driven by a huge imbalance between supply and demand that neither the U.S. nor Russia experiences. No thought given to the notion that Europe’s deindustrialisation has been accelerated by the political choice to cut off 90% of piped Russian gas supplies. As every other mainstream British pundit has called for more sanctions and less gas, Owen Matthews has plumped for the easy option too. Presumably to show some value-added in his low-calorie commentary, Owen Matthews supports Ukrainian drone attacks on any energy infrastructure that facilitates the delivery of Russian gas to Europe. Clearly impressed by the destruction of the NordStream pipeline, like a spotty-faced teenager watching a Seventies Bond movie, he considers industrial terrorism to be a legitimate policy choice for western leaders. I would like to say that his article was terrible. But in truth, it was no different from practically every other mainstream British Glavlit article on Russia’s economy that I’ve seen over the past eleven years. And, the thing is, it isn’t that it was littered with data that was objectively untrue. It was not the not the lack of economic analysis, or the failure to explore the greater economic challenge facing Ukraine. It was not, even, the crass and frankly dangerous policy prescriptions. It was that, like so many other journalists I had thought weaker, Owen Matthews was missing the point. Badly, irresponsibly, and idiotically, missing the point. Despite the very clear economic challenges that Russia does face because of the war in Ukraine, its economy will always be better placed to manage the shock of war than Ukraine’s. Every argument to punish Russia more will only embolden Putin to keep fighting. In this war of attrition, Ukraine, and Europe, will run out of money first. And with Trump shutting off the taps of American money, that crunch point will come much sooner.

America Is Already A Large Country. Let’s Not Make It Bigger – Op...	By Patrick Carroll One of the themes that seems to be emerging in the first weeks of Donald Trump’s second term is geography, and specifically cartography. He has already renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, he has floated the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state, and he has also expressed interest in bringing Greenland into the fold. Suffice it to say, a lot of maps will need to be redrawn if he gets his way. This isn’t the first time Americans have set their sights on acquiring new territory. Indeed, American history is littered with expansionist schemes, from westward expansion to the Alaska Purchase and so on. It’s apposite that Trump has also changed the official name of Denali back to Mount McKinley, after another expansionist president. Not everyone is happy with these latest designs, of course. Canadians in particular have mostly balked at the notion of being absorbed by the US. But while the merits and demerits of these proposals can be debated, what’s really interesting about these border conversations is the fact that we’re even having them. Thinking Outside the Box National borders have become deeply ingrained in many parts of the modern world. While some borders do change from time to time, many others—such as the Canada/US border—have been the same for decades and have come to be taken for granted. From a young age we learn that this is just the way the world is, and the standard depiction gets reinforced by the thousands of maps we encounter throughout our lives. But with Trump’s recent moves, people are waking up to the fact that we don’t need to accept the longstanding status quo borders that we’ve inherited. If everyone is on board, we can just change the map if we feel like it. The people who drew the existing lines aren’t in charge anymore; we are, and we have every right to draw different lines if we so choose. The question then arises: What kind of political borders should we want? What’s the ideal size of a country, and, conversely, how many countries should there be? At first blush, it seems clear that there’s a Goldilocks zone for country size. A country that’s too big would likely run into problems because it would force all sorts of diverse and geographically dispersed people groups into the same polity. At the same time, a country that’s too small might miss out on economies of scale. When weighing this idea, it’s important to remember just how wide this spectrum can be. Some of today’s countries are tiny microstates—such as Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and Vatican City—and yet by all accounts they seem to be doing fine, if not excelling. But while these practical considerations are interesting to ponder, there’s a moral component to this question as well. The Case for Smaller Countries In the view of America’s Founding Fathers, governments have a very specific role, namely, protecting the rights of the people. The whole point of the institution, in their view, is establishing and enforcing this moral principle. So maybe the question we should be asking is not so much 'What size of country is the most practical?' but rather 'What size of country will be the most conducive to the protection of human rights?' On this question, there’s a good case to be made that having a large number of small countries is better than having a small number of large countries. In his 2022 book Breaking Away: The Case for Secession, Radical Decentralization, and Smaller Polities, Ryan McMaken outlines some of the primary benefits of political decentralization. 'The first benefit of decentralization is that smaller states and decentralized states allow residents to make more choices as to what sort of regime they wish to live under in order to better meet their needs and protect their rights,' he writes. When a wide variety of other countries are right next door, relocating to a country that’s a better fit for you is a much more realistic option. Another point McMaken makes is that decentralization tends to limit the power of aggressive states: On the whole, small and decentralized states are less likely to abuse their power, destroy their economies, and disregard basic human rights. Large, centralized states, on the other hand, are more easily able to abuse their residents and deny their rights, leading also to more dysfunctional economies and diminished economic opportunity. While pondering these ideas, some may be concerned that breaking up countries would compromise the unity of a territory or people group, but that doesn’t have to be the case. Countries can come together to form military and economic partnerships, just like they currently do. Decentralization is not about breaking people apart. It’s simply about changing the administrative structure of the world to something that will do a better job of fostering freedom and prosperity. All that to say, now that longstanding borders are suddenly being questioned, this seems like a good time to interrogate the cartographic shibboleths of our age.

Free Markets Promote Peaceful Cooperation And Racial Harmony – Op...	By Wanjiru Njoya In Human Action, Ludwig von Mises highlights the importance of human cooperation as a prerequisite for the division of labor and free exchange. Without this, humanity remains mired in poverty: The 'state of nature' that the reformers and utopians depicted as paradisiac was in fact a state of extreme poverty and distress. 'Poverty,' says Bentham, 'is not the work of the laws, it is the primitive condition of the human race.' Even those at the base of the social pyramid are much better off than they would have been in the absence of social cooperation. They too are benefited by the operation of the market economy and participate in the advantages of civilized society. Mises emphasizes that free exchange does not merely benefit specific groups but benefits everyone in society. He argues that 'everybody is interested in the preservation of the social division of labor, the system that multiplies the productivity of human efforts.' He calls this 'the theorem of the harmony of the rightly understood interests of all members of the market society,' because all members of society benefit from free market exchange. He debunks the theory propagated by Marxists that capitalism is about 'class affiliation' and their claim that economics is about promoting the 'class interests' of the bourgeoisie at the expense of the proletariat. In what are often described as 'Neo-Marxist' theories, class interests are now seen by many people as analogous to race interests, so they depict economics as an attempt to promote the interests of one race at the expense of another. They claim that 'oppressor' races represent a threat to the economic interests of 'oppressed' races. Failing to understand the social and economic benefits of free exchange, they cling to the false notion that economic development is a zero-sum game, in which anyone who gains can only do so at the expense of others who must lose—the fallacy that some are rich because others are poor. This is one of the fundamental errors made by race-hustlers who claim that black people are poor because white people are rich. They view market exchange as just another platform for racial conflict, in which different races compete against each other for a fixed amount of wealth. They promote racial hostility and treat peaceful cooperation with disdain. They wage all types of wars—real and metaphorical—such as the 'war on hate' and the 'war on racism,' which assign blame for social and economic problems along racial lines. For example, an article published by the Economic Policy Institute claims that the economic model of the American South is deliberately racist and aims 'to extract the labor of black and brown Southerners as cheaply as possible.' Although slavery in the United States was abolished in 1865, these economists claim that 'the Southern economic development model ensures that businesses continue to have access to cheap Black labor even after the abolition of slavery.' They are champions of the twisted Orwellian notion that 'war is peace' as they attempt, in vain, to bring about economic progress, not through peaceful cooperation and exchange, but instead through fomenting racial conflict. Yet this racial rhetoric—far from inspiring economic progress—leads only to persistent hostility and resentment, which, in turn, yields more poverty and destitution. Punished with Poverty In their book, Punished with Poverty, Ronald and Donald Kennedy reject such insistence on viewing the economy of the South through the prism of race. The Kennedys point out that after the war of 1861-1865, policies of subjugation and poverty were deliberately pursued to the detriment of the entire South. They argue that this was harmful to all races—and the poorest suffered the most. The view was widespread at the time that subjecting the South to poverty was no more than a people who lost a war should expect. The Kennedys illustrate this with the example of Horace Greeley, who in May 1861 said that: When the rebellious traitors are overwhelmed in the field, and scattered like leaves before an angry wind, it must not be to return to peaceful and contented homes. They must find poverty at their firesides, and see privation in the anxious eyes of mothers and the rags of children. While Greeley’s views, like those of many others, may have evolved as the war unfolded, the view he expressed in 1861 was once again featured during the Reconstruction era, in an article published in 1872 by The New York Times. It is clear that the economic policy of Reconstruction was not designed to rebuild the South, but to 'punish it with poverty' as the Kennedys put it. In a similar vein, Tom DiLorenzo observes that: The main purpose (and effect) of the 1865–1877 'Reconstruction' policies was to centralize and consolidate state power and to establish Republican Party political hegemony. It was not to 'heal the nation’s wounds' or economically revitalize the South. Indeed, Reconstruction created new wounds and economically destroyed the South. Its purpose was to continue the economic plundering of the Southern states for as long as possible, and to establish a national Republican Party political monopoly. Therefore, the Kennedys argue that the economic interests of the South during Reconstruction should not be understood purely by reference to race, but instead ought to be seen as the common interest of the South. They point out that, 'The Northern desire to put Southern children in ‘rags’ was not directed just at white Southerners but it was directed at all Southerners, both white and black.' Contemporary economic challenges, then, cannot be understood as pertaining to specific races. Thus, the Kennedys argue that: …the South’s impoverishment will not be corrected by improving one part (black or white) of the South’s population while leaving the other in poverty… The propagandists for the Federal Empire have done a masterful job in convincing black Southerners that if the white South gains then the black South will lose. This false Yankee narrative began during the War and Reconstruction and continues today. This narrative of the Radical Republicans, which claimed that white Southerners were against economic progress for blacks, was countered by both black and white speakers at an event organized by a black group, the Pole-Bearers’ Association, in July 1875. A speech given at this event by Gideon Pillow emphasized that 'the two races have a common interest in each other and in each others’ welfare…the interests of the white and colored races in the south are inseparably intermingled, and are dependent on each other. What advances the interests of the one advances the interest of the other.' Pillow was echoing the words of Nathan Bedford Forrest who in his address at this event said: 'I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt—that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live on the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers?' About the author: Dr. Wanjiru Njoya is the Walter E.

The Geopolitical Implications Of Energy Transition – Analysis	Shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources can be considered a major transformation of the twenty-first century and was solemnly adopted due to the increase in efforts made towards combating climate change. This shift also included technological and environmental factors along with considerable changes in a country's politics. W hile countries try to embrace cleaner energy systems with the intent of reducing carbon emissions, the shifting energy systems are transforming the world's power relations, economic interdependencies, and international affairs. This article aims to understand the international relations impact of such energy transitions, focusing on the power shifts, the emergence of new critical mineral markets, the reduced dominance of traditional petrostates, the creation of new forms of international and interregional competition and cooperation, and how such factors will impact international politics and the challenges and opportunities that will emerge from it. The Redistribution of Global Power The power structure worldwide undergoes key transformations due to the continuing energy transition. Throughout history, fossil fuel-abundant nations including Saudi Arabia together with Russia and the United States used their resources to gain significant political influence. Global power centres are starting to realign because the worldwide shift towards renewable energy sources is taking place. Nations that excel in renewable energy cultivation along with exports and technological development including essential minerals sourcing will gain status as future superpowers of the energy sector. China currently leads other nations in renewable energy technology production by being the worldwide front-runner for solar panels wind turbines and batteries. Significant financial support for research and development activities has provided China with decisive advantages in the worldwide energy transformation process. The nation leads worldwide in solar panel production at 70% of total output and has major battery manufacturers CATL and BYD among its manufacturers. The dominant position of China allows the country to control world markets and lead the development of future energy systems. Through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has expanded its political influence by making large investments in renewable energy initiatives for Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The European Union (EU) has established itself as a prominent climate policy leader while working to achieve carbon neutrality targets through green technology innovation. The European Commission launched the European Green Deal in 2019 to transform Europe into the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The initiative aims to invest €1 trillion in renewable power development along with energy efficiency upscales and sustainable infrastructure advancement during the succeeding decade. EU initiative-taking climate policy has given the organization both geographical power and international leadership capacity to establish worldwide benchmarks and steer global climate discussions. The global reduction in fossil fuel dependency has diminished the worldwide influence of Russia and Saudi Arabia since the world shifted toward alternative energy sources. Oil and gas exports account for 40% of the Russian federal budget revenue and these exports have been strained by reduced demand alongside Western economic restrictions (BP, 2023). The Ukrainian invasion fast-tracked European nations to abandon Russian energy supplies thus making Moscow internationally weaker. Saudi Arabia seeks economic diversification through Vision 2030 while its export revenue heavily depends on oil at 85%. The Importance of Critical Minerals Sustainable energy development heavily relies on essential minerals that include lithium, cobalt nickel, and rare earth elements because these elements enable battery production electric vehicle manufacturing and renewable energy infrastructure development. The geopolitical influence of mineral supply chains intensifies because most foreign supply routes are restricted to a few countries thus creating both strategic risks and diplomatic possibilities. China exercises control over 60% of global rare earth element production and it continues to invest in mining activities throughout Latin America and Africa. Advanced technological devices, which include wind turbines and electric vehicles require these rare elements for their production. The extensive Chinese control of this sector provides Beijing with the power to influence worldwide markets and manipulate other countries through economic pressure. In 2010 China suspended its rare earth element exports which disrupted major international supply routes throughout the diplomatic standoff with Japan. The United States alongside its allies have started a synchronized effort to distribute their supply chains by funding domestic mining activities while developing resource partnerships in locations like Australia and Canada. Because of its critical minerals needs the U.S. created the Energy Resource Governance Initiative (ERGI) to support environmentally friendly mining operations and maintain vital mineral supply. The European Union acknowledges critical minerals as strategic assets thus it works on developing local sources while creating stronger international partnerships to reduce dependence on China. The anticipated growth of mineral resource competition could trigger both nationalist policies and international trade conflicts together with military confrontations. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) stands out as an essential location because the country produces 70% of global cobalt while becoming a focal point of international rivalry. The battery technology market heavily relies on cobalt because it powers the crucial lithium-ion cells utilized for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. Cobalt mining in the DRC frequently creates environmental damage together with human rights violations that generate substantial ethical and environmental concerns. The resolution of present-day struggles in mining requires international partnerships between nations together with the implementation of environmentally friendly mining guidelines. Other than the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) which promotes transparency and accountability in mining operations, more steps must be taken to achieve fair distribution of energy transition benefits. The Diminishing Influence of Petro-Dependent Nations The decline of global dependence on fossil fuels creates substantial economic challenges for petrostates because these nations operate through oil and gas exports. The financial success and international influence of Saudi Arabia together with Russia and Venezuela stem from their fossil fuel product exports. Energy transition threatens these oil-exporting countries economically and politically leading to possible social unrest throughout their territories and regional peace destabilization. Russia's federal budget depends on oil and gas exports to the extent of 40% which has led to financial deterioration due to reduced global demand and international sanctions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has accelerated European nations to shift their energy supply from Russian sources thus strengthening both political and economic independence of Ukraine and weakening Moscow's international position. Russia attempts to reverse its market deterioration by strengthening ties with China and India, but European market retreat continues to affect their economic stability. The Saudi government launched Vision 2030 to reduce oil dependence in its economy through investments in renewable energy projects and growth in the tourism and entertainment industry. These strategic initiatives show unclear results because oil remains responsible for exporting 85% of the kingdom's revenue. Petrostates declining power will make a noticeable impact on worldwide security levels. Depletion of revenue creates obstacles for these countries to support their social systems and maintain political stability thus causing internal conflicts which can lead to population movements across borders. Venezuela became an economic disaster after its citizens lost wealth to falling international oil prices alongside its administrative dysfunction. Under such conditions, Venezuela has become the source of a humanitarian crisis that pushes 6 million of its citizens to leave their homes resulting in increased pressure on Colombia and Brazil. Some petrostates take assertive measures to defend their interests through manipulation of energy prices together with proxy-conflict engagement. The Middle Eastern nation Iran serves as an example by using revenue from oil to fund military groups in the area that raise regional conflict levels. The progress of alternative energy transitions will cause petrostate geopolitical methods to transform into new international security challenges. The Rise of New Alliances and Conflicts Renewable energy development creates new strategic alliances and competitive relations between countries which seek to secure their energy systems. International power relations acknowledge renewable energy collaboration as an essential factor which enables countries to share technology construct infrastructure systems and address climate change challenges. The European Green Deal operated by the European Union attains partnerships with African nations to develop their renewable energy sector while boosting their sustainable development framework. The process of transition is deepening already existing conflicts alongside producing fresh disputes. Knowledge sharing, infrastructure building and climate policy initiatives drive important disputes that emerge from mineral resource competitions. Geopolitical competition is escalating for energy network development such as pipelines and grids. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China has delivered substantial investment to renewable energy ventures that traverse Asia and Africa while Europe through an approach that worries local nations about debt burdens and Chinese strategic control. Energy transition affects both military strategy development as well as defence organization priorities. Both cyber threats and physical attacks on renewable energy infrastructure are prompting nations to allocate funds for protective measures because renewable energy holds vital importance for national security. Space satellite systems serve as primary monitoring instruments for managing renewable energy installations as countries build space-force capabilities. The Importance of International Institutions The energy transformation process demands robust worldwide organizations to manage its network of complex geopolitical issues. The United Nations (UN) together with the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) require transformation to monitor essential components like resource administration and climate financial assistance along with technological delivery. The priority must concentrate on creating international standards and rules regarding renewable energy technologies along with essential mineral supply chains. The development of clear guidelines that maintain fairness while ensuring transparency stands essential for resource access alongside environmental sustainability and prevention of exploitation. International collaboration plays a vital role in helping developing nations achieve their energy transition by ensuring the worldwide distribution of renewable energy benefits. Conclusion The energy transition serves both environmental protection needs and geopolitical system changes worldwide. The transition has restructured worldwide political structures through new power alliances, it has established complex networks of reliance and exposure, and it generates mixed results from collaborative work and confrontational actions. Countries need to address geopolitical difficulties during their energy transition while finding ways to benefit from existing opportunities. The path towards a smooth energy transition needs global partnership based on multilateral institutions to succeed. Unite national efforts help nations to minimize resource competition risks along with providing support to vulnerable oil-producing states and promoting sustainable development. The energy transition remains a critical challenge of our present time since it will affect global geopolitics throughout the ensuing years.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqjx-Jwg1rdqYt	2025-03-16T17:28:05-07:00	
Europe Needs Trump, Now And In The Future – Anlysis	Europe is staring down the barrel of a stark new harsh truth and reality where the US is no longer a given in the security umbrella of the continent, and all the past ignorance and almost total reliance on Washington for its security needs will now need a total overhaul. Europe and NATO without the US will inevitably spell doom for both, as although they have more than a million troops and modern weaponry at its disposal from the 31 other countries in the alliance, they still lack the final piece of the capacity needed to win a conflict and to deal a decisive blow, or to even have a capable deterrent effect in the first place. With Ukraine now accepting the peace proposal from the US and that the ball is now in the court of Moscow, Europe left even more vulnerable and less influential in the stakes involved, especially the future. During the Cold War, US troops were on the continent as a deterrent to Soviet ambitions, but now, the presence there further fuelled complacency on the parts of Europe,encapsulated in the potential move to reassign American troops from Germany to Hungary. Europe is now seen from the lens of Washington and Trump as increasingly the enemy and disruptor from within, where decades of military support and funding have only been met with more economic and trade imbalances that have further squeezed Washington. For Europe, long buoyed by Washington's easy and entrenched support in a bipartisan basis before Trump came along, it has now increasingly termed Washington as the enemy rather than the trusted ally, from the increasingly fragile security umbrella to the ease of Trump using his cards to expand influence and territories and using the tariff tool to correct pact imbalances, including goals on Greenland and Canada. Europe sees that if Trump can do that to established allies including Canada, then Europe minus the strategic foresight and move by UK's Starmer, will be in the line of fire as well. Some argue that as soon as Europe realises that it can no longer trust and rely on Washington, it will be compelled to fix its own security which will create an even stronger, not weaker Europe. This does not reflect the past and future reality of the continent's security and economic credentials. Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk argued that Europe as a whole is truly capable of winning any military, financial, or economic confrontation with Russia. Far from it, Europe is left as a sitting duck without the US. Washington has been central to European security WWII, helped to create NATO and deployed hundreds of thousands of soldiers to Europe to challenge Soviet influence. As of July 2024, the US had about 65,000 active-duty soldiers permanently stationed across Europe, along with extensive weaponry, defence systems and other assets vital to NATO, according to the US government's Defense Manpower Data Center. Most of those US troops are in Germany (35,000), Italy (12,000) and the UK (10,000), and with some 10,000 soldiers on rotational deployment in Poland which is a key part of NATO's eastern flank with Russia. While some have argued that the UK, France, Italy and Spain all possess modern aircraft carriers and amphibious ships capable of launching jets as compared to Russia's single antiquated aircraft carrier, they lack the capacity, readiness and volumes of direct deterrence and in sustaining a protracted war that Russia is now accustomed to, even with the various economic pressure in place. NATO's European allies have some 7,000 aircraft, 6,800 tanks, 2,170 military ships and six aircraft carriers, according to the Global Firepower defence index. However, they lack the real life firepower capacity and the precedence of war fighting experience unlike what the Americans and Russians have had. Russia enjoys higher volume and practical experience and an upper hand advantage both in conventional and nuclear capacities. France and Britain both have a combined nuclear warheads of around 500, while the US has around 5000, and Russia has the highest number at approximately 6000. Currently, Russia has at least 1.32 million active-duty soldiers, hundreds of thousands of whom are fighting in Ukraine.Russia also operates dozens of overseas military facilities, most located in former Soviet states. The capability and power gap still persists between the whole of Europe and Washington's armoury that is very much in need. The new wave of arms race and armament has changed the orientation of the region, but Europe still needs Washington support. Zelensky has claimed that around 40% of his country's battlefield needs are being met through domestic production, often in joint ventures with Western defence firms, but remains vulnerable without American support especially in nuclear and high technology missiles. Last year, only 18 NATO allies just spent the target of 2% of GDP in defence. Currently, the EU's member states spend some €325bn ($340bn) a year on defence, which comes to about 1.8% of the bloc's GDP. That is still, three years into the war in Ukraine, less than the 2% target that NATO set its members in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea and occupied the eastern Donbas region. Even the 3.5% figure leaves a gap of 1.7% of GDP to be filled. What does Europe really lack? It is the basic military technology and capability that make armed forces credible, capable and most importantly, lethal. Europe has outdated and outnumbered ships and missiles. It has ships without the proper missiles, planes without the needed technological capacity including jamming capabilities, and even troops without adequate ammunition. The disparity of Western and Eastern European military capabilities and intra-European power gap are glaring. Lacking the combined holistic military spectrum, including intelligence, space security and satellite capabilities, cyber and digital warfare, missiles, and nuclear first and second strike capacities, Europe cannot afford to defend itself without America. The nature of European arsenals cannot match with the overall nuclear and military umbrella that America provides. The American nuclear umbrella and nuclear forces have protected Europe for decades, serving as the ultimate deterrent. But it has for decades been piggybacking on America's back, banking on the conventional and assured American military and financial support in securing its interests and security needs without the urgent need to bolster these capabilities. The nature of European arsenals cannot match with the overall nuclear and military umbrella that America provides. The American nuclear umbrella and nuclear forces have protected Europe for decades, serving as the ultimate assurance and guarantee against a Russian invasion. This easy ride on security assurances for Europe made it easier for it to focus deeper on its economic and trade needs, and pivoting to Africa and Asia. However, even this is ineffective, with its Global Gateway strategy and the Indo Pacific push all failing to pull Europe out of its stagnation,even in post Brexit recovery. With Trump now reversing decades of free ride, European security suddenly looks in shambles, even without the Ukraine pretext in the first place. This new reality jolted Europe into a new scramble for defence reorientation. EU countries are trying to mobilize trillions of euros for additional defense for this purpose. Germany's chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz announced that the government would amend the constitution to exempt defense and security outlays from fiscal limits, paving the way for a massive increase in defence spending and support, pledging to do 'whatever it takes' to defend the country, including planning a €500 billion infrastructure fund to invest in priorities such as transportation, energy grids and housing over 10 years. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed raising hundreds of billions more to restore Europe's defense capacity. Despite the new historic move by Germany to shake up its defence needs and industry and in taking leadership of Europe's security since its postwar history, it still lacks the capability to unite and project capable European collective security in the way Washington has done. As Trump repeatedly pointed out Europe's own perplexing irony, the EU spent $23 billion on Russian oil and gas in the third year of the war on Ukraine, more than the $19.6 billion in financial aid it offered to the war torn country, resulting in the Kremlin making close to $1 trillion from oil exports since February 2022. Europe has long accustomed itself to the perceived status quo model of democracy and governance that has seen it being mired in its traditional approach to addressing and perceiving threats. Vance argued that a lack of Trump-style 'democracy' in Europe was a bigger security threat to the continent than China or Russia. This Trump approach to reorient the European and Russian policies and models have invited various perceptions and arguments. Some have seen this move as a strategic model to split Russia from China and to get Europe to take care of itself, paving the way for the US to fully focus on the rivalry with Beijing. The argument behind this is that while the West remains fairly important in maintaining the rules based order and democracy, Trump sees the more important need for America to sustain and to be strong again, as only the US has the capacity to stand up to any global threats. His aim is to Make America Great Again, and not Make the West Great Again, where a win for the US is more pervasive and important for the entire Western world. Others have called for Europe to build its own credible nuclear deterrent, with France being called to extend its nuclear protection to Germany and to the rest of Europe. With Germany being the largest and economically most powerful country in Europe, others have called for Berlin to pay the lion's share for this new nuclear umbrella, where with its low debt burden, Berlin would be able to mobilise money. This remains a far-fetched ambition. Although capital and resources might be pooled, the end result in a realistic on-the-ground deterrent remains sketchy and inadequate. Europe's vulnerability to energy security and reliance on external energy sources remain the main sticking points. It remains hard for Europe to ward off this dependency, let alone defend the shipping lanes and pipelines for its energy imports. The calls for Europe to enhance its domestic energy production through the woke and liberal approach of renewable energy sources continue to be a bad strategic mistake, where after the initial bandwagon of reducing fossil fuel energy reliance, most European nations switched back to conventional sources. Germany realised that shutting down its nuclear power plants and pushing clumsy and lousy climate policies that have alienated large parts of the population remained a huge mistake for the wrong scramble to join the madness of the green liberal agenda. While Europe is busy aligning with the green and woke agenda, China and Russia continue to surge ahead with their own relentless strategic pursuits of military advancements without the limitations of green models and policies, powering through their energy, economic and military transformations with common sense utilisations of their strength. Trump wanted the same common sense approach in regaining America's long subdues and hidden strength that has been curtailed by the liberal Democrats that has weakened the country's economic, energy and military potential, further being strangled by both allies and enemies alike in trade and economy and global moral obligations without any returns. Europe's spending to support Ukraine is equally underwhelming. Since January 2022 the EU and its member states have spent €113bn in financial, military and humanitarian help, the equivalent of just above 0.2% of their GDP during each of those three years, according to data from the think tank, Kiel Institute. Europe's imports of weapons made by the United States have skyrocketed in the past five years, raising serious questions about whether the continent can achieve its vaunted goal of defence autonomy. New research released on Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a leading defence and armaments think tank, shows Europe increased its imports of weapons two-and-a-half times over in the past five years compared with the previous five years. Most European Union members did not begin boosting their domestic weapons production until last year. Zelensky went to solicit European support after the Trump standoff, hoping to use the fear of Russia to get the needed European military and funding injection and explain how Ukraine will supposedly serve as the buffer for European security. The new wave of arms race and armament has changed the orientation of the region, but Europe still needs Washington support. Zelensky has claimed that around 40% of his country's battlefield needs are being met through domestic production, often in joint ventures with Western defence firms, but remains sitting ducks without American support especially in nuclear and high technology missiles. The question is, how far will Europe go to spend and defend Ukraine if it does not create the deterrent effect against Russia? It is the fear of the domino effect that has propelled Europe to be jolted out of its slumber, where it has for years been taking advantage of Washington in doing the heavy lifting. If Ukraine does not serve as the buffer and as the frontier in stopping Putin's intent, Europe will have little incentive to commit as much as Washington did. The US and Trump still hold the upper card in dealing with both Europe and Russia, and deservingly so, for the peace of the regions and the world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj5ksEsZ2uwv0	2025-03-16T17:24:05-07:00	
African Air Chiefs Focus On Disaster Response	Across the continent, Air Forces are striving to achieve air supremacy, neutralize threats and gather intelligence. They also play a pivotal role in humanitarian and disaster relief efforts. That occasionally overlooked role was the focus of the recent African Air Chiefs Symposium, where more than 240 participants from 38 nations gathered in Lusaka, Zambia, from February 17-21. Citing the ebb and flow of drought and floods in his country, Zambia Air Force Commander Lt. Gen. Oscar Nyoni underscored the importance of bringing together air chiefs from across the continent. 'Air Forces across Africa possess a unique capability to do more than just safeguard our skies,' he said during an online media briefing on February 19. 'With diverse air assets and skilled personnel, we have the potential to provide vital support to nations in distress. 'These things come unannounced, and they can affect anybody at any time. So it is very gratifying that we are hosting this symposium at a time that we have seen the effects of drought, and we know exactly what it means to seek support from other willing nations.' The annual symposium is the keystone event for the Association of African Air Forces (AAAF), which Nyoni chairs. The organization focuses on collaboration in finding African-led air power solutions among its 29 member nations and the United States Air Force. U.S. Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa Commander Gen. James Hecker highlighted the growing role of the association, which has expanded significantly since its creation in 2015. 'From just four countries to 29 member nations, the expansion of the Association of African Air Forces reflects Africa’s increasing capacity to address its challenges collectively,' he said during the online media briefing. While the weeklong event featured workshops, community engagement activities and cultural exchanges, its centerpiece was a tabletop exercise, which sought to improve coordination and readiness for humanitarian assistance and disaster response missions with an emphasis on air mobility and resource-sharing. A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based session where team members meet in an informal setting to discuss their roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular simulated situation. Hecker underscored the importance of planning, noting that critical logistical questions, such as fuel costs, supply arrangements and diplomatic clearances for overflights, must be addressed in advance rather than during a crisis. 'What we’re doing here is the beginning of this tabletop exercise,' Hecker said. 'The culmination will be a live-flight lifeline exercise that will occur in Kenya in November of 2026.' The live-flight exercise aims to enhance coordination, response time and logistical efficiency in disaster-relief scenarios. Since its establishment in 2011, a different member nation of the association has hosted the symposium each year. Nigeria will host in 2026. With the AAAF anthem playing during the closing ceremony, Nyoni passed the association flag to Air Marshal Hassan Bala Abubakar, the Nigerian Air Force chief of staff and the next chairman of the organization. The association chose both the new flag and the new anthem during the session. 'Together we can achieve greatness as one unified continent,' Abubakar said. 'This symposium is more than just a meeting of minds. It is a demonstration of our commitment towards a safe, more secure and prosperous Africa. Our collaboration is a powerful reminder of the importance of finding African solutions to African problems.' Nyoni reflected Zambia’s pride in hosting the symposium, noting that the event is a significant step toward deeper collaboration among African Air Forces. 'The enthusiasm and the contributions that have been brought on board by the chiefs from all over Africa — that’s Southern Africa, East Africa, West Africa, and the North — has been fantastic,' he said. 'And seeing the contributions from them and their desire to contribute towards solving African problems is highly appreciated. And for us in Zambia, being at the center of it, it’s something that I think is very, very encouraging and inspiring.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj1TGikwny1Fi	2025-03-16T17:20:49-07:00	
The US And EU Drumbeat For Central Asia’s Critical Minerals Grows...	(Eurasianet) -- It is not just the Trump administration that is into hard rocks. The European Union is also a big fan of Central Asian metal. In their dealings with Central Asian governments, US and EU officials seem fixated on expanding access to the region’s abundance of 'critical minerals.' Over the past few days, top Trump administration officials have courted Kazakhstan. Energy Secretary Chris Wright raised the topic of rare earths during a March 13 meeting with his Kazakh counterpart, Almassadam Satkaliyev, on the sidelines of an energy conference in Houston. A day earlier, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement following talks with Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister-Foreign Minister Murat Nurtleu stating that the United States 'looks forward to working with Kazakhstan to deepen economic ties in the energy, telecommunications, and critical minerals sectors.' The growing American interest in critical minerals is matched by the European Union. European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jozef Sikelak, who began a six-day tour of the five Central States on March 12, is also scouting out potential investments in the mining sector. An EU statement noted that critical minerals is one of the four main topics for discussion with Central Asian leaders during Sikelak’s visit, with the EU aiming to promote 'best practices, new jobs and economic resilience.' The other chief aims of the tour are to improve infrastructure in transport, digital connectivity and water, energy & the climate sectors, enabling an expansion of trade between Central Asia and the EU. During a stop in Uzbekistan, Sikelak is scheduled to tour the Almalyk Mining and Metallurgical Complex. Uzbekistan earlier in March announced a $2.6 billion initiative to develop its mineral and mining sector creating a prime opportunity for US and European investment. During his recent visit to France, Uzbek leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev signed a $5 million mineral deal, the state-aligned Gazeta.uz outlet reported March 13. As part of the agreement, France’s Geological Service will 'provide its experience and knowledge for the development of the national geological service in Uzbekistan,' the Gazeta.uz report said. Another project involves 'geological and technical studies of critical minerals.' A lack of supply of rare earths needed to power many of the gadgets deemed indispensable in the 21st century is prompting the US and EU to look to Central Asia as a supply source. 'A combination of factors makes Central Asia – particularly resource-endowed Kazakhstan but also Uzbekistan and Tajikistan – the most viable alternative to traditional suppliers [especially China],' according to an analysis published in late 2024 by the Australia-based Lowy Institute. But the United States and EU must play catch-up to gain a significant share in the region’s mining and minerals sector. China long ago established itself as the region’s dominant player. 'China’s own growing internal demand for critical minerals – primarily associated with the rapidly increasing production of microchips and green energy – makes its strategic interest in this sector of Central Asian economies particularly strong,' the Lowy Institute analysis stated. 'In effect, Beijing has already taken the lead, especially in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, where it controls almost all the leases of rare-earth mining.' While few opportunities may exist with current mining operations, the US and EU have an opportunity to capture a major share of future projects. 'Central Asian leaders understand that without foreign (financial) capital, know-how and technologies, capitalization on local resource potential is not realistic,' said the Lowy Institute analysis. 'They have also realized that collaborative actions will better enable them to excel in producing [critical minerals], thus securing their place in the global supply chain.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj6Vo9CVLvkA5	2025-03-16T17:14:26-07:00	
The Dangers Of Trump’s Expansionist Foreign Policy: Global Instab...	In recent years, the emergence of aggressive unilateral policies has raised significant concerns within the global community. The foreign policy maneuvers of former President Trump—such as proposals to invade Greenland and Mexico as well as the suggestion to annex Canada as the 51st state—constitute a direct threat to international stability and the established global order. These reckless initiatives undermine international alliances and multilateral cooperation, thereby risking severe diplomatic and economic security repercussions. This essay examines the challenges posed by these policies, analyzes their potential consequences, and underscores the necessity for a more strategic and cooperative approach in 2025. The Importance of International Alliances A cornerstone of contemporary global governance is the network of international alliances that sustain order and maintain a balance of power. Partnerships with NATO, Canada, Mexico, and other traditional allies are essential for security. In 2025, data from the American Institute for Global Policy revealed that 72% of foreign diplomats believe that unpredictable U. S. foreign policies significantly jeopardize global stability. By diverging from established diplomatic protocols, unilateral actions such as invasions proposed and annexations threaten these relationships. In the absence of trust and cooperation, the efficacy of global security initiatives diminishes efforts, complicating the address threats transnational such as terrorism cyberattacks and organized crime. Unilateral Aggression and the Consequences of Expansionism The proposals to invade and Greenland along Mexico with the audacious plan to annex Canada exemplify a broader trend towards unilateral aggression. Historically, international law and norms have condemned acts of expansionism and violations of national sovereignty. In 2025 expert in international relations cautioned that any military intervention conducted without multilateral consent could establish a perilous precedent. • Invasion of Greenland: This would challenge the territorial integrity of a sovereign nation and risk exacerbating tensions in the Arctic, a region already strained by climate change and competing economic interests. • Annexation of Canada: This proposal is both politically and logistically implausible and would elicit widespread backlash from the global community. Canada, a close economic and security ally, would likely pursue alternative partnerships, thereby weakening U. S. influence in North America. • Invasion of Mexico: While cartel violence is a legitimate concern, a unilateral invasion would likely escalate violence and further destabilize the region. Intervention without Mexico’s consent could provoke a humanitarian crisis and undermine standing agreements. Diplomatic Fallout: Downgrades and Severed Ties One immediate consequence of these aggressive policies is the potential for diplomatic downgrades or the complete severing of relationships with key allies. In 2025, reports preliminary indicate that longstanding several diplomatic partners are reevaluating their ties the with United States. • Canada and Mexico: In response to expansionist rhetoric from certain targets, these nations are seeking alternative alliances with global powers, including the European Union and China. • NATO and UN Relations: By disregarding international agreements, the United States risks alienating its NATO allies and undermining its standing within the United Nations. • Economic Consequences: Should allies or downgrade sever ties the United States could encounter economic trade sanctions restrictions and foreign reduced ultimately investment domestic harming industries and employment. The Need for Transparency and Congressional Oversight Foreign policy careful necessitates deliberation and transparency. However, the ambiguity surrounding these aggressive proposals has engendered widespread uncertainty both domestically and internationally. In 2025, lawmakers expressed many concerns regarding the absence of clear strategic objectives. They argue unchecked that executive power in foreign policy could lead to detrimental decisions to international relations and destabilizing for domestic governance. • Strengthening Congressional Oversight: Congress must exercise its authority to obstruct reckless military actions and ensure that foreign policy decisions are aligned with democratic principles and national interests. • Avoiding Policy Flip-Flops: Rapid shifts in foreign policy create instability. A coherent long-term strategy is essential to maintain U.S. credibility on the global stage. Multilateral Diplomacy as a Countermeasure In 2025, diplomatic engagement with international organizations such as the United Nations and the Organization of American States is crucial. These institutions provide a platform for peaceful conflict resolution and uphold global norms. By embracing multilateral diplomacy, the United States can: • Rebuild trust with Allies: A commitment to international cooperation strengthens diplomatic relationships. • Resources Pool for Global Security: Coordinated efforts in sharing intelligence and military joint training can effectively address security threats without unilateral intervention. • Enhance Conflict Resolution Mechanisms: Diplomatic channels should be prioritized over military action to address cross-border issues such as drug trafficking and organized crime. Investing in Soft Power Initiatives Soft power—the capacity to influence through culture diplomacy and economic incentives—serves as a crucial alternative to military intervention. In 2025, the United. State Department reported that several allied nations had augmented support for cultural exchange programs and international aid to aggressive counter foreign policies. Cultural Diplomacy: Strengthening academic and cultural programs exchange can foster goodwill between nations. Economic Aid and Development: Providing economic support to struggling regions can address the root causes of instability rather than resorting to military intervention. Public Diplomacy Campaigns: Utilizing media technology to promote U.S values and interests can enhance global perceptions of America’s role in international affairs. Challenges In Reversing Aggressive Policies Despite the benefits of diplomacy and soft power, significant challenges persist in transitioning away from an aggressive foreign policy approach. • Domestic Political Polarization: The influence of nationalist and isolationist factions within the United States complicates the pursuit of a cooperative foreign policy. • Economic and Political Costs: Reversing course may provoke economic sanctions, trade barriers, and diplomatic backlash. • Rebuilding Credibility: Restoring trust among global allies requires time, particularly following years of unpredictable policy decisions. Conclusion: The Need for a Coherent Foreign Policy Strategy President Trump's aggressive foreign policy proposals, including plans to invade Greenland and Mexico and to annex Canada, pose a significant threat to international stability. As 2025 unfolds, trends observed in global relations underscore the urgent need for a recalibrated U.S strategy that prioritizes multilateral cooperation and legislative oversight. By strengthening international alliances, unilaterally rejecting aggression, and investing in soft power initiatives, the United States can avert the pitfalls of diplomatic isolation and economic fallout. Ultimately, a well-defined foreign policy that respects international law and embraces cooperative problem-solving is essential for safeguarding national interests and promoting long-term prosperity in an increasingly interconnected world.

North Macedonia Nightclub Fire Leaves Dozens Dead	By Sinisa Jakov Marusic At least 59 people have died and 155 have been hospitalised after a fire broke out inside a nightclub in the small eastern town of Kocani in the early hours of Sunday morning, Interior Minister Pance Toskovski told reporters. Toskovski said the use of pyrotechnics for visual effects during a live concert at the club was the likely cause. 'At the moment when the [pyrotechnic] fountains were activated, the sparks most likely hit the ceiling, which is made of flammable material, and in a short time the fire spread throughout the entire discotheque and thick smoke was generated,' he said. Video footage of the fire inside the nightclub published on Sunday morning, showing the ceiling on fire, seemed to corroborate the minister’s account. Earlier, Toskovski said that as part of the investigation into the cause of the fire, the police have already apprehended suspects. Radio Kocani, which was first to break the news, said the fire at the overcrowded Pulse nightclub broke out around 3am. The blaze started during a performance by a well-known North Macedonia hip-hop band called DNK (DNA in English). At least one of the band’s members, musician Vladimir Blazevski, known as Panco, was hospitalised, his sister Jadranka Nikolovksa told the local Sakam da Kazam news website. 'I know for now that his life is not in danger. He has burns on his face and hand and is on oxygen support,' Nikolovska was quoted as saying. In the wake of what is one of the biggest tragedies in the recent history of the country, North Macedonia’s Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski has cancelled a trip to Montenegro where he was supposed to attend a European People’s Party summit. Mickoski headed for Kocani instead. North Macedonia’s President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova went to visit one of the hospitals in Skopje where some of the injured have been taken. 'I cannot comprehend how it was possible that this happened,' Siljanovska-Davkova told reporters there. Justice Minister Igor Filkov told a press conference that those responsible must be held accountable. 'This is not just a tragedy. This is an alarm that calls for accountability! There are no words for this pain… but there has to be justice! Something like this must never happen again,' Filkov said. The European Union’s enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, sent condolences. 'Deeply saddened by the tragic fire in Kocani, North Macedonia, which claimed lives of too many young people,' Kos wrote on X. The town of Kocani is located some 100 kilometres east of the capital, Skopje, and has a population of around 25,000 people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj3ax1fFwdiL_	2025-03-16T17:09:24-07:00	
Why Egypt Refuses To Administer Gaza – OpEd	By Dr. Abdellatif El-Menawy Egypt has firmly rejected the proposal made last month by Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid that suggested Egypt take over the administration of the Gaza Strip for up to 15 years in exchange for the cancellation of its external debt. The Egyptian response was clear and decisive, with the Foreign Ministry stating that such proposals are an 'attempt to circumvent Egypt’s and the Arab world’s firm stance,' emphasizing the need for Israel to withdraw from occupied Palestinian territories and for an independent Palestinian state to be established. This rejection is not just a passing political stance but a continuation of Egypt’s long-standing position on the Palestinian issue. Egypt has consistently opposed any proposals that reinforce the occupation or undermine the Palestinian cause. Previously, it also refused to participate in international forces within Gaza, further demonstrating its firm stance against assuming security or administrative responsibilities in the enclave. The idea of Egypt managing Gaza is not new, as Egypt governed the territory between 1948 and 1967. Initially, Gaza was under the administration of the All-Palestine Government, which was supported by Cairo but lacked effective international recognition. As a result, Egypt later placed Gaza under direct military rule without formally annexing it. During this period, Gaza faced severe economic and humanitarian challenges, worsened by the influx of more than 200,000 Palestinian refugees after the Nakba in 1948. Egypt never had a long-term political plan for governing Gaza; rather, it saw its administration as a temporary responsibility until a comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue was found. Egyptian rule in Gaza ended after the 1967 war, when Israel occupied the enclave along with the West Bank and Sinai. Since then, Egypt has not played a direct role in Gaza’s administration but has remained a key player in security matters and political mediation. Egypt’s rejection of Lapid’s proposal is rooted in multiple concerns, with national security being the most critical. Cairo fears that assuming control of Gaza would create a significant security burden, particularly given the complex internal dynamics of the enclave and the presence of armed factions outside the control of the Palestinian Authority. If Egypt were to take administrative responsibility, it might find itself in direct confrontation with resistance groups, leading to unwanted conflicts that could destabilize Egypt’s internal security. Additionally, Egypt is wary of Gaza becoming an unstable zone that extremist groups could exploit as a base for attacks on northern Sinai. To avoid such scenarios, Cairo is keen to prevent any situation that would entangle it in a complex security challenge on its eastern border. Egypt also rejects any role that would make it act as a security enforcer for Israel. From Cairo’s perspective, Lapid’s proposal is an attempt to shift responsibility for Gaza onto Egypt, allowing Israel to evade its obligations. Instead of shouldering the costs of reconstruction after the devastation caused by Israeli military operations, Tel Aviv appears to be seeking to offload the burden onto Egypt. This aligns with Egypt’s policy of refusing to serve as an instrument for implementing Israeli strategies that do not contribute to a comprehensive resolution of the Palestinian issue. Cairo understands that any direct involvement in Gaza’s administration could be perceived as serving Israeli interests at the expense of Palestinian rights. Egypt is also deeply concerned that taking over Gaza’s administration could serve as the first step in a larger plan to permanently separate the enclave from the West Bank, effectively dismantling the Palestinian cause. If Gaza is removed from the broader Palestinian equation, it could pave the way for initiatives aimed at resettling Palestinians outside the West Bank — an idea that Egypt has consistently opposed. There is also a strong fear that accepting control over Gaza could lead to a broader plan of relocating Palestinians from the enclave into the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt firmly rejects such a scenario, as it would not only undermine its national sovereignty but also pose a serious threat to its stability. Another key factor in Egypt’s rejection of the proposal is the belief that its economic challenges do not justify compromising its national policies. Despite the economic incentives included in Lapid’s proposal, particularly the offer to cancel Egypt’s debts, Cairo has made it clear that it will not trade its strategic positions for financial relief. Egyptian officials have repeatedly emphasized that, despite the country’s economic difficulties, accepting such an offer could lead to political and security repercussions that far outweigh any temporary economic benefits. Lapid’s proposal was not the first attempt to persuade Egypt to take on Gaza’s administration. In 2023, the US made a similar suggestion of Egypt temporarily overseeing Gaza’s security, but Cairo rejected that as well. Then-CIA Director William Burns discussed the idea with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who firmly declined the proposal. Moreover, Egypt has refused to participate in any international forces inside Gaza, believing that such involvement would make it a direct party to a prolonged conflict, leading to unpredictable consequences. Egypt has not merely rejected the idea of governing Gaza but has also proposed alternative solutions that focus on Palestinian self-governance. One such solution is reinstating the PA’s control over Gaza as a step toward Palestinian unity and an end to internal divisions. Additionally, Cairo has suggested forming a nonpartisan Palestinian government to oversee both the West Bank and Gaza — a proposal that Israel has opposed. Egypt has also offered to provide limited security and logistical support, such as border monitoring and training Palestinian security personnel, while firmly refusing any direct administrative role. Egypt’s position on Gaza is clear and strategic: it refuses any direct administrative role within the enclave and opposes any plans that could undermine the Palestinian cause. This stance is evident in its repeated rejection of Israeli and American proposals, despite political pressure and economic incentives. From Cairo’s perspective, the solution to Gaza’s crisis does not lie in Egyptian administration but in a comprehensive settlement that includes ending Israel’s occupation, restoring PA control over Gaza and ensuring the Palestinian people’s right to establish an independent state. Egypt remains committed to its role as a mediator, but it refuses to become a direct party to a crisis that it believes should not be its responsibility.

Czech Minister Urges EU Response In Wake Of Trump Cuts To Radio F...	By Aneta Zachová and Charles Szumski (EurActiv) -- Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský said he plans to raise the issue of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) at Monday’s gathering of foreign ministers from across the European Union in Brussels, following moves by US President Donald Trump to yank funding from several media outlets over the weekend. Lipavský argued on Czech TV on Sunday that Europe should launch a broader political discussion given what the broadcaster means for the continent, although he wasn't sure exactly what steps the EU could take. In a post on X, Lipavský wrote that he wanted to explore 'how to at least partially maintain' RFE/RL's broadcasting operations. The Czech minister's comment comes after the Trump administration placed journalists at several US-funded broadcasters – including RFE/RL and Voice of America – on leave on Saturday after it froze their funding. The White House framed it as part of an effort to reduce US federal bureaucracy and a purge of 'radical propaganda'. But in Prague, where RFE/RL has its headquarters, the reaction has been one of alarm. The media outlet played an important historical role in opposing communist rule in Czechoslovakia, and across the Eastern Bloc, before 1989. It is in Europe's interest that such broadcasting continues, Lipavský said, adding that RFE/RL provides crucial support to democratic forces in Eastern European and Asian countries. He also called RFE/RL a 'beacon' for those under totalitarian rule. 'From Belarus to Iran, from Russia to Afghanistan, RFE and Voice of America are among the few free sources for people living without freedom,' he said on X. He also suggested that those outlets are important for countering Kremlin narratives. 'This is a gift to America’s enemies,' warned RFE/RL President Stephen Capus in an articlepublished on Saturday, a sentiment echoed by the international press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders, which condemned the move as a betrayal of America’s historic commitment to press freedom. However, Trump’s allies, including senior US Agency for Global Media adviser Kari Lake, defend the cuts, arguing the agency is a 'giant rot' wasting taxpayer dollars. Lake claimed that projected savings could hit $700 million by 2026. Elon Musk, a key administration figure, cheered the decision on the X social media platform, which he owns. Musk dismissed the US government-backed outlets as 'radical left crazy people talking to themselves'. Centre-right Czech MEP Danuše Nerudová said she also intends to raise the broadcaster’s future within the European Parliament.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj_FjyohAmdc3	2025-03-16T17:03:31-07:00	
Serbia’s Vucic Says Government Gets ‘The Message’ After Biggest P...	(RFE/RL) -- President Aleksandar Vucic acknowledged the 'enormous negative energy and anger' directed at authorities as the Serbian capital witnessed its biggest public protest in decades. With public ire fueled by allegations that official corruption played a role in a deadly train station accident in November, Vucic tried to position himself as responsive to public demands. 'We will have to change ourselves,' Vucic told a news conference late on March 15. 'All people in the government have to understand the message when this many people gather. We will have to change ourselves,' he said. Authorities had estimated the crowd size at between 88,000 and 107,000. However, the Archive of Public Gatherings, an informal organization, put the number of people participating at between 275,000 and 325,000. The outpouring of crowds was one of the largest Serbia has witnessed in decades. Protesters skirmished with riot police at several locations in Belgrade, throwing fireworks and bottles. Minor incidents were reported around 7 p.m. near Pioneer Park, where students had set up a camp, after which participants announced an end to the protest for the night. A group of people later continued to light torches at the Serbian parliament building as police stood nearby. Most protesters left the area by 11 p.m. The demonstration was the largest in a wave of student-led protests demanding Vucic's government be held accountable for a deadly cement canopy collapse at a railway station in November. Vucic also insisted the majority of citizens do not want a 'color revolution.' That's a term referring to public uprisings in places like Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan that have led to the ouster of governments. The popular protests that paved the way for the ouster of Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 are also sometimes classified as a 'color revolution' as well. Earlier in the day on March 15, flag-waving demonstrators gathered at several locations and converged outside the parliament, in what appeared to be one of the country's biggest protests in decades. 'Look how many of us there are,' one student told protesters. 'Let your voice wake up Serbia.' Participants had streamed into the capital from across the country on foot, bicycles, and motorcycles ahead of the demonstration. Supporters and fellow protesters, including students from Belgrade, laid out a red carpet and cheered as people entered the city center. Vucic also said 56 people were injured during the protest but none with life-threatening injuries. He said 22 protesters had been arrested for crimes against property and for assaulting police officers and other people. The number could not immediately be confirmed. The November 1 collapse of the cement canopy at the railway station in the northern town of Novi Sad has led to what may be the biggest challenge yet to Vucic's political power. Fifteen people were killed in that incident. Student protests over the accident have evolved into a broader movement opposing what demonstrators say is the crumbling rule of law and systemic corruption under Vucic, the president since 2017 and prime minister for three years before that. Student protesters have been demonstrating and blocking their university departments for over three months. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets to demonstrate in over 200 cities and towns. Ljiljana Kovacevic, a teacher from the northern town of Vrbas, told RFE/RL that she came to Belgrade to support the students, her former pupils. 'We hope everything will go smoothly and the students will achieve their goals -- along with us,' she said. The parliament speaker announced a day before the protest that the parliament building would remain closed until March 17 for security reasons. Government officials accused the protest organizers of planning violence and announced arrests. Students denied the authorities' claims and called for a peaceful gathering.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj4gSnOpXlRK5	2025-03-16T16:59:59-07:00	
The End Of Transatlanticism – OpEd	There is growing evidence that the United States' relationship with Europe will never be the same under Donald Trump presidency. In light of two key developments, it seems that the American Century in Europe has truly come to an end. First, there was the 90-minute phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on February 12, during which the two leaders agreed to immediately begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine—without the presence of Ukraine or Europe. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made his first foreign trip to Brussels to remind European allies that from now on, the responsibility for Europe's defense lies with European nations, not the United States. Hegseth’s bluntness in front of European counterparts—who are used to more diplomatic language—was truly shocking. He reiterated Trump's demand that NATO members allocate at least 5% of their GDP to defense spending, despite knowing that many European countries oppose this. He also made it clear that the top priority of Trump's second administration in foreign policy would be dealing with China and securing America's borders—not Ukraine or Europe. He further warned that the U.S. would no longer tolerate an unbalanced relationship—essentially the current transatlantic system—that encourages dependency. Following Hegseth’s remarks, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated in a recent interview that the United States should not be the primary guarantor of security in Europe but rather a supporting actor in achieving it. He also criticized major European powers, saying: 'When you ask them why they can’t spend more on national security, they respond that doing so would require cuts to welfare programs, unemployment benefits, and early retirement at age 59. That’s the choice they have made, but we are subsidizing it.' This unconventional and deconstructive stance on transatlantic relations stems from the fact that both American presidents and their European counterparts have failed to adapt transatlantic relations to the realities of the 21st century. As a result, the transatlantic alliance now finds itself extremely vulnerable to a U.S. president who, more than any other, has pursued policies in a nationalist and deal-oriented manner. Trump’s treatment of European allies reflects his disregard for the central pillar of U.S. grand strategy since World War II—trans-Atlanticism. Trump’s agenda is not about European security. He believes the United States should no longer bear the cost of securing Europe. Without a doubt, the first major test of this new reality in U.S.-Europe relations will be Ukraine. Peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine began immediately after Trump's direct call with Putin. However, these talks are currently taking place in Saudi Arabia between the U.S. and Russia, with no Ukrainian representatives present. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, European leaders have also been completely excluded from the negotiations. As a result, not only President Zelensky but all of Europe has been sidelined from this U.S.-led deal. The absence of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—who was at the center of U.S. efforts on Ukraine during Biden’s presidency—and his European allies from the talks is an alarming sign for them. It has raised concerns that a 'dirty deal' is being brokered to end the war entirely in Moscow's favor, at the expense of Kyiv and Europe. In response, Zelensky has stated that he will not recognize any agreement in which Ukraine is not included in the negotiations. European leaders, after holding an emergency meeting in Paris, have also insisted that any peace talks must include both Kyiv and European nations. Given the bleak outlook Hegseth painted during his Brussels visit regarding Ukraine’s future, Kyiv and Europe’s reaction seems justified. In reality, he was laying out Washington’s initial stance before entering negotiations: Ukraine cannot return to its pre-2014 borders before the annexation of Crimea, Ukraine cannot join NATO, U.S. forces will play no role in any security force guaranteeing a potential peace deal, and any peacekeeping force that is formed will not fall under NATO’s mutual defense clause—meaning the U.S. will not support peacekeepers in case of conflict. Trump and other U.S. officials argue that they are taking a 'realistic' approach to the Ukraine war and that European leaders must accept this new reality—one shaped by Russia's military power. Despite violating fundamental international laws, this situation, they argue, is irreversible. The truth is that Trump is leveraging Ukraine’s and Europe’s concerns as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from his longtime friend, Putin. However, he must consider that rewarding Russia with a favorable deal could set a dangerous precedent. Under these circumstances, Ukraine’s hopes of reclaiming its lost territories seem increasingly distant. There is a strong possibility that negotiations will lead to an outcome similar to the division of Germany after World War II—one part of Ukraine under Moscow's control, and the other, an independent Ukraine, potentially joining the European Union, much like West Germany once did. But beyond Ukraine's lost lands and aspirations, something else has also vanished: the familiar and long-standing trans-Atlanticism that has defined U.S.-Europe relations for over eight decades.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj0jsVgkX2oon	2025-03-16T16:56:52-07:00	
Trump And The Return to Economic Colonialism: Coercive Diplomacy ...	U.S. President Donald Trump, continuing his strong-arm tactics toward Europe and making territorial claims over the continent, has now set his sights on economically subjugating an independent European country. His demands for a share of Ukraine’s natural resources, along with his close ally Elon Musk’s use of coercive diplomacy and blackmail, signal that Trump's America is willing to sacrifice any principle and revive old patterns of exploitation to maintain its dominance in what is now a new era of great power competition. As the war in Ukraine rages on, leaving the country heavily reliant on military and financial aid from its Western allies—especially the U.S.—Washington has reportedly proposed an agreement to Kyiv that resembles extortion. The Trump administration has demanded that Ukraine hand over half of its revenue from natural resources, including oil, gas, minerals, and port infrastructure, in exchange for continued support. Moreover, the U.S. wants a 66% stake in resources from territories currently under Russian occupation if they are liberated. Meanwhile, Trump refuses to offer any concrete security guarantees to Ukraine or bolster its conventional deterrence against Russia. The pressure doesn’t come from Trump alone. Elon Musk, a close ally, has reportedly threatened to cut off Ukraine’s access to Starlink services if Kyiv refuses to comply with the deal. This would cripple Ukraine’s critical military communications and disrupt essential civilian services, including businesses, hospitals, and humanitarian aid, putting the country under even greater strain. Ukraine’s natural resources hold immense strategic value. The country possesses vast mineral reserves vital for advanced technologies, including electric vehicles and wind turbines, and are critical to national security for major powers. For example, Ukraine has some of the world’s largest deposits of graphite and lithium, essential for lithium-ion batteries, electronics, and stealth fighter jets. Additionally, rare earth elements and strategic metals like neodymium and gallium—crucial for defense industries and green energy—are abundant in Ukraine. With China dominating global supply chains for these materials, Western nations view Ukraine’s reserves as essential to countering Beijing’s economic influence. Trump’s worldview revolves around great power competition, where the U.S. must use any means necessary to maintain its global dominance. In this perspective, sanctions, threats, extortion, military intervention, and even colonial-style resource exploitation are all seen as legitimate tools for securing America’s superiority. His interest in Ukraine’s mineral and energy wealth aligns with this broader strategy, particularly in countering China. Similarly, his previous interest in acquiring Greenland can be understood in this context, as its strategic location and resources would bolster U.S. power against both China and Russia. The world is experiencing a resurgence of great power rivalry and neo-colonialism, but with one crucial difference: Europe is no longer a dominant force or a colonial power—it is now a target. Historically, Europe played a central role in shaping global policies and resource distribution. However, it is now caught in the crossfire of ruthless geopolitical competition from the U.S., China, and other rising powers. As America pursues aggressive bargaining, sanctions, and military threats to strengthen its position, Europe finds itself no longer leading the game but struggling to navigate its growing vulnerabilities in an increasingly brutal global contest.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj1Y9CNcoXfpQ	2025-03-16T16:52:25-07:00	
Trump’s Second Presidency: The Fall Or Reconstruction Of American...	Donald Trump's second presidency has not only introduced new challenges to U.S. domestic policies but has also posed serious threats to democratic institutions and the U.S. Constitution. These threats have the potential to dismantle the very foundations laid by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, which were designed to ensure a balance of power. During Trump's second term, the U.S. has witnessed dramatic developments and even crises in both domestic and foreign policy. While his first presidency was marked by controversial and polarizing policies, his second term has escalated concerns with executive orders that challenge legal and democratic institutions. These orders have not only put the Constitution at risk but have also undermined the fundamental principles of American democracy, which emphasize the separation of powers and checks and balances. The Trump administration has issued multiple executive orders that not only contradict the core principles of the U.S. Constitution but also set a dangerous precedent for the executive branch’s authority. These orders have largely targeted areas such as immigration, human rights, and international agreements. For example, Trump’s immigration policies, particularly restrictions on refugee admissions and migration, have starkly contradicted constitutional provisions that emphasize individual freedoms and human rights. One of the most controversial executive orders was the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, which sparked widespread protests both domestically and internationally. This order not only violated human rights principles and religious freedoms but also directly conflicted with constitutional guarantees regarding equal protection and non-discrimination. Democratic institutions in the U.S., which rely on the balance of power, face significant threats. A key principle of the Constitution is the separation of powers, designed to prevent excessive concentration of authority in any single branch. However, Trump’s reliance on executive orders, especially without consulting Congress or the judiciary, has disrupted this balance and created deep divisions within democratic governance. For example, the Brookings Institution has warned of the potential harm to U.S. democracy under Trump’s leadership. Analysts have expressed concerns about the erosion of the separation of powers and the undermining of constitutional governance due to Trump's authoritarian tendencies. Similarly, the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies has highlighted how Trump’s policies weaken democratic institutions, impact elections, and threaten voting rights. One of the most significant consequences of Trump's presidency has been his influence over the judiciary. Both during his first and second terms, he has aggressively sought to appoint judges to federal courts who align with his ideological and political views. These appointments—often made with minimal oversight—have had lasting impacts on judicial proceedings and legal interpretations. This shift in judicial and executive appointments, particularly within the U.S. Supreme Court, is placing democratic institutions under immense strain and gradually eroding the judiciary's independence. In American society, the crises triggered by Trump’s policies continue to intensify. One of the most pressing issues is the deepening social divisions fueled by his racist, anti-immigrant, and economic policies. Decisions such as withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, reducing public welfare programs, and implementing extreme economic policies have not only widened social disparities but also posed serious threats to national and social security. According to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), Trump has repeatedly clashed with U.S. democratic institutions. He has shown little regard for the judiciary, bureaucratic agencies, or Congress’s ability to check his power. This approach reached its peak when he refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and incited his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. His actions have drawn comparisons to populist leaders in Hungary and Poland who have systematically challenged democratic systems. Ultimately, Trump's executive orders and policies may lead to further constitutional and democratic crises in the future. While he has been successful in pushing many of his orders through in the short term, in the long run, this trend risks undermining the very foundations of American democracy and destabilizing the nation. If Trump continues to govern through executive orders while refusing to cooperate with Congress and the judiciary, American democracy may face even greater instability. Only if he moves toward greater collaboration with various government institutions and allows for proper oversight in decision-making can there be hope for a more stable and democratic future. Trump’s approach to governance—centered on personalizing power and weakening traditional democratic institutions—could ultimately erode the U.S. Constitution. By using executive orders as a tool to bypass legislative processes, he has effectively elevated the executive branch above the other branches of government. This strategy, which deepens the rift between the judiciary and legislative bodies such as Congress and the Senate, will further reduce their ability to function effectively. In such a scenario, the principle of separation of powers—one of the fundamental pillars of the American Constitution—will be sidelined, and the system of checks and balances will give way to authoritarianism. The long-term consequences of this approach include reduced political legitimacy, governance crises, and ultimately, the erosion of civil society. A society once built on participation, public trust, and independent institutions now faces the risk of internal collapse.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj0I_fWHgC03e	2025-03-16T16:50:25-07:00	
US To Expel South Africa Ambassador As Relations Deteriorate	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Friday that South Africa's ambassador to Washington had been declared persona non grata, signaling worsening relations between the two countries. In a post on X, Rubio said South Africa's ambassador to the U.S., Ebrahim Rasool, was 'no longer welcome in our great country.' Ebrahim Rasool is a race-baiting politician who hates America and hates @POTUS [President of the United States].' There has been no immediate response from South Africa's embassy in Washington. Rubio's move came amid tense relations between the U.S. and South Africa. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order suspending aid to South Africa over a controversial land expropriation act that Trump said would lead to the takeover of white-owned farms. Trump also said that South African farmers were welcome to settle in the United States. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in a post on X, defended his government's measure. 'We are guided by the Constitution, which places a responsibility on the state to take measures to redress the effects of past racial discrimination,' he said. 'We have expressed concern about the mischaracterisation of the situation in South Africa and certain of our laws and our foreign policy positions,' Ramaphosa said after Trump signed the executive order in early February.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj0-bWcJSA7qf	2025-03-16T16:48:14-07:00	
Africa’s Unique Gut Microbiome Could Guide New Medicines	More than 40,000 previously unknown gut microbes in African populations could completely change how medicines work for millions of people, according to scientists. Research led by the Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience (SBIMB) at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, addressed the gap in microbiome studies, which have largely overlooked African populations. 'The long-term goal is to be able to translate a lot of this into real life,' explains Ovokeraye Oduaran, one of the researchers. 'We want to make sure that when medicines are made, as many people as possible are counted.' Why this matters For years, most medicines have been developed based on research from high-income countries. But the gut bacteria – the tiny organisms living in the digestive systems – help process these medicines, and African populations have completely different gut bacteria to people in Europe or America. This means many drugs might not work the same way for African patients. The researchers say their findings, published in the journal Nature could help create better treatments specifically designed for African populations.'These findings represent a watershed moment for the African human microbiome by highlighting the scale of novel biodiversity that still exists within African microbiomes.'Jerolen Naidoo, senior researcher in bioengineering and integrative genomics, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research 'That’s how important these studies are and it gives you that power to be able to make that decision,' says Luicer Ingasia Olubayo, a Sydney Brenner Charitable Trust postdoctoral fellow at SBIMB, who also worked on the study. She says doctors might need to prescribe different medication or add probiotics when treating African patients. Surprise discoveries The team from the Sydney Brenner Institute found more than 1,000 new bacteria species and over 40,000 new viruses living in the gut microbiomes of African people. 'We found a lot of novelties,' says Olubayo. 'Certain bacteria that were rare on other continents were plentiful in Africa.' The researchers collected stool samples from about 1,800 women across Kenya, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and South Africa. These samples were analysed using genetic sequencing technology to identify the different microorganisms present. New hope for HIV treatment One of the most exciting discoveries was finding unique gut bacteria patterns in people with HIV, say the researchers. 'Had we not done this study, we would not have found this unique microbial signature linked to HIV infection,' says Olubayo, explaining that the bacteria patterns they found were completely different from those seen in HIV patients in wealthier countries. This discovery could lead to better ways to detect, monitor, and treat HIV in African populations. The study was the largest ever to investigate the microbiomes of women living with HIV and understanding this disease requires regional-specific research. City vs. rural life The researchers found that people living in rural areas had richer, more diverse gut bacteria than city dwellers. They also found that urban participants often lacked a bacteria called Treponema, probably because they eat less fibre and use more antibiotics. Charissa Naidoo, co-director of the African Microbiome Institute, warns that beneficial gut bacteria are disappearing as more Africans adopt urban lifestyles and use more antibiotics. 'Urgent action, such as through nutritional intervention, is needed to preserve gut microbiome diversity in the era of antibiotic overuse,' she cautions. This loss of diversity could have long-term health consequences, potentially contributing to increases in allergies, autoimmune disorders, and metabolic diseases like diabetes. However, the story isn’t as simple as 'rural versus urban'. The team found that gut bacteria varied significantly even between different cities like those in Kenya versus South Africa. 'We questioned the rural-urban dichotomy that is usually used by other researchers,' explains Olubayo. 'Instead, there was fluidity and transition between these populations.' This suggests that local diets, environmental factors, and cultural practices all play important roles in shaping our gut microbiome. Filling in the blank spots In 2007, the US National Institutes of Health launched a major global project called the Human Microbiome Project, to improve understanding of the microbiota involved in human health and disease. However, most studies in this area have largely focused on high-income populations, with low- and middle-income countries severely underrepresented. 'If you look at the map of the world and plot how many population-based studies have been done, Africa is ending up to be blank, so we’re happy that we are able to paint the African map as well,' says Olubayo. The researchers say they are expanding their work to study connections between gut bacteria and other health issues like sleep problems, menopause, and brain diseases. Naidoo, of the African Microbiome Institute, suggests future research should also focus on tuberculosis, given its widespread impact in South Africa and neighbouring countries. Jerolen Naidoo, senior researcher in bioengineering and integrative genomics at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, says this work is the first large-scale study of its kind, led by and focusing on Africans. 'These findings represent a watershed moment for the African human microbiome by highlighting the scale of novel biodiversity that still exists within African microbiomes,' he says. More equitable representation of this diversity is needed within global resources and reference databases, he adds.

Iran And Russia Pursue Multipolar World Order – Analysis	On January 17, the leaders of Iran and Russia signed a new comprehensive strategic partnership agreement in Moscow, replacing a previous pact from 2001 that has been renewed several times (Al Jazeera, January 17). Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and deteriorating Russia-West relations have transformed Moscow-Tehran ties. Historically, Russia was cautious about sharing sensitive technology with Iran to avoid Western backlash. Russia’s war against Ukraine, however, has pushed Moscow to further pivot toward Asia, with Iran playing a key role in this realignment. Even if the war against Ukraine ends, Russia’s alignment with Iran is likely to continue. As both states face Western sanctions, Moscow increasingly views Tehran as a vital partner, especially for access to the Indian Ocean and East Africa (see EDM, January 11, 2024). Iran, anticipating maximum pressure from Washington, is also keen to expand military and political cooperation with Russia (The White House, February 4). The official details of the new agreement essentially cover all areas of cooperation, including culture, politics, infrastructure development, and even sanitation (IranGov, January 17). Russia and Iran argue that the two will continue promoting a just and multipolar world. This means cooperation within and expansion of such platforms as BRICS+ and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (see EDM, November 4, 2024). [1] Another area of cooperation is the development of a new payment system to facilitate the reduction of dependence on the U.S. dollar (see EDM, January 11, 2024). There are also intentions to expand the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which runs from Russian ports to Iran and its southern seashore and aims to link Russia with the Middle East, India, and even Africa’s eastern coasts (see EDM, June 7, 2023). Unsurprisingly, military and strategic ties are prevalent throughout the treaty, including strengthening bilateral cooperation. This likely refers to the continued supply of Iranian drones and potentially other technologies such as short-range ballistic missiles to Russia (see EDM, March 6, June 20, 2023, September 18, 2024). The document mentions the South Caucasus and the Caspian Sea, and how Russia and Iran will strive to 'facilitate bolstering of peace and security' in these areas (IranGov, January 17). In both regions, Moscow and Tehran have traditionally shared a specific approach based on the concept of 'regionalism,' which seeks to limit the presence of non-regional actors such as the United States and the European Union. Tehran and Moscow likewise support the 3+3 initiative which includes Russia, Iran, Türkiye, and the three South Caucasus states (despite Georgia so far declining participation due to Russia’s continuous occupation of 20 percent of its territory) (see EDM, March 12). Beyond these points, the treaty also reveals the limits of the Russo-Iranian partnership. Despite expanding cooperation, Moscow and Tehran have not included stipulations on forming a formal alliance, nor pledges on mutual defense in case one of the countries is attacked by a third party. Conversely, for example, the treaty between Russia and North Korea signed in 2024 does have a special mutual defense clause, effectively elevating Moscow-Pyongyang relations to an alliance (Al Jazeera, November 12, 2024). This difference highlights Tehran and Moscow’s need to maintain flexibility in their partnership in such a way that evades formal alliance. Moreover, beyond the lack of a specific mutual defense clause, a series of issues remain contentious and limit the level of cooperation between Moscow and Tehran. Tensions persist, particularly over delays in arms trade as Iran still awaits delivery of Russian Su-35 fighter jets, possibly due to Moscow’s balancing act with Middle Eastern powers such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (Al-Monitor, January 27). Additionally, there are differences over Russia’s support for Azerbaijan’s ambition to establish the so-called Zangezur corridor, which would run from Azerbaijan proper to its exclave of Nakhchivan and to Türkiye, all via Armenia’s southernmost province of Syunik. Russia is eager to restore Soviet transportation routes, increasing its influence in the region (see EDM, January 25, 2021). While Iran’s calculus is simple, the corridor would deprive Armenia of its physical border with the Islamic Republic (Azatutyun, February 6). Iran would face an uncomfortable reality of Russian and especially Turkish influence along its northern border. The differences have often sparked diplomatic spats between Moscow and Tehran and continue to be problematic (see EDM, September 12, 2024). A wider Middle Eastern angle to Russo-Iranian relations is also underway. Iran has often chastised Russia for the latter’s support of the United Arab Emirates’s claim over the islands in the Persian Gulf. These islands are currently under Tehran’s control, but are contested by Abu Dhabi as under occupation by Iran (Iranintl, December 21, 2023; ARN News Center, September 24, 2023). Moreover, Russia is unlikely to support Iran in any direct conflict with Israel, instead limiting military support to avoid jeopardizing its broader regional interests (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, December 30, 2024; Izvestiya, March 6). The treaty serves as a comprehensive framework for the two powers to build closer ties and cooperate in ushering what they often refer to as a just and multipolar world order (see EDM, November 10, 2022, October 21, 2024; Tehran Times, August 11, 2024). Bound by shared opposition to the West, Tehran and Moscow appear to have found a balance between expanding cooperation while maintaining strategic flexibility. In short, their relationship remains transactional, with both sides wary of each other’s long-term ambitions from the South Caucasus to the Middle East. The January agreement ultimately demonstrates the awareness that Moscow and Iran maintain in both evading binding commitments that could restrict their maneuverability while seeking to project a unified position toward multipolarity.

Pakistan Bogged By Growing Ferocity Of Balochistan Insurgency – A...	By Sushant Sareen The insurgency in Balochistan is becoming ominous and has been palpable for a couple of years. But the gravity of the situation in Pakistan's biggest province failed to register in the Byzantine corridors of power in Islamabad. In Pakistan's capital city, the only thing that mattered was controlling and manipulating the state’s institutions to ensure the survival of the hybrid regime controlled by the military junta of General Syed Asim Munir and fronted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The fires in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) received cursory coverage in the media. The public discourse has predominantly revolved around Imran Khan and his trials and tribulations in prison, and the regime’s machinations in countering his narrative, and his popularity. Balochistan was too distant from Islamabad and even Lahore for anyone to bother about what was happening in the restive province. Late last month, after Maulana Fazal-ur Rehman’s speech in the National Assembly where he said that 'five to seven districts in Balochistan were in a position to announce independence' and the 'United Nations (UN) would recognise them the next day,' Pakistani people and beyond started taking notice of the sharply deteriorating security situation in the province. Although Maulana may have gone a bit overboard over the UN recognising a declaration of independence in Balochistan, he has his ears and eyes on the ground in the province and has a very good understanding of how bad things are. Following the Maulana, the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub, said that the Pakistani state had virtually ceased to exist in more than half a dozen districts of Balochistan. According to Ayub, the Pakistani flag was not flying in these districts. Nonetheless, it was not only political leaders opposed to the hybrid regime who were flagging the alarming situation in Balochistan. One of the closest advisors of PM Sharif, Rana Sanaullah, warned that armed groups could descend from the mountains and seize control of Balochistan. After initially trying to deny that things were spiraling out of control in the province, the Chief Minister, Sarfraz Bugti, finally admitted the situation was alarming. However, the insurgents could not hold any area for longer than a few hours. That the insurgents could strike at will and seize control of major highways and small towns for even a few hours was hardly something that any responsible administrator could be sanguine about. If anything, the rising frequency of high-profile, high-impact strikes by the Baloch insurgents has completely undermined the authority of the state. Worse, it has fuelled so much uncertainty that it has put paid to ambitious plans to attract foreign investment in infrastructure and mining projects. It was against this backdrop that the Baloch Raaji Aajoi Sangar (BRAS), an umbrella group of four militant insurgent groups namely Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), Balochistan Republic Guard (BRG) and Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA) announced the formation of a Baloch National Army with a unified command structure and a shift of focus from 'Scattered operations to an organised, coordinated and decisive force'. BRAS declared its intent to intensify the war against both Pakistan and its main patron, China and bring greater lethality in its guerilla operations. To hit Pakistan and China where it hurts, the BRAS decided to ‘intensify the blockade on all important highways of Balochistan to disrupt the logistical, economic, and military interests of the occupying state.’ Within days of the BRAS announcement of ramping up its operations, the guerillas hit the strategic Coastal Highway and set six gas tankers and police vehicles on fire. There was also a sudden uptick in Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and suicide attacks on Pakistani security forces and Baloch collaborators. The sheer expanse of geography where these attacks took place was particularly notable–a suicide attack in Kalat city, an IED blast in Quetta, another IED in Khuzdar against a pro-regime tribal leader, targeted killings of two clerics in Zehri, the same town that was stormed and occupied for a few hours by nearly a 100 insurgents in January last. According to data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal, in just the first nine weeks of 2025, there have already been 70 incidents, in which around 135 Pakistani security forces personnel have been killed as against 66 insurgents/extremists–a ratio of 2:1 which reflects the enormity of the problem. Some of these insurgent attacks caused serious damage in men and material to the Pakistani security forces. In early February last, insurgents ambushed a van carrying troops, killing 17 Pakistani soldiers in the Kalat district. Two weeks later, in attacks on a Pakistan army checkpoint and a convoy in the Mand area, another 17 Pakistani soldiers were killed. The insurgents also attacked a bus carrying mine workers in Harnai, killing 11. Although the Pakistani media presented this as an extortion racket run by the insurgents, the fact that it was an attack on an economic target–the insurgents call it exploitation of Balochistan’s resources by Punjab–made it a legitimate target in their view. Similarly, the targeting of Punjabi businessmen and settlers the Baloch call them spies and collaborators–is also a part of the strategy of the Baloch fighters against the Pakistani state. Perhaps the most devastating attack was carried out in August 2024 when the Baloch insurgents launched Operation Herof, in which they carried out coordinated attacks across the length and breadth of the province. In 2024 alone, over 900 attacks were carried out by the insurgent groups, the bulk of them by BLA, BLF and under the label of BRAS. Except for the Pashtun-dominated districts of Northern Balochistan, the Baloch insurgents have been active in every district of Balochistan. This is a qualitative change from past insurgencies when the fighting was restricted to a few districts and tribes. Now, it is pan-Balochistan and cutting across tribal, linguistic, and gender divide. While the Baloch insurgents have upped their game, not just in terms of the ferocity, intensity, and organisational capability, the Pakistani state—which is a euphemism for the Pakistan Army—has not been able to evolve to respond effectively. Its playbook is the same decades-old one: increase brutality, offer blandishments to tribal chieftains, bribe influential politicians, browbeat the people, stifle all dissent, keep a very tight leash over the media, install puppets and Quislings to run the province under the garb of democracy. But it is proving counterproductive, and the more the Pakistan Army doubles down on its repressive rule, the more it alienates the Baloch people and swells the ranks of the insurgent groups with recruits, including women and young people from educated middle-class. Finding itself losing the narrative war, the Pakistan Army has responded predictably. It has started raiding universities and abducting Baloch students, keeping them in illegal custody and, in some cases, killing them and dumping their bodies on the roadsides or in the wilds. In just the first few weeks of this calendar year, over 250 students have forcibly disappeared. This enforced disappearances issue has only fuelled disgust and alienation against the Pakistani state, arguably becoming one of the central pillars around which Baloch public opinion has been mobilised. Apart from the brutal repression that has been unleashed, the Pakistan Army is trying to play catch up in the narrative game by using tactics which are now anachronistic. For instance, authorities often parade a ‘surrendered militant’ who recites a predictable narrative – accusing commanders of greed, claiming India funds them, and asserting they work against Baloch interests. The Pakistani media then plays up these stories to amplify them. But no one except perhaps people in Punjab are buying what the Pakistan Army’s disinformation wing is selling. Similarly, exaggerated and often utterly fictitious claims of the Pakistan Army’s operations either to repel an attack or to raid insurgent hideouts are not impressing anyone. In most cases, the Pakistan Army conjures up an imaginary number of insurgents killed just to show that it is fighting back, and hard. The BRAS declaration to restructure its organisation and intensify its operations makes it clear– the insurgents believe the struggle in Balochistan has entered a decisive phase. The political narrative is dominated by young leaders of the Baloch Yakjheti Council, such as the indomitable Mahrang Baloch, Sami Deen Baloch and other members spearheading massive protests across the province. Members of the legislative assembly and the ‘elected’ government in the province have become political pigmies who are in power only because they have been foisted on the people of Balochistan by the Pakistan Army. The political and democratic processes in Balochistan have become redundant because they have been completely compromised and rigged by the Pakistan Army, all of which feeds into the narrative of pro-independence voices. Militarily, the Baloch insurgents have demonstrated their reach, capability and ability to coordinate complex attacks. While there is some skepticism about how much the Baloch can achieve because they constitute less than 5 percent of Pakistan's 250 million population, the insurgents believe that they have the critical mass required to win against the Pakistani state. What they lack in sheer numbers, they make up because of the raging Taliban insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Pashtun belt of Balochistan, which is bogging down and bleeding the Pakistan Army. Add to this the sharp deterioration in relations between the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban appear to be giving space to the Baloch as it gives them a certain leverage over Pakistan, which they suspect of flirting with Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) to undermine the Islamic Emirate. The situation in Sistan-Balochistan province of Iran is also proving conducive for the Baloch insurgents in Pakistan. Faced with the audacity and ferocity of attacks being carried out by the Baloch freedom fighters, and given that Pakistan’s antediluvian approach to tackling the restiveness in the province is not working, there are limited options available to the Pakistan Army. It can continue doing what it has been over the last 25 years since this fifth insurgency has been raging in Balochistan, perhaps intensify what it has been doing. But the result is unlikely to be any different. The Pakistan Army could also decide to carry out a scorched earth steamroller operation in Balochistan. Managing the operation’s political, military and diplomatic consequences could prove disastrous. A third option is to try reconciliation. This is, however, a long and difficult path to take and beyond the intellectual ability of Pakistan's Punjabi military elite because it militates against the colonial control fetish of Pakistan's ruling class. But regardless of what policy Pakistan adopts, the situation in Balochistan will continue to be fraught for the foreseeable future. And while intimations of Balochistan shaking off the ‘shackles of slavery’ (to use the evocative phrase of Imran Khan) might be highly premature and overly optimistic, Balochistan will remain the bone stuck in Pakistan's throat—one it cannot expel, yet one it struggles to swallow.

Egypt’s Gaza Reconstruction Plan – Analysis	By Hirak Jyoti Das On 4 March 2025, the Arab League held an emergency summit in response to United States (US) President Donald Trump’s announcement to 'take over' and 'own' Gaza, under long-term American control and relocating Palestinians elsewhere, particularly Egypt and Jordan. Trump’s plan has fostered collective concern within the Arab world, not just about Palestinians but also to protect their own states from spillover effects. The Arab League members adopted Egypt’s Gaza reconstruction plan which focuses on re-development and rehabilitation without removing the Palestinian population.[1] The plan envisions a green and smart city powered by renewable energy, fostering a sustainable economy with long-term employment in industry, agriculture and technology. Gaza is divided into five key sectors each with distinct functions, i.e., Rafah as a logistics centre; Khan Younis as a science and knowledge centre; Deir Al-Balah hosting Al-salam centre; Gaza city hosting the government headquarters; and a cultural centre in North Gaza. The plan designates six basic zones, i.e., residential zones, commercial and mixed-use spaces, service and development corridors, recreational and tourism zones, central green axis and agricultural and industrial zones.[2] The estimated cost of the five-year Gaza reconstruction plan, set to conclude by 2030, is US$ 53 billion. The six-month early recovery phase (US$ 3 billion) focuses on clearing rubble, building 200,000 temporary housing units, restoring 60,000 homes and implementing social protection and loan programmes. Phase one (two years, US$ 20 billion) will develop infrastructure, essential services and utilities. Phase two (2.5 years, US$ 30 billion) aims to construct 460,000 housing units for 2.75 million people, establish utilities, build industrial zones, fishing and commercial ports, an airport and a 10 km Corniche road. The plan seeks to generate 500,000 jobs across housing (80,000), industry (70,000), tourism (60,000), services (90,000), agriculture (120,000) and fishing (80,000).[3] The sources of financing that could be tapped include the United Nations (UN), financial institutions, donor states, development banks, FDI and private partnerships. A trust fund under international supervision is proposed for transparency and efficient fund allocation. Politically, the plan aims for a two-state solution, ceasefire preservation and governance under a non-partisan technocratic Gaza Administration Committee during a six-month transition period facilitating Palestinian Authority’s (PA) return in Gaza Strip. Egypt and Jordan offered training for Palestinian forces, while a UN Security Council-backed peacekeeping force is suggested for security and state-building.[4] Lacuna in the Proposal The Egyptian plan is perceived as more realistic than Trump’s ‘Riviera in the Middle East’ proposal which could perpetuate significant destabilisation in the region. The Egyptian plan excludes Hamas from governing Gaza and dismisses the relocation option. There are, however, significant gaps in the Egyptian plan’s security and governance provisions and it does not sufficiently address Israel’s strategic concerns. Israel’s Foreign Ministry rejected the Arab League-endorsed proposal arguing that it 'fails to address the realities of the situation following 7 October 2023, remaining rooted in outdated perspectives'. It suggested that Donald Trump’s idea could provide an opportunity for the Palestinians in Gaza 'to have free choice based on their free will'.[5] The statement blamed Arab states for levelling baseless accusations against Israel and rejecting Trump’s initiative. Israel’s swift rejection is a calculated move to block the plan from gaining international acceptance. Israeli commentators have pointed to the lack of condemnation of Hamas’ 7 October 2023 attack and the absence of accountability for their actions in the Egyptian plan.[6] Israel has insisted on adhering to a security-centric approach towards Hamas. In this context, the plan lacks clear mechanism for Hamas’ transition out of power in the long term and does not address the armed group’s military capabilities or durable security arrangements. The plan does not mention disarming Hamas but instead calls for resolving the issue of armed factions through a credible political process by restoring Palestinian rights. Moreover, Israel is unlikely to favour a UN peacekeeping force in Gaza Strip due to its distrust of the UN’s activities and their overall stance on Israeli occupation policy.[7] Israel’s non-acceptance of a PA rule in Gaza poses a serious challenge to the Egyptian plan. Israel has reasons to be concerned about the selection of members for the Palestinian technocratic team, as radical elements could potentially infiltrate in the governing bodies. While technocrats may be responsible for managing day-to-day affairs, Hamas could still maintain de-facto authority by exerting influence behind the scenes.[8] The proposal does not include any provision for elections. During the summit, PA President Mahmoud Abbas expressed his commitment to holding elections in the West Bank, Gaza and occupied East Jerusalem if the circumstances are suitable. However, Abbas’ commitment to elections remains highly doubtful that could in fact weaken Fatah’s hold in West Bank. Besides Israel, divisions among Arab states could hinder the Egyptian plan’s feasibility. While all Arab League members have endorsed the proposal, Gulf States remain cautious about Hamas’ Islamist agenda and links with Iran. Qatar supports Hamas’ inclusion in the political process, whereas, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) insist that the group relinquish power and commit to disarmament.[9] The absence of Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman and Emirati President Mohamed bin Zayed in the Cairo summit suggests hesitation to commit to Gaza’s rehabilitation without a clear roadmap for security, peace and political reform.[10] Notably, the Emirati Ambassador to the US, Yousef Al-Otaiba speaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai on 12 February 2025, broke from the broader Arab stance stating that he saw ‘no alternative’ to Trump’s plan and expressed hope for finding common ground with the US policy.[11] The rehabilitation process along with critical financial support from Gulf States could be jeopardised if Hamas continues its militant activities, perpetuating the cycle of violence and increasing the risk of newly built infrastructure being destroyed in future conflicts. In the US, reactions have been mixed. White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes argued that the Arab Plan did not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance. President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.[12] Subsequently, US Special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff called the proposal a 'good faith first step' with 'a lot of compelling features to it'. Hours later, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce stated that Trump’s plan was 'an invitation for new ideas, and it seemed to have spurred some new ideas' from the Arab world but characterised the Egyptian proposal as 'inadequate'.[13] The US policy, therefore, intends to push regional allies to propose alternative offers, shape the diplomatic process and keep its options open. In the coming days, how key Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Egypt navigate their engagement with the Trump presidency will be critical in influencing Israel to compromise. This could involve accepting a reformed Palestinian Authority, resuming aid, ensuring full implementation of Phases Two and Three of ceasefire deal, and ultimately ending the war.[14] To salvage the plan, securing US backing and leveraging its strategic heft to pressurise Israel will be pertinent. The US, rather than UN, could be assigned a leading role in peacekeeping efforts. The US, even without direct troop deployment, could provide diplomatic leadership, operational and logistical support. The peacekeeping efforts should proceed in parallel with confidence-building measures and international guarantees to prevent Israel from reneging and resuming hostilities. Arab states should also exert pressure on Hamas to ensure full compliance. A joint US–Arab initiative could help relaunch Israel’s peace negotiations with PA and long-term truce with Hamas. A Saudi–Israel normalisation based plan could help secure US’ active involvement and a central role in a renewed Arab plan.[15] While Israel supports Trump’s plan and rejects the Egyptian proposal, Hamas’ refusal to disarm could deepen divisions, making the initiative a non-starter. Hamas has sent mixed signals about its future in Gaza, expressing willingness to discuss demilitarisation as the end goal of the peace process, but rejecting it as a prerequisite for negotiations.[16] Uncertainty remains over whether Hamas will cooperate, disarm and relinquish control. Moreover, Netanyahu’s political compulsions and the growing unpopularity of a two-state solution within Israel could impede any path towards reconciliation. Conclusion Trump’s displacement option carries significant risks creating unpredictable outcomes and potentially leading to the annulment of Egypt and Jordan’s peace treaties with Israel, sabotage the Abraham Accords and normalisation plans with Saudi Arabia. However, Israel’s current government remains unwilling to compromise on PA rule in Gaza, uninterrupted aid supply and complete withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor. The continued political domination of Hamas in post war Gaza could complicate the rehabilitation process pushed by the Gulf States. While mass displacement is unlikely, Israel may seek territorial concessions that would redraw Gaza’s borders. A security buffer zone running from north to south on the Palestinian side would confine the population within the 365 sq. km area, which spans approximately 40 km in length and 3 to 12 km in width.[17] Given these constraints, the most probable scenario is the return to status quo. This would entail a slow and fragmented rehabilitation process, a stalled reconstruction effort, and continued Palestinian dependence on Israel for aid and essential services. Intermittent rocket attacks and IDF counter strikes would likely persist, reinforcing instability. Additionally, Israel may retain military presence in key areas within Gaza, solidifying control through the buffer zone while avoiding full reoccupation. The prolonged deadlock would deepen humanitarian challenges, delaying any long-term resolution to the conflict.

Thailand: Two Years On Has Anti-Torture Law Reduced Abuse? – Anal...	By Nontarat Phaicharoen After an infamous case where police were filmed torturing a drug suspect who died, a Thai court in 2023 ordered police to implement measures under an anti-torture law, including videotaping interrogations and wearing body cameras during arrests. The police officers entangled in the 2021 case thought they had erased footage from a CCTV camera of their interrogation of suspect Jirapong Tanapat. But an officer leaked it to a lawyers’ group, which circulated it on social media. Former Police Col. Thitisan Utthanaphon – nicknamed 'Jo Ferrari' because he had a personal fleet of fast cars – was the policeman who led the interrogation where officers handcuffed and put plastic bags over Jirapong’s head. On March 7, Thitisan was found dead in his Bangkok prison cell, where he was serving a life sentence over the case. Authorities this week ruled his death a suicide by hanging. But whatever happened with the anti-torture measures that were mandated under the law? Have the measures made a difference? The law has led to the purchase of nearly 50,000 body cameras for law enforcers, authorities said. Since the Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearance Act was passed in February 2023, the Justice Ministry reports 141 complaints have been filed. That’s a significant reduction. Statistics from the National Human Rights Commission showed that at least 150 cases were reported annually in the years 2017 through 2022. Breaking down the 141 complaints from the past two years, 58 involve torture, 45 involve cruel and inhumane treatment, 17 involve enforced disappearances and 21 involve multiple offenses. Officials said no officers have been prosecuted but several cases are under investigation. 'This law is a crucial tool that will ensure state officials carry out their duties more cautiously, and as we’ve seen, complaints have indeed decreased,' Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong said late last month. During the same month as the law took effect in February 2023, the cabinet approved spending 445 million baht ($13.2 million) to acquire 48,568 body cameras for police officers. These cameras were allocated to crime prevention, patrol and traffic officers along with investigators. Somchai Homlaor, a member of the Committee on Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearances, noted significant improvements. 'In these two years since implementation, effective measures include body cameras and arrest-report documentation,' he told BenarNews. 'We must acknowledge that complaints about torture and enforced disappearances have significantly decreased. Officials are considerably more cautious.' Despite the apparent success of the cameras, some issues remain. 'The sheer volume of data is enormous and it must be retained until each case is closed, presenting considerable challenges during implementation,' Thanaseth said. How did this happen? The path to enactment of the anti-torture law took over a decade despite attempts by advocates to get it on the books. Thailand ratified the U.N. Convention Against Torture in 2007 and signed the Convention Against Enforced Disappearances in 2012. Yet, efforts to pass the domestic law stalled for years. In 2016, Thailand’s junta-led National Legislative Assembly, whose members were mostly police and military officers, rejected proposed legislation. Following the 2019 election of a new, democratic legislature, PMs eventually passed the bill in 2022, leading to its implementation in early 2023. 'This law primarily addresses state officials’ actions. It directly affects law enforcement officers and their handling of suspects, ensuring accountability for any torture or cruel treatment inflicted physically or mentally,' police Col. Thanaseth Pirom-iam, deputy commander of the Royal Thai Police Education and Quality Assurance Division, told BenarNews. Pornpen Khongkachonkiet, director of the Cross Cultural Foundation, emphasized the significance of the law, which was created with public participation and closely aligns with international standards. 'It can genuinely protect victims, provide remedies and hold state officials accountable for acts of torture,' she told BenarNews. Key provisions prohibit detention in secret or undisclosed locations and unequivocally forbid enforced disappearances under any circumstances, including war, internal security threats or public emergencies. The law covering police, military, immigration and forestry officers mandates comprehensive audiovisual recording from the moment of arrest through interrogation and release. Offenders face severe penalties, including prison terms ranging from 15 years to life and fines between 300,000 and 1 million baht (U.S. $8,875 and $29,600). Still, deaths in custody remain high, although the Justice Ministry attributes most of them to natural causes including illnesses. The ministry statistics show 627 deaths involving prisoners and 52 while in police custody were recorded over the past two years. Are officials finding ways around the law? Even as reports of torture appear to show a decrease, human rights advocates question whether law enforcement tactics may be changing. The Cross Cultural Foundation documented 24 complaints under the anti-torture law, but only one case reached court and 17 remain under investigation. Foundation lawyer Pornpimol Mukkuntod said methods of mistreatment had become more subtle to evade legal detection. 'The law is indeed enforceable, but is every article effectively implemented? Do all officials follow the rules strictly? That’s another matter,' Pornpimol said. 'Torture has significantly reduced, but we’ve received reports of soldiers forcing detainees to strip and stand in the rain, a more subtle form of abuse designed to circumvent the law.' Ruj Chuenban in Bangkok contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMFgEurx4QEDv	2025-03-15T17:21:07-07:00	
Chinese Blockbuster Holds A Lesson For China’s Soft Power – Analy...	By Wanning Sun The release of Ne Zha 2, an animated feature film about a rebellious boy from Chinese mythology, has been hailed as a DeepSeek moment in China’s film industry. Its success makes the case for market-driven cultural diplomacy rather than government direction. Since its release in cinemas throughout China on 29 January 2025, the film about a god-boy grossed over US$1 billion in China in nine days. This makes Ne Zha 2 the first movie to break US$1 billion in a single market — overtaking Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It is also the first time a film produced outside the Hollywood Studio System has crossed the US$1 billion mark. A few key ingredients may account for the phenomenal box office success of Ne Zha 2. One is certainly its creative energy. The film takes a story from ancient Chinese mythology and turns it into a visual feast that is funny, fast-paced and irreverent. Its release as one of the ‘Chinese New Year Films’ (he sui pian) — a marketing gimmick that can be traced back to the post-war Hong Kong film industry — also contributed to domestic success. Another could be its ability to appeal to the patriotism of domestic audiences by poking light fun at the United States. Above all, like DeepSeek, Ne Zha 2 relied on local talent. The film took five years to make and involved more than 130 Chinese companies. Producer and Director Yang Yu said he initially wanted to engage an overseas animation team to help with the special effects but struggled to win interest. Eventually, China’s Base FX took on the challenge. Ne Zha 2 is a market endeavour, but this does not stop the Chinese government from boasting about it. After all, Party policy thinkers have thought long and hard about how to get mainstream international audiences, especially those in the West, to consume Chinese content. As early as the 1990s, the Chinese government was aware of the undue dominance of Western media in shaping global attitudes towards China. Enamoured of the idea of soft power, Beijing has spent around 6 billion dollars trying to get its state media content to ‘go global’ and compete with Western discourses. The agenda of the ‘go global’ mission was to ‘tell China’s story’ to the world, with its own voice and perspective. Complimentary copies of China’s state media outlet China Daily became widely available in many major cities in the West. Chinese state media organisations also tried to forge collaborations or partnerships with Western media outlets by signing memorandums. But these initiatives have to a large extent backfired, producing widespread suspicion and anxiety about Chinese influence. The rest of the world, especially Western countries, tend to find the content of Chinese media boring, hollow and propagandistic. In turn, the entertainment sector, not primarily tasked with telling China’s story or targeting international audiences, has shown some promising signs of delivering soft power dividends. For instance, the Chinese television dating show If You Are the One took flight in Australia and many other countries. Unlike state news media, entertainment programs like If You Are the One offer a glimpse of Chinese society that is mostly missing from the Western media, thereby offering a much-needed counterbalance — even a healthy antidote — to the China influence narrative. Though not initially tasked with promoting an attractive China, the show presented aspects of contemporary Chinese society that are more convincing, relatable and even endearing to its Western viewers. Like If You Are the One, Ne Zha 2 is a market product that primarily targets Chinese-speaking viewers and has gone global via market mechanisms rather than Party decree. Ne Zha 2 debuted in North America on 14 February 2025 after special screenings on 12 February, and launched in cinemas in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea on 13 February. Additional releases are also planned for other countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Egypt, South Africa, Pakistan, Japan and South Korea. Now six weeks since its initial release, the film has surpassed US$2 billion at the box office. Its grossing figures continue to rise. The phenomenal box-office value of Ne Zha 2 sends a clear message to Disney and its subsidiary Pixar — Chinese audiences may no longer need to be entertained by Hollywood blockbusters. It also puts the heads of other animation studios — including DreamWorks, Warner Bros, and (in Japan) Studio Ghibli — on notice, suggesting that Chinese animations could soon vie to attract a global audience that has so far been almost monopolised by Disney. Most significantly, the Chinese animation industry may soon begin to reverse the Mulan phenomenon — rather than letting the Americans tell a Chinese story, why can’t the Chinese tell a Western story? At the very least, perhaps the Chinese government will get the message this time — keep your hands off and let markets do the job of finding innovative ways of showcasing Chinese culture to the world.

Can Trump Do Anything To Make Putin Accept A Cease-Fire In Ukrain...	By Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- While Ukraine has signed up to a US cease-fire plan, Russian President Vladimir Putin has equivocated –- effectively saying 'Yes, but.' Trump has said it would be 'disappointing' if Putin doesn't sign up, but did not want to be drawn on what leverage he may have to push him to agree to the 30-day truce. So, what can he do? There seem to be three options. Sanctions Trump said he could do 'things financially that would be very bad for Russia.' This sounds like a hint of extra sanctions, and Trump also threatened as much in a recent post on his Truth Social network. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Kevin Hackett, head of the National Economic Council, have echoed Trump's comments but not provided any detail of what tougher sanctions would look like. Hackett spoke recently of 'sticks and carrots.' On March 13, the administration took action by not extending a sanctions waiver on selected Russian banks facilitating payments for oil and gas. This makes it harder for other countries to make these purchases. Reestablishing the waiver would be a carrot, and the United States have raised the prospect of sanctions relief if Moscow negotiates. Putin has indicated he wants bigger carrots, such as demilitarizing Ukraine and stopping US weapons supplies to Kyiv. In terms of sticks, Hackett said there was 'a heck of a lot of things' that could be done but did not name any of them. One option that's been discussed would be imposing secondary sanctions on third countries that buy Russian oil above a Western-imposed price cap of $60 a barrel (the current market price is around $70). The biggest customers are China, India, and Turkey (in that order). Another idea might be to reduce the level of the cap, further slashing Russian revenues. This would require coordination with Western allies. Russia has used a 'shadow fleet' of aging oil tankers to circumvent existing sanctions. This could also face tighter sanctions, by adding more vessels to the proscribed list, for example. But it's a game of cat and mouse. Vessels often go through multiple ownership changes involving numerous shell companies. Enforcement requires substantial effort and resources. Another step that's been mooted would be to ban imports of products based on Russian crude oil refined in third countries. Measures such as these would tighten the screw on the Russian economy. But they would not be a quick fix and would be unlikely to have the same rapid effect that Washington's weapons supply freeze appeared to have in pushing Ukraine to agree to the cease-fire plan. Tariffs In other international disputes, Trump's weapon of choice is tariffs, and he could certainly impose them on Russia. But the effect would likely be very limited. Trump's use of sanctions has caused deep concern in other countries, such as China, Canada, and European Union members. But these are all major US trading partners with plenty to lose. Russia, by contrast, hardly sells anything to the United States. 'Russian exports to the US dropped by more than 80% last year, compared to the pre-war period, to about $3bn, the lowest since 1992,' noted Alexander Kolyandr in a recent article for the Center for European Policy Analysis. 'This represents about 10 days-worth of Russian exports to China in 2024.' A non-tariff measure Trump suggested in January was persuading Saudi Arabia to drive down the price of oil by ramping up production. But this would seem unlikely to match Saudi interests. Guns Trump's special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has laid out a third way that Washington could wave a stick at Russia. In June last year, he unveiled a plan to get both sides to the negotiating table quickly. 'We tell the Ukrainians, 'You've got to come to the table, and if you don't come to the table, support from the United States will dry up,'' he said. 'And you tell Putin…if you don't come to the table, then we'll give Ukrainians everything they need to kill you in the field.' So far, we've seen the first part of this scenario. It was quick and easy to achieve. It was also cheap, since withholding military aid is obviously cheaper to US taxpayers than providing it. There are major questions about the second part, not least that Kellogg himself has not played a prominent role in negotiations so far. Flooding Ukraine with weapons would be an expensive endeavor for a US president who has spoken so often about how the war has already cost Americans too much. It would also represent a dizzying political turnaround. Trump has warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he is 'gambling with World War III.' Washington may judge that the second part of Kellogg's strategy is just too risky. Ray Furlong is a Senior International Correspondent for RFE/RL.

Remembering The Ides Of March – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed In Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, a fortune teller warns the Roman potentate to 'Beware the Ides of March.' In the calendar of the time, this meant the 15th. Caesar paid little heed, and on March 15, in 44 BC, he was assassinated by senators eager to restore the fading Republic. If I had been in Rome on that date, I might have applauded the deed. Caesar, after all, was no friend of the liberties of the Republic. He was a violent, power-lusting demagogue who bullied the Senate into naming him 'dictator for life' just weeks earlier. I can easily imagine that the threat to Roman liberty justified extreme measures. We now know, however, that Caesar’s death did not produce the outcome its architects intended. Instead of renewing liberty, it provoked civil war and imperial autocracy. The Republic was dead as a doornail, never to rise again. While the most famous Ides of March remains that fateful day in Rome, a March 15 event from American history (in 1783) also deserves attention. The two principal characters—Caesar in the first instance, George Washington in the second—couldn’t have been more different. Both were military figures, but the similarities end there. The former intended to extinguish a republic; the latter fought to establish one. One was ambitious for political power; the other preferred managing a farm in Virginia. Caesar possessed little respect for civilian authority, but Washington defended it at all costs. And while Caesar was an arrogant scoundrel, Washington earned the reverence of his countrymen as a pillar of solid character. What happened on March 15, 1783? Known in history as the high-water mark of the 'Newburgh Conspiracy,' it involved disgruntled officers and soldiers of America’s Continental Army, commanded by General George Washington. Perhaps the best book on the subject is David Head’s A Crisis of Peace: George Washington, the Newburgh Conspiracy, and the Fate of the American Revolution. 'It was a crisis of peace,' the author argues, 'a time when the Revolution still might have failed, and the crisis at Newburgh was an hour of grave danger.' Americans can be grateful that in a moment when character made all the difference, we had a Washington and not a Caesar. Here’s the backdrop: In the popular imagination, the American victory against the British at Yorktown in October 1781 is the end of the conflict with the mother country. In reality, the war would not formally conclude until the Treaty of Paris almost two years later. If peace overtures had broken down at any time in between, hostilities could easily have resumed. So Washington, headquartered in Newburgh, New York, worked to keep the army together and ready in case events turned nasty. It was, to put it mildly, a massive challenge that would have defeated a lesser man. The army seethed with discontent over the bad food and deplorable living conditions it had suffered for years. The men longed to rejoin their families, impoverished in many instances by the absence of a breadwinner. To add insult to injury, compensation for their wartime services was pitiful. David Head writes: As much as they expected money, officers and soldiers alike rarely received any pay at all. As Washington told a complaining Maryland general in spring 1782, 'no pay has been lately given to the Troops of any state.' He could have said the same at virtually any other point in the war. Congress and the states had offered the men little more than pledges to pay something in the future. The paper dollars the Congress printed and sometimes provided the army were near-worthless from the start, as were the slips of paper issued by various states. Imagine setting aside your life, occupation, and family, risking life and limb under harsh conditions for a cause that might not end well—and doing it for free. In May 1778, in lieu of pay, Congress approved pensions of half pay for seven years for officers who served for the duration of the war. That was immensely better than anything the average grunt could expect at that moment. Late in the conflict, Congress changed the promise from seven years to life at Washington’s urging. Anything less, the General feared, would produce mass resignations. Yet he still expected loyalty to the goals of the revolution. When an officer suggested to Washington that the men be given land in the West to establish a country and anoint a king, Washington smacked it down in the strongest possible terms. He wanted no hints of any betrayal of the young country’s republican principles. The problem was not that Congress had the money and simply wouldn’t pay it out. It was on the brink of bankruptcy, the costs of war having drained what little treasury it ever had. In early March 1783, tensions over the pay and pensions situation threatened to boil over. Letters and rumors hinted that some men contemplated a march on Congress in Philadelphia to compel it to pay up. Some politicians hoped, not so secretly, that the threat of insurrection would galvanize the country in favor of stronger central government. Washington was more than a little concerned. He knew, as the National Constitution Center explains, that 'A large-scale mutiny by American soldiers would shatter the public’s confidence in the military, vindicate Great Britain’s skepticism about the American experiment, and tarnish the young nation in the eyes of the world.' The great man ordered an assembly of officers for March 15 and gave the indication that General Horatio Gates would be the speaker. Washington understood the value of a theatrical entrance. Gates had barely opened the meeting when Washington surprised everybody by walking in. Stunned, Gates gave him the floor as Washington gazed upon the faces of his angry men. He produced some paper on which he had written what became known as the 'Newburgh Address,' arguably the most important speech of his military career. In a calm but fervent tone, Washington counseled patience. He recognized what the men had been through, and he asked them not to throw it all away: Let me entreat you, Gentlemen, on your part, not to take any measures, which, viewed in the calm light of reason, will lessen the dignity, and sully the glory you have hitherto maintained—let me request you to rely on the plighted faith of your Country, and place a full confidence in the purity of the intentions of Congress; that, previous to your dissolution as an Army they will cause all your Accts to be fairly liquidated, as directed in their resolutions, which were published to you two days ago—and that they will adopt the most effectual measures in their power, to render ample justice to you, for your faithful and meritorious Services. And then, he did something that brought many men to tears. He appeared to hesitate over some words, reached in his pocket for a pair of glasses almost no one had ever seen him wear before, and said this: Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country. In an instant, the turmoil was over. This was a man who had always strived to do his best, who endured hardship at the side of his men, who never lost faith in the cause of liberty or the men who fought on its behalf. Washington loved his men, and they in turn loved him back. As he departed the building, one officer after another reaffirmed their loyalty. There would be no mutiny that day. Peace with Britain arrived in September. Congress eventually hammered out an agreement with the army. It called for five years of full pay instead of the lifetime pension of half pay promised earlier. The men received bonds which, to Congress’s credit, were redeemed at 100 cents on the dollar by the new American government in 1790. In an ancient Roman context, the Ides of March evokes a story of bloodshed and tyranny. In an American context, however, March 15 should be remembered as a remarkable day in which the character of a great man saved a nation. About the author: Lawrence W.

Leftward Drift Of America’s Political Duopoly – OpEd	Trump's social and economic policy is a mixed bag of leftist and rightist tenets. Many still fail to grasp the core ideological principles of his populist approach, left to rely solely on the vague 'Make America Great Again' slogan. Representatives of the Republican Party and conservatives generally assume themselves to be right-wing. Indeed, within the American duopoly political system, Republicans are positioned to the right of Democrats on a relative scale. However, on an absolute scale, both major American political parties today occupy positions on the political left. While this assertion may seem counterintuitive at first glance, this article offers some evidence to support this conclusion. Looking ahead, I will note that the main point of convergence is the fact that both Democrats and Republicans alike rely extensively on omnipotent state to address all societal problems, which essentially positions them in left-wing ideological territory. The Democratic Party is evidently left-wing by design and policy, closely resembling Europe's Social-Democratic parties. Often known as Evolutionary Socialists or Democratic Socialists, Democrats explicitly advocate for increased governmental roles in healthcare, education, wealth redistribution, and extensive regulation of the economy. They believe societal issues are primarily resolved through state intervention rather than individual initiative or free-market solutions. Republicans, traditionally perceived as the party of limited government, have gradually drifted leftward, abandoning core conservative principles over recent decades. In this article, 'conservative' refers to a flavor of conservative philosophy rooted in free-market principles and the maximization of individual freedom, closely aligned with libertarianism. The last genuinely center-right president was Ronald Reagan, who comprehensively understood and articulated the dangers inherent to expansive government power. Reagan famously asserted that the government was not the solution but rather the problem itself. Since his era, Republican leadership has increasingly embraced state intervention in various forms, marking a pronounced departure from authentic conservative tenets. I argue that the current ideological stance of the Republican Party is center-left. What policies are keeping Republicans hooked on the center? Let’s take Trump presidency as an example. One of Trump's most commendable right-wing economic moves involved reducing taxes and advocating for deregulation. Tax reductions typically align with conservative economic thought, intended to foster economic growth by enabling individuals and businesses to retain a larger share of their earnings. Similarly, deregulation reflects conservative acknowledgment that excessive bureaucratic processes impede productivity and stifle innovation. Trump, with firsthand experience as a businessman, vividly illustrated the impediments caused by burdensome regulations, especially in construction and real estate industries. However, Trump's commitment to conservative principles wasn't consistent. A prominent example was his staunch support for eminent domain, the state’s ability to seize private property, allegedly for the public good. Trump's justification was pragmatic: without eminent domain, infrastructural projects like highways couldn't efficiently proceed. Yet, from a libertarian perspective, eminent domain severely undermines the sanctity of private property, a cornerstone principle of genuine individualist philosophy. Any support for such state intrusion places one firmly on the political left. Trump should be praised for his efforts to eliminate wokism, social-engineering and restoring common sense. He courageously challenged the increasingly pervasive ideology of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) which has permeated educational institutions, corporations, and government agencies. Trump's attempts to curtail this ideology within governmental operations were important, highlighting how collectivist thinking can erode the individual autonomy fundamental to a free society. At the same time, we see that American business tend to sway with the wind—eagerly adopting DEI, only to quietly retreat later when the administration changes. It’s disappointing to see American companies lose their spine, too tied to the state’s shifts. This suggests a society tilting toward a collective mindset. The Trump administration aimed to streamline government, trim its size, and rein in spending—a worthy goal that, if realized, could greatly benefit society. Yet, small government does not simply mean its nominal size—although reducing this is inherently beneficial—but rather its minimal footprint in socio-economic affairs. True conservatism prioritizes limiting governmental power and maximizing individual freedom, resisting state interference in private decisions. Sadly, this doesn’t always seem to top the Republican priorities. Next, let’s consider what precisely constitutes the Republicans' leftward drift? Fundamentally, it revolves around their reliance on government intervention. Despite rhetoric favoring small government, Republican policies frequently employ the state's regulatory and economic power extensively. A striking misstep in Trump's policies is his enthusiastic embrace of tariffs, which, despite his rhetoric, neither shrank the overall trade deficit nor significantly spurred the onshoring of American businesses during his first term. Tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods, a governmental measure that contradicts conservative economic principles. They increase the cost of goods for consumers and businesses, inadvertently transferring wealth from private entities to government coffers. Republicans traditionally advocate for reduced taxation, yet tariffs effectively increase economic burdens, limiting market freedom and consumer choice. The rationale behind tariffs typically revolves around protecting domestic industries from foreign competition. However, this justification often lacks credibility, as demonstrated by Trump's tariff policy regarding Canada and Mexico. The American automotive industry, for instance, was blindsided by tariffs that Trump imposed without their prior request or even consultation. Instead of benefiting, automakers found themselves pleading for tariff exemptions, fearing significant economic losses. This scenario starkly illustrates how such protectionist measures often backfire, undermining their supposed intent and inflicting unintended economic harm. To grasp why tariffs typically harm the economy, it's essential to understand the principle of competitive advantage in international economics. Competitive advantage occurs when a nation or business produces goods or services more efficiently than others, benefiting from specialization and trade. Trump’s claim that the U.S. doesn't need Canadian lumber neglected this principle entirely. By arbitrarily deciding on behalf of businesses from whom they should buy their resources, Trump engaged in profoundly leftist governmental interference. In a genuine free-market economy, companies—not governments—should choose their suppliers based on efficiency, quality, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, autarky—economic self-sufficiency—is inherently leftist, opposing right-wing market-based economics advocating free and open trade. Trump's tariff strategy, whether intentional or not, veered dangerously toward economic isolationism, undermining the core conservative value of free enterprise and open markets. What socio-economic policies would bring Republicans back to right side of the political spectrum? There are critical regulatory policies hampering economic growth that genuine conservative approaches would dismantle. The first and most significant regulation ripe for removal is the mandatory minimum wage, a state-imposed constraint distorting the natural market dynamics of labor supply and demand. True economic freedom involves allowing the market to determine wages organically, optimizing employment and economic efficiency based on real-time conditions and individual merit rather than artificial government mandates. Rent control policies similarly represent another destructive intervention that exacerbates the housing crisis rather than resolving it. Government-imposed rent limits artificially reduce housing supply and quality, discouraging investment and leading to chronic shortages and deteriorating housing conditions. Eliminating rent control would allow market forces to adjust housing availability and affordability naturally, genuinely addressing shortages through incentivized production rather than misguided state-imposed restrictions. Another key regulatory element needing improvement is our tax code. It’s overly complex, burdensome, and riddled with loopholes. Our progressive tax system acts as a wealth redistribution mechanism, placing individuals and businesses in tricky situations, especially near tax bracket thresholds. Progressive taxation subtly and gradually erodes property rights, unfairly penalizing success. Reforming the IRS and adopting a simplified tax code with a modest flat tax would be a better path forward. There’s no need to create yet another government agency, the ERS, to handle tariffs and other external contributions to the treasury. This is definitely not an exhaustive list of policies; rather, it highlights just a few key areas needing attention, leaving room for broader discussion and additional reforms. Ultimately, genuine economic revitalization relies not on expansive government intervention but on policies increasing productivity, innovation, and product quality. True right-wing economic ideology emphasizes minimal state involvement, enabling individuals and businesses maximum freedom to determine their economic destinies. Any deviation from this principle, however well-intentioned, inevitably pushes policy into leftist territory, restricting liberty, stifling economic vitality, and perpetuating state dependency.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMGeU8fXU02LJ	2025-03-15T17:11:46-07:00	
Kremlin: Reasons To Be Optimistic About Ceasefire Deal	Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that there were reasons for 'cautious optimism' regarding a proposed ceasefire deal between Ukraine and Russia, following talks between a U.S. envoy and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Speaking to reporters in a telephone news briefing, Peskov referenced comments from Putin on Thursday in which he expressed qualified support for a U.S. ceasefire proposal to halt Russia's war with Ukraine for 30 days but said some questions needed to be answered. Peskov said that while much remains to be done, Putin 'expressed solidarity with [U.S. President Donald] Trump's position.' He said Putin held late-night talks Thursday with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, during which Putin 'conveyed information and additional signals to President Trump.' The Kremlin spokesman said both sides agreed Putin and Trump should speak, adding that the timing of the conversation would be agreed upon once Witkoff had conveyed the new information to Trump. Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website Friday morning that 'there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.' He also said he had 'strongly requested' that Putin spare the lives of 'thousands' of Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk border region who were 'completely surrounded' by the Russian military. 'This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II,' Trump wrote on social media. Later Friday, Putin told the National Security Council in Moscow that if the Ukrainian troops laid down their arms and surrendered, they would not be killed. Ukraine's military, however, denied that its forces in Kursk were surrounded by Moscow's troops and said reports to that effect were Russian manipulation. In his nightly address to his nation Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Putin's comments to Witkoff were 'very manipulative,' and that he thought Putin's qualified support for the U.S. plan was an effort to lay the groundwork for rejecting it. 'He is in fact preparing a rejection at present, because Putin is, of course, scared to tell President Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians,' Zelenskyy said. He noted Ukraine had accepted the U.S. proposal and was ready to organize monitoring and verification. 'We are not setting conditions that complicate the process; Russia is,' Zelenskyy said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Friday that no discussions between Trump and Putin had been scheduled, but she said that could change. She called the talks in Moscow on Thursday 'a productive day for the United States of America and for the world in terms of peace.' On Thursday at the White House, ahead of talks with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump said it would be 'very disappointing' if Russia ended up rejecting U.S. efforts to end the fighting. Meanwhile, Britain's Defense Ministry said Friday that Russia's prioritization of funding its war with Ukraine had likely resulted in insufficient funding for average Russians' health care, leading to shortages of medical staff and equipment. In its Defense Intelligence report, the ministry said Russia reportedly closed at least 160 hospitals in 2024, including 18 maternity facilities and at least 10 children's clinics. The report said Russia's small towns and villages had been particularly affected. The Defense Ministry said the 500,000 casualties Russia has sustained in the war in Ukraine most certainly continue to put a strain on all levels of care in the Russian military medical system.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWME4FTvKrXkyp	2025-03-15T17:10:19-07:00	
We Can’t Fix International Organizations Like The WTO: Abolish Th...	In a recent Springer publication, Marcos Falcone proposed 'Bringing the Austrian School into the 21st century' by embracing existing international institutions as a means of maximizing global liberty. Acknowledging that they are often justly criticized for being bureaucratic and ineffective, Falcone argues that they have historically contributed to economic growth and democratization and that all that is needed are two key reforms to strengthen freedom within the current international order: strict enforcement of the subsidiarity principle (where governance decisions occur at the most local level possible) and the acceptance of secession as a legitimate political process. The article traces the theoretical justification for these reforms through the works of prominent Austrian economists, such as Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Murray Rothbard. Falcone highlights how subsidiarity, when applied weakly (e.g., the European Union’s version), allows for overreach by centralized authorities and argues that a stricter application would ensure that power remains local, preventing unnecessary bureaucratic growth and inefficiency. Likewise, secession is framed as an extension of self-determination, enabling political communities to align more closely with their preferences. Falcone uses Switzerland and the early United States as models for balancing subsidiarity and secession, arguing that their federal structures successfully limited centralized power while preserving diversity. Ultimately, Falcone argues that enforcing subsidiarity and embracing secession would strengthen rather than weaken international institutions by making them more accountable, flexible, and limited in scope. The reforms would foster competition between governments, improving policies and enhancing freedom. While it should be clear that Falcone is right in citing Rothbard as a champion of secession as essential for individual liberty, he did so because he saw decentralization as a step toward full privatization of governance, not the better working of supranational institutions. A full Rothbardian critique would take issue with several fundamental premises of Falcone’s argument. The Flaws in Falcone’s Premises From a strict anarcho-capitalist and voluntarist perspective, the idea of 'improving' international organizations rather than abolishing them is entirely misguided, as these organizations are inherently coercive, funded through taxation (theft), and serve the interests of political elites rather than individuals. What is desired is advancing true liberty, not advocating for a 'better' form of statism. 1. International Organizations as Illegitimate Entities In Nations by Consent, Rothbard rejects the idea that states (or international organizations) should have any monopoly over governance. Instead, he argues for a world of decentralized, voluntary associations without coercive taxation or state control. Falcone assumes that international institutions should be reformed to function more efficiently, but Rothbard would insist that they should be eliminated entirely, as they are unnatural constructs that exist solely to serve political elites, not individuals. 2. Subsidiarity is Insufficient – Only Privatization Ensures Freedom The article argues that strict subsidiarity (where decision-making is pushed to the lowest level) is a means of increasing liberty. However, Rothbard would reject subsidiarity as an incomplete solution because it still assumes the existence of government power at any level. Rothbard’s anarcho-capitalist vision goes beyond subsidiarity—he would argue that all governance functions should be privatized. Under subsidiarity, a local government may impose restrictive economic policies or violate property rights just as a national government would. Size of government is not the issue—its very existence is. Instead of subsidiarity, Rothbard would advocate for competing private security agencies, voluntary arbitration, and free-market legal structures. 3. Secession is Good – But Not Enough The article correctly aligns with Rothbard’s strong support for secession as a fundamental right. However, Rothbard would likely push the logic further – secession should not stop at the nation-state level but continue down to the individual level. Rothbard argues that the ultimate goal of secession is not just breaking states into smaller states but eliminating the state entirely. In The Ethics of Liberty, he argues that secession is a form of voluntary association: If a neighborhood, city, or even a single person wants to secede, they should be allowed to do so. The article still envisions nation-states as inevitable, but Rothbard would argue that the real aim should be the disintegration of the state into purely voluntary associations. 4. No Need for 'Stronger' International Organizations The article assumes that international organizations could strengthen if they limit their scope and embrace secession. A Rothbardian critique would be that international organizations should not be strengthened at all – they should be abolished. Organizations like the UN, EU, and WTO exist only because of state coercion. Without taxation and political power, they would collapse. Rothbard would likely argue that instead of 'strengthening' them, they should be replaced with voluntary networks of trade, arbitration, and private defense associations. The author treats international organizations as a given, but Rothbard would say they are artificial constructs that serve political elites, not free individuals. 5. The Market, Not Governments, Should Facilitate Trade and Cooperation The article acknowledges that international trade has lifted billions out of poverty, but it credits international institutions like the WTO and NAFTA for facilitating this trade. Rothbard would argue that free markets, not governments or bureaucracies, are responsible for economic progress. Trade happens despite institutions like the WTO, not because of them. Governments create tariffs, regulations, and barriers that hinder free exchange. A Rothbardian view would reject managed trade agreements and instead support true free trade, meaning unilateral elimination of all trade barriers without reliance on international treaties. Conclusion: Falcone’s 'Better Statism' is Inadequate to the Austrian School’s Goals While the article presents a vision for greater decentralization, Rothbard would find its underlying premise flawed: namely, that the current system can or should be improved within existing international structures. Instead, a Rothbardian critique would advocate for: Abolition of international organizations rather than their reform. Privatization over subsidiarity – decentralization is good, but private governance is the real goal. Radical secession – not just for states, but for individuals and voluntary communities. Free trade through voluntary association, not international agreements. Elimination of all coercive government entities in favor of private legal and defense systems. Ultimately, from a Rothbardian perspective, the best way to maximize liberty is not through better governance but through the abolition of the state altogether. While Falcone’s article takes steps in the right direction by supporting subsidiarity and secession, it does not go far enough in fully dismantling state power and replacing it with a system based purely on individual consent and voluntary association. In this sense, Falcone’s effort is inadequate to the needs of 'Bringing the Austrian School into the 21st Century' since the Austrian school – at least in its Rothbardian form – does not seek 'better statism' but actual liberty.

Ukraine’s President Signs Law To Facilitate Purchase Of Belene Nu...	The two part-built units at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant could be finished with unused equipment from Bulgaria's discontinued Belene nuclear power plant project, with President Volodymyr Zelensky signing into law the legal framework for the acquisition. Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, backed the plan last month, with the presidential signature required to put it into law. Nuclear power plant operator Energoatom said the law establishes the legal framework and gives approval for negotiations with Bulgaria for the acquisition of the equipment. The back-story Khmelnitsky's first reactor was connected to the grid in 1987, but work on three other reactors was halted in 1990, at a time when unit 3 was about 80% complete and unit 4 about 25%. Work on the second reactor restarted and it was connected to the grid in 2004, but units 3 and 4 remain uncompleted. The Belene project in northern Bulgaria was for the construction of two 1000 MWe units, using Russian VVER-1000 designs. Preliminary site works began in 2008, and contracts for components including large forgings and I&C systems were signed with suppliers, but the project was stymied by financing problems. Equipment for the nuclear island had been paid for and was manufactured and delivered in 2017 and has since been kept in storage - the then government formally ended plans for the project in 2023. Since then there have been talks about Ukraine purchasing the unused Belene equipment in what International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi called an 'interesting project' with its 'efficient' idea of one interrupted construction project integrating technology from a discontinued project. The agency has said that it will help throughout the project to ensure safety standards are assured at all times. The Bulgarian parliament has already given approval for negotiations about the sale of the equipment to Ukraine, with the minimum aim of recouping the reported EUR600 million (USD622 million) paid for the equipment. In May last year, at the request of the Bulgarian and Ukrainian governments, a US technical team joined experts from the two countries to conduct a technical assessment of the VVER equipment stored at Belene. Westinghouse has also confirmed it will be able to supply fuel for the completed Khmelnitsky units. Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said, after the parliamentary vote giving the go-ahead in February: 'The completion of the Khmelnitsky NPP is a strategic task for Ukraine. Nuclear energy is the basis of our energy system, and to a large extent it is thanks to it that we have light and heat, despite constant attacks.' He also stressed that Ukraine, which is currently at war with Russia, would not see any Russian involvement in the project - 'everything will be implemented by Ukrainian and American companies'. He added that completion of the units will be 'many times' faster and cheaper than construction from scratch. Ukraine has 15 reactors, capable of generating half its electricity, at four existing nuclear power plants, including the six-unit Zaporizhzhia plant which has been under Russian military control since early March 2022. The country has plans for at least nine Westinghouse AP1000 units, including two new ones planned at Khmelnitsky and others at the Rivne and South Ukraine plants. The two completed units could provide more than 2 GW of capacity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMOHzuf4i5kwW	2025-03-15T17:06:15-07:00	
Crypto And The Far Right – OpEd	Back in 2021, Donald Trump called cryptocurrency 'a disaster waiting to happen' and a 'scam.' Takes one to know one, right? As he got closer to regaining the White House, however, Trump changed his mind about this 'scam,' probably as a result of the millions of dollars that flowed into his campaign coffers from industry donors. To the delight of these donors, Trump promised to make the United States the cryptocurrency capital of the world. He also talked about creating a strategic reserve of Bitcoin. After he won the election, Trump received over $11 million in contributions to his inaugural committee from the crypto industry. It’s a hallmark of pyramid scams that only the people at the top reap the benefits, and Trump has put himself at the very apex of the ziggurat in order to rake in millions for his posse and for himself. Consider the saga of $TRUMP. Three days before his inauguration, the $TRUMP meme coin debuted. Meme coins are usually based on an Internet meme and are 'typically characterized by their volatile nature.' Well, that sounds like a good fit for Trump! Indeed, after he promoted the coin on his social media accounts, its value surged astronomically. Some of the biggest winners in this naked money grab were the firms that launched the coin and profited from the transaction fees, which netted them as much as $100 million in the first two weeks. One of those firms was CIC Digital, which is owned by…Trump himself. Like all financial operations characterized by irrational exuberance, the value of $TRUMP soon plummeted. Indeed, over 800,000 investor accounts lost a total of $2 billion. Of course, they’re not the only Trump supporters who are suffering from buyer’s remorse. Even the stock market, which initially cheered Trump’s election, is having a serious hangover, a swing in mood not very different from $TRUMP’s trajectory. $TRUMP’s deep dive notwithstanding—or perhaps because of the success of this scam—crypto remains an essential part of Trump’s economic plans. And Trump is not the only far-right leader who has dabbled in scamming the population with crypto. Argentina’s Javier Milei is now dealing with the aftermath of a corruption scandal associated with $LIBRA, a meme coin he initially supported and which left 10,000 investors over $250 million poorer. El Salvador is still reeling from Nayib Bukele’s crypto obsession, which cost his country $60 million when Bitcoin tanked a couple years ago—not to mention all the Salvadoran energy and natural resources that Bitcoin mining has absorbed. Two years ago, I explained how cryptocurrencies function like pyramid scams. Last year, I discussed the environmental consequences of crypto. Now I want to dig a little deeper into the politics of crypto: how Trump and his far-right allies are using these digital currencies as a strategy to rig the rules of the game in their favor. The Mechanisms of Theft To understand how crypto scams work, you need to know about 'sniping' and 'rug-pulling.' When a new crypto product is launched, whether it’s a meme coin or a non-fungible token, a select group of speculators place a big buy to push the value higher. If enough of these 'snipers' exit at the same time, the value drops, providing the snipers with short-term profits and leaving a lot of other investors holding the (empty) bag. Of course, it helps to know in advance about a new product launch so that you can line up your bots and your AI to execute high-volume and high-speed trades—and your coordinated exit from the stage. In another context, you might call this 'insider trading.' The orchestrated sale of the crypto product is known as the 'rug pull.' It can be sudden, as was the case with $TRUMP. Or it can take place over a longer period of time in what used to be known as the 'long con.' The rug pull sometimes relies on the services of a celebrity. Let’s take a brief look at the case of Javier Milei in Argentina to understand how this works. Enter Milei Argentine President Javier Milei is, to say the least, a heterodox economist. He pledged to cut government spending as a way of reining in inflation. He fired 30,000 government workers, eliminated government subsidies, and halted many public works projects. No surprise that Milei and his infamous chainsaw served as the inspiration for Musk and DOGE. Inflation in Argentina has indeed fallen, from nearly 300 percent to around 85 percent in January. But the costs have been immense to the poor. More than half of Argentines now live below the poverty line, and they are dealing with increased costs for food and basic services. The economy has contracted as a not-very-surprising result of Milei’s chainsaw approach to government. Among his many economic enthusiasms, Milei has relentlessly attacked the country’s central bank and advocated for the adoption of the U.S. dollar as the national currency. During his first year in office, he didn’t put crypto at the heart of his economic platform. But his efforts to displace the central bank has been accompanied by a push to lift restrictions on currency exchange, which would give cryptocurrencies a big boost. Argentinians are already leading adopters of crypto, largely as a hedge against the volatility of the Argentine peso (frankly, they might as well buy lottery tickets or play slots at the casino). But that’s changing as a result of the $LIBRA scandal. At the instigation of several fast-talking meme coin boosters, Milei endorsed $LIBRA when it was released on Valentine’s Day this year. But the value of the meme coin tanked within mere hours as top investors pulled the rug out from under it. As 'Cryptogate' spread, Milei scrambled to deny any connection to the fiasco. But that was hard to do given the evidence of several tweets showing Milei, with his trademark glower and two thumbs up, posing with those boosters, including an American named Hayden Davis. Davis runs Kelsier Ventures, which was part of the sniping and rug-pulling around $MELANIA, the spousal counterpart to $TRUMP, which followed a similar trajectory of jumping high off the diving board and then plunging into the empty pool below. Davis did the same thing with $LIBRA, making off with around $100 million. He has promised to refund some of that money to the people who lost big. Don’t hold your breath. 'This is an insider’s game,' Davis has said about these meme coins. 'This is like an unregulated casino.' As for Milei, the real purpose of his economic program has been starkly revealed by this scandal: a transfer of money from the poor to the rich. His popularity was already on a downward trajectory in early February before the scandal, with 53 percent of the population disapproving of his policies (compared to 43 percent in favor). Cryptogate could be an anchor that pulls Milei down to the bottom of the sea. Trump Also Goes Big It’s no accident that the administration’s government-cutting initiative, DOGE, shares a name with a leading cryptocurrency. Cutting government oversight, eliminating regulations, and empowering the already-powerful private sector all benefit the crypto industry. But Trump is not just cutting government—he is putting his own people into positions of power. That includes right-wing financier David Sacks, who’s in charge of both crypto and AI in the Trump administration. Sacks comes out of the same political milieu as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel (with whom he led PayPal). As with so many of Trump’s appointees, the opportunities for corruption abound. As MSNBC reported at the end of last year, 'Sacks launched an artificial intelligence company called Glue this year and is known to be a major investor in cryptocurrencies, which would seem likely to create some conflicts of interest if he’s steering the administration’s AI and crypto policies.' Trump is also staffing the Securities and Exchange Commission with crypto loyalists who have already begun to deconstruct the oversight of the crypto sector. As The New York Times notes: Federal officials declared that so-called memecoins would not be subject to strict oversight. A series of investigations into major cryptocurrency firms were halted. And the Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to pause a fraud case against a top crypto entrepreneur. Just over a month since President Trump’s inauguration, U.S. regulators have almost entirely dismantled a yearslong government crackdown on the crypto industry, a volatile sector rife with fraud, scams and theft. Meme coins, of course, are the $TRUMP and $MELANIA scams that have already bilked thousands of investors. The reduction of oversight on crypto, meanwhile, is likely to increase the pool of victims. Burwick Law is the firm trying to claw back money for those who were scammed by $HAWK (promoted by influencer Haliey Welch) and also 200 clients from various countries who lost money in the $LIBRA scandal. Dubbed the 'ambulance chaser of crypto,' Max Burwick is going to face a deregulatory headwind coming from the Trump administration. But the biggest crypto project of the Trump administration is its crypto strategic reserve, an idea promoted hard by the crypto industry. It’s the culmination of the right-wing’s push for U.S. businesses to invest in crypto and also state governments buy up the currency. A strategic reserve of crypto makes no sense. Such reserves are meant for valuable assets like oil and gold. Why doesn’t Trump consider a strategic reserve of Amway products or Tupperware? For the time being, the two reserves (one for Bitcoin, the second for other digital assets) will contain only crypto seized in criminal or civil forfeitures. The crypto industry was disappointed that Trump didn’t mandate federal purchases of the currencies. But that will probably happen in the future. The new initiative calls on federal agencies to come up with strategies to buy more Bitcoin. And there’s now a bill in Congress calling on the government to buy a million Bitcoin. So, basically, such a reserve is just a gift to all the crypto loyalists who have supported Trump. Let’s call it what it is: a first step toward state capture by crypto oligarchs. Why Does the Far Right Love Crypto? Crypto appeals to the far right for several reasons. It promises to undermine the state’s central authority. It offers a degree of anonymity, which can facilitate tax evasion, asset parking overseas, and plain old money-laundering. And its volatility allows for the profiteering that sometimes goes by the name of entrepreneurialism. Meanwhile, for extremist organizations that need to stay under the radar to evade surveillance, crypto is the monetary equivalent of an encrypted messaging service. According to the Anti-Defamation League, '15 white supremacist and antisemitic groups and individuals, as well as their donors, that collectively moved $142,546 worth of cryptocurrency to and/or from 22 different cryptocurrency service providers.' The European far right is also beginning to trade in these currencies. In countries with conventional governance—that is, not lunatics like Trump and locos like Milei—crypto functions as a right-wing weapon against the state. But when the inmates take over the asylum, the currency becomes a way of consolidating power in the hands of oligarchs. Meme coins like $TRUMP and $LIBRA are just the side hustles by opportunists who want some of the crumbs that fall off the oligarchs’ tables. The real money is in the 'legitimate' trade in crypto, the speculation in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. This is where far-right politicians create 'positive synergies' between government deregulation on one side and campaign contributions on the other. This institutional corruption is at the center of the Trump/Milei enterprise: the wholesale looting of the public sector and the grotesque enrichment of the already rich.

Mass Protests Grip Belgrade As Serbia’s Vučić Faces Pressure From...	By Laurent Geslin (EurActiv) -- Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Belgrade today as a wave of demonstrations against Serbia’s powerful president, Aleksandar Vučić, enters its fourth month. This demonstration could be Serbia's largest since the fall of Slobodan Milošević in October 2000. At least, that's what the columns of students and Serbian citizens who have been converging on Belgrade from across the country over the past few days are hoping. In the heart of the Serbian capital, a hundred tractors requisitioned by the regime were parked around the Presidential Palace on Friday, creating the appearance of an improvised fortress, as RFI reported. Nearby, a city park has already been occupied for several days by a mix of hooded toughs claiming to be students – who say they oppose the months-long blockade of Serbian universities by protesters – and by several dozen veterans of the Yugoslav wars. 'The government may attempt to unleash its most violent supporters against the protesters,' Vuk Vuksanović, an analyst at the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, told Euractiv. 'But any such move would only fuel the mobilisation, especially since it is unclear whether the police and military are still fully under the control of the authorities.' In an effort to secure the loyalty of the country’s security forces, the Serbian government passed an abrupt pay hike for Interior Ministry employees on Thursday. The authoritarian Vučić, who has held power in Serbia since 2014, has also intensified his threats, stating on 11 March in an interview with Serbia’s national broadcaster RTS that 'those who commit acts of violence will end up behind bars'. These warnings, however, have done little to deter the months-long student protests that have been demanding transparency about the deadly roof collapse at the recently renovated railway station in Novi Sad, which killed 15 people on 1 November. What began in the northern Serbian city quickly spread nationwide, with protesters also denouncing widespread government corruption.'Aleksandar Vučić spreads fake news on social media, claiming that students are attacking the police, which is obviously false,' Aleksa Nikolić, a student at the University of Novi Sad, told Euractiv. 'He is doing everything to stir up tensions, divide the population, and provoke clashes – but it is up to us to decide when this movement will end.' In a bid to quell public anger, the Serbian president dismissed his prime minister, Miloš Vučević, in late January after a student was beaten by members of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). Since then, Vučić has struggled to regain control, facing a movement without a clearly identified leader that has deliberately distanced itself from major opposition parties. 'The key question now is how to channel this anger into political action,' the Belgrade-based novelist and philosopher Igor Štiks told Euractiv. 'The only option currently on the table is the formation of a transitional technical government, whose main task would be to organise free elections.' Vučić’s international backers Despite mounting street opposition, Vučić continues to enjoy tacit support from major European capitals that have business interests in Serbia, including Berlin and Paris, as well as from EU institutions – although the Socialists and Democrats group (SD) in the European Parliament has echoed the student demands. The Serbian president also enjoys the help of his American counterpart, Donald Trump, who this week did not hesitate to send his eldest son, Donald Jr., to Belgrade. The visit followed last year’s agreement with an investment firm run by Jared Kushner – Trump's son-in-law – which plans to build a hotel on the site of the former Yugoslav People’s Army headquarters, damaged during the 1999 NATO bombing of Belgrade. Vučić can also take pride in his close ties with Moscow, as Belgrade has never enforced EU sanctions against Russia, despite Serbia holding official EU candidate status since 2012. Just days ago, Vučić stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin supported 'the legitimate authorities of Serbia'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMCAt0ZsVkNCG	2025-03-15T17:00:40-07:00	
South Sudan: Opposition Leaders, Others, Detained, Says HRW	South Sudanese authorities have arrested at least 22 political and military personnel in the wake of violent clashes that started in mid-February 2025 between government and armed groups in Upper Nile, Human Rights Watch said. These recent developments have plunged the country into political crisis.'The lack of transparency and legitimate concerns about the legality of the arrests and detention of opposition leaders and others fuel instability in an already fragile security context,' said Nyagoah Tut Pur, South Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'Authorities should immediately reveal the fate and whereabouts of detainees and ensure their due process rights, including by bringing them before a properly constituted and impartial court.' The people arrested since March 4, are aligned with First Vice President Riek Machar, head of the Sudan People’s Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA-IO). The timing of these detentions coincides with a political crisis in Nasir, Upper Nile, where clashes between government forces and armed youth militia, also known as the White Army, displaced thousands of civilians. The area is a stronghold for supporters of Machar who has long been in opposition to President Kiir. The South Sudanese government should immediately end the enforced disappearance or incommunicado detention of everyone linked to the opposition who has been detained since the first week of March and ensure full and strict respect for their due process rights, Human Rights Watch said. On March 4, military authorities arrested and detained Lieutenant General Gabriel Duop Lam, deputy chief of staff of the unified army structures, who also serves as acting chief of Staff for SPLA-IO. Officials also disarmed and detained five of his bodyguards, a credible source said. The whereabouts of the six men is unknown. The detention or other deprivation of liberty of an individual, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the detention or to reveal the fate or whereabouts of the person deprived of their liberty, constitutes an enforced disappearance under international law, a crime subject to an absolute prohibition in all circumstances. On March 5, at 2 a.m., armed National Security Service (NSS) officers took Puot Kang Chol, the petroleum minister, from his house in Juba, along with at least seven others, without explanation and drove them away, a credible witness said. The seven include: a friend, Camilo Gatmach; bodyguards Nelson Malou, Kun Tut, Peter Magong; and three family members Koang Puk, Biluny Puk, and Buay Thiechuong. The NSS officers had initially arrested Chol with one of his bodyguards at around 11 p.m. on March 4 but brought him back, a credible witness said. The eight men were initially held at the NSS Riverside (Operations) facility then transferred to the NSS headquarters, also known as Blue House, credible sources say. On March 6, the NSS arrested Thomas Jal Thomas, deputy inspector general of the police, and James Duop Gatleak, his deputy, in their offices and took them to the Riverside detention site but released them after a few hours, according to a credible source. That same day, 11 armed NSS officers took Stephen Par Kuol, the peacebuilding minister, from his office along with three staff members, a witness said. They bundled them into two Landcruiser pickup trucks with other armed officers and drove away. The four men were released on early morning of March 7. Also on March 6, NSS officers arrested and detained Mam Pal Dhuor, a member of SPLA-IO, at Juba International Airport as he attempted to board a flight to Kampala, a credible source said. Meanwhile the situation in Nasir deteriorated. On March 7, armed men attacked a UN helicopter on a mission to rescue wounded soldiers in Nasir, killing a crew member and injuring two others. President Kiir also announced that a well-known army general, Majur Dak along with 27 other soldiers who were to be evacuated, were also killed during the attack. The same day, the army issued a circular, seen by Human Rights Watch, deploying forces in six major road junctions leading to and from the capital, Juba. Heavy deployment at the residence of Riek Machar in the evenings is apparently ongoing. Puok Both Baluang, the spokesperson for Riek Machar, told Human Rights Watch that as of March 10 they knew of 22 men affiliated with the SPLA-IO – including party members, staff, family, and bodyguards – detained by NSS and Military Intelligence, many of whose fate or whereabouts is unknown. Media reported that Gatwech Lam Puoch, an SPLA-IO member of parliament for Nasir county, was arrested on March 11 and is detained at the Blue House. Spokespeople for the NSS and the army did not respond to requests for comment. At a news conference on March 5, Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth, said that, 'If anybody is arrested, it is for a reason.' And on March 8, the NSS spokesperson announced that it had arrested people with 'verified links to the situation in Nasir, Ulang, and surrounding areas' following extensive 'intelligence' and promised more arrests. The National Security Service operates with limited legal and judicial oversight and de facto impunity. The service is responsible for enforced disappearances as well as the incommunicado detention and torture and ill-treatment of detainees. It has also unlawfully conducted surveillance. The government should revise the definition of 'crimes against the state' and remove the security service authority to arrest and detain people, limit its authority for search, seizure, and surveillance, and bring it in line with the constitution and international human rights standards, Human Rights Watch said. The government has in the past used trumped up charges of crimes against the state such as treason, publishing false information, and insulting the president, to restrict freedom of expression, assembly and association, such as peaceful exercise of political opposition, or public criticism of state policy and actions. Prosecutions and trials have been marred by human rights abuses and political interference. The government should immediately make public the grounds for and evidence to justify the recent arrests. All detainees should immediately be brought before an independent judge to scrutinize the legality of the arrests, and to determine if they should be released or if they can continue to be lawfully detained. The international community, including the United Nations, the African Union, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) should press the South Sudanese authorities to uphold human rights, including the immediate end to any and all enforced disappearance and bringing the detainees before a court, Human Rights Watch said. 'South Sudanese authorities should cease arbitrary detention of opposition members and other actions that amount to harassment and not use the security institutions as a tool of oppression,' Pur said. 'International and regional actors like the African Union should insist that authorities uphold human rights obligations as they seek to de-escalate political tensions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMLo9nDtGbizL	2025-03-15T16:57:24-07:00	
ASEAN’s Response To Trump 2.0: An Analysis Of Problems And Challe...	The return of Donald Trump to the White House in 2025 presents a complex geopolitical challenge for the Association of Asian Southeast Nations (ASEAN). Trump’s previous tenure demonstrated a clear departure from multilateralism, a prioritization of bilateral transactions, and an unpredictable engagement with global allies. ASEAN, a bloc reliant on diplomacy, economic integration, and strategic neutrality, now finds itself at a critical juncture. Trump likely brings resurgence economic uncertainty, security dilemmas and a potential erosion of ASEAN’s diplomatic unity. This essay presents a deeper analysis of the problems ASEAN faces and challenges it must navigate for Trump 2.0. Trump’s first presidency (2017-2021) reshaped global diplomatic norms, retreating from multilateral institutions and shifting U.S. engagement toward a transactional interest-based approach. Unlike Biden’s administration, which sought to rebuild alliances, Trump 2.0 could see ASEAN further marginalized in favor of individual, deal-driven engagements. The erosion of ASEAN’s collective leverage weakens its ability to negotiate favorable terms with the U.S, ultimately creating internal strategic divisions and dilemmas among its member states. If Trump dismisses ASEAN-centric frameworks such as the ASEAN-U.S. Summit and the East Asia Summit bloc, regional influence may wane, making it vulnerable to external pressures from both Washington and Beijing. Economic ramifications are among the most pressing concerns. Trump’s initial tenure was marked by an aggressive trade war with China, severely disrupting global supply chains and creating economic ripples throughout Southeast Asia. The potential for renewed economic hostilities in 2025 poses a threat to ASEAN’s economic stability, which is deeply intertwined with both the U.S. and Chinese markets. While ASEAN sought to mitigate these risks through agreements such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a Trump-led U.S. could impose new trade barriers or renegotiate deals favoring American interests, leaving ASEAN economies susceptible to external economic shocks. Moreover, Trump’s preference for bilateral over multilateral trade deals undermines ASEAN’s negotiating power, potentially isolating smaller economies and exposing them to predatory economic practices. Security in the Indo-Pacific is another significant challenge. Trump’s previous presidency displayed a wavering commitment to regional security frameworks, which, if repeated, could leave ASEAN member states exposed to China’s increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. The Biden administration reinforced freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) and reaffirmed support for ASEAN’s territorial claims, but Trump’s return deprioritize might these efforts favor in striking of trade or investment deals with Beijing. If the U.S. scales back its military presence, China could seize the opportunity to escalate its militarization of disputed waters, further pressuring ASEAN claimants such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The lack of a strong U.S deterrence could force ASEAN states into strategic difficult recalibrations with some potentially yielding to Chinese influence to ensure economic and security guarantees. Moreover, ASEAN’s ability to maintain autonomy is strategic U.S.; amid tensions, China will be tested severely. Trump’s with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) comprising the U.S. Japan, India, and Australia were inconsistent during his first term. A second Trump presidency could either revive an aggressive Indo-Pacific posture or result in further disengagement, depending on his administration’s priorities. Both scenarios present challenges: an intensified Indo-Pacific strategy could pressure ASEAN states to choose between aligning with the U.S. and maintaining neutrality, while a disengaged Trump administration could leave ASEAN diplomatically stranded, exposing it to Beijing’s influence. The principle of ASEAN neutrality, long regarded as stabilizing a force in the region, may come under increasing strain as the bloc struggles to navigate shifting geopolitical dynamics. Institutional limitations within ASEAN also pose challenges in responding to a changing U. S foreign policy landscape. The bloc’s consensus-based decision-making model, while promoting unity, often slows responses to geopolitical crises. Trump’s preference for direct bilateral negotiations could widen divisions within ASEAN, particularly between states aligned more closely with U.S. interests (such as Singapore and the Philippines) and those economically dependent on China (such as Cambodia and Laos). A lack of ASEAN-coordinated response would weaken its influence in Washington, reducing its ability to shape U. S. policies that affect the region. Political ramifications are also a significant challenge for ASEAN. During Trump's first term, there was a noticeable reluctance to prioritize democratic norms and human rights, with a greater emphasis on economic and security-based transactions. If this trend persists, ASEAN leaders grappling with internal legitimacy issues—like Myanmar’s junta or Thailand’s military-backed government—may experience reduced scrutiny from Washington. Conversely, democracies like Indonesia, which value strong relations with the U. S based on governance and human rights, could see their ties strained. This disparity may further fragment ASEAN’s internal cohesion as different member states navigate Trump’s foreign policy priorities through diverging strategies. Despite these hurdles, ASEAN has opportunities to counterbalance the uncertainty of a Trump 2.0 Presidency. Strengthening intra-regional economic cooperation through RCEP and fostering deeper trade ties with the European Union could help Japan and India reduce their overreliance on U.S. markets. ASEAN can strengthen its defense initiatives through the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus), allowing for a degree of stability that is independent of U.S. military engagement. Engaging China strategically while maintaining ASEAN’s collective stance in territorial disputes will be crucial in ensuring that regional sovereignty is not undermined. Ultimately, ASEAN’s response to Trump 2.0 must be characterized by adaptability, unity, and strategic foresight. The bloc faces formidable challenges, including economic uncertainty, instability, security, and the erosion of multilateral diplomatic engagement. The primary obstacle remains ASEAN’s cohesion—without a unified strategy, individual states may be forced into difficult concessions that undermine regional stability. Trump’s unpredictable approach to foreign policy adds a layer of complexity, making it imperative for ASEAN to bolster its resilience through diversified partnerships and strengthened internal coordination. If ASEAN fails to shape its regional strategies proactively, it risks being sidelined in an increasingly volatile Indo-Pacific order. The coming years will test the bloc’s ability to navigate one of its most complex diplomatic landscapes to date, demanding a recalibrated and pragmatic approach to ensure its continued relevance and stability.

Petrobras Confirms ‘High Productivity’ Of Discovered Well In Colo...	By Bruno de Freitas Moura Petrobras announced this week that formation tests on the Sirius-2 well, discovered last year in Colombia’s deep waters, confirmed 'good productivity.' Sirius-2 is situated in the Guajira Basin of the Caribbean Sea, 31 kilometers off the coast at a depth of 804 meters. The reservoir lies 76 kilometers from Santa Marta. In addition to confirming good productivity, samples were collected for laboratory analysis. 'The test's preliminary results reinforce the region's gas potential,' the company stated. Petrobras explores and produces oil and gas in Colombia through its subsidiary, Petrobras International Braspetro B.V.—Sucursal Colombia (PIB-COL), in partnership with the state-owned oil company Ecopetrol. The Colombians hold a 55.56 percent stake in the consortium, while Petrobras owns 44.44 percent. When the consortium announced the well's discovery in August, it was named Uchuva. It was later renamed Sirius. Exploratory block In addition to Sirius-2, the companies are also exploring Sirius-1, a nearby well within the same exploration block. 'The consortium will continue assessing the drilling results of the Sirius-1 and Sirius-2 wells, in line with the planning and contractual commitments with the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH),' Petrobras stated. The ANH, affiliated with the Colombian Ministry of Mines and Energy, is the regulatory body for the oil and gas sector in Colombia, similar to the role of Brazil's National Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels Agency (ANP). In this week's statement, Petrobras highlighted that exploration in the Guajira Offshore Basin maritime block (GUA-OFF-0) 'aligns with the company's long-term strategy to replenish oil and gas reserves by exploring new frontiers and forming partnerships, ensuring global energy demand is met during the energy transition.' Giant field The region where the Sirius-2 well is located can be considered part of the equatorial margin, as stated by Petrobras' Director of Exploration and Production, Sylvia Anjos, on December 5, 2024. At that time, the state-owned company announced the discovery of the largest natural gas reservoir in the history of the neighboring country. Despite the large volume, the Brazilian state-owned company declared that production would be directed to the Colombian gas market to meet the country's high demand. Equatorial margin The equatorial margin has gained attention in recent years as a promising new frontier for oil and gas exploration. Recent discoveries off the coasts of Guyana, French Guiana, and Suriname have highlighted the region's significant exploration potential, given its proximity to the equator. In Brazil, the equatorial margin extends from the state of Rio Grande do Norte to the state of Amapá. Petrobras has 16 wells in this new exploratory frontier but only has authorization from the Brazilian Environmental Institute (Ibama) to drill two of them, located off the coast of Rio Grande do Norte. The exploration has faced criticism from environmentalists, who are concerned about potential environmental damage. Ibama has denied licenses for other areas, such as the mouth of the Amazon Basin. Petrobras has requested a reconsideration from the institute, which is linked to the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change and is currently awaiting a decision. Petrobras emphasizes that extracting oil from the equatorial margin is a strategic decision to reduce the country’s reliance on oil imports. Petrobras in the world The Brazilian state-owned company's operations abroad aim to secure sources that will strengthen its oil and gas reserves. Less than a month ago, Director Sylvia Anjos highlighted the need to acquire oil fields in African countries, particularly in Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. Petrobras also holds three exploration blocks in São Tomé and Príncipe, located off the west coast of Africa. In Argentina, through its subsidiary Petrobras Operaciones S.A., the company holds a 33.6 percent stake in the Neuquén River production asset. In Bolivia, Petrobras primarily produces gas from the San Alberto and San Antonio fields, holding a 35 percent stake in each of these service contracts, which are mainly focused on supplying gas to Brazil and Bolivia. In the United States, Petrobras operates in deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico, with a 20 percent stake held by Petrobras America Inc. The company is part of the MPGoM joint venture with Murphy Exploration & Production Company.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMIN3fZ3Joimp	2025-03-15T16:52:09-07:00	
Trump Calls For Safety Of Surrounded Ukrainian Troops In Kursk Re...	U.S. President Donald Trump announced that his administration has held 'productive discussions' with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which he urged the safety of Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrounded in Russia's Kursk region. In a March 14 post on Truth Social, Trump stated: 'At this moment, thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are completely surrounded by the Russian army and are in a very bad and vulnerable position. I have strongly urged President Putin to spare their lives. It would be a terrible massacre, the likes of which hasn't been seen since World War II. God bless them all.' However, he did not provide specific evidence. Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a meeting with permanent members of the Security Council, emphasized that Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, if they lay down their arms and surrender, will have their lives and dignified treatment guaranteed in accordance with international law and Russian Federation laws. The Russian President noted that the Russian side approaches Trump's appeal with understanding, considering the humanitarian aspects concerning Ukrainian servicemen. However, he stressed that their crimes against civilians are classified as terrorism. Putin also stated that foreign mercenaries are not subject to the provisions of the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war. Additionally, the Russian president mentioned that the Trump administration is taking steps to restore Russian-American relations, which had deteriorated under the previous U.S. administration. He emphasized that this process is complex, but there have already been phone conversations between the two countries' leaders, communications between foreign ministers, as well as a meeting between Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov and his American counterpart. On March 13, Putin stated that Russia is ready to consider the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, provided that Ukraine halts mobilization, military preparations, and foreign aid supplies. He also claimed significant advances in the Kursk region, stating that the ceasefire would benefit Ukraine. On March 12, Moscow reported recapturing over 86% of previously occupied territories in the region, including the strategic city of Sudzha, initially seized by Ukrainian forces during the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Putin noted that in the event of a complete physical encirclement, Ukrainian soldiers would have two choices: surrender or die. However, Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the 'difficult situation' in the region but affirmed that Ukrainian forces would maintain their defense 'as long as it is reasonable and necessary.' Previously, Syrskyi had denied reports of Ukrainian soldiers being encircled in the Kursk region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMDK9wBhb35rc	2025-03-15T16:50:41-07:00	
Patriarch Bartholomew Says 1054 Church Division ‘Not Insurmountab...	By AC Wimmer Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople on Wednesday offered a hopeful historical assessment of the traditional 1054 date for the 'Great Schism' between Rome and Constantinople, suggesting that tensions developed gradually over time and 'are not insurmountable.' 'Of course, problems have accumulated over a thousand years. But we are full of hope that they will be resolved in a few years,' the patriarch emphasized during an audience in Istanbul on March 12 with a pilgrimage group from the German Association of the Holy Land. The honorary head of worldwide Orthodoxy made these comments in the presence of Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch Emeritus Gregory III Laham, reported CNA Deutsch, CNA’s German-language news partner. The pilgrimage preceded the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea held in 325 A.D. Rather than a sudden break in 1054 — the traditional date of the separation between the Orthodox and Catholic churches — Patriarch Bartholomew suggested these tensions gradually strengthened over time. The potential for a historic breakthrough in ecumenical relations has been building for some time. In January, during vespers concluding the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, Pope Francis highlighted the 'providential' timing of Easter falling on the same date in both the Gregorian and Julian calendars this year. 'Let us rediscover the common roots of the faith,' the pontiff urged. 'Let us preserve unity!' Cardinal Kurt Koch, prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Christian Unity, has long supported efforts toward a common Easter date. In 2021, Koch welcomed a suggestion that the year 2025 would be an ideal time to introduce a calendar reform allowing both Eastern and Western Christians to celebrate Easter together. 'It will not be easy to agree on a common Easter date, but it is worth working for it,' Koch stated at the time, adding that the initiative was 'very dear to Pope Francis and also to the Coptic Pope Tawadros.' Calendar considerations The First Council of Nicaea, held in 325, decided that Easter would be celebrated on the first Sunday after the full moon following the beginning of spring, making the earliest possible date March 22 and the latest possible April 25. Today, Orthodox Christians use the Julian calendar to calculate the Easter date instead of the Gregorian calendar, which was introduced in 1582 and is used by most of the world. The Julian calendar calculates a slightly longer year and is currently 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar, resulting in different dates for Easter celebrations most years. One possible obstacle to a universal agreement could be ongoing tensions between different churches. In 2018, the Russian Orthodox Church severed ties to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople after Patriarch Bartholomew confirmed his intention to recognize the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. During a meeting with the International Theological Commission at the Vatican in November 2024, Pope Francis confirmed his intention to travel to Turkey in May 2025 to mark this significant anniversary. 'I plan to go there,' Pope Francis stated, noting that the Council of Nicaea 'constitutes a milestone in the journey of the Church and also of all humanity, because faith in Jesus, the Son of God made flesh for us and for our salvation, was formulated and professed as a light that illuminates the meaning of reality and the destiny of all history.' However, the pope’s health situation may affect the planned pilgrimage to modern-day Turkey, as his ongoing hospitalization has raised questions about his ability to undertake the journey.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMETbWctOpbo2	2025-03-15T16:48:02-07:00	
Sporting Contradictions: Athletes, The Olympics And Climate Chang...	The time has come for arguably the sporting world’s most famous mafia organisation to select its new chief. The various turf-conscious representatives of the International Olympic Committee will be busy with the task of finding a replacement for Thomas Bach when ballots are cast at Costa Navarino, Greece on March 20. Seven candidates have made the list. They show little risk of cleaning the body’s spotty image. Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr.’s candidacy is a lovely reminder of his father, who was himself made IOC president in 1980. That Samaranch was not shy about his fascist sympathies, defending, not infrequently, the rule and legacy of Spain’s dictator Francisco Franco. 'I was with many, many Spaniards with Franco,' he stated at a news conference in 1999. While the father’s sins should not be visited upon the son, the very fact that a bid is being made for the IOC presidency suggests that this apple did not fall so far from the tree. In a flawed effort to influence the candidates and what might be called their vision for the games, over 400 athletes from 90 countries have added their names to a letter urging the candidates to prioritise climate change in their policies. That they think their views make the slightest difference is almost charming. That they pick climate change as the issue suggests they have slumbered in a deep, uninterrupted sleep. The IOC has certainly shown interest in easily gulled athletes in recent years. At points, it has been rather cunning and ruthless in using these unsuspecting sorts to spruce an unrecoverably tarnished brand. The organisation, most notably, trumpeted the role played by some 6,000 sporting individuals in laughable anti-corruption education campaigns during the Paris Olympic Games last year, and the Youth Olympic Games held at Gangwon. The letter itself has also been pushed by athletes who are already in the employ of the IOC apparatus. Sailor and British Olympian Hannah Mills, one of the document’s key proponents, is called, without any sense of irony, an IOC sustainability ambassador. With a sense of wonder, she reflects on the devastation caused by the LA wildfires and how it proved something of an epiphany: 'the time is now to set a course for a safe, bright future.' The letter asks the incoming president 'that over the years and the course of your presidency one issue be above all others: the care of the planet.' The rise in temperatures and extreme weather were 'already disrupting competition schedules, putting iconic venues at risk and affecting the health of athletes and fans.' Rising heat levels had also raised 'real concerns about whether the Summer Games can be held safely in future years, and Winter Games are becoming harder to organise with reliable snow and ice conditions diminishing annually.' A few of the IOC candidates, mindful of the letter’s publicity, reacted on cue. Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan professed being impressed by the 'powerful message from Olympians around the world'. World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe expressed his willingness to meet the signatories to 'share ideas and initiatives'. The letter itself is an exercise in mushy contradiction. The Olympics, pushed by an organisation that runs on the blood of corruption, must count as an environmental and social welfare calamity. Staging them entails disruptive construction, the depletion of resources, the alteration of landscape. Their purpose, far from encouraging good will and the stirrings of the social conscience, lies in a promotion of the relevant city and government often at the expense of the disadvantaged citizenry, a naked, propagandistic display of the regime of the day. The IOC has unashamedly claimed to be a promoter of green policies. In 2021, it committed to reducing its direct and indirect emissions in the order of 30 per cent, and 50 per cent by 2030. It puts much stock in the Olympics Forest project, a shiny enterprise that conceals what has come to be described as 'carbon colonialism', which involves the use of misleading carbon offsets and the exploitation of states in the Global South. Little wonder that this cynical body has been identified as a greenwashing culprit par excellence, a point utterly missed by the letter’s signatories. The 2024 Paris Olympics, described by organisers as 'historic for climate' and 'revolutionary' in nature, proved nothing of the sort. Jules Boykoff, well versed on the politics of the Olympics, preferred a different view, calling the games a 'recycled version of green capitalism that is oblivious in its incrementalism, vague with its methodology and loose with its accountability.' If care of the planet is what these athletes sincerely want, a swift abolition of the Olympics, along with a virtuous cancellation of the IOC, would achieve their goals. At the very least, the games should be dramatically shrunk. Iconic avenues would be spared. The safety of athletes and fans would not be an issue. Why wait for extreme weather to either modify or even do away with the games altogether? Dear incoming IOC president, you can end the whole charade once and for all.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMNxN6At-sKBb	2025-03-15T16:46:11-07:00	
AI Is Greatly Lowering The Integrity And Standards Of A PhD Award...	The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has already heavily impacted the credibility of the PhD or Doctorate of Philosophy. AI has long been used to assist students in undertaking literature searches, but now the technology is fully capable of creating a whole thesis in a matter of a few days. Not only can AI create a thesis, but even the primary research materials, such as interviews can skilfully be created using AI. By using advanced settings, any AI generated data can closely resemble the syntax and idiosyncrasies of target interviewee cohorts. A number of psychology and sociology-based research journal papers have already been withdrawn and/or removed from journals, because it was discovered the data was generated by AI. Such ethical violations have been rising exponentially in the academic world of late. Creating a thesis by AI is an easy option to the old days when internet didn’t exist and almost half the time of a PhD candidate’s working time was looking for and reading articles in libraries. Sometimes students would have to wait months for some obscure article or book can be found in some far-off library and borrowed. The work that once could take a year of more can now be done in a day. Today AI is fully capable of developing a flawless hypothesis, generate a complete literature review, and finally discuss and analyse any date and results to a satisfactory standard to satisfy PhD examiners. As mentioned above, with even the data artificially generated, a whole thesis can be fabricated. A new industry has developed Ethics and integrity are the only gateways that are set up to prevent such fraudulent activity. However, today unfortunately, very little integrity and ethics exist in academia. Previously, PhD candidates had the noble ambition to further their own knowledge in scientific and philosophic domains, and usually ended up in research or teaching roles. The numbers were very low. However, today, the PhD, master of DBA degrees are desired for getting high paying jobs, and gaining a title that would garner them a persona of respect within the community. AI now allows the masses to achieve this. Those who undertake the PhD process with the aim of defrauding it, must find a supervisor, who is willing to take part in the conspiracy. Unfortunately, there are so many willing to do that. The supervisor can hide from the faculty, the fact that the thesis was not created through numbers of drafts, until the final thesis was ready. In this way, a PhD candidate can be presented to examiners without they being wise to the fact the thesis was AI generated. Spotting an AI generated thesis requires some skill. They are generally flawless documents. However, some supervisors know how to counter this with 'implanting' small mistakes and error to remain above this suspicion. The key to exposing any AI generated thesis comes down to the viva, where the candidate will be asked questions. In addition, examiners must delve into a person’s academic background to gauge whether they would be capable of undertaking such research. Creating AI generated thesis is rapidly growing into a lucrative business. If USD 2,000 for a master thesis and USD 15,000 for a PhD thesis are the going rates, then some unscrupulous academics can make a lot of money, and easy money at that. The only extra skill that is needed is mastering AI software in a way to create what is needed for candidates. Don’t be shocked to know that there are some people making big money on this gravy train. The bottom line for society is that the PhD is now becoming almost worthless. Any PhD holder will now become a suspect of being an AI graduate. The same goes for master and DBA graduates. Feeding this fraudulence is the high number of students who demand this service. The most lucrative place to undertake this activity is in institutions where large numbers of foreign students attend. AI will supplement the pockets of those who want to flaunt the system, and make money. AI is already taking over the jobs of journalists, teachers, and any other job that requires knowledge, because AI can replace the need for knowledge. This is a major problem for academia, which until now is not speaking up about this issue. There is complete silence in the halls of learning today. The long-term risks are that future PhD graduates may take on critical jobs where lives depend, thus endangering the community. Meanwhile, there are unscrupulous academics enjoying the AI windfall.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMGLfZrvquG-s	2025-03-15T16:44:18-07:00	
Islamic Extremism In Sri Lanka: A Rising Threat To South Asian Se...	Since the onset of Israel’s war on Hamas, the first incident of Israeli tourists facing terrorist threats abroad occurred in Sri Lanka. The war began on October 7 after Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage. In October, Israel’s National Security Council urged Israelis to leave Sri Lanka’s Arugam Bay area and other beaches in the island’s south and west immediately, citing terrorism threats in the eastern part of Sri Lanka. This announcement from the Israeli Defense Ministry followed a warning from the US embassy in Sri Lanka, which stated it had 'received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations' in eastern Arugam Bay. Eastern Arugam Bay, a hotspot for surfing around 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Colombo by road, is a popular destination for Israeli tourists. The Indian Intelligence Agency had given a tip-off on October 7 that foreigners could be targeted, the local media reported, citing the Acting Inspector General of Police. The Sri Lankan government has now received intelligence reports of attempts to propagate extremist ideologies within the Muslim population in the Eastern Province. Most of such activities have been reported from the Kalmunai area, prompting SIS and military intelligence units to increase monitoring. Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala has confirmed this, highlighting evidence of a breeding ground for Islamic extremism in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake informed Parliament that six arrests were made following intelligence reports about possible attacks on tourists in the Arugam Bay area. The April 2019 Easter attacks highlighted Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to the transnational Islamic Jihadi network. Up to 280 people, including foreigners, were killed in a series of suicide attacks orchestrated by ISIS-Sri Lanka (ISIS-S), which had its roots in Kattankudy, a predominantly Muslim area in the Eastern Province. The Zion Church in Batticaloa, one of the Catholic churches targeted, was symbolically selected due to the association of 'Zion' with the Land of Israel. The Eastern Province of Sri Lanka is an area where Muslims live in large numbers. Due to natural population growth and the migration of the main community, Hindu Tamils, Muslims are now approaching near-majority status in the Eastern Province. In the strategically important area of Trincomalee, Muslims are currently the majority community. Given this background, the view that the Eastern Province belongs to Muslims has been slowly taking root among the Muslim polity for a long time. What many fail to see is that support for Palestine has been the basis for the penetration of Western and anti-Israel ideologies among Muslims in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. In October 2022, a local media outlet reported that India and Israel were planning to invest jointly in the development of the agriculture sector in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. This plan was immediately opposed by Muslims, who viewed Indian-Israeli involvement in Sri Lanka as a disaster. This opposition was based on the belief that Israel should not be allowed to enter a place that belongs to Muslims. The opportunity to engage with religious organizations in Islamic countries has created an environment conducive to the spread of Islamic extremist ideas in East Sri Lanka. Whenever jihadists gain prominence internationally or Islamic attacks on the United States and Israel occur, there is a celebratory spirit among Muslim groups in the Eastern Province. For instance, during al-Qaeda’s peak, Osama bin Laden’s translated speeches were distributed in some local mosques. All South Asian-based Jihadi groups endorsed Osama bin Laden’s global jihad declaration and regarded al-Qaeda as the vanguard of jihadism. The activities of jihadists from Gaza to Kashmir are indirectly celebrated among Muslim groups in East Sri Lanka. This has fostered a continuing environment of anti-Western and anti-Indian sentiment among the younger Muslim generation. It is within this context that the ideology of ISIS was able to easily penetrate Kattankudy in the Eastern part of Sri Lanka. Moulavi M.C. Zahran, considered the architect of the Easter attack, has long been involved in the spread of jihadism in Sri Lanka. In August 2009, local media reported that he was the Propaganda Secretary of the Kattankudy-based Thawheed group. This group follows the Wahabi school, named after Muhammed ibn Abd al-Wahab (1703-1792), described as the first modern Islamic fundamentalist. Against this backdrop, Kattankudy has become known as the island of Islamic life, a fertile ground for Wahhabi-Sufi confrontations in Sri Lanka. Wahhabi-influenced youth from Kattankudy began targeting Sufis, who practice a mystical form of Islam. Grenades were thrown, and swords were thrust, resulting in hundreds of Sufis being forced from their homes. A 2007 academic policy paper warned that violence by hardline Muslims against Sufis in Sri Lanka could eventually lead to armed movements in parts of the country. Some analysts incorrectly attribute the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Sri Lanka to the failure of successive Sri Lankan governments to address the socio-cultural, political, and economic grievances of the affected communities. In reality, Muslims in Sri Lanka should not be viewed as a community oppressed by the majority Sinhalese. Instead, they should be recognized as a community that has economically thrived by capitalizing on the civil war. Muslim politicians have held powerful ministerial positions in every government, including the ministries of foreign affairs and justice. The roots of Islamic extremism in Sri Lanka should be understood within the context of the religious global bond among Muslims. There are groups that identify themselves as global Muslims rather than citizens of a single country. It is within this framework that their jihadist mentality should be examined. The Sri Lankan government failed to anticipate the potential rise of globally inspired Islamic fundamentalist groups during the civil war. By allowing the formation of Muslim Home Guards to counter Tamil separatist militancy, the government inadvertently created an opportunity for these fundamentalist groups. This environment facilitated their easy establishment and organization in the region. Consequently, the notion that the Eastern Province was their territory gradually took hold among Muslim extremist groups. This progression vividly illustrates how Wahhabi preaching evolved into ISIS-Sri Lanka. The Iran-aligned Yemen-based Houthi terrorist group’s recent attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea exemplify how Islamic terrorism can serve as a proxy tool in geopolitical competition. Amidst global geopolitical rivalries, the rise of Islamic fundamentalist groups in Sri Lanka’s Eastern Province, a region of strategic investment for India—particularly the Trincomalee district—poses significant security concerns. This development threatens not only Sri Lanka’s security but also India’s national security. India’s longstanding security challenges with Pakistan are intricately linked to the broader transnational threat of terrorism. South Asia has already witnessed the emergence of new jihadist groups. According to sources, many of these militant groups in South Asia draw their guidelines from al-Qaeda’s ideology and tactics, despite many being Deobandis while al-Qaeda adheres to Takfiri-Salafism. Al-Qaeda popularized the notion of Ghazwa-e-Hind to capture the imagination and loyalty of South Asian jihadists. National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ) in Sri Lanka, founded by Zaharan, and the rapidly growing Tamil Nadu Thoweed Jamath in southern India both aim to foment militant Islamic fundamentalism. These groups have maintained a relationship for over a decade, as noted by MEMRI, a Washington-based think tank on the Middle East. In this context, the growth of Islamic extremism in Sri Lanka is intrinsically linked to South Asia’s security landscape.

Pakistan’s Hostage-Rescue Failures Exposed As BLA Siege Ends In H...	Conflicting narratives and military missteps emerge from the Jaffar Express crisis in Balochistan. The recent hijacking of Pakistan's Jaffar Express by militants from the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has ended in tragedy, exposing serious flaws in Pakistan's military preparedness and counterterrorism capabilities. While Pakistani authorities quickly declared success in ending the siege, conflicting reports from militants and independent sources have cast serious doubts on the official version, indicating higher casualties and continuing insurgent resistance. On March 11, 2025, militants belonging to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist insurgent group seeking independence for Pakistan's Balochistan province, seized control of the Jaffar Express near the Mashkaf region in Balochistan. The attackers blew up railway tracks, derailing the train, which was carrying around 440 passengers from Quetta to Peshawar, and held hundreds hostage, including Pakistani security personnel. Initially, the BLA issued a demand for a prisoner exchange, threatening to execute hostages if Pakistani authorities failed to comply within 48 hours. In response, the Pakistani military launched a large-scale operation, employing both ground forces and airstrikes. By March 12, Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military's media wing, declared the operation successfully concluded, stating all 33 insurgents had been killed, 21 passengers and four Pakistani Army personnel had died, and all hostages had been rescued. Yet, the BLA swiftly disputed this victory declaration. The insurgent group categorically rejected ISPR's claims, labelling them 'propaganda.' In an official statement, BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch said, 'The claims made by the Pakistani army spokesperson are a failed attempt to cover up lies and defeat. The ground reality is that the battle continues on multiple fronts, and the enemy is suffering heavy casualties and military losses.' Independent media reports further exposed these contradictions. Reuters, citing security sources, reported only 155 hostages were rescued initially, leaving many passengers unaccounted for. Al Jazeera corroborated that several dozen hostages remained trapped even after the Pakistani military's claimed completion of operations. Reports emerging from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, provided an even grimmer picture. Local sources indicated at least 200 coffins being prepared for Pakistani soldiers, sharply contradicting the official military casualty figures. Additionally, the BLA publicly stated that it executed 50 hostages after Pakistani authorities refused to negotiate a prisoner exchange—highlighting the tragic cost of the military's refusal to engage diplomatically with insurgents. Security experts have pointed out that Pakistan's premature declaration of victory has damaged its credibility despite unclear ground realities. Military analysts noted the complexity of this particular hostage situation, mainly due to the insurgents reportedly having suicide bombers among their ranks, posing significant challenges for rescue operations. Islamabad, known for projecting its omnipotent intelligence apparatus and substantial counterterrorism experience, was expected to conduct a swift and precise operation. However, operational delays of approximately 30 hours suggest hesitations and logistical gaps, raising doubts about the military's preparedness for such high-stakes missions. Notably, Pakistan's approach stands in contrast to global best practices in hostage rescue operations. For instance, India's National Security Guard (NSG), internationally recognised for its counterterrorism capabilities, emphasises rapid deployment, real-time intelligence integration, and precision tactics. During the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, the NSG successfully rescued over 600 hostages in a heavily contested urban environment. Even India's Railway Protection Special Force, Commando for Railway Security (CORAS), specialises in handling hostage situations involving trains, highlighting operational deficiencies within Pakistan's elite Special Services Group (SSG). Moreover, the Pakistani authorities' swift declaration of victory, without independent verification, has undermined public trust and credibility domestically and internationally. Reports of ongoing clashes and accusations by insurgents suggest that the military's narrative was an attempt at controlling the information landscape rather than accurately depicting operational realities. The broader context of the Baloch insurgency highlights that the hijacking was not an isolated incident. Balochistan remains Pakistan's poorest yet most resource-rich province, with a long history of grievances over economic marginalisation, political suppression, and human rights abuses by state forces. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a multibillion-dollar infrastructure initiative, further intensified these grievances by excluding local Baloch populations from economic benefits, leading insurgent groups to increasingly target both Pakistani and Chinese personnel and assets. Since its formation in 2000, the BLA has evolved into a more potent threat. Notable attacks include the 2019 assault on Gwadar's Pearl Continental Hotel and the 2022 Karachi University suicide bombing targeting Chinese nationals. The group recently formed a unified structure under Baloch Raji Aajoi Sangar (BRAS), aiming to launch even more coordinated offensives against Pakistani forces. This crisis has prompted renewed attention to the underlying political issues in Balochistan. Former Balochistan chief minister Akhtar Mengal recently stated, 'There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority. They have lost this war—completely and irreversibly.' Mengal's statement suggests the insurgency is evolving beyond the state's control. Human rights groups and analysts have urged Pakistan to adopt a political solution alongside military operations. History shows that purely military strategies in Balochistan have only exacerbated local resentments, fostering further insurgency. The international community, which has remained largely silent, is also urged to reassess its stance and advocate for peaceful political solutions rather than tacitly supporting a purely militaristic approach. As the immediate crisis surrounding the Jaffar Express siege concludes amid confusion and controversy, deeper questions linger about Pakistan's broader counterinsurgency strategy and its repeated reliance on military solutions. The government's unwillingness to negotiate, combined with the military's mishandling of the operation and conflicting public claims, reveals a troubling lack of transparency and readiness to protect its citizens effectively. If the Pakistani state continues to prioritise military force over political dialogue, experts warn that the violence will escalate further, perpetuating instability and putting civilians at even greater risk. The recent siege stresses the critical need for Pakistan to rethink its approach to counterinsurgency—balancing security measures with genuine political reconciliation and respect for human rights. Unless such reforms are implemented promptly, Balochistan is likely to remain a flashpoint of conflict where both civilians and soldiers continue to pay the ultimate price.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6upjQa2cF4Wlj	2025-03-14T17:21:06-07:00	
Iran And The Price Of The ANC’s Nostalgia – Analysis	The African National Congress’ friendship with Tehran is becoming the main bugbear in US relations with South Africa. By Peter Fabricius Back in 2022 and 2023 after Russia invaded Ukraine and Pretoria refused to condemn Moscow, South Africa’s friendly relations with Russia were the most toxic in Western, especially United States’ (US) eyes. But US President Donald Trump has turned the world on its head by blaming Ukraine for allowing itself to be invaded, a position that aligns with Russia’s narrative about the war. Now South Africa’s ties with Iran are emerging as the most damaging to its relations with the US. Trump’s hostility to South Africa became official in an executive order terminating all US aid to the country, partly because of its new Expropriation Act but also because of South Africa’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) case against Israel, and its ‘[reinvigorated] relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.’ Pretoria has been trying to avoid a complete breakdown in its relationship with the US, largely to protect its lucrative duty-free access to the US market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The recent aid cuts also pose a significant risk to South Africa, especially its already ailing health sector. Despite this, the African National Congress (ANC) – the major partner in South Africa’s government of national unity – is actively promoting its good relations with Iran. Last week Nomvula Mokonyane, the ANC’s Deputy Secretary-General and Blade Nzimande, Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, both separately hosted Iranian Ambassador to South Africa, Mansour Shakib Mehr, describing their relationship with Tehran as ‘warm and cordial.’ Despite US concerns and recent aid cuts, the ANC is actively promoting its good relations with Iran This undoubtedly added grist to the mills of South Africa’s many enemies in the US, who have had Pretoria’s relations with Iran in their sights for some time. The US embassy in Pretoria warned South Africa about possible sanctions when two Iranian warships docked in Cape Town in early 2023. South Africa’s relations with Iran came under scrutiny after the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, which Iran openly supports. On 22 October, South Africa’s then foreign minister Naledi Pandor visited Tehran and met then president Ebrahim Raisi. At the time, foreign affairs officials told ISS Today she had among other things, delivered an invitation from Ramaphosa to visit South Africa, but that the visit had been called off. And then in January 2024, the ANC – which had been flirting with insolvency for years – announced it had managed to stabilise its finances without explaining how. Just days earlier, South Africa had charged Israel with genocide in Gaza before the ICJ. The timing raised suspicions, and a few commentators opined that Iran had paid off the ANC for taking Israel to court. The ANC and government denied this. A Daily Maverick fact check found no evidence of a payoff but concluded that the charges could not be proven or disproven, largely because the ANC accounts were not public. The ANC also aroused suspicion by hosting Hamas leaders for a Palestinian solidarity convention in South Africa shortly after the group attacked Israel. The ANC often seems to invite suspicion about its dealings with Iran and Hamas. Statements by top ANC executive and Minister of Mineral and Petroleum Resources, Gwede Mantashe – just days after Trump cut aid to South Africa this year – are a good example. He said Iran and Russia were both welcome to bid for South Africa’s planned contract to build a nuclear reactor to add 2 500 megawatts to the electricity. Trump is overreacting to SA’s positions, but countries shouldn’t be surprised if they are judged by the company they keep Yet, as Isabel Bosman, a Researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), told ISS Today, Iran has no known capacity or track record of building nuclear power stations abroad. She said Iran had required Russian assistance even to build its own nuclear power station. The fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency warned this month that Tehran is moving closer to being able to build nuclear weapons, has not helped South Africa’s cause. Even though, as Bosman says, there’s no evidence of any nuclear cooperation between the two countries. Chrispin Phiri, Spokesperson for South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola told ISS Today: ‘Regarding the baseless allegations of nuclear collaboration, we resolutely uphold the principle that nuclear weapons have no legitimate place in our shared future. South Africa remains unwavering in its dedication to international initiatives designed to curtail the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.’ It appears that the ANC is just being true to an old struggle-era ally, as it does with Cuba, Venezuela and Russia. (Even if, as Ukraine points out, the ANC’s struggle ally was the USSR not Russia, and Ukraine was part of the USSR.) South Africa and Iran’s official relationship goes back to the dawn of democracy when a Joint Commission of Cooperation was formed in 1995, and has met regularly ever since. But as Steve Gruzd, Head of the African Governance and Diplomacy Programme at SAIIA notes, the ANC’s relationship with Iran is even older than that and ‘when the ANC makes a friend, it's almost a friend for life and all sins are forgiven thereafter…’. He told ISS Today the ANC had admired Iran since the 1979 revolution, and that it falls into the category of ANC friends that ‘are not popular in the West.’ Is the rest of South Africa paying too high a price for the ANC’s revolutionary nostalgia? Gruzd notes that South Africa has defended Iran at the United Nations for its right to run a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes. He also said that the South African cellphone provider MTN is heavily invested in Iran, with a 49% share in one of the main cellphone companies. Yet it’s clear that national economic interests do not drive the relationship as total trade between the two countries barely reached R300 million in 2023. It is curious that the ANC is so friendly with Hamas’ main sponsor and Hamas itself, which is dedicated to a one-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Officially, the ANC still supports a two-state solution and is closer to the Palestine Liberation Organization – the co-architect of the two-state solution – than to Hamas. Phiri observes that ‘The narrative framing South Africa’s relationship with Iran echoes the now-discarded narrative towards Russia. Take for example [US] Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio’s statement on Russia relations – it refers to 'a commitment to restore a respectful and constructive interstate dialogue with Russia'’. Phiri adds that ‘As a sovereign state, South Africa unequivocally reserves the right to engage in dialogue founded on mutual respect and constructive intent with any nation, in alignment with its principles and national interests.’ That is of course true. It is also true that Trump is grossly overreacting to South Africa’s actions and positions. But countries should not be surprised if they are judged by the company they keep. Iran sponsors Hamas and Hezbollah to attack Israel, supplies drones to Russia to attack Ukraine and appears to be close to building nuclear weapons. As with other old ANC chums like Russia, one has to ask whether the rest of South Africa is paying too high a price for the ANC’s revolutionary nostalgia.

Russian Influence Operations In Georgia: A Threat To Democracy An...	By Vasil Sikharulidze (FPRI) -- Russia’s influence operations in Georgia represent one of the Black Sea region’s most comprehensive hybrid warfare campaigns. The Kremlin has employed military intervention and territorial occupation, economic embargos, energy leverages, political co-optation, corruption, and information warfare. The Kremlin’s objective is clear: to undermine Georgia’s statehood and derail the country from its democratic and economic development and Euro-Atlantic integration path, as well as entrench Russian strategic dominance. While Russia’s military occupation of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali remains a direct challenge to Georgia’s sovereignty, Moscow has expanded its influence through political co-optation, economic dependency, and information warfare. In Georgia, Russia has penetrated the ruling elite, manipulated public discourse, and fostered internal divisions, allowing it to exert control without open military action but with deeply embedded instruments of influence. While Georgia has demonstrated strong public resistance to these efforts, the growing authoritarian tendencies of its ruling elites—aided by Russian interference—pose a severe risk to the country’s future. Security Dimension To understand Russia’s influence in Georgia, we must begin with the security dimension. In 2008, Russia launched an open military invasion of Georgia. Currently, in violation of the EU-mediated ceasefire, Russia continues to occupy 20 percent of Georgia’s territory, establishing permanent military bases in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali. This occupation is a deliberate instrument of coercion aimed at limiting Georgia’s strategic choices. One of Russia’s hybrid tactics is 'borderization'—the gradual shifting of the occupation line deeper into Georgian-controlled territory. This tactic fosters insecurity, keeps border communities under constant pressure, disrupts local economies, and tests Western reactions. However, Russia’s influence in Georgia extends far beyond military pressure. Since 2012, following the electoral victory of the Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia Party (GD), founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili (a billionaire with deep ties to Russia), Georgia’s political alignment has gradually shifted as a result of Kremlin narratives and financial incentives. It has accelerated in recent years, most actively after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. What began as a 'normalization policy' with Russia has evolved into a systemic rollback of democratic institutions and growing alignment with Kremlin objectives. Eventually, it developed into a Kleptocratic authoritarian governance system that had many similarities to the Kremlin regime. Another key turning point came in 2023 when the European Union granted Georgia candidate status. Instead of embracing this historic opportunity, the ruling party reintroduced the Russian-style 'Foreign Agents’ law,' a measure designed to silence civil society and independent media. This move sparked massive protests that were met with brutality from the government. Yet the government doubled down on Kremlin-style rhetoric, accusing the West of orchestrating unrest and attempting to drug Georgia into the war with Russia. The GD party even came up with a unique conspiracy theory of the 'Global War Party,' framing all critics as part of this 'party' that was pushing Georgia towards war. GD has echoed Moscow’s narrative on the 2008 war, blaming past Georgian leaders instead of Russia. The Kremlin’s propaganda promotes appeasement as the path to stability while portraying the West as a disruptor. Economic Leverages Beyond security and politics, Russia maintains substantial economic leverage over Georgia through trade dependencies, energy supply, and penetration into Georgia’s financial System. Despite a trade embargo from Russia that started in 2006, Georgia had remarkable economic growth thanks to effective economic and governance reforms undertaken. Georgian exports to Russia resumed in 2013. Despite Georgia’s stated policy of economic diversification, trade data shows a steady increase in economic ties with Russia. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the structure of Russian business activities in Georgia underwent significant changes. Large Russian enterprises were compelled to exit the market, leading to a rise in small and medium-sized enterprises. Given that 38 percent of foreign investments in Georgia originate from offshore zones, accurately assessing the extent of Russian oligarchic influence remains challenging. In 2022, Russian foreign direct investment in Georgia reached a record $105.6 million, followed by a slight decline to $103.3 million in 2023. This increase has raised concerns among policymakers regarding Georgia’s long-term economic sovereignty. A particularly notable trend is the surge in real estate acquisitions by Russian citizens, which grew by 115 percent between 2022 and 2023, raising concerns about financial penetration and long-term economic influence. In 2023, the officially recorded trade turnover between Georgia and Russia reached $2.39 billion—a 47 percent increase compared to 2021, the year before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s share of Georgia’s total trade turnover fluctuated over the past three years, rising from 11.4 percent in 2021 to 13.1 percent in 2022 before declining to 11.2 percent in 2023. This increasing economic interdependence poses risks, particularly for Georgian manufacturers who face growing competition from Russian imports, which now constitute approximately 39 percent of Georgia’s total imports. Energy Dependence: A Strategic Vulnerability Georgia’s dependency on Russian natural gas remains very low—Georgia mainly relies on natural gas from Azerbaijan since the 2006 South Caucasus Pipeline (or the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum Pipeline). While Georgia receives natural gas from Azerbaijan, Russian pricing mechanisms remain opaque, raising concerns about potential energy coercion. However, Georgia has become heavily dependent on Russia for liquefied petroleum gas controlled by Moscow-backed enterprises. Furthermore, Georgia relies entirely on imported petroleum, and current trends show that Georgia is becoming more dependent on Russian oil products such as gasoline and diesel again, which wasn’t the case a few years ago. In 2023, Russian fuel imports declined by 11 percent ($70 million) due to supply disruptions, but overall, Georgia’s dependence on Russian petroleum has increased since 2021. One of the most concerning aspects of Georgia’s energy policy is the absence of a strategic gas reserve, which places the country at risk of severe supply disruptions. Despite receiving €120 million in funding from European institutions for the construction of a strategic reserve, the Georgian government redirected these funds during the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying the project until 2025. As a result, Georgia remains the only country in the region without a strategic gas storage facility, making it highly vulnerable to supply shocks and potential Russian coercion. Strategic Connectivity and the Anaklia Deep-Sea Port Georgia’s geostrategic position makes it a vital link between Europe and Central Asia, with great potential for strategic connectivity crucial for trade, energy, and transportation. By bypassing Russia, this network may reduce Moscow’s leverage over regional commerce and strengthen economic ties between Central Asia and Europe, contributing to EU energy security. The Anaklia Deep-Sea Port was designed to enhance Georgia’s role as a key transit hub, attract Western investment, and integrate the country into global supply chains. However, the GD government undermined the project by canceling contracts, delaying implementation, and handing it over to a Chinese firm. This move sidelined Western investment and raised concerns about Chinese and Russian influence over Georgia’s infrastructure. By obstructing Anaklia, the government weakened Georgia’s strategic connectivity, reinforcing economic dependencies that serve Moscow’s interests. The project’s failure highlights how political decisions, influenced by pro-Russian narratives and geopolitical pressures, continue to limit Georgia’s long-term economic potential. Soft Power: Intelligence & Propaganda Networks Russia has systematically invested in propaganda, disinformation, political influence, and intelligence penetration in Georgia. Beyond economic dependencies, Moscow has developed a multi-layered soft-power network designed to shape public discourse, foster pro-Kremlin sentiments, and undermine Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic integration. One of the key pillars of Russia’s influence strategy is disinformation and media control. Kremlin-backed media outlets, troll farms, and social media networks actively disseminate anti-Western narratives, portraying European and NATO integration as threats to Georgia’s sovereignty and traditional values. These efforts promote the notion that Russia is Georgia’s natural economic and security partner, reinforcing dependence on Moscow. The penetration of these narratives extends beyond media platforms into Georgia’s political landscape, where the GD political class echoes Kremlin rhetoric opposing NATO and EU integration. A particularly concerning development is the role of the GD party in advancing anti-Western narratives. Over time, the ruling party has cultivated a distinctly anti-American and anti-European political rhetoric that closely mirrors Kremlin propaganda. GD leaders and affiliated media outlets routinely claim that the West seeks to destabilize Georgia, interfere in its domestic affairs, and push the country into war with Russia. These accusations, similar to narratives promoted by Russian state media, serve to discredit Georgia’s Western allies and undermine public support for European and NATO integration. The party has also employed fear-based messaging by portraying Western engagement as a direct threat to Georgia’s sovereignty while simultaneously advocating for 'sovereign democracy'—a concept aligned with Moscow’s ideological framework, which rejects Western democratic models in favor of state-controlled governance. Moscow has also cultivated an extensive network of non-governmental organizations and intelligence-linked entities to advance its strategic objectives. Investigative reports indicate that at least tens of pro-Russian organizations operate in Georgia, engaging in activities that whitewash Moscow’s aggression, downplay the occupation of Georgian territories, and propagate anti-Western propaganda. These organizations not only shape public opinion but serve as instruments for intelligence gathering, political lobbying, and electoral interference. The depth of Russian influence within Georgia’s political elite was starkly revealed in April 2024 when Ivanishvili claimed that Russia’s invasions of Georgia and Ukraine were orchestrated by a 'Global War Party' in the West. Similarly, statements from Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze suggesting that external forces control the United States and the European Union further illustrate the extent to which Kremlin-aligned narratives have been internalized within the ruling establishment. These statements reflect a broader effort to shift public opinion away from Western integration and to normalize closer ties with Moscow. Beyond political and media influence, Russia uses economic and financial tools to expand its presence in Georgia. State-controlled businesses serve strategic interests, while covert funding supports pro-Russian parties, civil groups, and media outlets that amplify Kremlin propaganda. These resources also fuel electoral interference, shaping Georgia’s political trajectory. In the digital sphere, Russian troll factories and media networks manipulate public perception, particularly during elections. They discredit Western alliances, promote pro-Kremlin narratives, and compete with national broadcasters. The GD party and its affiliates play a key role in this information warfare, pushing anti-Western rhetoric, revisionist history on the 2008 war, and policies that weaken Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic ties. The 2024 Elections and Public Protests The October 26, 2024, parliamentary elections marked a major setback for Georgia’s democracy. Independent observers, including the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy, the Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association, and international monitors, documented widespread electoral fraud, including voter intimidation, ballot stuffing, vote secrecy breaches, and suppression of election observers. Despite clear evidence of fraud, the Central Election Commission declared GD victorious with 54 percent, an outcome immediately rejected by opposition parties, civil society, and international observers. While the European Union and United States refused to recognize the results, Russia and other pro-Kremlin leaders endorsed them, reinforcing Georgia’s political shift toward Moscow. Mass protests erupted, now lasting for over eighty-five consecutive days, making them one of Georgia’s longest-running resistance movements. The government responded with Kremlin-style repression, including brutal police crackdowns with mass detentions and arrests, beating and torturing detainees, and smear campaigns labeling protesters as 'foreign agents.' In a further escalation, Ivanishvili’s regime enacted draconian legislation that violates fundamental rights, including freedom of assembly, expression, and due process. It also uses financial pressure as a tool of political suppression. Just one example is the weaponization of financial penalties against protesters. Authorities introduced harsh new fines of 5,000 GEL—a crippling sum in a country where the average pension is 350 GEL and salaries average 1,000 GEL. More than fifty political prisoners remain detained while a politically controlled judiciary rubber-stamps these penalties. By criminalizing peaceful protest, the GD consolidates its authoritarian rule, erodes democratic norms, and distances Georgia from its European aspirations. Despite repression, public resistance remains strong, marking a defining moment in Georgia’s democratic struggle. Georgia stands at a crossroads, facing a choice between preserving its sovereignty and the Euro-Atlantic path or falling deeper under Moscow’s influence. The resilience of the Georgian people and international support will be critical in shaping its future. Russia’s influence strategy in Georgia is comprehensive, integrating political, economic, and informational tools to weaken sovereignty and entrench dependence. By portraying closer ties with Moscow as necessary for stability, the Kremlin aims to consolidate its regional dominance. Georgia’s subordination is central to Russia’s broader revisionist ambitions in the South Caucasus. The Global Danger of Russian Influence Operations Russia’s hybrid warfare—propaganda, disinformation, corruption, and political subversion—extends far beyond Georgia. These tactics target democratic societies worldwide, eroding trust in institutions and manipulating political discourse. The same elite capture, economic coercion, and divisive narratives used in Georgia are actively deployed against Europe and North America. This challenge does not require military confrontation: It works silently, destabilizing democracies from within. Western nations have already faced election interference, cyber-attacks, and disinformation campaigns designed to fragment societies and weaken strategic cohesion. Addressing this threat demands urgent, coordinated action from NATO, the European Union, and democratic allies. Strengthening resilience, transparency, and counter-disinformation efforts is essential. Georgia’s experience is a warning: If left unchecked, Russia’s tactics will be replicated elsewhere. Now is the time for proactive engagement, strategic countermeasures, and a firm commitment to defending democratic integrity globally.

Russia Plans To Turn Belarus Into Launching Pad For Intermediate-...	By Alexander Taranov On December 6, 2024, during a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State in Minsk, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) (Kremlin.ru, December 6, 2024). This deployment is planned for the second half of 2025 on Belarusian territory. As in the case of the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, this decision was purportedly made in response to a request from Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka (Belta.by, January 26). Putin justified his decision by referencing Russia’s obligations under the Treaty on Security Guarantees within the Union State, positioning it as a measure to ensure Belarus’s security against potential North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) aggression (see EDM, February 12, 13). In March 2023, Lukashenka mentioned the possibility of Russian strategic missile systems being placed in Belarus. He stated that discussions were ongoing with the Kremlin regarding the potential deployment of Russian strategic nuclear weapons, specifically the RT-2PM2 Topol-M ground-based missile systems (GBMS) (President of the Republic of Belarus, March 31, 2023). In April 2023, Belarusian Armed Forces undertook first measures to restore and modernize Soviet-era infrastructure in Brest oblast, specifically the launch sites for the RT-2PM Topol GBMS (Telegram/@modmilby, April 23, 2023; (Telegram/@Hajun_BY, April 24, 2023). Belarusian officials have indicated that Minsk still lacks complete information about the specific parameters and plan of Russia’s deployment of the Oreshnik missile system (MS) in Belarus. For instance, Lukashenka instructed the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Belarus to facilitate the deployment of the Russian Oreshnik MS in the country and carefully plan its combat use. According to Chief Major General Pavel Muraveiko, however, the Belarusian side has not been informed about the number of Oreshnik MS launchers that Russia will deploy in Belarus. Only the President of Russia knows this (Belta.by, December 12, 2024). Representatives of the top military-political leadership are addressing public concerns about this decision, which increases military dependence on Russia and affects Belarus’s sovereignty. In response, Lukashenka denied that Belarus is losing sovereignty to Russia. Contrary to his latest moves, he specifically stated that there is no 'Russian occupation' of Belarus and that such a situation will not occur as long as he remains the leader of the country (Reform.news, December 10, 2024; see EDM, February 12, 13). Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Belarus, Colonel Sergei Lagodzyuk, explains the decision to deploy the Oreshnik MS as a response to the deployment of similar U.S. medium-range weapons in Europe, the militarization of the region, Russia’s war against Ukraine, as well as an information campaign 'launched against Belarus to discredit the authorities and the leadership of the country to create conditions for the emergence or provocation of conflicts' ( Belta.by, December 12, 2024). The military-political leadership of Belarus believes that the MSs will produce a deterrent effect, such as nuclear weapons already on Belarusian territory, and will become a serious obstacle to potential aggression from NATO (Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus, December 7, 2024). The commander of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, Colonel General Sergei Karakaev, explained that the Russian military command is only working on a decision to create new formations of the Strategic Missile Forces for a new medium-range missile system (TASS, December 16, 2024). The Oreshnik MS will be part of the Strategic Missile Forces of the Russian Armed Forces (RAF). In the event of deployment on the territory of Belarus, these systems will also be subordinate to the Main Staff of the RAF Strategic Missile Forces and/or the Joint Command of the Regional Troops Grouping (RTG) of Russia and Belarus, in which the Russian side dominates in the decision-making process, and the Belarusian side only has the right to an advisory vote (see EDM, February 3, 13). Lukashenka himself claims that, by agreement with Moscow, the military-political leadership of Belarus will select the targets for strikes with the Oreshnik MS (Belta.by, December 10, 2024; see EDM, February 3). He also stated that the military of the RAF will only service and carry out launches on certain targets, while and until Russian specialists train Belarusian military personnel (Belta.by, December 12, 2024). He also publicly confirmed the involvement of Belarus in the creation of this system, in particular the provision of chassis for its launchers manufactured by the Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant, or MZKT. In his words, Belarus needs 'only missiles' from Russia, and Belarus will allegedly create the chassis and launchers itself (Belta.by, December 10, 2024). Specifically, in the first nine months of 2024, MZKT sent 36 railcars with equipment and components to the Federal Research and Production Center 'Titan-Barricady' (Volgograd), one of co-producers of the Oreshnik MS (Telegram/@Hajun_BY, November 22, 2024). Some Russian military experts estimate that it is preferable to launch the Oreshnik IRBMs from locations in Belarus that are protected from a direct disarming strike. The areas around the cities of Mogilev and Bobruisk in Mogilev oblast are considered suitable for its deployment due to adequate forests, low population density, existing airfields, roads, railways, air defense coverage, and proximity to the Russian border. Consequently, it will be challenging for U.S. ATACMS to target these locations. Deploying the Oreshnik IRBM further west, however, could be risky, as the missiles would become vulnerable to enemy air defense systems during their initial flight trajectory. According to Russian military experts, 8–12 launchers of Oreshnik MS can be placed at two sites, which is equivalent to a full-fledged missile regiment of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces (Topcor.ru, December 17, 2024). Another potential site for the deployment of the Oreshnik MS may be the village of Cheretyanka in Gomel oblast, where the abandoned base of the 369th missile regiment of the Strategic Missile Forces was located during Soviet times. A delegation of the RTG Joint Command visited it in June 2022 with an unclear inspection. In Soviet times, the RSD-10 Pioneer missile system and the RT-2PM Topol strategic missile system were based on it. Near and on the base’s territory, there is all the necessary infrastructure, including a platform for unloading nuclear missiles, a railway, boiler houses, barracks and warehouses, although in poor condition (Telegram/@Hajun_BY, June 12, 2022). Considering these infrastructural requirements for the deployment, it can be assumed that in Mogilev oblast, Oreshnik can be placed in areas between Chausy, Krichev and Cherikov, on one hand, as well as Krichev, Bykhov, and Kirovsky, on the other. This deployment seems to be based on the assumption that Ukraine will not strike these targets. Practically, however, the Ukrainian Armed Forces can easily destroy Oreshnik IRBMs in those areas (The Kyiv Independent, November 24, 2024). Lukashenka confirmed on December 26 that he wants to receive 10 units of the Oreshnik IRBM from Russia and deploy them closer to the Smolensk oblast of Russia, which borders Belarus (Reform.news, December 26, 2024, January 26). References to Russia’s neighboring regions likely concern Russian Strategic Missile Forces’ combat duty crews operating in Belarus, frequently changing routes and positions. Permanent deployment points may appear in Russia’s Smolensk oblast, while temporary deployment points could be set up in Belarus’s Mogilev and Gomel oblasts. The deployment of the Oreshnik IRBMs, even in the Mogilev oblast, does not guarantee bypassing the U.S./NATO missile defense systems in Redzikowo, Poland and Deveselu, Romania in the SM-3 Block IIA version (NATO, July 10, 2024). The direct distance from Mogilev to these facilities is 850 kilometers (530 miles) and 1,170 kilometers (730 miles), respectively. There is only one military scenario for using the Oreshnik IRBMs from the territory of Belarus. This scenario involves the preemptive destruction of U.S./NATO missile defense bases in Poland and Romania as a result of a massive missile attack and/or the use of tactical nuclear weapons to destroy them. After that, the Oreshnik IRBMs can be used from the territory of Belarus against targets in Europe without the threat of interception by missile defense systems. Such a scenario is possible if Russian leadership designs plans for a vertical escalation of the conflict with Ukraine to a regional war with NATO in the European theater of war. For this reason, Russia plans to expand the tactical nuclear weapon carrier supply to Belarus. In particular, since June 2024, two new hangars have been built on the territory of military unit No 12147 in Osipovichi—where the 465th Missile Brigade of the Armed Forces of Belarus is located—for the new Iskander-M operational-tactical missile systems. In size and appearance, the hangars are similar to those shelters for the MS, built here two years ago (Svaboda.org, June 7, 2024). The missile brigade itself is located 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from one of the alleged locations for Russian tactical nuclear weapons in the Balshaya Garozha village on the territory of the 1405th Artillery Ammunition Base (see EDM, April 30, 2024). Each of the hangars can accommodate 12 combat vehicles. In February 2024, Lukashenka mentioned that there were already two battalions of the Iskander-M MS in Belarus (RIA Novosti, February 20, 2024). Construction activities testify that a new missile brigade armed with the Iskander-M MS will be formed in Belarus. In this case, the total number of tactical nuclear weapon carrier launchers will reach 12 units in the near future in the missile brigade (Belarusinfocus.pro, June 9, 2024). At the same time, the Russian military-industrial complex is already modifying missiles for this system with a range of up to 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) (Militaryrussia.ru, July 24, 2024). In this regard, Putin also mentioned Belarus regarding additional deliveries of long-range missile weapons and speculated about Russia’s right to supply similar weapons to the West’s opponents (TASS, June 7, 2024). By the end of 2025, Russia will additionally deploy missile systems with a maximum range of 1,000 to 6,000 kilometers (621 to 3,728 miles) on the territory of Belarus. It is not ruled out that an additional batch of Iskander-M as well as Oreshnik missile systems will also arrive in Belarus in connection with preparations for the Zapad-2025 strategic maneuvers and will remain permanently there, as it happened after the Soyuznaya Reshimost-2022 exercise (Interfax.ru, May 10, 2022; see EDM, November 7, November 18, 2024). The deployment of such systems so close to NATO’s eastern flank, a potential theater of operations, indicates that Russia and Belarus are preparing for scenarios of preemptive missile strikes against critical, military and logistical infrastructure in Europe both in conventional and nuclear versions. Investments in advanced missile defense and long-range strike capabilities by Ukraine and NATO could mitigate the threats coming from Russian missile systems’ deployment in Belarus.

Syria’s Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham: The Jungle And The Leopard – OpEd	By Fernando Carvajal Events in Syria continue to evolve at lightspeed. In December 2024, regional and Western governments rushed to engage the new al-Qaeda-affiliated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) government, which is supported by NATO member Turkey. Jubilation intoxicated the general population and the diaspora following the anticlimactic fall of the Assad regime. Nearly three months later, the honeymoon has run its course and the jungle holds on to the spots. After the regressive series of events following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, regional and Western powers wait to see if the HTS government leaders can truly change their spots, as they traded fatigues for designer suits. The region has witnessed the chaos following the fall of notorious Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and most recently the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan. In both cases, the region experienced a series of events where al-Qaeda and ISIS gained a lifeline, and women and minorities suffered from tremendous regressive policies under corrupt and extremist regimes. Damascus, the first Arab capital governed by self-made extremists listed as terrorists by the international community, surfaced as a unique case. In contrast to other extremist groups, HTS leaders immediately launched a well-coordinated 'charm offensive' and presented themselves as statesmen, surrounded by a jungle of militants marginalized by the victors, and away from the spoils. HTS leaders and their patrons aim to convince the world they’ve changed their spots. Can the jungle let it last? This is a loaded question. First, the international community must wait and see where the approach to de-radicalization since the September 11 attacks failed and the revolutionary spirit achieves change. The world waits to see the difference between al-Qaeda ideologues and their former hosts: the Taliban and ISIS. The experiment also raises the stakes for the Muslim Brotherhood — can it succeed in Damascus where it failed in Cairo? Damascus and the jungle On January 29, 2025, the HTS leadership gathered to confirm Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani (now Ahmed al-Shar’a) during a symbolic bay’a — Islamic oath of allegiance to a leader — summit in Damascus. Civilian and military loyalists gathered to consolidate the image of the State, but this was as much a message to rival Islamist factions as it was to international audiences. Under overt guidance and with material support from Turkey, the HTS government moved quickly to address a major obstacle to international legitimacy, removal from terrorist lists by the United States, European Union and United Nations. The new rulers in Damascus also need to consolidate authority and power over rival factions, ethnic minority groups, former regime remnants and hostile neighbors like Iran, Iraq and Israel. While HTS does not yet control all of Syria’s territory, it is relying on an extensive network of Islamist militants to deter fragmentation. Jawlani’s chess game smartly moved toward Iraq, where it hosted a meeting with former enemies in neighboring intelligence services. The meeting with Hamid al-Shatri, Head of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, aimed to mend fences from Jawlani’s ISIS days. It also sought to strengthen the rear front to prevent new incursions by Iran-affiliated militias and elements of Lebanon’s Hezbollah paramilitary group. By meeting with Iraqi intelligence rather than diplomats, Jawlani signaled a merging of interests with Turkey. More interesting, and of higher risk for HTS, has been the reported collaboration with the US. A US State Department delegation visited Damascus in late December 2024. Soon after, a report emerged of possible intelligence sharing between Washington and HTS leadership. The meeting with Iraq officials and sharing of intelligence with the US seems like a carrot from Turkey to sweeten up the deal with Damascus. US strikes against ISIS and al-Qaeda elements serve Jawlani’s interests as much as the West’s. Members of jihadist groups from the jungle resisting Jawlani’s authority may turn on Damascus, derail HTS governance and attract negative attention. Enemies inside and outside pose as much threat as the inability to govern a highly diverse Syrian environment. HTS’s move from a jihadist militant group to a government entity complicates funding. Damascus no longer must simply fund a patronage network of jihadists. As a central government, HTS must provide costly services beyond the center, beyond security. Collection of taxes beyond their safe haven in the city of Idlib is no longer a model, neither are 'extortion, kidnapping and oil-smuggling … [or] at least $94 million from prisoner-exchange deals with the Syrian government, Iran, Lebanon and Italy.' Damascus needs a deal with Kurds for access to oil supplies. This requires a delicate balance as Turkey lies in the middle of an agreement with them. Can the leopard change its spots? Just as Afghanistan under the Taliban, the potential for Syria to surface as a new safe haven for jihadist militants is a primary concern for the region and the West. Every militant group is bound to experience a struggle for power, and Jawlani is at the center. As he switches from jihadist field commander to head of state, he must guard his generals as much as rivals among militant factions beyond the center. It is still unclear how power will project beyond the core. Likewise, no one knows what role Jawlani’s loyalists will play. Security and State revenue beyond Damascus will undoubtedly depend on stability in areas with Shia, Druze, Kurdish and Yazidi populations. Relations with minority groups will test the ability to govern and the degree to which Islamist extremists can change their spots. Jawlani has spoken the magic words for the West and pointed to elections being held around five years from now.

Trump’s Presidential Diplomacy Is Surging – OpEd	The US President Donald Trump by far outstrips any of his predecessors in post-cold war era in the transparency of his foreign policy agenda and in his attempt to connect the public opinion with his America First ideology. Trump’s presidential diplomacy depends heavily on his media briefings, which have become a daily occurrence and are an absolute ‘must’ for any serious analyst or observer of world affairs. Trump’s press conference at the White House on Thursday during the visit of the NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte stood out for the following signposts in the US foreign policy agenda that he planted in a 48-minute event alone. One. Whereas the expectation was that Rutte’s visit was just the right occasion for Trump to bring the western alliance to the centre stage of his foreign policy and reclaim the leadership of the transatlantic alliance 'to project American power' (Rutte’s words), he was instead simply uninterested in NATO — although Rutte praised him sky-high for his contribution to making the alliance a 'strong' organisation by boosting its budget. Two. On the contrary, Trump spoke at length on the Ukraine peace process and expressed hope that the war is ending, taking even a swipe at NATO for having squandered its budget wastefully under the Biden presidency by intervening in a war that should not have happened. By the way, Rutte is known to be a super hawk on Russia (which actually inspired President Biden to handpick him for the present job late last year.) Rutte was a prominent fixture in the family photos of the recent string of EU summits that were pioneered by French President Emmanuel Macron to choreograph the future trajectory of the Ukraine war against the backdrop of the perceived US retrenchment in Europe, Three. Trump taunted Rutte openly by proposing that the latter could be 'instrumental' in his hugely controversial foreign policy venture to annex Greenland, which Denmark, a NATO country, claims as its integral part. Trump severely questioned the basis of the claim by Denmark to Greenland. Rutte tried to change the topic but Trump would have none of it and reminded him of NATO’s 'relevance'. To be sure, NATO finds itself like a cat on a hot tin roof if Trump’s strong hint of a likely boost in the US troop deployment in its two existing bases in Greenland goes ahead which will be tantamount to an annexation by military means, something Denmark will be hardly in a position to counter. Trump spoke in the presence of Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Four. Trump point blank rejected the narrative that Russia posed a military threat to Europe and that Russian victory in Ukraine will encourage Moscow to attack European states. Arguably, Trump’s ‘nyet’ not only knocks the bottom out of the legitimacy of the NATO and Europe’s intervention in Ukraine but also casts doubts on the raison d’être of the NATO. (Earlier in his remarks, Rutte had spoken forcefully of the imperative need to swiftly build up Europe’s defence industry to meet the Russian threat.) Five. Trump hinted that he may resume talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, which he began in the first term but got derailed as his presidency increasingly came under siege from the deep state and the neocon lobby with the support of the Democratic Party. A resumption of the US-DPRK talks can potentially realign the security alliance matrix in Northeast Asia and impact the US’ Indo-Pacific strategy on the whole. Six. Most important, Trump disclosed that much serious discussion had been taking place with Ukraine, including on the seemingly intractable territorial issues and the future status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in southeastern Ukraine, which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and among the 10 largest in the world, and has been under Russian control since 2022. Trump said, 'We’ve been discussing land with Ukraine… pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement. You know, we’ve been discussing concepts of land because you don’t want to waste time with a ceasefire if it’s not going to mean anything, They discussed (in Jeddah) NATO and being in NATO, and everybody knows what the answer to that is. They’ve known that answer for 40 years, in all fairness.' Trump seemed to suggest that conditions have been created for holding serious negotiations with Russia going forward. Trump spoke with great deliberation in Rutte’s presence, knowing that European capitals would be keenly listening. Suffice to say, Trump has left the US’ European allies in no doubt that he is the new sheriff in town and there are no two ways about it. Trump has shown no interest in Western troop deployment in Ukraine; nor does he envisage any European participation in the US-Russia dialogue. Trump sees this as a deal between him and Putin and sounded confident that Russia’s concerns can be properly addressed. However, it is doubtful whether the Russian side also sees the situation in such binary terms. If Putin’s address to the Russian Foreign Ministry last June (spelling out the conditions to be fulfilled before talks commenced) is applied as the yardstick today, there is a long winding road ahead. Indeed, there is much scepticism in Moscow even about Ukraine’s sudden turnaround on ceasefire. Russians see it as a tactical ploy to wriggle out of the devastating rout that thousands of its elite troops are facing in Kursk at the moment, and nothing more. At the press conference, Trump touched on Putin’s statement on March 13 and said that the latter 'put out a very promising statement, but it wasn’t complete. And, yeah, I’d love to meet with him or talk to him.' Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff met Putin on Thursday to discuss the results of US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this week and to relay Moscow’s position back to Washington. based on Witkoff’s feedback from Moscow, Trump has since written on Truth Social, 'We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end — BUT, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIAN TROOPS ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY, AND IN A VERY BAD AND VULNERABLE POSITION. I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!' In televised remarks later, Putin responded to Trump’s ‘demarche’ regarding the fate of Ukrainian troops. He said, 'We are sympathetic to President Trump’s call. If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment.' Trump had stated during the press conference yesterday that the US has already discussed many details of a potential 'final agreement' with Kiev and is now waiting to see 'whether or not Russia is there.' Apparently, Trump is conveying the impression that the latest signal from Witkoff’s meeting last night with Putin is that Russia is coming on board. However, appearances can be deceptive in such situations of smoke and mirrors in international diplomacy. A close reading of Putin’s statement of March 13 reveals that while Russia is, in principle, open to the US’ call for ceasefire, Moscow has serious reservations, and several questions remain to be answered. The ball is, arguably, in Trump’s court now, contrary to Washington’s facile argument. Suffice to say, the US-Russia dialogue appears to be at an inflection point.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uszy4Mi_i3JL	2025-03-14T17:12:31-07:00	
Kra Canal: The Impossible Dream Of Southeast Asia Shipping – Anal...	By Paulo Aguiar The idea of the Kra Canal has been a topic of discussion for centuries, as the promise of an alternative route between the Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand could revolutionize shipping and reshape regional geopolitics. While the project has never come to fruition, its potential impact keeps it in strategic conversations, particularly in light of China’s expanding influence in Southeast Asia and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As of now, Thailand has opted for a different path, but debates over the canal’s feasibility and geopolitical consequences remain very much alive. Historical Background The concept of the Kra Canal dates back to 1677 when Thai King Narai commissioned French engineer de Lamar to survey the Kra Isthmus for a possible canal. At the time, the idea was not to connect the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea but rather to establish a navigable waterway between Songkhla and Marid (now Myanmar). De Lamar’s assessment concluded that the mountainous terrain, dense jungles, and the technological limitations of the era rendered the project unfeasible. The immense effort required to dig through the isthmus using 17th-century engineering methods made construction virtually impossible, leading to its abandonment. In the 19th century, as European colonial powers expanded their influence in Southeast Asia, the concept of the Kra Canal resurfaced. The British, who controlled key maritime trade routes through Singapore and the Strait of Malacca, viewed any alternative shipping channel with suspicion. They feared that a canal through Thailand would weaken Singapore’s strategic importance and threaten British dominance in regional trade. Meanwhile, France, eager to strengthen its presence in Indochina, saw the canal as a way to establish a stronger foothold in the region and counterbalance British influence. However, the Siamese government, wary of foreign intervention and territorial disputes, strategically resisted both British and French involvement. By carefully balancing diplomatic relations with European powers while preserving its sovereignty, Siam managed to prevent any progress on the canal during this period. Kra Canal in the Contemporary Context The Kra Canal attracted renewed interest in 1972 when an American firm, Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS), proposed a 102-km-long canal connecting Satun to Songkhla. This proposal was driven by the need for an alternative shipping route to alleviate congestion in the Malacca Strait and provide a more direct maritime passage between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. The plan involvedadvanced engineering techniques of the time, envisioning a deep-water canal capable of handling large cargo vessels and oil tankers. However, with a projected cost of $5.6 billion and a projected 10–12 year construction period, the Thai government ultimately rejected the plan. Concerns included the massive financial burden, environmental impact, and the risk of regional instability, particularly stemming from foreign influence and internal security challenges. More recently, China has become increasingly interested in reviving the project as part of its Maritime Silk Road initiative, a key component of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In 2015, an MoU was signed between private entities from China and Thailand to explore the feasibility of the canal, highlighting its potential to reshape trade routes and reduce reliance on the Malacca Strait. However, both governments quickly distanced themselves from the agreement, likely due to political sensitivities and opposition from regional players like Singapore and India. The canal never progressed beyond preliminary discussions. As of 2025, Thailand has instead opted to prioritize a $28 billion land bridge project—an overland transport corridor designed to facilitate cargo movement between the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. This alternative aims to achieve similar economic benefits without the political and environmental challenges posed by a canal, making it a more viable and strategically balanced solution. Geopolitical Stakes Why the Kra Canal Matters If constructed, the Kra Canal would provide a strategic alternative to the Strait of Malacca, reducing shipping distances by approximately 1,200 nautical miles. This shortcut would save fuel costs, cut transit times, and ease congestion in the Strait of Malacca, which currently handles nearly 94,000 vessel passages annually. As global trade continues to expand, particularly in energy and container shipping, the demand for efficient and secure maritime routes is higher than ever. The canal would create an additional passage, reducing bottlenecks and alleviating concerns about over-reliance on a single trade route. China, as the world’s largest trading nation, would stand to benefit immensely by reducing its reliance on the Malacca Strait for energy imports and trade. Currently, approximately 80% of China’s oil imports pass through the Malacca Strait, making it a critical vulnerability in times of geopolitical tensions. Diversifying maritime routes through the Kra Canal could enhance China’s energy security, providing an alternative supply chain for crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from the Middle East and Africa. China-US Competition For China, the Kra Canal would address its 'Malacca dilemma'—the vulnerability of its maritime trade routes to potential blockades by rival naval forces, particularly the United States. A hypothetical China-controlled canal would enhance Beijing’s control over its supply chain and maritime security, while boosting its geopolitical influence in the region. Notably, the canal would enable China to establish a stronger presence in the Indian Ocean, allowing the PLA Navy greater operational flexibility and enhancing its ability to protect critical sea lanes. The United States and its allies, particularly Singapore and India, oppose the canal’s construction owing in large part to these geopolitical considerations. A China-dominated Kra Canal could reduce Singapore’s significance as a shipping hub, potentially diminishing its economic and strategic value. Singapore, which benefits heavily from transshipment fees and trade facilitation, would likely experience economic losses if traffic were diverted to a new canal. India, which has growing concerns over China’s increasing influence in the Indian Ocean, sees the Kra Canal as another strategic asset that could strengthen China’s maritime footprint near its sphere of influence. As a countermeasure, Washington is supporting Thailand’s land bridge project, which offers an alternative trade corridor without directly benefiting China’s strategic interests. The land bridge project, consisting of highways, rail networks, and deep-sea ports, provides a non-maritime alternative for trade while maintaining the regional balance of power. The United States has also increased maritime cooperation with Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines to ensure the continued security and open accessibility of the Malacca Strait. Regional Impacts For Thailand, the Kra Canal presents both opportunities and challenges. Economically, it could transform the country into a key logistics hub, generating substantial revenue from transit fees, port services, and related industries. By cutting travel distances for major shipping routes, the canal could increase direct investment in Thailand’s maritime infrastructure and create thousands of new jobs in shipping, trade, and logistics. The long-term economic benefits could help Thailand strengthen its position as a regional powerhouse in maritime commerce. However, from a stability standpoint, the canal threatens to divide Thailand geographically, reinforcing separatist movements in the south. The country has long struggled with separatist tensions in its southern provinces, and a canal physically splitting the nation could exacerbate these internal divisions. There are also concerns about foreign control or heavy foreign investment in the canal project, particularly if China were to play a dominant role in its financing and construction. Such involvement would inevitably spark concerns over sovereignty, with the canal potentially becoming an extension of China’s influence in the region. Additionally, the project would disrupt existing maritime economies, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, which have consistently opposed its development due to fears of economic losses. The canal’s success would depend on the extent to which it diverts shipping away from traditional routes. If global shipping companies find it more cost-effective and efficient to use the new passage, Singapore’s role as a regional shipping hub could decline, prompting diplomatic tensions and resistance from ASEAN partners. Given these economic and political complexities, Thailand must carefully weigh its options. Kra Canal: A Reality Check Despite its apparent advantages, the Kra Canal comes with a host of economic, environmental, and security concerns. The latest estimated construction cost has ballooned to $30 billion, making financial feasibility a major hurdle. Beyond the initial investment, maintenance costs and the need for continuous dredging due to sediment buildup would add to long-term expenditures. Additionally, securing international financing could be challenging, especially considering the canal’s geopolitical implications and potential opposition from regional powers. The environmental impact is another major concern. Constructing a canal of this scale would require large-scale excavation, leading to habitat destruction for marine and terrestrial wildlife. The potential for oil spills, increased shipping traffic, and disruptions to local fisheries could have lasting ecological consequences. Moreover, altering water flow between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand could impact ocean currents, salinity levels, and even regional weather patterns. Due to these challenges, the Thai government remains cautious, choosing instead to prioritize port expansions and alternative infrastructure projects. The modernization of Laem Chabang and Map Ta Phut ports aims to improve Thailand’s maritime logistics without the risks associated with the Kra Canal. Furthermore, the land bridge initiative offers a feasible alternative to facilitate cargo movement between the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea while maintaining national unity and minimizing geopolitical tensions.

Gaza’s Future – OpEd	The Arab League held a summit in Cairo on March 4 with the sole intention of considering a comprehensive plan for Gaza’s future, master-minded by Egypt. Costed at some $53bn, it focuses in a 112-page document on emergency relief, rebuilding shattered infrastructure and long-term economic development. The conference endorsed the plan, as far as it went. The later stages will require more detailed consideration. It was on February 4 that US President Donald Trump announced his proposal to turn the Gaza Strip into a US-run 'Riviera of the Middle East', having first evacuated the population to any nearby Arab states willing to accept a total of some 2 million people. The Arab world, as well as much of the rest of the globe, greeted the idea with a mixture of astonishment and ridicule. Some commentators, claiming to know Trump’s methods, maintained that he had deliberately used shock tactics to goad the Arab world into playing a more active role in considering Gaza’s future and how to achieve it. If this was indeed the method in Trump’s madness, it produced results. A couple of weeks later, on February 17, news media worldwide reported that Egypt was preparing an alternative to Trump’s proposal in which evacuating the territory and relocating the Gazan population would play no part. In the event the Egyptian proposal called for establishing 'secure areas' within Gaza, where Palestinians can live temporarily while Egyptian and international construction firms reconstitute the Strip’s infrastructure. More than two dozen Egyptian and international firms would take part, and the reconstruction would provide tens of thousands of jobs for Gaza’s population. Winding up the summit on March 4 Egypt’s President Abdel el-Sisi welcomed 'the consensus among the Arab countries to support the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, which allows the Palestinian people to stay on their land without displacement.' In a social media post after the conference, Sisi said he looked forward to working with Trump, other Arab nations and the international community 'to adopt a plan that aims for a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian Issue, ends the root causes of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, guarantees the security and stability of the peoples of the region and establishes the Palestinian State.' The Egyptian plan outlines a three-phase process taking five years, starting with a six-month 'early recovery period' involving the establishment of 'safe zones'. Some 1.5 million displaced Gazans would be moved into 200,000 prefabricated housing units and 60,000 repaired homes. This stage is estimated to cost some $3bn The second phase, lasting two years and costing $20bn, would see housing and utilities rebuilt. During the third phase, which would take another two years, an airport, two seaports and an industrial zone would be built at a cost of $30bn. As for the Strip’s governance, a key aspect of this plan is the establishment of a temporary Governance Assistance Mission from which Hamas would be excluded. This interim body would oversee humanitarian aid and initiate reconstruction efforts until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) can assume control. Despite this exclusion, Hamas has publicly welcomed the Egyptian plan as signaling strong Arab alignment with the Palestinian cause. Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the summit’s final communique calls on the UN Security Council to deploy an international peacekeeping force in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. In addition, the communique said Egypt will host an international conference in cooperation with the UN to agree on Gaza’s reconstruction. Funding will probably require investment from oil-rich Gulf governments including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. A trust fund, overseen by the World Bank, will be established to handle pledges and donor-provided funds. A final stage, still open for Arab discussion and refinement, would start the process of creating a sovereign Palestinian state. Establishing inter-connectivity between the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip would be an early priority. In tackling this conundrum the planners need look no further than Trump’s own comprehensive plan, 'Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People', issued on 28 January 2020. The result of years of intensive diplomatic effort by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the plan envisaged the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank, excluding the settlements, plus a Gaza greatly expanded by a swath of Israeli territory south of the Strip. All Palestinian occupied territories would be made contiguous by way of a network of highways and a road tunnel linking the West Bank to Gaza. The published plan contained maps illustrating how all enclaves of a sovereign Palestine could be inter-connected. Trump’s plan was no sooner unveiled than it was vehemently rejected by Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority (PA), and other voices in the Arab world. But not universally. Significantly, both Saudi Arabia and Egypt seemed prepared to give the plan a fair hearing. The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated: 'Egypt recognizes the importance of considering the US administration's initiative from the perspective of the importance of achieving the resolution of the Palestinian issue, thus restoring to the Palestinian people their full legitimate rights…' Egypt’s new plan for Gaza’s future, while carrying the whole-hearted approval of the Arab League, has not fared so well in US and Israeli circles. The AP news agency reported that White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes has dismissed the Egyptian proposal as unworkable. 'The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable,' said Hughes on March 4, 'and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance. President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.' A spokesperson for Israel’s foreign ministry, Oren Marmorstein, posted on X that the Egyptian plan 'fails to address the realities of the situation'. The plan, he said, remains 'rooted in outdated perspectives.' Nevertheless Egypt’s plan garnered backing from the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, who attended the Arab summit. 'I welcome and strongly endorse the Arab-led initiative to mobilize support for Gaza’s reconstruction,' he said. 'The UN stands ready to fully cooperate in this endeavor.' Initial knee-jerk reactions by US and Israeli spokesmen to the Arab-endorsed plan may yet be modified, especially as the White Housse announced on March 5 that the US was engaged in direct talks with Hamas. The door Is open for discussion and negotiation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6ukLVxs5HAIk-	2025-03-14T17:05:15-07:00	
Iran: The IRGC’s Fuel Smuggling Mafia – OpEd	Amid the power struggle and the impeachment battle of Abdolnaser Hemmati, the Iranian regime’s minister of economy, the issue of large-scale fuel smuggling has resurfaced. On February 26, Iranian regime president Masoud Pezeshkian said, 'Who is responsible for taking this massive amount of reserves out of the country? It is not possible for someone to smuggle diesel by hand or in small barrels across the border. Such large-scale smuggling requires an extensive network, so it must be clarified who is involved in this cycle' (Jamaran website, February 26, 2025). Even if it is unclear to others who is involved in this cycle, Pezeshkian knows well. He understands that the fuel smuggling corruption is linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the military arm of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, for whose longevity Pezeshkian prays daily. On March 1, the state-affiliated Ham-Mihan newspaper highlighted Pezeshkian’s admission: 'Smugglers buy diesel at 3,000 rials per liter and sell it for 700,000 rials per liter.' It then questioned: 'Why don’t you name the smugglers? Is it against the policy of unity? Who are these smugglers? … When you publish an official report listing the names of these ‘respectable’ smugglers, the people will believe that you can actually stop it.' Pezeshkian knows well that 30 million liters of fuel cannot be smuggled daily using small containers. Fuel smuggling is different from garment smuggling—it is controlled by entities with the tools to regulate, monitor, and even legitimize such operations. The IRGC, leveraging its influence over ports, land borders, and international networks, has turned fuel smuggling into a highly profitable industry. Pezeshkian is not distant from this cycle either. He is not here to expose the IRGC’s secrets; rather, he aims to use the disappearance of oil barrels as a political weapon to pressure his economy minister. Pezeshkian, in turn, seeks to use this issue to force his rivals into retreat in the power struggle. That is why, once the uproar over the 'impeachment' and 'resignation' subsided, Pezeshkian also stopped talking about corruption and fuel smuggling. However, the trail of smuggled 20, 30, or even 50 million barrels of oil is such a massive scandal that its signs occasionally emerge in the regime’s internal power and wealth struggles, as voiced by its own figures and media. The Tabnak website, affiliated with former IRGC commander Mohsen Rezaei, reported on December 28, quoting Alireza Salimi, a member of the parliament’s presidium: 'The oil minister told our commission that we are buying nearly 9 million liters of fuel from smugglers. So you know who the smugglers are because you’re buying from them! The trail is in your hands. Losing 20 million liters is a big deal—it’s no joke.' Some regime-affiliated experts claim that the actual amount of fuel smuggling is far greater than 20 or 30 million liters per day. The state-run Arman-e Emrooz newspaper, on December 23, quoted an economic expert: 'We consume 120 million liters of gasoline per day. Of this, only 70 million liters are actual domestic consumption—the rest is smuggled out of the country… Hossein Raghfar stated that this cannot be carried out solely by border porters or ordinary individuals; rather, it is an organized operation—in other words, a government-run enterprise.' By 'government-run,' he refers to the regime’s own machinery of looting, crime, and oppression. The same apparatus that, under the banner of the IRGC, burned dozens of impoverished Baluchi fuel carriers alive in their vehicles in March 2021. At that time, the IRGC attempted to block fuel carriers by digging deep ditches and setting up roadblocks. At the Askan border point, they opened fire with tank-mounted machine guns on the fuel carriers and the people who came to support them.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6ury-EUX16IZ5	2025-03-14T17:03:32-07:00	
Closing Signs Are Signs Of The Times – OpEd	By Mark Thornton It was not long ago when signs for 'Help Wanted' seemed to be in every store window. That is starting to be replaced in 2024 and 2025 with 'Store Closing' signs. This switcheroo tells us volumes about how people and the economy are adjusting to the Fed’s money printing business. While the government and the wealthy elite benefit from the money printing, consumers and workers only seem to suffer. I do feel sorry for the rank-and-file workers in the economy, but my greatest gratitude and admiration is for the entrepreneurs and managers that are responsible for our prosperity, provide all the real jobs, and, in addition, create the tax base. Their much-maligned work and the changes they have been forced to make are truly remarkable in the face of the onslaught of change that has been unleashed by the government and the Federal Reserve, especially since covid. According to the ABCT, firings, mass layoffs and closures are late-stage events that are predictable from the previous stages starting with the Fed’s money printing. It is not the result of some random or mysterious psychological process. Sure, managers make plenty of what appear to be bonehead decisions, but I don’t envy them for the tough decisions they have to make every day. We know it’s a Fed-caused business cycle because the trends happen in stages along with spikes in the data, rather than in a normal fashion, with no spikes and correlation—so large numbers of 'Help Wanted' signs followed later by large numbers of 'Store Closure' signs. The time of adjustment with business cycles is uncertain. We don’t know exactly how much time will be involved or exactly how events will unfold. We do know that Trump’s tariffs will make things worse, but not by how much. The ways in which people have been adapting is particularly illuminating to the cause of the cycle—the Fed’s money supply expansion, but also to the fact that it causes, not just higher prices, but that it does cause a cyclical disturbance and that it creates winners and losers, and that, above all else, paper money is not neutral! Last year, retail closures reached 3/4 of the covid peak (boosted by some corporate bankruptcies) including large numbers of Family Dollar stores, CVS pharmacies, and Big Lots. That number is expected to double in 2025, led by Party City, Walgreens, 7-Eleven, and Macy’s. According to Intelligent HQ, in 2024 the: Goldman Sachs survey found that 91% of small business owners are struggling with the current economic impact on their industries. 56% report that the situation has worsened since the beginning of the year. Are small business owners prepared for these upcoming challenges in 2025? Of course, many small independent businesses are also closing, partly for traditional reasons because small independent businesses fail a lot even in normal times, but also for cycle-related reasons, such as a downturn in the real income of their consumers and the abnormally and stubbornly rising costs due to monetary inflation by the Fed. Changing consumer trends have been happening forever and the online trend has been firmly in place for 25 years and the delivery trend for over 5 years. These are also chains that are both opening and closing stores in large numbers. The retail landscape has already been adapting to those changing trends. One trend that we have been pointing to is the economic pinch inflation has on low and middle-income families. See the recent episode on how inflation is impacting 'satisfaction' and voting patterns. There are also signs that consumers are trading down from Target, to Walmart, and to the dollar stores, in addition to just 'doing without.' The other dominant trend is the stubbornness of rising costs. Labor has become more expensive and scarce in many occupations. The costs of materials and goods continue to rise. Rent, utilities, insurance continue to rise. The cost of government red tape and access to capital are major problems. This is frustrating to consumers and business owners alike. Business closures and startups are visible, but entrepreneurs and managers have been working at a frantic pace to keep companies operational and profitable enough to stay in business and expand. Staffing and shift changes, input mixes, technological fixes, product lines, and operating hours are just some of the noteworthy aspects or 'margins' of the business that have been changing at revolutionary speed compared to normal conditions. Of course, customers don’t like price hikes, surcharges, and automated tipping, but—under the circumstances—it is completely understandable. There are also business-specific changes that have been made. A restaurant may have transitioned from dine-in only to take-out only, to dine-in and take out, added delivery, and become a catering-only business in a matter of a few years. The menu had to change, hours of operation, along with big staffing changes. Inventories and suppliers of food items, condiments, and cleaning supplies all changed. Washing dishes and glasses might now all be replaced with take-out containers. The industrial dishwasher might be just sitting there, taking up space, or replaced with some cooking unit and the dishwasher crew replaced with a delivery crew or social media contractor. Even the politicized choice of what type of straw to offer customers has become a tense business decision! As Hayek pointed out, the knowledge to make such changes only exists in the mind of individuals at the local level. Their incentive to profit and stay in business is the reason for the dependability of capitalism. You should read Ludwig von Mises’s article 'Profit and Loss.' Artificial intelligence might help with this small business decision-making and that of their franchise-chain big brothers, but it will never be able to replace it. Of course, Hayek’s point also lays bare the general ineptitude of government-run operations to even keep up under such dynamic or even normal conditions! Government bureaucracies can only continue to exist with subsidized, routinized operations. The main source of our frustrations as consumers is the Federal Reserve. I will continue to be grateful to the entrepreneurs and managers and their staff for trudging through these difficult times.

Trump Sees ‘Very Good Chance’ Of Peace After ‘Productive’ Talks W...	(RFE/RL) -- US President Donald Trump said he sees a 'very good chance' for peace between Ukraine and Russia after 'very good and productive discussions' between US officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a March 14 post on his Truth Social site, Trump also said the United States had urged Russia to spare the lives of 'thousands' of Ukrainian soldiers that Putin has said have been isolated by Russian troops in Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine disputes that claim. The post came just hours after the Kremlin said it was 'cautiously optimistic' following a meeting late on March 13 between Putin and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. 'We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end,' Trump wrote. Trump added that 'thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position.' 'I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared,' he wrote. 'This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II.' Putin said a day earlier that a group of Ukrainian troops were 'isolated' in the Kursk region, the site of a surprise incursion by Ukrainian forces last August. Responding to Trump's plea on March 14, he said the soldiers' lives would be spared if they surrendered and urged Kyiv to order them to do so. Officials in Kyiv have said that while Ukrainian forces have been slowly withdrawing in the Kursk region under heavy pressure from Russian troops, but the armed forces general staff said on March 14 that '[r]eports of the alleged 'encirclement' of Ukrainian units...in the Kursk region are false and fabricated.' 'There is no threat of encirclement of our units,' it said in a statement on social media. Zelenskyy Challenges Putin's Motives Earlier on March 14, Putin's spokesman said there were grounds for 'cautious optimism' over Trump's 30-day cease-fire proposal, which Ukraine accepted earlier this week at talks with US officials in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine, meanwhile, questioned Moscow's sincerity in ending the war, which is now in its fourth year since Russia's full-scale invasion on February 2022. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that Putin sent Trump a message about his cease-fire proposal after his talks with Witkoff in the Russian capital. 'When Mr Witkoff brings all the information to President Trump, we will determine the timing of a conversation (between Trump and Putin). There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic,' Peskov said. Putin said a day earlier that he agrees in principle with the US proposal for a temporary cease-fire with Ukraine, but added that 'there are nuances,' such as Western weapons deliveries to Kyiv, that he wants addressed first. The Russian leader also said any agreement should lead to long-term peace that addresses the 'root' reasons for the war, an apparent reference to NATO expansion and other developments Putin claims have put Russia's security in jeopardy. In a video posted late on March 13, Zelenskyy questioned Putin's motives, saying the Russian leader was preparing to reject the proposal but was afraid to tell Trump.'That's why in Moscow they are imposing upon the idea of a cease-fire these conditions -- so that nothing happens at all, or so that it cannot happen for as long as possible,' Zelenskyy said. He followed up on March 14 with a post on social media accusing the Kremlin of trying to 'complicate and drag out the process.' 'Russia is the only party that wants the war to continue and diplomacy to break down,' he said on X after a call with the Secretary of State of the Holy See, cardinal Pietro Parolin. Putin's Response To Trump's Pressure Kyiv agreed to Trump's 30-day cease-fire proposal at a meeting in Jeddah on March 11, putting the onus for peace in Moscow's lap. Putin's response threw the ball back into US hands, at least to some degree. Trump called Putin's initial reaction to peace talk developments 'promising' but incomplete, though he added he hoped Russia would 'do the right thing' and agree to the deal. 'I think the Russians are keen not to be seen as the intransigent party as that could lead to consequences from Trump, such as sanctions. So that informed Putin's comments today,' John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank, told RFE/RL. Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine a top priority since taking office for a second term less than two months ago, and is wielding US leverage to get both Kyiv and Moscow to the table. On March 13, the US administration heightened pressure on Russia by increasing restrictions on the country's oil, gas, and banking sectors. Among the measures, the Treasury Department was allowing the expiration of a 60-day exemption put in place in January by the Biden administration that let some energy transactions involving sanctioned Russian banks continue. The move would make it more difficult for other nations, especially in Europe, to buy Russian oil. Meanwhile, the foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) -- which includes the United States, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan -- said they discussed imposing more sanctions on Russia and boosting support for Ukraine if the Kremlin does not agree to the cease-fire. Among the measures discussed during the March 13-14 meeting were caps on the price for Russian oil exports, they said in a joint statement. Western nations in late 2022 imposed a $60-a-barrel price cap on the export of Russian oil using Western ships or insurance. It is unclear if the G7 discussions touched on lowering the price cap. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, which account for a third of federal budget revenues. In a joint statement following the meeting, the G7 said that 'we reaffirmed our unwavering support for Ukraine in defending its territorial integrity and right to exist, and its freedom, sovereignty, and independence.' 'We welcomed ongoing efforts to achieve a ceasefire, and in particular the meeting on March 11 between the US and Ukraine in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,' it added. Putin also said there were several unanswered questions in the proposal, such as what to do about Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region. 'If we have a cease-fire, does that mean that everyone there would leave?' Putin said. 'Should we release them [Ukrainian troops] after they committed crimes against the population? Or would they surrender?' Ukraine denies committing such crimes, saying it abides by humanitarian law and does not target civilians. Why Should Russia Agree To A Cease-Fire? Kyiv seized a swath of the Kursk region in a stealth incursion in August, a move seen as an effort to divert Russian forces from eastern Ukraine and use the territory as a bargaining chip in any peace talks. That strategy is now failing as Russian forces supported by North Korean troops push the Ukrainians out of Kursk. Russia has regained more than half the territory in Kursk initially captured by Ukraine. Zelenskyy told reporters on March 14 that the situation in Kursk was 'obviously very difficult.' Among the other concerns Putin voiced about the cease-fire proposal is whether Ukraine would use the 30-day period to mobilize and train forces or rearm with the help of the West. He also raised the question of how the nearly 2,000-kilometer front would be monitored. Zelenskyy told reporters that the front could be monitored by US satellites. Experts had warned that Putin would likely seek to drag out cease-fire talks because his forces have the upper hand on the battlefield. Aside from the advances in Kursk, Russia is gaining territory in eastern Ukraine -- albeit at high human and material costs -- due to its significant manpower advantage. However, Zelenskyy said Ukraine has stopped Russian forces at the gates of Pokrovsk, a key logistical hub in Donetsk region, after months of fighting on the outskirts of the city. Zelenskyy asserted that the incursion into Kursk forced Russia to pull forces from eastern Ukraine, giving his troops time to defend the city. Russia is seeking to capture at a minimum the entirety of the four regions of Ukraine it claims to have annexed in September 2022: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson. A cease-fire freezing the current front lines would leave them short of that goal. 'One way the Russians could slow down this process without coming out directly and saying 'no', is by dragging out those technical discussions on monitoring' the cease-fire, Hardie said. 'That could also give them ways to try to pin the blame back on Ukraine, by insisting on certain technical matters that Ukraine might find objectionable,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uk4N6JyS2bBV	2025-03-14T16:59:42-07:00	
NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 Launches To International Space Station	Four crew members of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 mission launched at 7:03 p.m. EDT Friday from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a science expedition aboard the International Space Station. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelled the Dragon spacecraft into orbit carrying NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov. The spacecraft will dock autonomously to the forward-facing port of the station’s Harmony module at approximately 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 15. Shortly after docking, the crew will join Expedition 72/73 for a long-duration stay aboard the orbiting laboratory. 'Congratulations to our NASA and SpaceX teams on the 10th crew rotation mission under our commercial crew partnership. This milestone demonstrates NASA’s continued commitment to advancing American leadership in space and driving growth in our national space economy,' said NASA acting Administrator Janet Petro.'Through these missions, we are laying the foundation for future exploration, from low Earth orbit to the Moon and Mars. Our international crew will contribute to innovative science research and technology development, delivering benefits to all humanity.' During Dragon’s flight, SpaceX will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Hawthorne, California. NASA will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. NASA’s live coverage resumes at 9:45 p.m., March 15, on NASA+ with rendezvous, docking, and hatching opening. After docking, the crew will change out of their spacesuits and prepare cargo for offload before opening the hatch between Dragon and the space station’s Harmony module around 1:05 a.m., Sunday, March 16. Once the new crew is aboard the orbital outpost, NASA will broadcast welcome remarks from Crew-10 and farewell remarks from the agency's SpaceX Crew-9 crew, beginning at about 1:40 a.m. The number of crew aboard the space station will increase to 11 for a short time as Crew-10 joins NASA astronauts Nick Hague, Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore, and Don Pettit, as well as Roscosmos cosmonauts Aleksandr Gorbunov, Alexey Ovchinin, and Ivan Vagner. Following a brief handover period, Hague, Williams, Wilmore, and Gorbunov will return to Earth no earlier than Wednesday, March 19.Ahead of Crew-9’s departure from station, mission teams will review weather conditions at the splashdown sites off the coast of Florida. With this mission, NASA continues to maximize the use of the orbiting laboratory, where people have lived and worked continuously for more than 24 years, testing technologies, performing science, and developing the skills needed to operate future commercial destinations in low Earth orbit and explore farther from our home planet. Research conducted at the space station benefits people on Earth and paves the way for future long-duration missions to the Moon under NASA’s Artemis campaign and beyond.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uhFkACzhMr4z	2025-03-14T16:58:22-07:00	
How Merz Hopes To End The Indecisive ‘German Vote’ In Brussels	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- Europe's fate partly lies in the hands of sixteen Germans. That's how many negotiators will design the future European policy of the continent’s largest and most populous economy, as the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) thrash out a coalition agreement in talks that started yesterday. The section on European affairs in the agreement has not usually been a major priority. But this time around, the negotiators got a special assignment from the very top. After three years of German indecision in Brussels, Friedrich Merz, the Christian Democrat chancellor-in-waiting, wants the country to take on a major leadership role in deciding the response to the myriad of challenges facing the continent. His solution? An institutional redesign that would assign more power over European policymaking to himself. It would help avoid the chronic deadlock between successive multi-party governments that's left Berlin silent on key EU issues in recent years. But it's also likely to ruffle feathers in coalition talks that are only just getting underway. Merz stresses that the alternative would be dire, however: 'If Germany remains silent, (...) we are also damaging the ability of the entire European community to act,' he said in a programmatic speech on his future foreign policy in January. Chronic indecision in Berlin The SPD likely shares Merz's diagnosis, as few were happy about the impression that Germany's SPD-led three-party coalition left in Brussels over the last three years. With European decision-making divvied up between different parties and ministries, indecision on key issues has been a problem at least since the days of Angela Merkel's 'Grand Coalitions'. Where the French president has almost full authority over his country's European course, the chancellor must find a common position within his government. When German coalition partners fail to agree on a joint position, then Berlin must abstain from voting on EU legislation – an outcome that's become so common it's dubbed the 'German vote'. In Berlin, a multi-departmental legislative file like EU migration reform has to be greenlighted by all ministries involved, requiring – in the case of migration – the approval of the foreign and interior ministers. Even the responsibility for coordination is split. The Chancellery's EU department can step in to adjudicate political conflicts between the parties; but the Foreign Office and the Economy Ministry are formally in charge of coordination between ministries, government sources explained. They also split responsibility for prepping European Council summits with the Chancellery, while a junior minister at the Foreign Office controls the EU reform and enlargement portfolios. That gives the Foreign Office – typically held by a junior coalition partner – a good deal of influence over EU matters. In short, it is a patchwork of overlapping responsibilities that has often left little space for Berlin to put forward a cohesive European vision. Things deteriorated under outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party government, which featured near-constant conflict between Scholz's Social Democrats, the Greens and the free-market liberal Free Democrats (FDP). 'In this past legislative period, almost all ministers [lacked] a sense for Europe,' acknowledged one SPD source, also pointing to Scholz's detachment from the issue, as he is mainly 'a transatlanticist'. The coalition partners repeatedly failed to engage with key EU legislation until the last minute, only to ultimately abstain from taking any position at all over a lack of agreement in Berlin. The most notorious example was the EU's proposed ban on the sale of new petrol cars, which had been fully negotiated in Brussels – only to be blocked when Germany pulled out just before the final vote due to an internal veto by the FDP. That Germany, home to a mighty car industry, hadn't weighed in earlier left many elsewhere in the EU baffled and irritated. Is a mightier Merz the answer? Merz has vowed to end all of the above. He is not planning on taking chances by relying on verbal commitments alone, as the previous coalition agreement did. Merz is aiming for an institutional redesign, as he outlined in January. The first pillar will be to create a powerful new national security council that he hopes to turn into 'the centre of gravity for the government's collective decision-making on all the main issues of foreign, security, development, and European policy'. The second pillar is to unite the steering power over European policy directly under the chancellor. The catch? Getting his perspective coalition partners to go along with that power grab won’t be easy. Creating a security council is likely the least controversial part, as the SPD had previously attempted to create such an institution under Scholz, only to be blocked by the Greens. But with an SPD politician almost certain to lay claim to the Foreign Office, it's unlikely they'd agree to shipping those European competences over to the Chancellery without a fight. 'I think we would protest strongly,' said the SPD source. 'We would not be smart if we left European policy entirely to the Christian Democrats, because European policy is also extremely important for the crucial areas of the economy and energy.' Experts still believe that Merz has a chance to improve European policy coordination, as the SPD's new leaders also have an interest in strengthening Germany's leadership in Europe, according to an analysis of the wider European impact of the German election by the Jacques Delors Centre's Johannes Lindner, Thu Nguyen, and Jannik Jansen. 'However, complete centralisation in the Chancellery will not be possible – if only because of [ministerial independence] and the need for coordination between the CDU/CSU and SPD,' Lindner told Euractiv. A lot will hinge on ministers' ability to improve timely coordination, he argued. 'The coalition negotiations now are a first test of how close they are to each other on the most important European policy issues.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uoPqLIm06F-w	2025-03-14T16:53:45-07:00	
All Eyes On Putin For Next Step To Ukraine Peace – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Global events can move quickly. Just two weeks ago, the world watched as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a heated exchange with US President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance in the Oval Office. A planned rare earths mineral deal was scrapped at the last minute, and Zelensky was sent out of the White House in an unprecedented diplomatic standoff. But hard work and sincere diplomacy can pay off. Behind the scenes, both sides worked tirelessly to repair the relationship, culminating in a high-stakes meeting in Jeddah this week that brought the US-Ukraine relationship back on track and set the stage for what could be the first meaningful step toward ending Russia’s three-year invasion of Ukraine. Trump has been clear about his desire to end the war, but since returning to office in January he has learned that this is easier said than done. The meeting in Jeddah was the first concrete step in that process. One of Trump’s biggest criticisms of Ukraine during the heated White House exchange was that he did not believe Zelensky was sincere about wanting peace. After Jeddah, that perception has changed. The US and Ukraine agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire on land, at sea, and in the air — a deal that could be extended if all parties agree. However, Kyiv would not implement it unless Moscow agreed to do the same. Forty-eight hours later, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he supported the idea of a ceasefire but added conditions that make its implementation uncertain. The US and Ukraine also finalized the draft of the minerals deal that had been abandoned at the White House. Trump has even invited Zelensky back to the Oval Office, signaling a major turnaround in their strained relationship. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: 'The ball is in Russia’s court.' Last week I made my fourth visit to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Anyone who has spent time there knows that Ukrainians want an end to the war. They endure nightly air raids, missile strikes, and drone attacks. They also understand the long-term threat that Russia poses if there are no real security guarantees. For those of us who have seen wartime Ukraine firsthand, it has always been obvious that the Ukrainian people want the fighting to end. Yet some around Trump question whether Zelensky shares this view. After Jeddah, there is no longer any doubt. It is now up to Russia to decide whether to pursue peace. There is still a long way to go, and plenty of opportunities for setbacks. Even if a temporary ceasefire were agreed on, the war would be far from over. The night before the Jeddah talks, Ukraine launched its largest drone strike yet, sending nearly 400 to hit targets as far away as Moscow. Meanwhile Russia has continued its relentless bombardment of Ukraine with missiles and drones on a near-nightly basis. When I visited the front lines in the Kherson region, it was clear that decisions made in Jeddah, Washington, or Moscow are often irrelevant to those fighting on the ground. For the soldiers in the trenches, survival is the only priority. Until an actual ceasefire is implemented — not just discussed — nothing will change for them. Another major development in the war, and one that represents a significant setback for Ukraine, is Russia’s counteroffensive in its Kursk region. Ukraine launched a surprise attack last August and captured a sizeable portion of territory. The idea was to hold on to this land as a bargaining chip for future negotiations. But over the past seven months, Russian forces — bolstered by thousands of North Korean troops — have steadily regained control. Last week it appears that Moscow had completed its recapture of all the territory Ukraine seized. It will be up to future historians to assess whether the Kursk offensive accomplished tactical objectives or if it was a strategic miscalculation. In the short term, however, it does not help Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table. The loss of Kursk weakens its leverage. After traveling around Ukraine this past week, I am certain of one thing: the Ukrainian people are exhausted from the war. But they also know they have no choice but to keep fighting as long as Russia continues its aggression. If there is to be any lasting peace, it must include security guarantees ensuring that Russia will not attack again. This is the biggest challenge for Kyiv. Trump has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine and has shifted the responsibility for security guarantees on to Europe. However, because the U.S. and most European countries operate under the same security umbrella, in practice it would be difficult to separate American and European commitments. The road to peace is long, and the war is far from over. The ongoing fighting in Donetsk, Kursk, and Kherson proves that reality. The biggest question now is whether the progress made in Jeddah will hold. There is always the risk that Trump is looking for a short-term political victory rather than a lasting peace agreement. If the ceasefire collapses, the war will probably escalate again, and Ukraine may find itself in an even more difficult position than before. For now, all eyes are on Moscow. The coming weeks will determine whether Russia is serious about peace or if the war will continue indefinitely. Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

California Endangers Self-Defense – OpEd	Last August in downtown San Francisco, an armed gunman stalked San Francisco 49ers rookie receiver Ricky Pearsall and demanded his watch along with everything he carried. Pearsall refused to comply and in the ensuing struggle took a bullet in the chest. The attack brought no public comment from Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco, and state Attorney General Rob Bonta. Also holding off was Assemblyman Rick Zbur, Los Angeles Democrat and Harvard law alum. Zbur’s new bill makes a case that Pearsall should have handed over his valuables, run away, or both. According to Zbur’s Assembly Bill 1333, the use of deadly force by an innocent party—'homicide' in the bill’s text—is not justified: When the person was outside of their residence and knew that using force likely to cause death or great bodily injury could have been avoided with complete safety by retreating. When the person used more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against a danger. When the person was the assailant, engaged in mutual combat, or knowingly engaged in conduct reasonably likely to provoke a person to commit a felony or do some great bodily injury, except if either of the following circumstances apply: The person reasonably believed that they were in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury, and had exhausted every reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use of force likely to cause death or great bodily injury. In good faith, the person withdrew from the encounter with the other assailant or assailants and indicated clearly to the other assailant or assailants that the person desired to withdraw and terminated the use of any force, but the other assailant or assailants continued or resumed the use of force. According to Zbur, his bill 'was never intended to limit a crime victim’s right to defend yourself, your family, or home.' In an X post now unavailable, Zbur claimed, 'the goal is to prevent wannabe vigilantes like Kyle Rittenhouse from provoking violence & claiming self defense after the fact.' The assemblyman failed to note that Rittenhouse, 18, deployed deadly force while under attack and was acquitted of all charges. Zbur did not cite the looters who gunned down retired St. Louis policeman David Dorn or any of the many homicides during the 2020 riots in cities across the nation. A politician concerned about public safety might also have cited James Hodgkinson, who in 2017 deployed an SKS rifle against members of Congress as they played baseball. The attack nearly killed Rep. Steve Scalise, who had no time to run away. Consider also wannabe assassin Thomas Mathew Crooks. On July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania, the 20-year-old Crooks eluded the Secret Service detail and got off eight shots, wounding presidential candidate Donald Trump, killing rally attendee Corey Comperatore, and wounding James Copenhaver and David Dutch. None of the attendees had time to flee. Californians can be forgiven for believing that AB-1333 benefits violent criminals while menacing the people’s right to self-defense. They might examine The Right to Bear Arms: A Constitutional Right of the People or a Privilege of the Ruling Class? by Stephen P. Halbrook, author of That Every Man Be Armed: Evolution of a Constitutional Right. And while debating AB-1333, know that a more dangerous bill is already state law. In September 2018, Gov. Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 1391, which bars all prosecution of criminals under 16 in adult court. That means anyone under the age of 16 could murder Ricky Pearsall, be tried only in juvenile court, and gain release at age 25. The 49er miraculously survived and played well in his first season. His attacker has been charged with attempted murder, assault with a semiautomatic weapon, and attempted second-degree robbery. At this writing, the 17-year-old has yet to be publicly identified.

ComInfFest 2025: MTUCI Discusses Prospects For Exporting Russian ...	An initiative, designed to foster a strategic collaboration between educational institutions from Russia and Africa, is set to bring together exceptional young professionals in the field of information technology. On 13th March 2025, the Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI) hosted a large-scale roundtable discussion on 'Exporting Russian IT Education' as part of the International Science Festival 'Festival of Communications and Informatics Science - ComInfFest 2025'. The event became an important platform for discussing issues of promoting Russian educational programs in the field of information technology in the international arena. The roundtable was attended by representatives of embassies of 15 foreign countries and diasporas, interested government bodies of the Russian Federation, leading IT companies, international student organizations, as well as the president of the Cameroonian diaspora in the Russian Federation and chairman of the commission for work with African diasporas of the Russian-African Club of Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov, Louis Gouend. MTUCI Rector Sergey Erokhin, the roundtable moderator, emphasized the growing interest in Russian IT education students from different countries, noting the need to create favorable conditions for their successful studies, adaptation, and professional development. Deputy Head of Rossotrudnichestvo Pavel Shevtsov emphasized the importance of creating attractive conditions for professional growth and employment of foreign students. Louis Gouend emphasized the importance of strengthening ties between the Russian and African educational communities and the role of the Russian IT sector in developing the potential of African students. He also touched upon the issues of adaptation of international students, proposing innovative integration methods and stressed that Africa will be a huge growing market for Russian IT education by 2050. The participants discussed issues of social and cultural adaptation, competitiveness of Russian education, and ways to overcome language barriers. The experts further emphasized the need for active interaction with foreign partners, popularization of Russian IT education, as well as interaction between educational institutions and businesses to create practical-oriented programs. At the end of the large-scale roundtable, Louis Gouend discussed with the university management the possibility of receiving subsidies for African students studying in the preparatory course. Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI) is a Russian university which specializes in the field of information technology, telecommunications, and information security. It currently has an enrollment of approximately 15,000 students. In January 1992, in accordance with Order of the Government of Russia, it received the status of as a technical university and transformed into the Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uq9tKE1kHGaX	2025-03-14T16:46:06-07:00	
Iraq Says Key Islamic State Leader Is Dead	By Jeff Seldin One of the Islamic State terror group's most senior leaders is reportedly dead, killed in what Iraq is describing as a U.S.-supported operation. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani posted on social media Friday that the country's intelligence service 'successfully eliminated' IS deputy caliph Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rufay'i. Sudani did not say when or how al-Rufay'i was killed, calling the death a 'significant security achievement.' Iraqi special forces, in a subsequent post on the X social media platform, said al-Rufay’i was killed Thursday in an airstrike targeting his location in Iraq’s Anbar desert. Officials said the strike was the result of a two-year effort to track his location, with breakthroughs coming in the past six months. The officials also said they arrested seven additional IS members, including two women, in a follow-up operation in Anbar. Intelligence collected at the scene of the airstrike further led to the arrest of another five people in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil. Iraqi officials said that al-Rufay'i, also known as Abu Khadija, was the top IS official for Iraq and Syria, and that he also played a key role in the group's external operations. A recent United Nations report, based on intelligence from U.N. member states, said al-Rufay'i ran IS operations across Iraq, Syria, Turkey and other parts of the Middle East. Other U.N. intelligence reports have identified al-Rufay'i as a member of IS' delegated committee, viewed as the terror group's most influential executive body. U.S. officials have yet to comment on the Iraqi claims. Various intelligence estimates put the number of IS fighters across Iraq and Syria at between 1,500 and 3,000, with the majority operating out of Syria. U.S. military officials warned in July of a possible IS resurgence in the region, saying the terror group was on a pace to more than double the number of attacks it had carried out in Iraq and Syria the previous year. More recently, in December, U.S. forces carried out a series of airstrikes against IS in Syria, hitting targets in areas abandoned by counterterror forces loyal to former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Despite those operations, intelligence shared by the U.N. indicated IS has been trying to take advantage of the fall of the Assad regime and resulting political turmoil. The U.N. report also said IS 'maintained the ability to operate and replace field commanders.' Yet while Iraq and Syria are central to IS' founding ideology, there has been a growing consensus among intelligence officials and experts that the terror group no longer sees the Middle East as its base for global operations. Officials, including those from the U.S., have said there is growing confidence that the group is now being led by Abdul Qadir Mumin, who has been based in Somalia, where he rose to prominence as the emir of the group's Somali affiliate, IS-Somalia. An offensive launched by forces in Somalia's Puntland region earlier this month, in part to chase after Mumin, has met with surprising success, pushing IS-Somalia out of some of its key strongholds. But the campaign has yet to find any traces of Mumin or other top IS leaders.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6unM1X-0KuOaN	2025-03-14T16:44:34-07:00	
US Sanctions Thai Officials For Deporting Uyghurs To China	By Alex Willemyns U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday announced visa sanctions against Thai government officials involved in last month’s deportation of 40 Uyghurs to China, where they likely face torture as part of what American officials call an ongoing 'genocide.' The men had been held in immigration detention in Thailand since escaping China’s persecution in 2014. The Thai government’s decision to return them to China on Feb. 27 was criticized by the United States, European Union, United Nations and global human rights groups. Rubio said the U.S. visa bans will apply to Thai officials 'responsible for, or complicit in, the forced return of Uyghurs' to China, where he said 'they are subject to torture and enforced disappearances.' 'In light of China’s longstanding acts of genocide and crimes against humanity committed against Uyghurs, we call on governments around the world not to forcibly return Uyghurs and other groups to China,' Rubio said in a statement issued by the U.S. State Department. The statement also said some family members of the officials may be banned from traveling to the United States under the blacklisting. The State Department did not respond to an inquiry from Radio Free Asia about how many officials would be subjected to the ban. Officials at the department routinely decline to identify the names of those hit with visa bans, citing U.S. immigration laws around privacy. The United States has since 2021 described China’s persecution of the mostly Muslim ethnic Uyghurs as a 'genocide,' leveling accusations of torture, forced sterilization and slavery against Chinese officials. Beijing rejects the claims and says it only promotes development and vocational training in far-western Xinjiang, where most Uyghurs live. Close alliance The deportation of the Uyghurs and the visa sanctions is a rare case of acrimony between longtime allies in the United States and Thailand. In the days after the Feb. 27 deportation, a State Department official confirmed to RFA that U.S. diplomats offered to resettle the Uyghurs either in the United States or a third country, while a Thai opposition lawmaker said Australia and Sweden also made similar offers. Thai Vice Foreign Minister Russ Jalichandra eventually acknowledged that such offers had been made but said that Bangkok had finally agreed to return the Uyghurs to China to avoid inevitable 'retaliation from China that would impact the livelihoods of many Thais.' Rubio had said during his Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 15 that he believed he could use America’s close historical relationship with Thailand to ensure the Uyghurs were not returned to Thailand. 'The good news is that Thailand is actually a very strong U.S. partner, a strong historical ally as well, and so that is an area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results, because of how important that relationship is and how close it is,' Rubio said at that time. World Uyghur Congress executive committee chair Rushan Abbas welcomed Friday’s visa bans, saying the move sent a clear warning to other governments that 'they will face consequences' for working with China to return escaped Uyghurs. 'This announcement is a critical step in holding those complicit in these egregious forced deportations accountable,' Abbas told RFA. 'For Uyghurs, forced return to China is tantamount to a death sentence, exposing them to torture, forced labor and enforced disappearances,' she said. 'This policy delivers a strong message that aiding China’s crimes will not go unpunished.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6upLVSL1FOAHP	2025-03-14T16:42:39-07:00	
End Of Unipolarity: A Chance For Change – OpEd	Global conflict and uncertainty are nothing new, but since the 2008/09 economic crash, they have worsened exponentially. The arrival of President Trump has dramatically exacerbated the situation, turning turbulence into chaos and anxiety into fear. Governments and institutions are reeling after just seven weeks of Trump, his vice president J.D. Vance, and Elon 'Chainsaw' Musk—figures so extreme they make Trump seem moderate by comparison. It is impossible to keep track of the carnage (executive orders alone – 73 signed in the first 30 days). The strategy appears to be to overwhelm everyone – the Democrats (who appear shell shocked), foreign governments, the media, and the public, so nobody will notice the details. Since 20 January, a barrage of barbaric policy decisions and executive lunacy has flowed from the Oval Office, often involving actions that shatter tradition, flout the law, and violate the Constitution. A new world order and shifting alliances are in the air. Could the storm being unleashed by Trump and Co. inadvertently lead to positive structural and systemic change? Global Disruption The dominant global structure since the Second World War has been one of U.S. unipolarity, marked by global domination in which America has faced no significant competition or threat from other states. It is from this position—one that, in the American context, has bred increasing levels of paranoia—that Trump speaks when he says the U.S. will 'have' Gaza, based on American authority. Trump appears intent on breaking everything, destabilizing global institutions, and shattering long-held ideals like global unity, shared prosperity, and a 'one world' vision. Such concepts are being abandoned as international bodies are attacked and long-standing rules of global exchange are dismantled. At the stroke of a chunky black pen, the U.S. was formally withdrawn from several United Nations bodies, including the World Health Organization (its largest donor), the Human Rights Council (UNHRC), and UNRWA, the UN agency supporting Palestinians. The World Trade Organization (WTO) also faces threats due to Trump’s aggressive tariff policies. A review of U.S. involvement in UNESCO (the UN’s educational, scientific, and cultural agency) and U.S. funding for the United Nations itself has been ordered. Citing ‘the wild disparities in levels of funding among different countries,’ White House staff secretary Will Scharf explained that the decision was also a protest against ‘anti-American bias’ within UN agencies, though no specific examples of such prejudice were provided. Old alliances are hanging by a thread; the Palestinians’ right to a homeland has been swept aside, with ethnic cleansing of Gaza openly touted, and Israel given free rein to be even more barbaric—if such a thing is even possible. Aid organizations have been decimated, Europe and Ukraine are criticized, and Russia and Putin receive accolades. Canada and Greenland are eyed as potential U.S. states, and Trump wants to reclaim the Panama Canal and transform Gaza into a Palestinian-free Mediterranean resort under ‘American authority. Whatever disruptive actions Trump takes, others can—and potentially will—mimic, particularly other far-right leaders. This is especially troubling in relation to the Paris Agreement and global support for United Nations agencies. The UN is entirely reliant on member states for funding to carry out its life-saving work. Should nations begin to argue over their contributions and withhold payments, the valuable work the UN is doing around the world would be threatened The Trump Storm has thrown governments and organizations worldwide into turmoil, and after 70 years of U.S. hegemony, during which Western geopolitics and global affairs have overwhelmingly been designed and administered from Washington—often with disastrous consequences—there is talk of a new world order. It is not, however, a visionary, hopeful new world based on unifying principles and the oneness of humanity. Instead, it’s yet another divisive model rooted in power, ideology, and global dominance: Will China take over? Will Russia seek to expand its territory? What role will Europe play? Is the Trans-Atlantic Alliance shattered? And so on. The conversation centers around uncertainty, security, and defense capabilities. It’s more of the same unimaginative, duplicitous rhetoric we’ve heard for decades—a shocking reflection of the appalling quality of leaders currently in office, the corrupt nature of politics, and the extent to which the military-industrial complex and the corporate world hold sway. A Vision for Fundamental Change What is needed is not a new old world order, but a creative reimagining of civilization—a shift in values and ideals that shapes new and just systems and cultivates principles of goodness—cooperation, sharing, tolerance, and understanding. Gradual yet fundamental change that moves beyond manipulating existing patterns to establish a global order based on social justice and freedom; only this will lead to peace. While far-reaching reforms designed to bring about such change could, in principle, be introduced without the total destruction of existing systems, those in power—both political and corporate—having benefited the most, are determined to maintain the status quo, regardless of the consequences for society and the natural world. This leads to the rather depressing conclusion that only a seismic downfall will enable the changes billions of people around the world long for.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uq1SJkUpma6S	2025-03-14T16:41:09-07:00	
Forceful Taiwan Reunification: China’s Targeted Military And Civi...	By Suyash Desai (FPRI) -- For nearly a century, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan have largely avoided direct military confrontations across the Taiwan Strait. However, there have been four notable exceptions: the Taiwan Strait crises of 1954–55, 1958, 1995–96, and most recently, 2022–23. In the first three instances, the status quo was primarily restored following the crisis. However, recent events suggest worrying trends highlighting that Beijing is preparing for a forceful reunification with Taiwan. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping has already made reunification with Taiwan a part of his signature China Dream, announced during the 19th Party Congress meeting in 2017. However, this was not the first time Taiwan was featured prominently in speeches by top Chinese leaders. As political scientist Ketian Zhang highlights in her book China’s Gambit: The Calculus of Coercion, annexing Taiwan is considered a core interest of China, with official references to its significance appearing regularly since 2003. The most recent instance was Xi Jinping’s New Year’s speech on December 31, 2024, where he declared, 'No one can stop the historical trend of reunification of the motherland' (誰也不能充實祖國統一的歷史大勢). But beyond rhetoric and political posturing, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has taken concrete measures over the past decade to advance Beijing’s reunification agenda. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures have intensified, reinforcing China’s willingness to use force. This article highlights the PLA’s systematic and incremental military and civilian-military measures—capabilities that might provide China with the tools to successfully conduct a potential forceful reunification with Taiwan in the near future. These measures include changing the institutions and patterns of PLA mobilization, constructing and using civilian infrastructure in military exercises, and establishing a new status quo through increasingly coercive military exercises around Taiwan. They also include standardization of the PLA for greater efficiency, effectiveness, combat readiness, stockpiling resources, and re-enlisting veterans with specific skills. This article builds upon Oriana Skylar Mastro’s arguments in her piece 'The Taiwan Temptation,' which contends that China’s expanding military capabilities and rising nationalism could drive Beijing to contemplate using force for reunification with Taiwan. It identifies granular military details, especially post-2020, but it doesn’t venture into arguments about the timing of the reunification, potential diplomatic backlash, or economic costs of the invasion. Recent Military-Civilian Measures Since 2015, the PRC has undertaken significant organizational, legal, and structural reforms to enhance the National Defense Mobilization System (NDMS) (國防動員系統). As China scholar Devin Thorne highlights in his recent testimony to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, NDMS enables the PRC to harness its political, economic, technological, cultural, social, and other civilian resources from peacetime to wartime. This helps China to address a wide range of threats, such as escalations on its border, domestic instabilities, natural disasters, and other crises. It also bolsters China’s military logistics. As Thorne highlights, the key developments include the enactment of the National Defense Transportation Law in 2017, the introduction of updated auditing and surveying data on natural resources protocols in 2018 and 2021, the establishment of new NDMS offices beginning in December 2022, the creation of a new type of highly trained and professional local militia force since 2021, and the enhancement of cross-militia training initiatives starting in 2024. The PLA can mobilize private and civilian resources through the NDMS during national emergencies. It highlights China’s determination to prepare for potential contingencies, including escalation activities on its borders with India, the Taiwan Strait, and the South China Sea. Lessons from the Russian-Ukrainian War and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have further shaped these efforts. Once operational, the NDMS would ultimately allow the PRC to mobilize society and harness civilian and military resources more systematically and institutionally in case of a potential forceful reunification attempt with Taiwan. However, mobilizing resources and force is insufficient, as China would need to reach the other side of the Taiwan Strait during a potential escalation. Some scholars dismiss the idea that the PLA remains incapable of conducting amphibious operations at the scale needed to take control of Taiwan. Amphibious operations (landing assault) are one of the five most important campaigns (alongside anti-landing, island blockade, border area counter-attack, and counter–air-raid campaigns) discussed at length in the PLA’s first written doctrine on joint operations, Joint Campaign Outline, as operational requirements to take over Taiwan by force. Taiwan has 169,000 active military personnel, backed by 1.66 million reservists. As career naval officer Harlan Ullman explains, using the traditional three-to-one ratio of attackers to defenders taught at war colleges, the PLA would need to mobilize at least 507,000 soldiers. By extension, to cross the 106-kilometer-wide Taiwan Strait to conduct landing operations, China would need thousands of ships—far more than the current PLA Navy capabilities of 234 operating warships. However, China has long been working to mobilize its civilian infrastructure to support its military campaign. For instance, the PRC has emphasized the construction of roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) (滾裝船) ships, which can use their power to set up ramps on docks or beaches to transport vehicles. Each RO–RO ship is estimated to carry at least three hundred vehicles and about fifteen hundred passengers. Since establishing the 'strategic projection support ship fleets' in China’s major ship-building companies in 2012, the PLA has actively cooperated with local shipping companies to improve maritime 'strategic delivery' capabilities by prioritizing the production of RO-RO ferries. According to naval strategist J. Michael Dahm, in January 2023, China had around thirty-one RO-RO ferries in operation. However, the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed out that the mainland shipyards would deliver up to two hundred RO-RO ships in the four years from 2023 to 2026. Furthermore, the PLA has used these ferries in military exercises in the Taiwan Strait since 2019. For instance, the first fifteen-thousand-ton ferry, Bang Chui Dao RO-RO ship (棒槌島滾裝船), participated in an amphibious assault exercise in 2019. Since then, the PLA has conducted such military exercises regularly. In July 2020, the PLA experimented with launching amphibious assault craft from civilian ferries toward the beach rather than port facilities, and it conducted day and night exercises off the coast of Guangdong Province. August 2021 was the first time the PLA used a ten-thousand-ton–class civilian ferry ship to land military exercises. Furthermore, in August 2022, after then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, six of these RO-RO ships, which are operated by the Bo Hai Ferry Group Company (渤海輪渡集團公司) and are affiliated with the PLA Maritime Militia 8th Transport Brigade (海上民兵第8運輸旅), headed south toward Xiamen—the closest point to Taiwan. The RO-RO ferries were used more frequently in cross-transportation military exercises in July and September 2023. Furthermore, it was also discovered in January 2025 that China is building at least five landing barges at the Guangzhou shipyard with unusually long road bridges that extend from the bow of the ship, which makes them relevant to amphibious landing operations. Although these vessels and barges are extremely susceptible to attacks from Taiwanese F-16s, warships, and submarines, they would be supported by the PLA Navy, PLA Air Force, and PLA Rocket Force. The Changing Nature of Coercion and Military Exercises around Taiwan On September 17, 2020, the Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense published its first real-time military update, documenting PLA incursions into Taiwan’s de facto air defense identification zone (ADIZ). As meticulously recorded by Ben Lewis and Gerald C. Brown, by January 2025, there had been approximately eight thousand PLA violations of the ADIZ, including multiple crossings of the median line. Notably, Chinese warplanes crossed the median line in 2019 for the first time since 1999. However, Nancy Pelosi’s August 2022 visit to Taiwan provided the PLA with a pretext to escalate its activities, culminating in multiple advanced military exercises conducted around Taiwan from all sides. Since August 2022, the PLA has conducted five large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. Most of them coincided with significant political events. For instance, the first military exercise in August 2022 followed Pelosi’s visit. This was succeeded by the inaugural PLA Joint Sword exercises in April 2023, coinciding with former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to the United States and her meeting with then-Speaker of the US House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy. Subsequent exercises included Joint Sword A in May 2024 and Joint Sword B in October 2024. These exercises aligned with the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te’s tenure and his National Day speech. The most recent military exercises, conducted in December 2024, were held shortly after President Lai Ching-te’s travels through the United States. Notably, President Lai did not engage with any major US leaders during his transit. However, the recent exercises display the opportunistic Chinese behavior of leveraging situations to establish a new normal through increasingly coercive activities in the Taiwan Strait. The Joint Sword A and B exercises and the December 2024 drills are particularly significant for understanding the evolution of China’s coercion pattern and the difference between China’s military posturing and its intentions in the Taiwan Strait. While the Joint Sword A and B drills were declared in advance and focused on anti-intervention and amphibious assault near Taiwan, recent December 2024 exercises intended to perform blockade, strategic deterrence, and anti-interventionism exercises. The latest exercises occurred across expanded locations like Fujian, Zhejiang, and the Western Pacific. Significantly, the December 2024 exercise, for the first time, witnessed all three of the PLA’s sea-facing theater commands—North, East, and South—jointly participating in an operation in the eastern waters of China, a key demand by the leadership to achieve multi-domain joint operations capabilities. Notably, these instances reveal that the Chinese leadership is keenly aware of the PLA’s pre-existing weaknesses, like amphibious assaults and anti-intervention operations, and has been pushing the PLA to address this gap gradually. They also leveraged elements of strategic deterrence and surprise while adhering to steps toward joint combat operations, a prerequisite for a forceful reunification. Geographically, these exercises extended beyond the Taiwan Strait to cover broader areas, including Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and the Western Pacific, indicating a shift toward controlling key maritime zones in the First Island Chain. Thus, with active participation from all major PLA services and the three sea-facing theater commands, and indulgence in numerous aspects of warfare targeted toward the PLA’s primary strategic direction—Taiwan—these exercises signalled a more nuanced and multi-layered operational focus. Multiple Standardizations within the PLA Over the past seven years, particularly in the post-pandemic period, China has prioritized comprehensive standardization of procedures with the PLA and its auxiliary support systems—non-combat systems and components that support and sustain military operations. PLA leadership has issued numerous directives to achieve uniformity across various domains, such as the construction of barracks, military equipment procurement, and the establishment of standardized military training grounds. These efforts are extended to standardizing resource allocation, engineering procurement, equipment support, logistical operations, medical services, communication infrastructure, cybersecurity systems, and intelligence gathering and analysis mechanisms. These initiatives highlight China’s attempt to enable standardization within the PLA’s military operations to enhance its overall efficiency, effectiveness, and combat readiness. Streamlining key processes, including operational logistics, equipment maintenance, and strategic communication networks, would help the PLA to accelerate achieving capabilities to perform multi-domain integrated joint operations. Standardization facilitates interoperability across services, theaters, and arms, resulting in seamless coordination among ground, naval, air, space, and cyber units. Developing these capabilities is a prerequisite for conducting multi-domain integrated joint operations, a requirement for forceful Taiwan reunification. They are also indicative of the PLA’s steps toward achieving operational readiness. It is particularly relevant in regional and near-regional escalations, such as those in the South China Sea and the Western Pacific Ocean, which could be possibilities during the Taiwan reunification campaign. Resource Stockpiling Resource stockpiling is an important indicator of a nation’s preparedness for a potential conflict. It involves the systematic accumulation of critical materials, energy reserves, food supplies, and industrial inputs essential during wartime. Such activities are often undertaken to ensure self-sufficiency, mitigate vulnerabilities, and maintain resilience in the face of potential embargoes, trade disruptions, or blockades. Agricultural economist Gustavo F.C. Ferreira highlights in his testimony to the US-China Economy and Security Review Commission that China has been significantly increasing its energy resource reserves, particularly coal, crude oil, and natural gas. The country has built an extensive storage capacity for crude oil, estimated to exceed 1.8 billion barrels, including strategic petroleum reserves and underground storage facilities. Additionally, he points out that China’s coal production has ramped up aggressively, with approval of expansion projects equivalent to the European Union’s annual coal production in just one year. He notes that beyond energy resources, the stockpiling extends to other critical areas such as food (grains and protein sources), strategic metals (rare earth, copper, and lithium), and technological components (semiconductors). These measures are supported by state policies to reduce China’s reliance on global markets and ensure continued operation during a conflict or escalation. Similarly, there are reports about China’s record 105.03-million-metric-ton import of soybeans in 2024. This marks a 6.5 percent increase from 2023. This surge is possibly due to China’s efforts to prepare for a contingency, particularly in anticipation of intensified trade tensions with the United States. Researcher Zongyuan Zoe Liu’s work highlights China’s strategies to shield its economy from potential Western sanctions by drawing lessons from sanctions imposed on Russia. She notes China’s attempt to increase economic and technological self-sufficiencies by immunizing its economy against sanctions and building financial resilience against potential sanctions by the United States. Re-enlistment of Veterans Since 2017, the PLA has notified several enlistment orders for veterans with specific skill sets. A key focus has been the integration of veterans into civil-military roles. This is supported by policies to re-enlist them in specialized units adhering to Xi’s stated and revealed military goals for the PLA. For instance, in the case of Taiwan-focused operations, the PLA’s re-enlistment efforts focus on operational readiness by re-enlisting veterans skilled in amphibious operations, cyber warfare, and missile systems. Since 2022, there has been an emphasis on integrating these veterans into critical roles, such as reserve forces, militia coordination, and rapid mobilization units. Beyond these six measures, several other developments—China’s heavy investment in dual-use infrastructure such as ports and airfields on the east coast, development of amphibious and airborne military capabilities like the large Type 075 landing ships and Y-20 aircraft, investment in offensive intelligence and cyber capabilities, deployment of strategic missile systems like the DF-15 and DF-21, training of the maritime militia with the PLA and their expansion to support the armed forces whenever required, and the integration of real-time battlefield awareness via the BeiDou navigation system—are additional factors to conclusively determine the PLA’s intention and readiness for a potential reunification campaign with Taiwan. Conclusion It is a political decision to pursue the reunification campaign. Western scholars dismiss such arguments on the basis of the PLA’s perceived lack of military preparedness and the significant economic costs China would incur during and after a reunification attempt. However, as this essay highlights, China is keenly aware of these considerations and is taking proactive steps to limit the fallout, if not eliminate it. This essay doesn’t argue whether China would attempt a forceful unification campaign or the cost of its campaign. Instead, it argues that through a combination of military and civilian measures, an effort has been made to address the possible critical vulnerabilities in military and economic sectors. The question remains about the PLA’s ability to execute and sustain complex cross-strait operations, especially after targeted military purges in 2023 and 2024. Every measure mentioned here can be seen in isolation and not as a part of a complex puzzle that indicates that the PLA is preparing to invade Taiwan. However, these measures involve systemic integration with military logistics, enabling rapid deployment and sustainability when required. A steady accumulation of capabilities indicates deliberate preparation for eventualities that may align with China’s political-military objectives across the Taiwan Strait.

Forceful Taiwan Reunification: China’s Targeted Military And Civi...	By Suyash Desai (FPRI) -- For nearly a century, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan have largely avoided direct military confrontations across the Taiwan Strait. However, there have been four notable exceptions: the Taiwan Strait crises of 1954–55, 1958, 1995–96, and most recently, 2022–23. In the first three instances, the status quo was primarily restored following the crisis. However, recent events suggest worrying trends highlighting that Beijing is preparing for a forceful reunification with Taiwan. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping has already made reunification with Taiwan a part of his signature China Dream, announced during the 19th Party Congress meeting in 2017. However, this was not the first time Taiwan was featured prominently in speeches by top Chinese leaders. As political scientist Ketian Zhang highlights in her book China’s Gambit: The Calculus of Coercion, annexing Taiwan is considered a core interest of China, with official references to its significance appearing regularly since 2003. The most recent instance was Xi Jinping’s New Year’s speech on December 31, 2024, where he declared, 'No one can stop the historical trend of reunification of the motherland' (誰也不能充實祖國統一的歷史大勢). But beyond rhetoric and political posturing, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has taken concrete measures over the past decade to advance Beijing’s reunification agenda. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures have intensified, reinforcing China’s willingness to use force. This article highlights the PLA’s systematic and incremental military and civilian-military measures—capabilities that might provide China with the tools to successfully conduct a potential forceful reunification with Taiwan in the near future. These measures include changing the institutions and patterns of PLA mobilization, constructing and using civilian infrastructure in military exercises, and establishing a new status quo through increasingly coercive military exercises around Taiwan. They also include standardization of the PLA for greater efficiency, effectiveness, combat readiness, stockpiling resources, and re-enlisting veterans with specific skills. This article builds upon Oriana Skylar Mastro’s arguments in her piece 'The Taiwan Temptation,' which contends that China’s expanding military capabilities and rising nationalism could drive Beijing to contemplate using force for reunification with Taiwan. It identifies granular military details, especially post-2020, but it doesn’t venture into arguments about the timing of the reunification, potential diplomatic backlash, or economic costs of the invasion. Recent Military-Civilian Measures Since 2015, the PRC has undertaken significant organizational, legal, and structural reforms to enhance the National Defense Mobilization System (NDMS) (國防動員系統). As China scholar Devin Thorne highlights in his recent testimony to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, NDMS enables the PRC to harness its political, economic, technological, cultural, social, and other civilian resources from peacetime to wartime. This helps China to address a wide range of threats, such as escalations on its border, domestic instabilities, natural disasters, and other crises. It also bolsters China’s military logistics. As Thorne highlights, the key developments include the enactment of the National Defense Transportation Law in 2017, the introduction of updated auditing and surveying data on natural resources protocols in 2018 and 2021, the establishment of new NDMS offices beginning in December 2022, the creation of a new type of highly trained and professional local militia force since 2021, and the enhancement of cross-militia training initiatives starting in 2024. The PLA can mobilize private and civilian resources through the NDMS during national emergencies. It highlights China’s determination to prepare for potential contingencies, including escalation activities on its borders with India, the Taiwan Strait, and the South China Sea. Lessons from the Russian-Ukrainian War and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have further shaped these efforts. Once operational, the NDMS would ultimately allow the PRC to mobilize society and harness civilian and military resources more systematically and institutionally in case of a potential forceful reunification attempt with Taiwan. However, mobilizing resources and force is insufficient, as China would need to reach the other side of the Taiwan Strait during a potential escalation. Some scholars dismiss the idea that the PLA remains incapable of conducting amphibious operations at the scale needed to take control of Taiwan. Amphibious operations (landing assault) are one of the five most important campaigns (alongside anti-landing, island blockade, border area counter-attack, and counter–air-raid campaigns) discussed at length in the PLA’s first written doctrine on joint operations, Joint Campaign Outline, as operational requirements to take over Taiwan by force. Taiwan has 169,000 active military personnel, backed by 1.66 million reservists. As career naval officer Harlan Ullman explains, using the traditional three-to-one ratio of attackers to defenders taught at war colleges, the PLA would need to mobilize at least 507,000 soldiers. By extension, to cross the 106-kilometer-wide Taiwan Strait to conduct landing operations, China would need thousands of ships—far more than the current PLA Navy capabilities of 234 operating warships. However, China has long been working to mobilize its civilian infrastructure to support its military campaign. For instance, the PRC has emphasized the construction of roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) (滾裝船) ships, which can use their power to set up ramps on docks or beaches to transport vehicles. Each RO–RO ship is estimated to carry at least three hundred vehicles and about fifteen hundred passengers. Since establishing the 'strategic projection support ship fleets' in China’s major ship-building companies in 2012, the PLA has actively cooperated with local shipping companies to improve maritime 'strategic delivery' capabilities by prioritizing the production of RO-RO ferries. According to naval strategist J. Michael Dahm, in January 2023, China had around thirty-one RO-RO ferries in operation. However, the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed out that the mainland shipyards would deliver up to two hundred RO-RO ships in the four years from 2023 to 2026. Furthermore, the PLA has used these ferries in military exercises in the Taiwan Strait since 2019. For instance, the first fifteen-thousand-ton ferry, Bang Chui Dao RO-RO ship (棒槌島滾裝船), participated in an amphibious assault exercise in 2019. Since then, the PLA has conducted such military exercises regularly. In July 2020, the PLA experimented with launching amphibious assault craft from civilian ferries toward the beach rather than port facilities, and it conducted day and night exercises off the coast of Guangdong Province.

Renewed US–China Tensions Spell Trouble For Australia’s Economy –...	By Madison Cartwright Trump 2.0 is in full swing and it is already causing major anxieties for the global economy. Australia must navigate US–China tensions with careful consideration of its economic realities. Ongoing negotiations for exemptions from US President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported metals do not shield Australia from reinvigorated US protectionism, especially as most of Trump’s ire has been targeted at China. While Australia’s trade relationship with China gets a lot of attention, its importance is not always fully grasped. Australia’s access to the Chinese market has significantly impacted how Australia’s political economy developed, creating path dependencies that are costly to break. The China-fuelled mining boom of the 2000s influenced the allocation of economic resources, raised its standard of living and affected its political culture. It has also shaped expectations on government dealings with issues like fiscal policy and economic prosperity that benefit from the booming Chinese commodity imports and deflationary exports. What about now? When China banned Australian coal imports in 2020, many assumed that the industry would be devastated. Yet it was not. Australia found other buyers for its coal. In 2021, China accounted for less than 1 per cent of its coal exports, even as Australia’s total coal exports increased by US$19 billion. By 2023, trade in coal had resumed but China still accounted for only 8 per cent of Australian coal exports, less than half the share in 2020. If Australia could adapt to losing the Chinese market for its coal, will Trump’s tariffs on China really be so bad? It is important not to draw the wrong lessons from this experience. Australia’s vulnerability lies in how much its exports rely on the Chinese market, the high share of these goods on Australia’s total exports and China’s share of the market for these goods globally. Energy is crucial to Australia’s trade with China, but its most important commodity is by far iron ore. In 2023, China purchased 84 per cent of Australia’s US$85.4 billion iron ore exports. Iron ore accounted for 23 per cent of Australia’s total exports in 2023. Finding alternative buyers would be difficult — China purchased 69 per cent of global iron ore exports in the same year. Australia’s third largest export is petroleum gas, with a 13 per cent share of its export mix. China, the largest importer of petroleum gas in the world, accounts for just under a third of these exports. China is a big importer of Australian services as well as goods. In the 2024 financial year, China was the largest importer of Australian education services, with a 24 per cent share. Australia’s trade surplus with China accounted for 4 per cent of its GDP in the 2024 financial year. The growth in the trade surplus with China also accounted for 10 per cent of the growth in GDP — measured in current prices — from 2023–24. If the trade surplus with China was to shrink or even fail to grow due to tariffs imposed by Trump, it would have a significant impact on Australia’s economy. Australia must also understand that the threat is not just tariffs or Trump. Political consensus on US–China economic relations is souring in the United States. Trump started the trade war with China in 2018, but president Joe Biden retained the Trump-era tariffs. Trump first sanctioned Huawei and proposed a ban on TikTok, but Biden expanded these sanctions to the entire Chinese semiconductor industry and shepherded a TikTok ban through Congress. China is flexing its economic power too, imposing its own export bans on materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. Rising economic tensions between the United States and China is the new normal — and Australia is caught in the middle. The big risk for Australia is increasing US demands on its allies to join efforts to decouple from China. This is happening in semiconductors already. Can we expect the United States to demand Australia to follow a path of decoupling from China or else face sanctions, risks to AUKUS and ANZUS or other forms of coercion? And what would that mean for Australia’s economy, standard of living and political stability? These are the questions Canberra should be considering. Decoupling from China will be costly for Australia not just because of exports. If Australia and other US allies stop buying Chinese computers, toys or smartphones, where will they turn? China supplies 49, 60 and 59 per cent of global exports of these products respectively and dominates many other markets. Of course, all of this could be manufactured elsewhere, but that would require substantial investment in domestic manufacturing or foreign production. It could also significantly increase inflation, as new manufacturing would likely incur higher costs. Meanwhile, Australia’s ability to afford these higher priced imports would weaken as foreign exchange earnings from commodity exports and mining investments decline, ultimately lowering incomes. Despite the legitimate security concerns over China’s policies, Australia must be realistic about its economic vulnerabilities. The Australian government should embrace the ‘pragmatic’ approach that had previously characterised Australia’s foreign policy towards China. Policymakers should also focus on deepening ties within the Asia Pacific to reduce Australia’s security reliance on the United States and economic reliance on China. Existing institutions, such as the ASEAN-centred Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, provide good mediums to engage with China productively. Cooperation with other regional actors which face common challenges is key to navigating the ramifications of rising great power tensions.

If Australia could adapt to losing the Chinese market for its coal, will Trump’s tariffs on China really be so bad? It is important not to draw the wrong lessons from this experience. Australia’s vulnerability lies in how much its exports rely on the Chinese market, the high share of these goods on Australia’s total exports and China’s share of the market for these goods globally. Energy is crucial to Australia’s trade with China, but its most important commodity is by far iron ore. In 2023, China purchased 84 per cent of Australia’s US$85.4 billion iron ore exports. Iron ore accounted for 23 per cent of Australia’s total exports in 2023. Finding alternative buyers would be difficult — China purchased 69 per cent of global iron ore exports in the same year. Australia’s third largest export is petroleum gas, with a 13 per cent share of its export mix. China, the largest importer of petroleum gas in the world, accounts for just under a third of these exports. China is a big importer of Australian services as well as goods. In the 2024 financial year, China was the largest importer of Australian education services, with a 24 per cent share. Australia’s trade surplus with China accounted for 4 per cent of its GDP in the 2024 financial year. The growth in the trade surplus with China also accounted for 10 per cent of the growth in GDP — measured in current prices — from 2023–24. If the trade surplus with China was to shrink or even fail to grow due to tariffs imposed by Trump, it would have a significant impact on Australia’s economy. Australia must also understand that the threat is not just tariffs or Trump. Political consensus on US–China economic relations is souring in the United States. Trump started the trade war with China in 2018, but president Joe Biden retained the Trump-era tariffs. Trump first sanctioned Huawei and proposed a ban on TikTok, but Biden expanded these sanctions to the entire Chinese semiconductor industry and shepherded a TikTok ban through Congress. China is flexing its economic power too, imposing its own export bans on materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. Rising economic tensions between the United States and China is the new normal — and Australia is caught in the middle. The big risk for Australia is increasing US demands on its allies to join efforts to decouple from China. This is happening in semiconductors already. Can we expect the United States to demand Australia to follow a path of decoupling from China or else face sanctions, risks to AUKUS and ANZUS or other forms of coercion? And what would that mean for Australia’s economy, standard of living and political stability? These are the questions Canberra should be considering. Decoupling from China will be costly for Australia not just because of exports. If Australia and other US allies stop buying Chinese computers, toys or smartphones, where will they turn? China supplies 49, 60 and 59 per cent of global exports of these products respectively and dominates many other markets. Of course, all of this could be manufactured elsewhere, but that would require substantial investment in domestic manufacturing or foreign production. It could also significantly increase inflation, as new manufacturing would likely incur higher costs. Meanwhile, Australia’s ability to afford these higher priced imports would weaken as foreign exchange earnings from commodity exports and mining investments decline, ultimately lowering incomes. Despite the legitimate security concerns over China’s policies, Australia must be realistic about its economic vulnerabilities. The Australian government should embrace the ‘pragmatic’ approach that had previously characterised Australia’s foreign policy towards China. Policymakers should also focus on deepening ties within the Asia Pacific to reduce Australia’s security reliance on the United States and economic reliance on China. Existing institutions, such as the ASEAN-centred Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, provide good mediums to engage with China productively. Cooperation with other regional actors which face common challenges is key to navigating the ramifications of rising great power tensions.

Why Did The ICC Arrest Ex-Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte? –...	By Jason Gutierrez Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is in custody after authorities in his home country arrested him on a warrant from the International Criminal Court and put him on a plane bound for the Netherlands, where the world court is headquartered. Philippine authorities had served Duterte with an arrest warrant from the ICC, as part of the court’s years-long investigation into his past administration’s bloody crackdown on illegal drugs. The 79-year-old Duterte was arrested in Manila on Tuesday as he disembarked from a flight from Hong Kong. He was held for hours at an air base next to Manila’s international airport before being put on another plane that whisked him away to The Hague. Here’s what you need to know about the ICC arrest order against Duterte: What are the potential charges against Duterte? As detailed in the ICC warrant, the former leader stands accused of committing crimes against humanity in connection with thousands of killings that occurred during a counter-narcotics crackdown under his watch as president (2016-22) and dating back to 2011, when he served as mayor of southern Davao city. Human Rights Watch and other rights advocacy group have said that the police under Duterte had regularly falsified evidence to justify the killings of suspected drug dealers and addicts. The Philippine government has given conflicting figures on how many people were killed in his administration’s so-called drug war. The last figure it gave was 6,252 suspects, who were killed from July 1, 2016 to May 31, 2022. Rights groups, however, have put the death toll as high as 20,000-plus. They have noted that statistics for many of those who were killed had been placed into the government’s 'death under investigation' category, and were therefore not logged as fatalities of Duterte’s anti-narcotics campaign. What evidence is there that Philippine police used excessive force? Evidence has been piling up. Eight police officers have so far been convicted of murder carried out in the name of the drug war. In June 2024, a court convicted four officers for the September 2016 killing of Luis Bonifacio, 45, and his 19-year-old son, Gabriel, inside their home. The court had said the victims’ injuries – including multiple gunshot wounds to their bodies – 'glaringly show the brutality employed upon them, despite the pleading for mercy of the victims.' In November 2018, a court in northern Manila convicted three police officers for killing 17-year-old teenager Kian Loyd delos Santos while he begged for mercy. It was not a shootout as police had claimed, and evidence later showed that he was also mistakenly killed. His death galvanized opposition to Duterte’s drug war. In March 2023, another policeman was found guilty of torturing two teenagers who were later found dead. Duterte has made no effort to hide his 'kill, kill, kill' order, and during his appearance before Congress in October, doubled down on his reason for doing so. 'If you think you will be killed, shoot him in the head. That would be one less criminal,' Duterte had said. He also admitted to the existence of his own private army, 'I can make the confession now if you want. I’m really doing it, but don’t involve the police,' Duterte told the hearing. 'I have a death squad, seven men, but they’re not police. They’re gangsters.' The former president refused to name them. Is the ICC arrest warrant still valid, given that the Philippines withdrew from the world court under President Duterte? The warrant is valid because the ICC jurisdiction covers crimes that took place before the Philippines withdrew from the statute that created the international court, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands. However, crimes committed after the country’s withdrawal – which took effect on March 17, 2019 – aren’t covered. Does the ICC still have jurisdiction over Philippine cases? As a court of last resort, the ICC prosecutes cases only when a government is unwilling or unable to do so 'genuinely.' Duterte’s arrest on Tuesday was a sign that the ICC felt that the Philippines could not or would not conduct genuine investigations into the allegations. What are the political ramifications of Duterte’s international arrest? The Duterte and Marcos families are two of the leading political families in the Philippines. But Rodrigo Duterte has been openly feuding with his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and has repeatedly taunted the chief executive in public appearances. Sara Duterte, Marcos’ vice president, is the former leader’s daughter. Despite leading in popularity surveys before the 2022 presidential election, Sara Duterte successfully opted to contest the polls as Marcos’ running mate. The political alliance, which trampled the opposition in the May 2022 national polls, ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the Marcos government to allow an international investigation into the drug war waged by former President Duterte. Last month, the House of Representatives impeached Sara Duterte for alleged constitutional violations, corruption, plotting to assassinate Marcos, betrayal of public trust and other high crimes – accusations which her family rejected as 'political persecution.' She is expected to face an impeachment trial before the Senate later this year.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlKAsEdqddXRp	2025-03-11T17:45:46-07:00

Conclave: Is A Hungarian Pope In The Smoke? – Analysis	Prominent among candidates to succeed Pope Francis is Hungary’s primate, Cardinal Peter Erdo. His potential election raises questions about both the direction of global Catholicism and Viktor Orban’s scope to wield influence through the Vatican. By Alexander Faludy The 72-year-old Hungarian primate Peter Erdo is tipped as a frontrunner among the candidates to succeed Pope Francis: the 88-year-old pontiff has now been under treatment in Rome’s Gemelli hospital for over three weeks, where his condition continues to be described as 'complex'. Cardinal Erdo is a popular figure internationally among conservative Catholics, and has had a close – if sometimes complicated – relationship with Hungary’s nationalist-populist government since Fidesz returned to power in 2010. Erdo became archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, and a cardinal, in 2003. A distinguished church lawyer, he first developed an international profile by leading the Council of Bishops' Conferences of Europe (CCEE), the representative body for Europe’s Catholic bishops, from 2006 to 2016. As rapporteur for the global Synod on the Family (2014-15), he resisted radical change to the church’s approach to divorced and gay Christians. His efforts, although not fully successful in halting reforms, won him sympathy among conservatives in Africa and America. More recently, his response to Pope Francis’s decree Fiducia Supplicans (December 2023), which permitted priests to bless same-sex couples informally, challenged the Vatican position. Preaching at midnight mass in Budapest’s St Stephen’s Basilica in December 2023, Erdo stated: 'If we are Christians, we must not only follow a pious philanthropic philosophy, perhaps with content that changes every decade according to fashion.' Instead, he said, 'the teachings, life, death and resurrection of Jesus are the eternal standard.' His words were widely viewed as a veiled criticism of the decree. Even so, Erdo, who is generally guarded in public statements, may still be able to position himself as a compromise candidate, offering the church an interval of calm after a period of accelerated change under Pope Francis. 'He is conservative but not reactionary, and comes across as both pragmatic and diplomatic,' observes Zoltan Laky, a Catholic journalist with the Hungarian outlet Valasz Online. While resistant to radical departures from church teaching, Erdo 'lacks the confrontational tone of some traditionalists', Laky continues, meaning that in the conclave he could 'appeal to both traditionalists and to moderate progressives as a stabilising force'. Orban’s man in the Vatican? The degree of Hungarian government interest in Erdo’s possible election worries some observers. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban hinted at his concern with the topic in his annual set-piece policy speech at the Fidesz summer camp in the Romanian spa town of Ballie Tusnad in July 2024. Citing a number of historical missteps from which Hungary should learn lessons for its geopolitical positioning, Orban included the country’s failure in 1513 to secure the papal election of the Hungarian candidate Tamas Bakocz. This has prompted obvious questions about the example’s contemporary relevance. Fidesz communications efforts reveal clear signs of support for Erdo’s papal candidacy. According to BIRN’s sources, Catholic Church affairs are a 'restricted topic' for the government- and Fidesz-controlled media in Hungary, one on which journalists are known to require special clearance to write about. Notably, each time Erdo’s possible election to the papacy is mentioned in the foreign press, that is immediately reported by such outlets as a news item in its own right. Hungarian reporting of the foreign coverage is then, in turn, amplified in English translation on the websites of Fidesz-organised ‘civil’ organisations, suggesting a co-ordinated strategy to drive discussion of the topic. Erdo’s candidacy may also have been boosted by the 2021 International Eucharistic Congress in Budapest, attended by several hundred bishops and cardinals from around the world. This congress provided Erdo with a platform to impress peers and make useful connections, The event was underwritten by the Hungarian state at a cost of about 80 million euros. Such an approach would echo, in both objective and technique, the successful efforts of Hungary’s Cold War Communist regime to secure the election of Bishop Zoltan Kaldy as president of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). The latter was achieved at the 1984 meeting of the LWF General Assembly in Budapest, again hosted at government expense and preceded by a focused international influence campaign lasting several years. Lately, Hungary has also played host to a number of individual visits by cardinal electors (and potential electors) attending conferences and events at a frequency surprising relative to Hungary’s size and location. Program costs for such visits are underwritten by government bodies, including the Prime Minister’s Office and the State Secretariat for Assisting Persecuted Christians. A mixed record During the 2015 migration crisis, Erdo declined to criticise the government’s hostile messaging about migrants, and in 2016 stormed out of a live TV interview when asked if Fidesz’s vilification of asylum-seekers was compatible with Catholic teaching on compassion for such people. He has also been silent in the face of the effective criminalisation of homelessness in a 2018 annexe to the constitution and the introduction of Russian-style legislation stigmatising the LGBTQ+ community in 2021. 'Not once did Peter Erdo speak out; he did not take the opportunity of prophetic criticism,' accuses Dr Rita Perintfalvi, a lay Catholic theologian from Hungary who teaches at the University of Graz in Austria. Indeed, Perintfalvi claims that when it comes to the mistreatment of vulnerable minorities, 'it has become clear that if Peter Erdo has to choose between papal guidance and the Hungarian government’s view on how churches should behave, he will always choose the latter.' The cardinal has also been notably silent on democratic backsliding in Hungary, rampant corruption, and the restriction of freedom of religion or belief for smaller faith communities. Yet Erdo’s relationship with Fidesz has not always been smooth. He opposed introducing compulsory religious education in Hungary’s state schools in 2013, warning it would compromise the viability of church youth groups, and he critiqued the quality of religion textbooks devised by government educators to support the curriculum. His opposition, together with other bishops, to the nationalisation of Hungary’s IVF clinics, citing church teaching on bioethics, caused an 18-month delay in implementing the policy while Fidesz unsuccessfully sought compromise with the church. The dispute occasioned public friction with then families minister (and later president) Katalin Novak. Overall, according to Zoltan Laky, 'While he [Erdo] hasn’t fully upheld the Church’s independence from political entanglements, neither did he align as closely with Viktor Orban’s government as have some other bishops.' Perintfalvi is more pessimistic: 'At a time when we are on the brink of the third world war and when Western civilisation, democracy and the future of human rights are at stake, I think the election of such a man as pope would be a disaster.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlA8wE549_9fD	2025-03-11T17:44:06-07:00

Ukraine World’s Biggest Arms Importer: US’ Dominance Of Global Ar...	Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but Russia (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind France (9.6 per cent), while Italy (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. At least 35 states sent weapons to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Ukraine received 8.8 per cent of global arms imports in 2020–24. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period. ‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘However, some major arms importers, including Saudi Arabia, India and China, saw large declines in import volumes for a variety of reasons, despite high threat perceptions in their regions.’ European NATO members increase dependence on US-supplied arms Arms imports by the European NATO members more than doubled between 2015–19 and 2020–24 (+105 per cent). The USA supplied 64 per cent of these arms, a substantially larger share than in 2015–19 (52 per cent). The other main suppliers were France and South Korea (accounting for 6.5 per cent each), Germany (4.7 per cent) and Israel (3.9 per cent). ‘With an increasingly belligerent Russia and transatlantic relations under stress during the first Trump presidency, European NATO states have taken steps to reduce their dependence on arms imports and to strengthen the European arms industry,’ said Pieter Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘But the transatlantic arms-supply relationship has deep roots. Imports from the USA have risen and European NATO states have almost 500 combat aircraft and many other weapons still on order from the USA.’ USA further increases its share of arms exports, while Russian exports slide Arms exports by the USA increased by 21 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24, and its share of global arms exports grew from 35 per cent to 43 per cent. The USA supplied major arms to 107 states in 2020–24. For the first time in two decades, the largest share of US arms exports in 2020–24 went to Europe (35 per cent) rather than the Middle East (33 per cent). Nevertheless, the top single recipient of US arms was Saudi Arabia (12 per cent of US arms exports). ‘The USA is in a unique position when it comes to arms exports. At 43 per cent, its share of global arms exports is more than four times as much as the next-largest exporter, France,’ said Mathew George. ‘The USA continues to be the supplier of choice for advanced long-range strike capabilities like combat aircraft.’ In contrast to the USA, arms exports by Russia fell sharply (–64 per cent) between 2015–19 and 2020–24. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. ‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. ‘Two of Russia’s most important arms-trading relationships had already weakened before 2022, with India increasingly favouring other suppliers, and China sourcing more arms from its own burgeoning arms industry.’ Russia delivered major arms to 33 states in 2020–24. Two thirds of Russian arms exports went to three states: India (38 per cent), China (17 per cent) and Kazakhstan (11 per cent). France became the world’s second largest arms supplier in 2020–24, delivering arms to 65 states. France’s exports of major arms to other European states almost trebled between 2015–19 and 2020–24 (+187 per cent). This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The second largest recipient of major arms from France was Qatar (9.7 per cent of French arms exports). China was the fourth largest exporter of arms in 2020–24, with 5.9 per cent of global arms exports. Despite China’s efforts to increase its arms exports, many large importers do not buy Chinese arms for political reasons. Asia and Oceania remains largest arms-importing region; China’s imports more than halve The share of global arms transfers going to states in Asia and Oceania fell from 41 per cent to 33 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. A 21 per cent drop in imports to the region was in large part due to arms imports by China shrinking by 64 per cent between the two periods, as it increasingly substituted imports—mainly from Russia—with locally designed and produced weapon systems. China’s arms imports are likely to keep falling as the capacity of its domestic arms industry grows. Four states in Asia and Oceania ranked among the 10 largest arms importers globally in 2020–24: India, Pakistan, Japan and Australia. China dropped out of the top 10 arms importers for the first time since 1990–94. The main suppliers to the region in 2020–24 were the USA, which accounted for 37 per cent of regional arms imports, Russia (17 per cent) and China (14 per cent). India was the world’s second largest arms importer, with its imports reflecting perceived threats from both China and Pakistan. However, its imports decreased by 9.3 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. The largest share of Indian arms imports (36 per cent) came from Russia, a significantly smaller share than in 2015–19 (55 per cent) and 2010–14 (72 per cent). Arms imports by Pakistan grew by 61 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. China became even more dominant as its supplier, accounting for 81 per cent of Pakistan’s arms imports in 2020–24, compared with 74 per cent in 2015–19. With the sharp drop in China’s arms imports, and marked decreases in imports by Taiwan (–27 per cent) and South Korea (–24 per cent), arms imports by East Asian states shrank by 22 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. Japan (+93 per cent) was the only East Asian state that saw an increase in its arms imports. ‘While arms imports to Europe and the Middle East continue to grab media attention, Asia and Oceania remained the largest arms-importing region in the world in 2020–24, as it has been almost invariably since the early 1990s,’ said Siemon Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘Threat perceptions concerning China are behind much of the arms procurement in the region.’ Middle East arms imports dip Arms imports by states in the Middle East fell by 20 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. Four of the top 10 global importers in 2020–24 were in the Middle East: Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kuwait. Qatar was the world’s third largest arms importer in 2020–24 (up from 10th largest in 2015–19). Between 2015–19 and 2020–24, Saudi Arabia’s arms imports decreased by 41 per cent. More than half of arms imports to the Middle East came from the USA (52 per cent), while 13 per cent came from Italy, 9.8 per cent from France and 7.6 per cent from Germany. ‘Regional conflicts and tensions continue to drive demand for arms imports in the Middle East,’ said Zain Hussain, Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘Given the volume of pending deliveries, the Middle East will remain a major arms-importing region.’ Despite the ongoing war in Gaza, arms imports by Israel remained largely stable between 2015–19 and 2020–24. In 2020–24 the USA supplied the biggest share of Israel’s arms imports (66 per cent), followed by Germany (33 per cent) and Italy (1.0 per cent). Israel was the 15th largest arms importer globally in 2020–24, down from 14th in 2015–19. ‘Israel has received substantial military aid from the USA following the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023,’ said Zain Hussain. ‘However, for its recent military operations, Israel has employed mainly US-supplied weapons it had received earlier. Israel’s adversaries Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis have relied on Iranian arms, and Hezbollah and the Houthis have used Iranian-supplied missiles and drones against Israel.’ Insecurity and conflict drive large increase in arms imports to West Africa Arms transfers to West Africa have been rising sharply in the past 15 years as the security situation has deteriorated. The combined arms imports of West African states almost doubled (+82 per cent) between 2010–14 and 2020–24. Nigeria accounted for by far the biggest share (34 per cent) of arms imports to West Africa in 2020–24. ‘The growth in arms imports to West Africa has been striking. While the volume of imports remains relatively small, it has important geopolitical implications,’ said Katarina Djokic, Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘States like Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal seem to be rapidly increasing their imports. Arms suppliers are using arms exports to boost their influence in this part of the world, including emerging suppliers—primarily Türkiye—alongside more established actors such as China, France, Russia and the USA.’ Other notable developments African arms imports fell by 44 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. This was mainly due to large decreases in imports by Algeria (–73 per cent) and Morocco (–26 per cent). Arms imports by states in sub-Saharan Africa increased by 4.2 per cent. Combat aircraft are the main long-range strike weapon imported by states, but interest in long-range land-attack missiles is increasing. In 2020–24 the USA supplied 45 per cent of global long-range land-attack missile exports, delivering them to 7 states, with deliveries to 13 states pending. Arms imports by states in the Americas increased by 13 per cent. The USA was the biggest importer in the region (accounting for 3.1 per cent of global arms imports and 50 per cent of imports by states in the Americas). Brazil’s arms imports increased by 77 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24, and accounted for 49 per cent of all arms imports to South America in 2020–24. The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent). North Korea exported artillery and missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. With this, both states violated the United Nations sanctions on North Korea.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlBG2QUsGO5nU	2025-03-11T17:42:06-07:00	
Ukraine World’s Biggest Arms Importer: US’ Dominance Of Global Ar...	Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but Russia (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind France (9.6 per cent), while Italy (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. At least 35 states sent weapons to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Ukraine received 8.8 per cent of global arms imports in 2020–24. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period. ‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘However, some major arms importers, including Saudi Arabia, India and China, saw large declines in import volumes for a variety of reasons, despite high threat perceptions in their regions.’ European NATO members increase dependence on US-supplied arms Arms imports by the European NATO members more than doubled between 2015–19 and 2020–24 (+105 per cent). The USA supplied 64 per cent of these arms, a substantially larger share than in 2015–19 (52 per cent). The other main suppliers were France and South Korea (accounting for 6.5 per cent each), Germany (4.7 per cent) and Israel (3.9 per cent). ‘With an increasingly belligerent Russia and transatlantic relations under stress during the first Trump presidency, European NATO states have taken steps to reduce their dependence on arms imports and to strengthen the European arms industry,’ said Pieter Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘But the transatlantic arms-supply relationship has deep roots. Imports from the USA have risen and European NATO states have almost 500 combat aircraft and many other weapons still on order from the USA.’ USA further increases its share of arms exports, while Russian exports slide Arms exports by the USA increased by 21 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24, and its share of global arms exports grew from 35 per cent to 43 per cent. The USA supplied major arms to 107 states in 2020–24. For the first time in two decades, the largest share of US arms exports in 2020–24 went to Europe (35 per cent) rather than the Middle East (33 per cent). Nevertheless, the top single recipient of US arms was Saudi Arabia (12 per cent of US arms exports). ‘The USA is in a unique position when it comes to arms exports. At 43 per cent, its share of global arms exports is more than four times as much as the next-largest exporter, France,’ said Mathew George. ‘The USA continues to be the supplier of choice for advanced long-range strike capabilities like combat aircraft.’ In contrast to the USA, arms exports by Russia fell sharply (–64 per cent) between 2015–19 and 2020–24. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. ‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. ‘Two of Russia’s most important arms-trading relationships had already weakened before 2022, with India increasingly favouring other suppliers, and China sourcing more arms from its own burgeoning arms industry.’ Russia delivered major arms to 33 states in 2020–24. Two thirds of Russian arms exports went to three states: India (38 per cent), China (17 per cent) and Kazakhstan (11 per cent). France became the world’s second largest arms supplier in 2020–24, delivering arms to 65 states. France’s exports of major arms to other European states almost trebled between 2015–19 and 2020–24 (+187 per cent). This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The second largest recipient of major arms from France was Qatar (9.7 per cent of French arms exports). China was the fourth largest exporter of arms in 2020–24, with 5.9 per cent of global arms exports. Despite China’s efforts to increase its arms exports, many large importers do not buy Chinese arms for political reasons. Asia and Oceania remains largest arms-importing region; China’s imports more than halve The share of global arms transfers going to states in Asia and Oceania fell from 41 per cent to 33 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. A 21 per cent drop in imports to the region was in large part due to arms imports by China shrinking by 64 per cent between the two periods, as it increasingly substituted imports—mainly from Russia—with locally designed and produced weapon systems.

India was the world’s second largest arms importer, with its imports reflecting perceived threats from both China and Pakistan. However, its imports decreased by 9.3 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. The largest share of Indian arms imports (36 per cent) came from Russia, a significantly smaller share than in 2015–19 (55 per cent) and 2010–14 (72 per cent).

China became even more dominant as its supplier, accounting for 81 per cent of Pakistan’s arms imports in 2020–24, compared with 74 per cent in 2015–19. With the sharp drop in China’s arms imports, and marked decreases in imports by Taiwan (–27 per cent) and South Korea (–24 per cent), arms imports by East Asian states shrank by 22 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24.

Ukraine Agrees To US-Brokered Cease-Fire Deal, Unlocking Military...	By Reid Standish (RFE/RL) -- Ukraine has agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day cease-fire in the war against the Russian invasion, prompting the United States to say it would immediately lift the suspension of military aid, including the sharing of intelligence. The outcome of nine hours of talks on March 11 in Jeddah marked a stunning turnaround less than two weeks after an acrimonious meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The clash between the two leaders preceded the US pause in aid and limits on intelligence sharing, which the United States said were imposed because of doubts that Ukraine was committed to seeking peace. 'The President wanted this war to end yesterday... So our hope is that the Russians will answer 'yes' as quickly as possible, so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations,' US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after the agreement was announced. A joint statement issued by the two countries said Ukraine expressed a 'readiness' to accept the US proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day cease-fire, 'which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation.' Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a meeting with Russia would take place later on March 11 or the following day. Rubio, who attended the talks in Saudi Arabia along with national-security adviser Mike Waltz, said the cease-fire plan puts the ball in Russia’s court. 'We’re going to tell them this is what’s on the table,' he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government. 'Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking. And now it’ll be up to them to say yes or no.' Russian officials have repeatedly said that they want a comprehensive peace deal, not a cease-fire or other temporary arrangement. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it wouldn't rule out contacts with US officials over next several days, but gave no further comment. The US and Ukrainian delegations said they also discussed the importance of humanitarian relief efforts as part of the peace process, particularly during the cease-fire, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. 'I have confirmation that the security assistance from the United States has been restored,' Pavlo Palisa, deputy head of the Ukrainian President's Office and a member of the delegation, said in a post on Facebook. 'Arrangements are starting to be fulfilled.' In addition, Ukraine and the United States agreed to conclude a pact on joint development of Ukrainian critical minerals and other resources as soon as possible. That deal had been expected to be signed at the White House meeting on February 28, but Zelenskyy left early after the argument in the Oval Office, leaving it in limbo. The talks were closely watched across Europe, which has grown concerned Washington's renewed contacts with the Kremlin would sideline both Kyiv and Brussels from the peace process. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who recently traveled to the White House to meet Trump, congratulated the US and Ukrainian delegations, saying it is now up to Moscow to end the fighting. European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the proposal for a ceasefire agreement and the resumption of U.S. intelligence sharing and security assistance was a welcome development.'This is a positive development that can be a step towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine. The ball is now in Russia’s court,' she added. The talks in Jeddah on March 11 followed a large-scale Ukrainian drone attack that struck the Moscow region and other Russian provinces overnight, killing three people. John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said before the joint statement that restoring intelligence cooperation should be seen as a positive result for Kyiv. He also said sequencing in future negotiations will be crucial. While an early cease-fire can be key part of a future peace process, he stresses that it's important that it be followed by further steps toward a lasting peace deal, such as continued military shipments to Ukraine, a potential demilitarized zone, and a greater role for European countries, including their forces deployed as peacekeepers. 'These are all serious ideas that have been floated,' Herbst said. 'That might not be a just peace, because a just peace wouldn’t see Ukraine have to concede territory, but it could still be a durable one that makes it very hard for Russia to renew aggression.' What Role Will Russia And Europe Play In Peace Talks? As Ukrainian and US officials met in Saudi Arabia, attention was also shifting to the other two players that will decide how the war ends: Russia and Kyiv’s European allies. Top military officials from more than 30 nations met in Paris on March 11 for talks on the creation of an international security force for Ukraine. The force is being envisaged by Britain and France. Its aim is to reassure Ukraine and deter another large-scale Russian offensive after any cease-fire. The force might include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine’s defense. Russia has so far said it is against accepting European troops in Ukraine as part of a deal. The Kremlin has also spoken about getting Western sanctions lifted on its economy as part of a peace process, including in Saudi Arabia where US and Russian officials held talks nearly a month ago. Marie Dumoulin, a former French diplomat and an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, says that this gives European governments some leverage when the dust settles from the talks in Jeddah. She said that doubts remain in European capitals about whether Russia is willing to make any concessions of its own and that Europe can use both its own offer of security guarantees to Ukraine and the possibility of lifting European Union sanctions on Russia as a way to shape discussions in both Moscow and Washington. 'This gives Ukraine a few more cards to hold at the table,' Dumoulin told RFE/RL. 'These can give Ukraine some room to say whether the deal being offered to them is good enough yet or not.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlIHs3l1_N3P3	2025-03-11T17:40:33-07:00

What Was It Like for Our Sapiens Ancestors To Meet And Mix With C...	Between 50,000 and 35,000 years ago in Eurasia, the disappearance of hominin species or their biocultural assimilation with anatomically modern humans is one of the biggest questions in prehistory today. Until now, at least 14 different species have been assigned to the genus Homo since it emerged in Ethiopia some 2.8 million years ago revealing branching evolutionary stories of survival, intermixing, and extinctions. Archaeology is increasingly allowing us to glimpse into one of those epochs, from 50,000 to 35,000 years ago—the period of transition between the Middle and the Upper Paleolithic eras when modern humans emerged as the last representative of our genus on the planet. In 2017, new finds from the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco were published, indicating that our species—H. sapiens—appeared on the scene as early as 300,000 years ago. Spreading into Eurasia l00,000 years later, these early anatomically modern humans rubbed shoulders with Neandertals and Denisovans, and may also have had encounters with five other distinct hominin populations that have only very recently been identified, including H. floresiensis, H. luzonensis, H. longi, and H. juluensis in Asia and Nesher Ramla Homo in the Levant. Given what we know from historical events that chronicle human population exchanges through time, many archeologists question whether the 'disappearances' of these other human lineages might have had anything to do with their coming into contact with modern humans. Taking an example of human interactions that took place more than half a millennium ago helps us to understand how these interactions can deeply impact the human condition on multiple levels, many of which would be incomprehensible in the prehistoric archeological record without written documents. The people of Western Europe living in hierarchized social configurations had reached a stage of technological readiness that led them to innovate ways to sustain life over extended periods of seafaring. As a result, they came into contact with the great civilizations established in the precolonial Americas over hundreds of generations. Before this encounter, the millions of people who lived in the Americas were oblivious to the existence of Europeans who would build powerful empires on the ruins of their treasured territorial and cultural heritage. The consequences of the ensuing exchanges were both cataclysmic and transformative. Notwithstanding their immeasurable human impact, this contact altered the course of animal demography and deeply affected the global distribution of countless species of plants and trees that the colonizing populations freely displaced and exploited to enrich their own countries. Against the backdrop of this extraordinary scenario was the unprecedented spread of bacterial, viral, and fungal assemblages that indelibly modified evolutionary systems established over millennia—decimating an estimated 90 percent of Indigenous populations in their wake soon after the consolidation of colonization. While it is difficult for us to conceive the magnitude of global turbulence generated after this event, we know that it led to a new world order that used human slavery to build systems of unidirectional wealth distribution whose ramifications still resound today. Written records provide information about this period of global turmoil that help us to build our understanding of complex events that occurred in the past. Thirty thousand years from now, how will the multilevel repercussions of this period of human history be reflected in the archeological record? Unlike the chaotic shifts that rocked the world at the cusp of the European Renaissance, archeologists studying the remote past cannot rely on written accounts of how ancient population interactions played out. In retrospect, it should be pointed out that the decimation of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas involved exchanges among a single human species, whereas the transition from the Middle to the Upper Paleolithic involved human forms with distinct or even mosaic genetic, anatomic and sociocultural traits, with only one species remaining by around 35,000 years ago. In conformity with the doctrines of their time, Europeans justified their actions by evoking cultural and racial differences that they believed made them superior to the populations they subjugated, while uneven levels of technological hegemony allowed them to consolidate domination. Scientific results emanating from ancient genomics are shedding light on these paleo-interactions and painting a new picture of how humanity evolved, migrated, adapted, and reproduced during this key period of prehistory. Each individual's genetic code is transcribed in the sequence of the base pairs composing the double-stranded helix of the DNA moleculecarrying biological information passed on by reproduction. Discrete sections of a DNA strand are composed of the genes that define phenotypic (observable) and genotypic (hidden) traits defining a population. Throughout the world today, the human genetic code differs between individuals by only around 0.1 percent. Under the right conditions, genetic data retrieved from ancient human fossils can be a powerful tool to study similarities and differences separating human lineages and is complementary to classical paleontological methods like Linnaean taxonomy and morphometric determination. Recent reconstructions of the genomic histories of fossil H. sapiens, Neandertals, and the Denisovans confirm not only that interspecific breeding took place but also that it produced fertile offspring, suggesting biological mixing played a role in the outcome of the modern human condition. Having successfully occupied a huge territorial range stretching from the Levant to Western Europe and northward into Siberia for thousands of generations, our cousin species H. neanderthalensis is at the center of the enigma. The paleo-genetic data obtained from Neandertal fossils indicates a complex scenario with physical encounters taking place with modern humans between 65,000 and 47,000 years ago. Meanwhile, a Neandertal genetic inheritance of between 1 and 4 percent has been documented in present-day non-African populations, and gene flow from early modern humans to some Neandertals also took place as early as 100,000 years ago. Analyzing genetic records from early modern humans living in Siberia and Central Europe 45,000-35,000 years ago revealed comparatively higher and relatively recent admixtures of Neandertal DNA, with these individuals believed to have contributed little to the gene pool of later European populations. In some cases, fossil human remains and their genomic signatures have even been found to display a mosaic of archaic and derived features, leading some paleoanthropologists to consider the possibility that Neandertals did not 'disappear,' but rather, they were assimilated into a modern human clade developing in Eurasia at the time. This raises the possibility of an ancestral population of anatomically modern humans that migrated out of Africa and subsequently underwent speciation as they spread into the ecologically diverse regions of Eurasia, where they evolved locally into diverse groups that occasionally interbred with one another, producing fertile offspring. From the Darwinian viewpoint, the decrease in Neandertal DNA genetic sequences shows that they were not selected in the natural evolutionary process that gave way to modern humans. To explore this puzzling scenario, some archeologists turn to the cultural record left behind by these ancient human groups. Specific methods applied to study human-made artifacts are used to link them to predefined stages of techno-social evolution traditionally equated with distinct cultural complexes. Since the early 20th century, prehistorians have ascribed these cultural entities to different types of humans. But the apparent inter-specific mixing evidenced by the genetic data and the emergence of H. sapiens far earlier than previously thought have contributed to changing this traditional human-culture equation. Once conveyed as brutish and primitive, Neandertals were alleged to have been incapable of matching the relatively 'advanced' esthetic and technological capacities of their modern human counterparts. But this premise has also changed with new data demonstrating that Neandertals lived in socially advanced groups, that they appear to have practiced some form of art and body ornamentation, and that they intentionally buried their dead, suggesting powerful symbolic and even ritual practices. So what do the artifacts tell us about the transitional period that saw the replacement of H. neanderthalensis by H. sapiens? A number of archeological sites preserve a record of this transitional phase, with Middle Paleolithic layers yielding the so-called Mousterian artifacts made from prepared stone cores attributed to Neandertals, overlain by strata containing Upper Paleolithic stone blades or bladelets attributed to H. sapiens. The blade industries attributed to modern humans are also associated with finely crafted bone, ivory, and antler artifacts, shell beads, ochre, and diverse forms of figurative art. Using detailed technological and typological criteria, archeologists further subdivide these cultural complexes, refining the cultural groupings to reconstruct a chrono-cultural framework reflecting human population turnover in time and space. Because only one species of Homo lived during the Upper Paleolithic (after around 35,000 years ago), changes observed in the tool kits are thought to reflect different traditions, rather than different hominins. These shifts are attributed to multiple factors, including cultural transmission through inter-populational contact. However, since multiple species of Homo were present during the Middle Paleolithic, cultural change is often thought to signal the disappearance of one lineage and its replacement by another. This begs the question: Do we observe a gradual or an abrupt transition from one phase to the next? If modern humans and Neandertals were interbreeding, then we might assume that they could also have exchanged cultural and technological know-how. This means that we might anticipate finding some blending of cultural evidence, just as we might expect to find hominin fossils with intermediate anatomical traits. Still, in most cases, the different cultural complexes defined for the Upper Paleolithic—generally beginning with the Early or Proto-Aurignacian cultures—appear sequentially above the Middle Paleolithic deposits, without intermixing of technological, typological, or stylistic features. Paradoxically, what we now know to have been a long period of contact between Neandertals and modern humans is not clearly reflected in the cultural materials found in the archeological record. But there are some intriguing exceptions. In Western and Central Europe, the Near East, and Siberia, where these intra-specific exchanges are being validated by paleo-genomics and comparative anatomy in several archeological sites, the 'intermediary' cultural scenarios are also becoming clearer. In some cases, transitional assemblages with elements inherited from the Middle Paleolithic combine with tools conveying innovative features commonly attributed to the Upper Paleolithic. For now, there is little consensus about which hominin was responsible for making these 'transitional' took kits in the timeframe that witnessed the disappearance or assimilation of the Neandertals and resulted in the ultimate domination of H. sapiens. Further research is needed to clarify humanity's complex evolutionary history that—in the 3 million years since the emergence of Homo—has only been condensed into a single representative species since around 35,000 years ago. When we compare this prehistoric chronicle to a transformative historical event for which we have a rich body of written information, we can see how huge revolutions can take place swiftly, almost imperceptibly, on the geological time scale. As archeologists discover more about the transitions in time that led us to where we are today, the subtleties of the complex biocultural mixing nascent to the contemporary globalization of our species are being revealed.

What Was It Like for Our Sapiens Ancestors To Meet And Mix With C...	Between 50,000 and 35,000 years ago in Eurasia, the disappearance of hominin species or their biocultural assimilation with anatomically modern humans is one of the biggest questions in prehistory today. Until now, at least 14 different species have been assigned to the genus Homo since it emerged in Ethiopia some 2.8 million years ago revealing branching evolutionary stories of survival, intermixing, and extinctions. Archaeology is increasingly allowing us to glimpse into one of those epochs, from 50,000 to 35,000 years ago—the period of transition between the Middle and the Upper Paleolithic eras when modern humans emerged as the last representative of our genus on the planet.

Remember Kerensky: The Failure of Reformist Regimes – OpEd	The Trump administration assumed power in the thick of public fury, following five years of brutal despotism, economic decline, and many years, if not decades, of declining trust. The intensity of the public mood is rarely reported by legacy media without condemnation. The denials of regime failure by the entire establishment in every sector has only caused incredulity to grow and spread. No matter how much you think people are angry, you are likely underestimating the level of public disgust with the regime, not just in the US but all over the industrialized world. In 2024, it reached such a fevered pitch that the seemingly impossible happened with the election of a former president who had been subject to nonstop media demonization, lawfare without precedent, and even assassination attempts. The attacks only helped him. Trump’s party was swept into power. That includes control of a Congress with many members who seem to be unaware of the urgency of the moment. Under such conditions, this cannot be the end of the story. There is a long history of reformist governments failing to act fast enough to quell public demand for change. It is typical that such governments underestimate the fire behind the historical forces at work. They come to believe that the problem is fixed by a personnel change, whereas the real issue is systemic and comprehensive. The classic case is Russia, 1917. The government of Alexander Kerensky (1881-1970) ruled Russia for only eight months, following the toppling of the Romanov monarchy and before the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. It was supposed to be an agent of calm reform; it ended as a parenthesis between the old regime and the new. Kerensky was a lawyer, a reformer, and a non-communist supporter of labor-led social democracy. Active in anti-government protests and denunciations for years, Kerensky seemed like the right man for the job. He had one foot in the old world and one in the new. On taking power, he found himself in the position of making judgments about the pace and path of reform efforts. He had to deal with a collapsing economy, revolutionary fervor among the workers and peasants, and grave suspicion toward the whole of the ruling classes, the military in particular. He proclaimed Russia to be a Republic of the Western variety and had every intention of holding elections and shepherding into being a new type of ruling regime in Russia. The war would end, land would go to the peasants, inflation would stop, and people would find their voice in government. Just not yet. It had to be orderly, in Kerensky’s view. His mistake was in thinking that he was in charge of the motion of history. He made a fateful judgment in thinking it was all about him and not the movement that gave rise to his position. He decided to continue the war and make one final push for victory. That included an intensification of conscription in the midst of inflation. That decision ended in disaster. What was he thinking? In his view, Russia had already sacrificed so much for the war effort. His plan was to make good on these sacrifices by granting the Russian people the pride of victory. He had hoped to tap into the magically forgiving power of patriotism, never more enlivened than by triumph in war. His gamble did not work out. His more fundamental error was in believing that his rule was more secure than it was. One can see why. The Russian state had a very long history of compelling assent. With church and state united, the public had a long history of acquiescence. He had not realized fully that the bond with the people broke when the Czar was unseated. Kerensky could not imagine the level of public doubt surrounding his position. He was brutal enough to draft people to get killed and maimed in war but lacked the military prowess and loyalty to enforce his new role. Plus, his stated role was to be provisional and bring about elections. That presented to the public a message of vulnerability. Meanwhile, in his own thinking, he was overly deferential to the financial and influence networks of the past. He wanted them on board with the next phase of Russian history, which he would lead. He underestimated the massive gap in perceptions that separated the ruling class and the people on the ground. He tried but failed to heal the chasm. The October Revolution seems inevitable in retrospect, but it was not. Had Kerensky acted quickly to dismantle the machinery of power, immediately withdraw the troops, unplug the money printers, and slash the spending and bureaucracy, his reformist efforts might have led to orderly elections and the normalization of society. Maybe. Instead, Russia experienced a revolution that began with great joy at home and abroad and quickly turned murderous as the entire royal family was slaughtered, the government turned on dissidents, the economy fully collapsed, and a regime far more ferocious than the one it replaced grabbed power and held it for 70 years. Kerensky’s failure to move quickly doomed his country to ruin for all but the last ten years of a full century. This is due to a single miscalculation: underestimating the public’s demand for dramatic change. He and his reformist cronies believed they could make the shift from the center, satisfying critics on all sides with slow-go moves and deference to the status quo. It is only obvious in retrospect that this plan was completely unworkable. It is typical for reformist governments to get carried away congratulating themselves for displacing their hated predecessors. They also tend to overestimate the extent of their hold on power. They are squeezed from two directions: legacy institutional corruption, which hates the intrusion of earnest newcomers, and a public deeply impatient for overthrowing evil. Navigating this maze of influence and pressure is not easy, obviously, but the error is usually the same: too much deference to the existing order and not enough push to accommodate public demands. Trump has his cabinet, which is earnest and includes top leaders of the dissident faction. He has DOGE and Elon Musk, who is said to be powerful due to his net worth, but maybe not. Trump has loyalists around him. He has the confidence of his movement and an aura of personal heroism in overcoming every attempt to defeat him. Trump’s political party has the Congress. But this Congress shows no signs of understanding the seriousness of the moment. Their budgets read as if nothing is going on, that there is no real need for drastic action. Even the foreign aid that Trump has tried to end is fully funded with a budget that adds more trillions to the debt. The larger problem is the machinery that undid his last tenure as president. The Trump administration, even if it is moving as fast and furiously as it is able, constitutes a small faction within a much larger apparatus, including hundreds of agencies, millions of employees, millions more in contractors, and unfathomable webs of finance and influence into every sector of life at home and abroad. It is not possible to describe the fullness of the opposition to change. On the fifth anniversary of lockdowns, X (formerly Twitter) has been subjected to DDOS attacks that took down a platform that was built to be impenetrable. The culprits are unknown. But those with an interest in stopping reform are known: they are the people powerful enough to have shut down the world five years ago. They want no upheaval and will use every resource to prevent it. The Trump administration came to power swearing to take on all of this, beginning with finally bringing some light on the financial books long held in secrecy. It had early successes with an avalanche of executive orders that deleted the most hated features of life under the regime. A month and weeks in, there has been a noticeable slowing of momentum with priority given to cabinet confirmations, budget battles, and trade concerns, which might turn out to be the obsession that distracts from myriad immediate needs. The hold that Trump has on government is more fragile than it looks from the outside. This might be the first administration in a century that has fully understood the problem of the administrative state and has had the determination to do something about it. Most other presidential administrations have either approved of the status quo, pretended not to notice that they are not in charge, or otherwise lacked the driving motivation and mandate to gut it. So too, the Kerensky government faced pressure in two directions: from the establishment that wanted the status quo and the people who wanted revolution. He chose a middle ground. Eight months later, he was gone and replaced by a new ruling junta that made the Romanovs look liberal by comparison. This is justified worry today: Can the reformist government in the US move hard and fast enough to please the fury at the grassroots? Can it stay focused enough to achieve the aim, overcoming myriad obstacles? Or will it go the way of previous post-despotic reformers and become a parenthesis in history, with every earnest aim foiled by a powerful establishment it failed to overthrow?

This is due to a single miscalculation: underestimating the public’s demand for dramatic change. He and his reformist cronies believed they could make the shift from the center, satisfying critics on all sides with slow-go moves and deference to the status quo. It is only obvious in retrospect that this plan was completely unworkable. It is typical for reformist governments to get carried away congratulating themselves for displacing their hated predecessors. They also tend to overestimate the extent of their hold on power. They are squeezed from two directions: legacy institutional corruption, which hates the intrusion of earnest newcomers, and a public deeply impatient for overthrowing evil. Navigating this maze of influence and pressure is not easy, obviously, but the error is usually the same: too much deference to the existing order and not enough push to accommodate public demands. Trump has his cabinet, which is earnest and includes top leaders of the dissident faction. He has DOGE and Elon Musk, who is said to be powerful due to his net worth, but maybe not. Trump has loyalists around him. He has the confidence of his movement and an aura of personal heroism in overcoming every attempt to defeat him. Trump’s political party has the Congress. But this Congress shows no signs of understanding the seriousness of the moment. Their budgets read as if nothing is going on, that there is no real need for drastic action. Even the foreign aid that Trump has tried to end is fully funded with a budget that adds more trillions to the debt. The larger problem is the machinery that undid his last tenure as president. The Trump administration, even if it is moving as fast and furiously as it is able, constitutes a small faction within a much larger apparatus, including hundreds of agencies, millions of employees, millions more in contractors, and unfathomable webs of finance and influence into every sector of life at home and abroad. It is not possible to describe the fullness of the opposition to change. On the fifth anniversary of lockdowns, X (formerly Twitter) has been subjected to DDOS attacks that took down a platform that was built to be impenetrable. The culprits are unknown. But those with an interest in stopping reform are known: they are the people powerful enough to have shut down the world five years ago. They want no upheaval and will use every resource to prevent it. The Trump administration came to power swearing to take on all of this, beginning with finally bringing some light on the financial books long held in secrecy. It had early successes with an avalanche of executive orders that deleted the most hated features of life under the regime. A month and weeks in, there has been a noticeable slowing of momentum with priority given to cabinet confirmations, budget battles, and trade concerns, which might turn out to be the obsession that distracts from myriad immediate needs. The hold that Trump has on government is more fragile than it looks from the outside. This might be the first administration in a century that has fully understood the problem of the administrative state and has had the determination to do something about it. Most other presidential administrations have either approved of the status quo, pretended not to notice that they are not in charge, or otherwise lacked the driving motivation and mandate to gut it. So too, the Kerensky government faced pressure in two directions: from the establishment that wanted the status quo and the people who wanted revolution. He chose a middle ground. Eight months later, he was gone and replaced by a new ruling junta that made the Romanovs look liberal by comparison. This is justified worry today: Can the reformist government in the US move hard and fast enough to please the fury at the grassroots? Can it stay focused enough to achieve the aim, overcoming myriad obstacles? Or will it go the way of previous post-despotic reformers and become a parenthesis in history, with every earnest aim foiled by a powerful establishment it failed to overthrow?

Europe Faces A MAGA ‘Vibe-Shift’ As Trump Moves To His Primordial...	President Trump wants Ukraine settled, full stop. This is so that he can move ahead quickly – to normalise with Russia, and begin the ‘big picture’ project of setting a new World Order, one that will end wars and facilitate business ties. The point here – which Europe feigns to not understand – is that the end to the Ukraine conflict simply is Trump’s ‘gateway’ to the entire rationale and platform on which he stood: The Great Reset of the Geo-Political landscape. Ukraine, simply said, is the obstacle to Trump’s pursuit of his primordial objective: The Global Reset. Starmer, Macron and the eastern wing of the Euro-élites are blind to the sheer scale of the global vibe-shift towards traditionalist U.S. politics and ethics. They miss too, the barely concealed fury in the Trump world that exists behind this nascent revolution. 'The Maga Right has none of the inhibitions of its predecessors. It is planning to leverage the power of a recaptured state to annihilate its enemies', Allister Heath writes. The European Ruling Class is in desperate trouble and increasingly isolated, in a world shifting ‘Rightward’ at breakneck speed. 'The U.S. is now the enemy of the West', the FT proclaims. European leaders wantonly won’t understand. The reality is that the U.S. is engaged now in rolling up Europe’s foreign policy. And, is about to start exporting U.S. traditional Republican values to roll up the European wokeist belief-system. The European Ruling strata – far removed from its base – has failed to grasp the threat to its own interests (a scenario outlined here). The Trump administration is trying to rebuild the ailing Republic, and Americans in this new era do not care for the European obsession with ancient feuds and their entailing wars. Trump reportedly views with utter disdain the UK and European boast that should the U.S. not do it, then Europe will. The Brussels class claims to be able still – after three years of losing in Ukraine – to be able to inflict a humiliating defeat on President Putin. More profoundly, however, Team Trump – committed to the task of taking down the American Deep State as the ‘inexorable enemy’ – perceives (rightly) the British security state to be co-joined at the hip with their American counterparts, as a part of its global meta-structure. And its oldest and deepest component has always been the destruction of Russia, and its dismemberment. So when Macron, in an address to the nation this week, rejected a ceasefire in Ukraine and declared that 'peace in Europe is only possible with a weakened Russia', calling the country a direct threat to France and the continent, many in ‘Trump world’ will interpret this defiant declaration (that ‘Ukraine defeating Russia is preferable to ‘peace’’) is nothing more than Macron and Starmer ventriloquising the aims of the Meta Deep State. This notion is lent substance by the sudden plethora of articles appearing in the European-(managed) MSM to the effect that Russia’s economy is much weaker than it appears and might collapse in the next year. Of course it is nonsense. This is about managing the European public to believe that keeping the war going in Ukraine is a ‘good idea’. The absurdity of the European position was perhaps best captured, as Wolfgang Münchau notes, in its full hubris last year by the historian and writer Anne Applebaum when she won a prestigious German peace prize. During her acceptance speech, she maintained that victory was more important than peace, asserting that the West’s ultimate goal should be regime change in Russia: 'We must help Ukrainians achieve victory, and not only for the sake of Ukraine,' she said. Zelensky and his European fans want ‘to negotiate’ – though later, rather than sooner (perhaps in a year, as one European Foreign Minister reportedly told Marco Rubio privately). 'This', Münchau writes, 'is what the very public disagreement in the Oval Office [last week] was all about. Peace through untrammelled victory — essentially the Second World War model — as the lens through which virtually all European leaders, and most commentators view the Russia-Ukraine conflict'. America sees things differently: It views almost certainly the European Deep State to be putting a spoke into Trump’s ‘normalisation with Russia’ wheel – a normalisation to which they are viscerally opposed. Or, at the very least, as the Europeans chasing a 'mirage that no longer exists, stubbornly hiking ‘tax and spend’, whilst doubling down on mass immigration and overpriced energy, oblivious to the flashing red lights in the [financial markets] as government debt yields rocket to their highest levels since 1998', as Allister Heath outlines. In other words, the suggestion is that Friedrich Merz, Macron and Starmer are talking about how they are going to turn around their countries – via a massive infusion of debt – into defence superstates. Yet, at some level of consciousness, they must realise that it is not doable, so they settle instead for presenting themselves as ‘world leaders on the international stage’. The European élites are deeply unstable ‘leaders’ who are risking the prosperity and stability of the continent. It is clear these countries do not have the military capacity to intervene in any concerted manner. More than anything, it is the European economy circling the drain that is the reality at the gates. Zelensky is accomplice to the European insistence that defeating Russia takes priority over achieving peace in Ukraine, in spite of lacking any strategic rationale as to how it may be achieved after three years of a worsening military situation. Both plans – crushing the Russian economy with sanctions and attrition of the Russian military to the point of collapse – have failed. Why then does Zelensky resist Trump’s peace proposals? On the surface, it makes no sense. The explanation likely goes back to the post-Maidan era when the western ‘Meta Security State’ (principally, the British and the Americans) entrenched hardline Banderites (then a tiny minority) into the Ukrainian Police, Intelligence and Security State. They are still today the controlling force. Even were this faction to acknowledge that their war cannot be won, they understand what happens if they lose: Russia will not deal with them. They view them as extremists (if not war criminals) who are in no way ‘agreement capable’ and must be replaced by a leadership who is actually capable of compromise. Russia would likely pursue and bring these men to trial. Zelensky has to be frightened at what the Banderites might do to him (despite his British team of bodyguards). Well, Trump is not entertaining these European ‘games’: He is administering a slap-down to Zelensky and European leaders, perhaps bringing Zelensky into line; or perhaps not … Team Trump, Politico reports, has now entered into direct talks with the Ukrainian opposition on holding early elections to unseat Zelensky – who is on his way to being removed, members of Team Trump say. Zelensky may be finished, but interestingly Zaluzhniy wasn’t discussed either. He is being groomed by the British as a replacement – it looks like the Americans are going to make this decision independently of the British, too. President Trump has ordered intelligence sharing with Ukraine stopped. What he technically did was to stop allowing Ukraine to use exclusive U.S. targeting systems controlled by U.S. Intelligence, the CIA, the National Reconnaissance Office and the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. What has been suspended is the exchange of so-called ‘lethal’ data, including information for HIMARS targeting. However, the defensive information needed for protection is still being provided to Ukraine. 'The extent of the intelligence-sharing freeze, which appears to have been imposed alongside the halt in military aid Mr Trump announced on Monday, initially appeared to be somewhat limited … But by Wednesday afternoon it became clear that the Trump administration, ignoring overtures from Mr Zelensky the previous evening, had gone much further. A military intelligence officer in Kyiv told The Telegraph that the freeze amounted to 'more or less a total blackout''. Put bluntly, the earlier munitions freeze will undoubtedly affect Ukraine’s military abilities over time, however the impact might not be felt for some weeks. The loss of vital intelligence, however, will make its mark immediately. It will – simply put – blind Ukraine. In Ukrainian command posts, the battle tracking and satellite online feeds on tablets and TV screens have indeed been disconnected. What Trump’s slap-down has done is to puncture the fiction that Ukraine is able to defend itself with a little substitute of European support. That has always been nonsensical bravado. NATO, the CIA and the global Intelligence Community have been in control of the war fighting from the outset. And that, for now, has been switched off. So, Europe wants to shoulder the U.S. burden? Bloomberg reports that European bond markets are in meltdown. If Europe pretends to replace the U.S., it is going to be extremely expensive, very politically costly, and it will fail.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlPZTyabhfd6j	2025-03-11T17:32:48-07:00

Spending Cuts Won’t Weaken The US Economy: They Will Strengthen I...	By Daniel Lacalle The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model projection for real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025 (Q1 2025) is now showing a slump to -1.5 percent. This marks a significant downward revision from the previous estimate of 2.3 percent on February 19, 2025. Such an enormous decline is strange. How did we go from +2.3 percent to -1.5 percent in less than a month? That kind of collapse in an economy as large as the United States is exceedingly rare. The immediate reaction from the media is to call this the beginning of a 'Trump recession' and blame it on President Trump’s policies. Interestingly, on June 1, 2022, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow estimated the second quarter of 2022 growth at +1.3 percent. By July 1, 2022, it had dropped to -2.1 percent, a shift of 3.4 percentage points in 30 days. What did the media call it? 'Growth scare'. A similar thing happened in the third quarter of 2021. The estimate fell from 6.1 percent (July 30) to 2.3 percent (October 1), a 3.8-point drop over two months. In 2022, real GDP declined for two consecutive quarters under Biden’s administration. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the first quarter saw a decrease of -1.6 percent in the annualized rate, followed by a 0.6 percent drop in the second quarter. Hundreds of analysts, commentators, and economists, along with the NBER, swiftly declared that this was not a recession. Thus, it is hilarious to read the hundreds of comments arguing that the Atlanta Fed NowCast means that the new administration’s policies are causing a recession. As I wrote a few months ago, the United States has been in a private sector recession for months. However, an abnormal increase in government spending during a period of growth and a risky borrowing policy led to a bloated Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The United States had a $7.59 trillion nominal GDP increase between 2021 and 2024 compared to a rise of $8.47 trillion in government debt. This marks the worst GDP growth adjusted for government debt accumulation since the 1930s. Many analysts are warning that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts will cause a recession if government spending is aggressively reduced. However, cutting spending may 'reduce' GDP but does not harm productive economic growth; it will likely strengthen it. We must remember that US government spending financed by increasing federal debt accounted for about 22 percent to 25 percent of the total US GDP growth over 2021–2024. This extraordinary increase in government spending in the middle of a recovery led to record-high government debt and was the leading cause of money supply growth and, with it, the inflation burst that Americans are suffering today. A research study from MIT Sloan published on July 17, 2024, by Mark Kritzman et al., titled 'The Determinants of Inflation,' concluded that federal spending was the overwhelming driver of the inflation spike in 2022, estimating it was two to three times more significant than any other factors. Government spending was out of control, leading money supply growth to soar, and the cumulative inflation suffered by Americans in the past four years is over 20.9 percent, with groceries and gas prices rising by more than 40 percent. Excessive government spending was not only the cause of the rise in money supply growth and the burst of inflation but also led to an $8.47 trillion increase in debt and an unsustainable path to financial ruin if policies remained the same. According to the Congressional Budget Office, with no policy changes, the United States would have accumulated deficits of $12.6 trillion between 2025 and 2030. Net interest outlays were expected to grow from $881 billion in 2024 to $1.2 trillion by 2030, even assuming no recessions or unemployment increases. Cutting government spending is essential to reduce prices, bring inflation under control and stop the looming public finance disaster. By 2024, it became evident that revenue measures would not reduce the United States federal deficit. Deficits are always a spending problem. We must remember that 2024’s 2.8 percent GDP growth reflected almost $2 trillion in borrowing, a roughly one-to-one spending-to-growth ratio and a dangerous path to a debt crisis. Private GDP should measure the economy, as government spending and debt do not drive productive growth. Stripping government spending can give us a more accurate picture of the reality of the productive sector in America. The latest Atlanta Fed estimates show a massive decline in net exports (-3.7 percent) due to a large increase in imports, a small decline in consumption of goods (-0.09 percent) but strong services (+0.62 percent) and rises in government expenditure (+0.34 percent) and a healthy increase in investment (+0.62 percent). Thus, the surprising factor is an abnormal slump in exports and a rise in imports that may be revised, because the trade deficit in December 2024 rose to a record $98.4 billion and GDP did not reflect such a massive slump in net exports. The concerning thing is that government spending continues to be excessive, and the United States is running an annualized $2.5 trillion deficit. The United States will not enter a recession due to the change of administration, but because of the excess spending policies of the Biden years. Reducing federal spending, deficit, and debt accumulation is essential to recover the health of the economy. Bloating GDP with public spending and debt is not growing; it is the recipe for disaster.

What Should Republicans Do About Medicaid? – OpEd	Republicans are in a bind. In order to give substance to their new budget bill, they need to cut Medicaid spending by billions of dollars. Yet the White House and many congressional Republicans insist that they do not want to cut Medicaid benefits. Here is where DOGE can come to the rescue. In mainstream economics there is a technical definition of 'waste.' A system is wasteful if it is possible to make a change that can in principle make everyone better off. Fortunately, Medicaid is so inefficient that it provides us with a rich bundle of opportunities. We can make changes that vastly improve services for the beneficiaries and free up billions in savings for the tax bill—at the same time. Here are some examples. Paying market prices. When people are newly enrolled in Medicaid, their visits to the ER increase by 40 percent! A likely reason is that many doctors won’t see Medicaid patients and even if they do, they are the last patients doctors want to see. Also, many of our best medical centers won’t take Medicaid managed care. Medicaid rates are often half the prices charged at walk-in clinics and urgent care centers. Even if some accept Medicaid fees, they rarely locate in areas where Medicaid enrollees live. One answer is to let Medicaid patients buy medical care the way they buy food. In the supermarket, low-income shoppers are free to combine food stamp funds with out-of-pocket money and pay market prices. In health care we have made that option illegal. In a reformed system, Medicaid enrollees could still get free care at the emergency room, and possibly lose a day’s pay. (The in-and-out time at Parkland, a safety net hospital in Dallas, is almost 6 hours!) Or they could save time and taxpayer money by getting care where middle-class patients go. If this reform (coupled with the 24/7 primary care described below) cut Medicaid emergency room spending in half, it would save the federal and state governments as much as $135 billion over 10 years. Roth Health Savings Accounts. Private companies managing Medicaid (or the state itself) should be ableto make deposits to an account that would cover, say, all primary care. Enrollees would be restricted to using the money for health care during an insurance year. Afterward, they could withdraw any unspent funds for any purpose. If there were no penalties for non-medical withdrawals, health care and non-health care would trade against each other on a level playing field under the tax law. People wouldn’t spend a dollar on health care unless they got a dollar’s worth of value. An early study by the RAND Corporation suggests that these accounts would reduce Medicaid spending by 30 percent. Aside from payments for the disabled and nursing home care, if Medicaid spending could be reduced by 30 percent, the savings would amount to almost $1 trillion over ten years. This saving would be shared by the beneficiaries and the taxpayers who fund Medicaid. We could probably double that number by creative programs of self-management and self-directed care for the rest of the Medicaid population. 24/7 primary care. What we used to call concierge medicine is now commonly called 'direct primary care' (DPC) and the prices have come way down. In a national model that originated in Wichita, Kansas, the monthly fee is $50 for a mother and $10 for a child. In return the family gets the doctor’s phone number and 24/7 access to all primary care. This is a competitive market and if at any time the family is unsatisfied, they can switch to another DPC doctor. Currently, employers are not allowed to put funds in an HSA to be used for DPC. By contrast, the Roth HSAs for Medicaid described above would be a perfect vehicle to facilitate DPC. Reducing fraud. According to the General Accounting Office, fraud in Medicare and Medicaid amounts to $100 billion a year, and the office admits that’s a low estimate. In principle, credit card fraud should be much easier to commit than health care fraud. (Think of how often your card goes out of sight in the possession of a waiter or other vendor.) Yet losses to credit card fraud amount to a fraction of 1 percent of spending. If the federal government could manage Medicare and Medicaid as efficiently as the credit card industry (or maybe contract out to them) the savings would approach $1 trillion over ten years. An optional Medicaid block grant. State governments should have the option of receiving 90% of their federal Medicaid dollars in the form of a block grant—saving federal taxpayers the other 10%. With their share, the states could do some of the things already discussed. They could create Roth HSAs outside the federal tax system. They could make deposits to these accounts and let enrollees pay market prices for their care. They could also allow HSA money to be used to pay the fees of direct primary care doctors, providing 24/7 care. If every state accepts the deal, taxpayer savings would be about $630 billion over 10 years. Legislation. A number of the ideas discussed here are already in legislation co-authored by Rep Pete Sessions (R-TX) and his colleagues. So, a good part of the reforms described here could be achieved by little more than cut and paste.

What Should Republicans Do About Medicaid? – OpEd	Republicans are in a bind. In order to give substance to their new budget bill, they need to cut Medicaid spending by billions of dollars. Yet the White House and many congressional Republicans insist that they do not want to cut Medicaid benefits. Here is where DOGE can come to the rescue.

The Democrats’ Necessary Apology – OpEd	An old friend asked me to write a short piece on what I think we (progressives) should do now. I mentioned some immediate ways to stem the Trump Blitzkrieg. I largely agree with the Nicholas Kristof price of eggs approach, although I think it’s also essential to demonize 'Elon the Nazi.' Politicians should be embarrassed to take his money, just as they would be embarrassed to take money from ISIS or Al Queda. But the Democrats really do need to take some big steps to reform themselves. There are many good progressive policies they should be pushing, like a big hike in the minimum wage, cracking down on drug prices, preventing insurers from ripping people off. But they also need a moment of reckoning with their past. The Democrats were considered the party of the establishment in the 2024 election. This is a bad place to be when people are angry. And people have cause to be angry. The Democrats supported a variety of policies that had the effect of redistributing income upward, from ordinary workers to highly paid workers (e.g. professionals, high-level corporate executives, and Wall Street types). The most visible policy in this category was trade. And Democrats have their fingerprint all over it, with NAFTA having been signed by Clinton and China being admitted to the WTO, also under Clinton. It’s true that more Republicans than Democrats in Congress supported these trade policies, but that doesn’t matter. The person sitting in the White House was a Democrat. And these deals really were bad news for workers without college degrees. By exposing manufacturing workers to direct competition with low-paid workers in China and other developing countries they cost the country millions of good-paying union jobs in manufacturing, and they lowered the pay for the jobs that remain. With unionization rates in manufacturing now only slightly higher than the rest of the private sector, the wage premium that workers used to enjoy in manufacturing has largely been eliminated. Not only was the Democrats’ trade policy very bad news for the country’s workers. They also lied about it. I don’t know how many times I have seen this graph showing manufacturing employment as a share of total employment. The story here is that there is a steady decline from the 1970s until 2010. In this story, there is nothing to see in the decade of the 00s, when the trade deficit exploded. But then there is the other graph showing manufacturing employment since 1970. The basic story is that there are cyclical ups and downs, but only a modest decline until 2000. Then we lost 3.4 million manufacturing jobs, 20 percent of all manufacturing jobs, from 2000 to 2007, before the Great Recession. This was the impact of trade. Millions of workers saw their lives ruined. Cities and towns across the Midwest saw their main employers lay off much of their labor force or go out of business altogether. The workers and communities affected have a right to be angry. Also, we should be clear, it was a lie to say this was 'free trade.' We didn’t expose our doctors to competition with their lower paid counterparts in the developing world or even Europe and Canada. As a result, our doctors get paid twice as much as doctors in other wealthy countries. We also made government-granted patent and copyright monopolies longer and stronger, a move that is 180 degrees at odds with free trade. This redistributed a huge amount of income upward, most obviously in the case of prescription drugs. We pay hundreds of billions of dollars a year ($4,000 per household) more than we would if drugs were sold in a free market. Pushing trade deals that were designed to screw ordinary workers and redistribute income upward predictably made the victims angry at the Democrats. An apology is definitely in order, even (especially) if that means throwing Bill Clinton under the bus.

Criticism Of Israel Is Misrepresented As Anti-Semitism – OpEd	By Jonathan Power In the New York Times, columnist Roger Cohen argued that anyone who queries the Jewish right to Israel is anti-Semitic. More than that, he accuses us of being racist, even though many of us fought against South African apartheid. He accuses us of 'pursuing the systematic 'Nazification' of Israel.' This is accusation by association. Israelis make this accusation daily. Let’s look at the facts. I’m anti-Israel, especially its present government, but for good reason I’m anti-Semitic. The Semitics bend history. After the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in AD 70 the Jews were thrust into the outer world — many into Arab countries, later to become Muslim, where they were extended protection, and later into the Roman and then Christian world where they were accepted for many centuries. There were no pogroms until the Middle Ages and then they were centuries apart. Over two millennia many big tribal groups have been dispersed — the Slavs, the Moguls, the Bantu, the Kurds, the Tamils, the Celts — the list is a long one — but only the Jews have had an idée fixe about where they want to go back to. During the last thousand years, while the Jews were in the diaspora, the Arabs reinforced their settlements on the same land that some Jews yearned for, just as pre-Arab tribes had settled it in the time before Moses — and just as the Celts settled in Ireland, the Europeans in North America, the Moguls in India and the Russians in Siberia. When in 1897 the rabbis of Vienna sent a fact-finding mission to Palestine, they reported back that the bride 'was beautiful but married to another man.' Theodor Herzl, the convenor of the first Zionist Conference, was not obsessed by a return to Palestine. Almost anywhere would do. Argentina was the first choice with its empty fertile spaces. The Uasin Gishu plateau near Nairobi, Kenya, was another. But the Zionist conference overruled him. The course of the First World War and the likely break-up of the Ottoman Empire led the British to think that Jewish control of Palestine would be more secure for British interests than Arab. In 1917 came the Balfour Declaration whereby the British cabinet declared that they viewed 'with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.' Lord Curzon, the former Indian viceroy, denounced it as an act of 'sentimental idealism' and said ironically that Britain had a 'stronger claim to parts of France.' Old Testament According to the texts of the Old Testament, the ultra-religious, settlement inclined, Israelis have it partly right — the whole of Palestine did once belong to them. But only partly. Read Genesis. When the Lord spoke to Moses and told him that he would deliver the Jews from Egypt he also said he would bring them into 'a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.' In other words, the Jews were to conquer and displace other tribes who had been long possessors of the land now called Palestine, and even other tribes further south such as the Midianites. Later in the Book of Numbers, the Lord told Moses to 'vex the Midianites and smite them'. Moses and his army did. 'They slew all the males' and took the women and children captive. Then Moses said to his commanders, 'Have you saved all the women alive?……Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known a man by lying with him.' He claimed that God told him to do this. The Jews would stop at almost nothing. Genocide, on occasion, was the tool of total conquest. Is this the proud history that present day Jews are fighting to uphold millennia later? The Jews of the Old Testament were as cruel as the Moguls and Tartars, and it is as difficult to justify the present-day Israeli occupation of Palestine as it would be to justify a Mogul regime in Russia or an Islamic one in northern India. If the Jews want the rest of the world’s sympathy, they have to be able to justify their modern-day presence in Palestine better than they do. They have to recognize how wrong were their conquests, both old and present. But now the Jews are in Palestine in such significant numbers the only solution is to honour the rest of the text of the Balfour Declaration. 'Nothing should be done that may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine', it said. This was the British condition. The Israelis overlook it today at their peril.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlAf3IDnsLhOv	2025-03-11T17:20:54-07:00

Cracking Down On US Colleges, For Israel – OpEd	The United States government does not need to give a dime to any college. But, if it does continue its funding of colleges, the First Amendment of the US Constitution bars that funding from being denied to a college because the college is determined to have insufficiently prevented speech the US government opposes, such as speech the US government deems to be critical of the Israel government. For this reason, President Trump’s effort to crack down on and bar funding to colleges the US executive branch concludes have insufficiently prevented anti-Israel or 'antisemitic' speech should be, and can be expected to be, struck down by courts. ('Antisemitic' under the peculiar definition being pushed by the Trump administration includes speech against the Israel government, not just speech against an ethnicity or religion as the term 'antisemitic' is generally understood to indicate.) This conclusion of unconstitutionality follows from a basic understanding of constitutional law that System Update host and astute politics commentator Glenn Greenwald described well in a video monologue he released this week.

Azerbaijan Creates Pathway To Reconciliation With Russia	(Eurasianet) -- An arrangement is in place that would allow Azerbaijan and Russia to move on from a bitter dispute over the accidental Russian shoot-down of an Azerbaijani civilian passenger jet. Russia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since late December when the Azerbaijani plane bound for the city of Grozny in the Russian republic of Chechnya was accidentally hit by anti-aircraft flak and ultimately crash landed in Kazakhstan, killing 38 of the 67 people aboard. The refusal of Russian officials to take responsibility for the crash and apologize stoked a series of acrimonious verbal exchanges between officials in Baku and Moscow, threatening to cause a rupture in their strategic partnership. In late February, however, the tone of the bilateral tiff shifted noticeably. It started with a post on the Telegram social media channel by Chechnya’s warlord, Ramzan Kadyrov, announcing that he will award medals for valor to the two plane crew members who survived the crash. He added that a memorial plaque to the crash victims will be installed in the Chechen capital. 'Their actions have become an example of true service and humanity,' Kadyrov wrote, referring to the plane’s crew members. Kadyrov’s comments apparently have soothed tempers in Baku and opened a pathway to reconciliation. In the days immediately after the crash, Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev reportedly refused to take a call from Kadyrov. Azerbaijani anger stemmed from the fact that Kadyrov had awarded a medal to his nephew for supposedly leading a stout air defense against a Ukrainian drone attack on Grozny shortly before the Azerbaijani airliner was hit by flak. The official stance in Baku towards Chechnya immediately softened following Kadyrov’s good-will gesture. 'The decision by Chechen authorities to award certain individuals after the crash understandably sparked strong outrage in Azerbaijani society. However, investigations have confirmed—and Azerbaijan has precise information—that the Chechen leadership had no involvement or responsibility in the incident,' a government source was quoted as saying by the Trend news agency on February 27. The source also told Trend that Russian military personnel were directly responsible for bringing the plane down. 'In Azerbaijan, the voiced position on this matter is deemed acceptable, even if it comes late,' the source added, referring to Kadyrov. Economic considerations are likely the reason for Baku’s softening stance. 'Despite the tensions, both sides have too much to lose from a lasting fallout,' Maxim Trudolyubov, an expert at the Kennan Institute in Washington, stated in an analysis published by the institute’s website. 'Russia relies on Azerbaijan for transport routes vital to its relations with Iran and the Persian Gulf, while Baku’s geopolitical pragmatism and shared strategic interests will likely push both countries toward reconciliation—though on terms that reflect Azerbaijan’s growing assertiveness.' Baku’s apparent absolution of Chechen involvement makes it easier for Putin to find a way to satisfy Azerbaijani complaints. Chechnya is perhaps the only corner of Russia where Putin’s word is not law; Kadyrov controls a private army numbering in the tens of thousands and operates with a wide degree of latitude from Moscow. In short, Putin couldn’t easily pin the blame on Chechens and compel Kadyrov to come up with some scapegoats for punishment. Now, Putin has a bit more leeway to act. If he so desires, he can identify a few unfortunate Russian recruits for punishment and all parties involved can move on. The question now is whether Putin will walk through the door that Azerbaijan has opened for him?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlGa0gBnU2P4q	2025-03-11T17:16:27-07:00

Russia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since late December when the Azerbaijani plane bound for the city of Grozny in the Russian republic of Chechnya was accidentally hit by anti-aircraft flak and ultimately crash landed in Kazakhstan, killing 38 of the 67 people aboard. The refusal of Russian officials to take responsibility for the crash and apologize stoked a series of acrimonious verbal exchanges between officials in Baku and Moscow, threatening to cause a rupture in their strategic partnership. In late February, however, the tone of the bilateral tiff shifted noticeably. It started with a post on the Telegram social media channel by Chechnya’s warlord, Ramzan Kadyrov, announcing that he will award medals for valor to the two plane crew members who survived the crash. He added that a memorial plaque to the crash victims will be installed in the Chechen capital. 'Their actions have become an example of true service and humanity,' Kadyrov wrote, referring to the plane’s crew members. Kadyrov’s comments apparently have soothed tempers in Baku and opened a pathway to reconciliation. In the days immediately after the crash, Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev reportedly refused to take a call from Kadyrov. Azerbaijani anger stemmed from the fact that Kadyrov had awarded a medal to his nephew for supposedly leading a stout air defense against a Ukrainian drone attack on Grozny shortly before the Azerbaijani airliner was hit by flak. The official stance in Baku towards Chechnya immediately softened following Kadyrov’s good-will gesture. 'The decision by Chechen authorities to award certain individuals after the crash understandably sparked strong outrage in Azerbaijani society. However, investigations have confirmed—and Azerbaijan has precise information—that the Chechen leadership had no involvement or responsibility in the incident,' a government source was quoted as saying by the Trend news agency on February 27. The source also told Trend that Russian military personnel were directly responsible for bringing the plane down. 'In Azerbaijan, the voiced position on this matter is deemed acceptable, even if it comes late,' the source added, referring to Kadyrov. Economic considerations are likely the reason for Baku’s softening stance. 'Despite the tensions, both sides have too much to lose from a lasting fallout,' Maxim Trudolyubov, an expert at the Kennan Institute in Washington, stated in an analysis published by the institute’s website. 'Russia relies on Azerbaijan for transport routes vital to its relations with Iran and the Persian Gulf, while Baku’s geopolitical pragmatism and shared strategic interests will likely push both countries toward reconciliation—though on terms that reflect Azerbaijan’s growing assertiveness.' Baku’s apparent absolution of Chechen involvement makes it easier for Putin to find a way to satisfy Azerbaijani complaints. Chechnya is perhaps the only corner of Russia where Putin’s word is not law; Kadyrov controls a private army numbering in the tens of thousands and operates with a wide degree of latitude from Moscow. In short, Putin couldn’t easily pin the blame on Chechens and compel Kadyrov to come up with some scapegoats for punishment. Now, Putin has a bit more leeway to act. If he so desires, he can identify a few unfortunate Russian recruits for punishment and all parties involved can move on. The question now is whether Putin will walk through the door that Azerbaijan has opened for him?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcyPosbFQglLdGzqSts9U-	2025-03-11T17:16:27-07:00	
Portugal’s Government Collapses After Confidence Vote (Again)	By Charles Szumski Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro's centre-right government lost a crucial vote of confidence amid a conflict of interest scandal, reigniting a cycle of dysfunction in the country's poiltics that stretches back years. Montenegro's government collapsed late Tuesday just over a year after his Democratic Alliance took power. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is expected to announce a snap election for mid-May. Scandals The current political turmoil stemmed from allegations concerning Montenegro's family business, Spinumviva, a consultancy firm specialising in compliance and personal data protection services. Investigations revealed that the company continued receiving payments from clients, including the casino group Solverde, even after Montenegro assumed office as prime minister in 2024. Montenegro's transfer of shares in the company to his wife also raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. The revelations led opposition parties, notably the Socialist Party and the far-right Chega, to announce their intention to vote against the government's confidence motion. increasing the likelihood of early elections later this year instead of in March 2028. Critics said new elections alone would not solve the underlying culture of corruption that many observers fear has taken hold of Portuguese politics. 'Elections do not replace or dispense with explanations,' Portuguese commentator Pedro Norton wrote on Publico, warning that the scandal would further corrode the health of Portugal's battered democracy. Third time's the charm With the fall of the Montenegro government, Portugal will have held three general elections in three years. The first was in January 2022, following the rejection of the Socialist Party (PS) government's budget in October 2021. The impasse led President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to dissolve parliament and call early elections. The PS, then led by Prime Minister António Costa, the current Council president, secured an absolute majority and formed a new government in March of the same year. In November 2023 however, Costa's administration was embroiled in a corruption scandal of its own involving his chief of staff, Vítor Escária, and Infrastructure Minister João Galamba. The investigation, known as Operation Influencer, centred on alleged irregularities in the awarding of contracts for lithium mining, green hydrogen projects, and data centres in the country. Under mounting pressure, Costa resigned, leading to early elections in March 2024. These elections brought Montenegro's centre-right Democratic Alliance to power with a minority government. However, his tenure was short-lived. Far-right boon The succession of political crises has led to frequent electoral cycles and heightened public disenchantment with traditional political institutions. According to sociologist António Barreto, quoted by Publico, the repeated political crisis caused two of the most damaging phenomena in the country's life: abstention from politics and the far-right party Chega. The instability has created fertile ground for populist movements, notably the far-right party, which has capitalised on the prevailing discontent to expand its influence. During the last elections, Chega secured 18.1% of the vote, resulting in 50 seats in the 230-member Assembly of the Republic, ranking third after the Socialist party and the centre-right Social Democrats. Portuguese voters did not respond to calls for a 'meaningful vote,' resulting in the 'most fragmented parliament ever', and with Chega being the 'big winner' of the last election, according to political experts who then spoke to Euractiv's partner Lusa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlNy5i4sYWtgx	2025-03-11T17:10:57-07:00

Trump’s Address To Congress Highlights The Absence Of Opposition ...	The relentless resistance that defined Trump's first term has faded into an unsettling quiet. A perfect storm of factors has granted him relatively unchecked power to push drastic domestic and international changes. During his address to Congress on March 4, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump faced brief heckling from Democratic Representative AI Green and scattered jeers from his colleagues. But the overwhelming response was silence, reflective of the reality that opposition to Trump has sharply weakened, even as his administration pushes sweeping domestic and international policy upheaval. The opening weeks of his first term in January 2017 were met with fierce resistance, and not just from combative Democrats. People came together to protest against Trump's immigration policies and his proposed travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. Republican politicians openly defied him amid constant media scrutiny. Clashes with the so-called 'deep state' due to intelligence leaks escalated when the FBI publicly confirmed an investigation into the Trump-Russia collusion in the 2016 election. These combined tensions defined his first term, culminating in him being temporarily banned from most major social media platforms and leading to widespread condemnation and isolation after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Now, at the start of his second term, opposition is notably subdued. The Women's March that drew millions in 2017, becoming 'the largest single-day public demonstration in U.S. history,' according to the New York Times, seems to have 'lost its luster' during his second term. The February 5 protest against Trump and Elon Musk's policies drew a low turnout, mostly confined to liberal enclaves, and the 2025 Oscars—once a stage for political grandstanding—avoided directly critiquing the president. Even Green's disruption caused dissent within his own party, with 10 Democrats censuring him the next day. Political and institutional fatigue, shifting cultural dynamics, and strategic alignment by corporations, billionaires, politicians, and other public figures have blunted resistance, leaving the Trump administration with fewer obstacles as it pushes forward with its agenda. One major factor is the weakness and division within the Democratic Party, preventing grassroots progressives from working with top-level establishment Democrats. After years of Biden attempting to balance the party's competing factions, tensions rose significantly following his response to the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas. Trump's victory a year later—securing both the electoral college and popular vote—has only deepened these fractures, fueling a blame game that contrasts with the unity following Trump's narrower 2016 election victory. The party's electoral failures are compounded by the absence of a unifying figure. Nancy Pelosi is no longer speaker, and while Chuck Schumer is the Senate minority leader, both of them are old and unpopular. Bernie Sanders, who is in his 80s, represents a sidelined progressive movement that has struggled to elevate new, dynamic leaders due to years of suppression by establishment Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has failed to offer new solutions, only deepening apathy and fatigue. Without organizational cohesion and the ability to inspire its base, the Democratic Party has been unable to marshal its diverse coalition against Trump's agenda. The issue that has mobilized progressives in large numbers in recent years is Palestine, which establishment Democrats are reluctant to support, including the recent arrest and threatened deportation of pro-Palestinian student Mahmoud Khalil. Losing young male voters has further weakened the party's ability to generate active dissent. Its association with progressive identity politics has meanwhile alienated broader segments of the electorate, with Biden having failed to address glaring economic issues and matters like crime and immigration during his presidency. On the Republican side, dissenting voices like Mitt Romney and the late John McCain are gone, and those who still might challenge Trump within the party fear backlash and isolation. 'Never Trump' conservative groups have struggled to pull voters away, while Trump's systemic dismantling of government bureaucracy (historically staffed with left-leaning officials) and the appointment of loyalists to key positions have cemented his control over the government and prevented institutional attempts to undermine him. With Republican control over all three branches of government, a conservative-majority Supreme Court, and Trump loyalists installed across federal agencies, his power—though often overstated—far surpasses that of his first term. Executive orders, constrained by previous presidents, are now being deployed at an unprecedented rate. His administration's ambitious federal restructuring efforts, tied to the Project 2025 framework, go beyond the government overhauls of Ronald Reagan's Grace Commission or Bill Clinton's bipartisan National Performance Review. Yet, Democratic disarray has left these efforts largely unchecked. Trump's progress also hinges on the support of the ultrawealthy. The Democratic Party is experiencing a funding shortfall, not just from grassroots donors but from major oligarchs as well. Meanwhile, Trump has secured broader public backing from America's corporate elite. Years of frustration with Democrats and the political left over issues like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, taxation, and regulations have pushed many business leaders toward his camp. This repositioning was on full display at Trump's inauguration, where Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and many more wealthy individuals were given front-row seats. Google's decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America,' a Trump executive order, signals the larger realignment across corporate America. No billionaire has played a more consequential role than Elon Musk. Though his relationship with Trump was rocky just a few years ago, Musk's endorsement of Trump in July 2024 cemented a powerful alliance between them. Musk's control of X (formerly Twitter) not only reintroduced Trump to the media platform but also helped normalize his return to other social media networks. Meanwhile, Democrats have struggled to maintain their online presence amid declining engagement and financial strain. This realignment has extended into the corporate media landscape. The aggressive anti-Trump narratives that dominated his first term have softened, driven by audience backlash against media institutions and wider progressive messaging. With traditional media outlets facing declining viewership, and the growing influence of oligarchic forces now backing Trump, the media's pivot is as much about survival as it is about political recalibration. Signs of this emerged even before the election. Jeff Bezos, who has owned the Washington Post since 2013, withdrew the paper's endorsement of Kamala Harris, as did billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times. CNN, under new leadership since 2023, has steadily adopted a more centrist tone, shedding high-profile anti-Trump figures like Don Lemon. MSNBC is undergoing an even more dramatic transformation, with outspoken Trump critics like Joy Reid and Alex Wagner losing their primetime slots in February 2025, while there has been scaling back of influence of others like Rachel Maddow in favor of less combative voices. Emboldened by a changing media environment, Trump is increasingly punishing outlets. The Associated Press was banned from presidential events in February after declining to adopt the 'Gulf of America' name. CBS remains embroiled in a $20 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over an edited interview with Kamala Harris, with Musk declaring that CBS reporters 'deserve a long prison sentence.' Meanwhile, Disney-ABC settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump for $15 million and recently replaced a transgender character from a new series with a Christian one. Meta, too, in January 2025, settled for $25 million for banning Trump from Facebook and Instagram after January 6. While these are small fines for corporate giants, they symbolize an increasing subservience to Trump, with both payments directed toward funding Trump's presidential library. It's hardly surprising that Trump appears so powerful at this moment. Political opposition is fractured, leaving no effective barriers to Trump's agenda. Many oligarchs have given him their quiet or public approval, as seen during his inauguration. The media's softened stance has shaped a perception of reduced conflict. The absence of strong opposition has created new momentum as political, corporate, and media institutions adapt to this shifting power balance instead of fighting it, reducing the public's appetite for resistance as well. For now, Trump is riding high after his election victory. But cracks are beginning to show. Public resistance to Musk's influence is growing, and the economic turbulence triggered by Trump's policies is stirring unease. Without a strong and combative adversary, Trump and his most ardent supporters may find themselves without a rallying cause. International stability could further test his power, and the reality of governance may prove far more challenging than dismantling what came before. Is this already the peak of Trump's power, or can it be sustained? Opposition to Trump fluctuated during his first term, yet today, the political, business, and cultural landscapes have adjusted in his favor. His greatest advantage, however, may be the quiet acquiescence of elites from various backgrounds. While some may oppose him openly, many are content to let events play out due to self-interest or inertia. About the author: John P.

South Africa: Call For Collaboration To Boost Infrastructure Inve...	President Cyril Ramaphosa has emphasised the need for strong collaboration between government and business to scale up infrastructure investment and drive South Africa’s economic growth.Speaking during a Questions for Oral Reply session in the National Assembly on Tuesday, the President highlighted the importance of structural reforms to address key constraints, such as energy supply and inefficiencies in freight and logistics. 'For South Africa to achieve the levels of economic growth it needs, it is essential that government and business work together to scale up investment in infrastructure.'Government has committed to an ambitious infrastructure build programme. Infrastructure spend by government will encourage and enable greater private sector investment in sectors such as electricity generation, electricity distribution, rail rolling-stock, and water distribution,' the President said. However, he stressed the distinction between public and private financial resources, particularly pension funds held by financial institutions. These funds, he noted, belong to workers and are intended for their retirement, making them private assets rather than State resources.To facilitate infrastructure investment, the President said that government needs to provide these savers with a reasonable return and ensure that these funds are safeguarded. In 2022, National Treasury amended Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act to allow for longer-term infrastructure investments by retirement funds. The changes introduced a definition of infrastructure and set a 45% upper limit for pension fund investments in infrastructure projects.Further regulatory adjustments have been made to facilitate economic development, including separating the investment limits for hedge funds and private equity. The allocation for private equity assets has been increased from 10% to 15%, allowing for greater infrastructure investments.In the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement of October 2024, the Minister of Finance announced work underway on mechanisms to complement the changes to Regulation 28 through the development of specific investment vehicles to simplify and incentivise institutional investors. The President said details on these mechanisms will be published in the upcoming Budget, which is expected to be delivered on Wednesday, 12 March 2025.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlEHVzdL_0VhC	2025-03-11T17:06:17-07:00

Five Takeaways From China’s National People’s Congress	By Qian Lang, Yitong Wu and Ha Syut China’s 10-day National People Congress ended in Beijing on Tuesday amid sweeping promises from the country’s leaders to boost economic growth, support AI and to take control over democratic Taiwan. Delegates also shed light on Beijing’s intentions for Tibet and revealed for the first time that U.S. sanctions on companies in Xinjiang using Uyghur forced labor are hurting business. Here are five takeaways: China aims to spur consumer spending amid looming trade war with US In his March 5 work report, Premier Li Qiang pledged to boost domestic consumption as the driving force for economic growth, which he set at 5% for the coming year -- a target experts say is highly questionable and likely concocted for political reasons. For years, exports have driven China’s growth. But leaders have tried to shift the focus to consumer spending after three years of COVID-19 restrictions and a slew of U.S. tariffs prompted manufacturers to move away from China and spooked foreign investors. And now President Donald Trump has imposed additional tariffs on Chinese exports to America. To shore up the economy, the government plans to boost fiscal spending by 1.2 trillion yuan (US$165 billion) to 29.7 trillion yuan (US$4.16 billion), Li said -- but gave few details of how that money would be spent. He also pledged to implement 'an appropriately accommodative monetary policy' in the coming year. 'The impact of this National People’s Congress on the Chinese people is that their economy is now moving from strength to weakness, and this weakness will be long term,' social economist Ji Rong told RFA Mandarin in a recent interview. One proposal discussed by delegates to the 10-day National People’s Congress in Beijing was shortening the working week to four-and-a-half days to give people more leisure time. The government will also further cut the personal income tax rate in a bid to boost purchasing power among middle- and low-earners. An economic commentator who gave only the surname Hong for fear of reprisals said changes to the working week could prove effective, but that Li’s work report contained few other practical measures. AI and high-tech seen as key sources of growth Li Qiang also vowed to 'unleash the creativity of the digital economy,' particularly through the use of AI. 'We will support the extensive application of large-scale AI models and vigorously develop new-generation intelligent terminals and smart manufacturing equipment, including intelligent connected new-energy vehicles, AI-enabled phones and computers, and intelligent robots,' he told delegates. Li was speaking weeks after China’s launched its DeepSeek AI model, in what some called a 'Sputnik moment' for the country. Li also promised increased funding for AI, biomanufacturing, quantum technology and 6G, without giving further details. But experts said China will continue to be hampered by U.S. export and high-tech bans, including for cutting-edge semiconductors. China’s increasingly powerful AI surveillance systems use facial recognition and combine data streams to create sophisticated 'city brains' that can track events in real time, and are increasingly being exported around the world, according to a recent report. The technology is also raising concerns about its use to treat patients by medical professionals, as well as to aid cheating in competitions (in Chinese). Tibetan officials vow to expand ideological education and Sinicize Tibetan Buddhism The Tibet Autonomous Region delegation vowed to strengthen efforts to fight 'separatism' and prioritize 'long-term stability' by expanding ideological education, as well as accelerate the Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism, which they said was key to 'changing the face of Tibet.' The delegates emphasized their commitment to ideological education guided by the 'Three Consciousnesses,' a phrase used in Chinese propaganda to refer to national -- or Han Chinese -- consciousness, civic duties and the rule of law. 'I believe this kind of education is highly effective,' said Karma Tseten, deputy head of the delegation and Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, or TAR. 'Despite its value, it is constantly smeared and disrupted by the Dalai Lama and his group. But we will not be swayed.' The rhetoric was a clear sign, experts said, that Beijing intends to continue to impose its repressive policies in Tibet under the guise of maintaining stability and combating separatism. 'Regardless of what policies China implements in Tibet, their stated goal of ‘maintaining stability’ fundamentally reveals that Tibetans do not trust the Chinese government,' Dawa Tsering, director at the Tibet Policy Institute, told Radio Free Asia. Delegates said at a media briefing on Thursday that more than 90 percent of community leaders in Tibet now had basic knowledge of Mandarin. They also emphasized that they will continue to focus on promoting in Tibet what China calls the 'four major events' -– border security, environment, stability and economic and social development. Top official from Uyghur region admits US sanctions are hurting businesses During the congress, the Chinese government acknowledged for the first time that U.S. sanctions over the use of Uyghur forced labor have affected more than 100 companies in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region, or XUAR, proving that international sanctions do have bite. Ma Xingrui, the XUAR party secretary, told delegates that 'the United States, relying on fabricated evidence, has imposed sanctions on Xinjiang businesses based on allegations of genocide and forced labor, affected more than 144 companies,' according to the China Daily. Sanctions 'over accusations of ‘forced labor’ have become one of the biggest challenges in the region’s development,' Ma said during a panel discussion Friday at the NPC, according to the report. While Ma didn’t elaborate on which companies were affected, this marks the first time the region’s highest party official admitted the sanctions were hurting businesses. The United States and nearly a dozen Western parliaments have accused China of committing genocide and crimes against humanity against the 13 million Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples living in Xinjiang. In 2021, the U.S. government has passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans U.S. companies from doing business with Chinese businesses judged to be using Uyghur forced labor. Since then, some 144 companies have been blacklisted. These sanctions are undermining the economic development of Xinjiang, which is a chief way that Beijing 'wants to extend the legitimacy of its rule,' said Raymond Kuo, a China expert at Rand Corporation, a Washington think tank. 'Ultimately, the economic benefits that come from [Beijing’s] rule are going to be the key thing to increase the legitimacy of its rule as well as win over the population,' he said. 'Western sanctions inhibit that.' The sanctions are 'particularly politically important for Xinjiang,' Kuo added. 'They’re clearly having some impact, right?' China to boost military spending by 7.2% China is increasing its 2025 defense budget by 7.2% to US$246 billion amid growing rivalry with the United States and tensions over Taiwan, marking the fourth consecutive year of more than 7% growth in defense spending. Li said Beijing would continue to 'resolutely oppose separatist activities' in democratic Taiwan, as well as what he termed 'external interference.' China has ramped up military activities around Taiwan, conducting frequent air and naval incursions into the island’s air defense identification zone and staging large-scale drills near its waters. Beijing views Taiwan as an inseparable part of its territory and insists on eventual unification, by force if necessary. Yet Li also vowed a soft power charm offensive to push for what Beijing calls 'peaceful unification.' 'We will improve institutions and policies for promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and advance integrated cross-Strait development,' he said. 'We will firmly advance the cause of China’s unification.' Military expert Pang Xinhua said China’s neighbors in the region are also worried about escalating military tensions. 'As China increases its military activities in the South China Sea, East China Sea and other regions, neighboring countries may worry about rising regional tensions leading to an escalating arms race,' Pang told RFA Mandarin. 'That could in turn lead to an escalation of the situation in the Taiwan Strait, as China’s continued strengthening of its military capabilities is interpreted as pressure on Taiwan,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlAEZI-TXy18H	2025-03-11T17:01:07-07:00	
Five Takeaways From China’s National People’s Congress	By Qian Lang, Yitong Wu and Ha Syut China’s 10-day National People Congress ended in Beijing on Tuesday amid sweeping promises from the country’s leaders to boost economic growth, support AI and to take control over democratic Taiwan.

Was October 7 Avoidable? – OpEd	After the Hamas-led offensive of October 7, 2023, it was portrayed as 'Israel’s 9/11,' which came out of the blue. Yet, this assumption is not supported by verified facts, including ignored intelligence, abandoned hostages and neglected Israeli communities around Gaza. A day after October 7, Eurasia Group’s Ian Bremmer said that the 'massive attacks by Hamas leadership into Israel … is no less than Israel’s 9/11.' By contrast, in the same interview for CNBC, I said that October 7 did not come out of the blue. 'The Israeli-Hamas War is a logical result of 50 years of failed military policies.' Our views were diametrically opposed. I had warned of the ticking time bomb in Gaza already in 2018, half a decade before. A day or two before October 7, I wrote an essay on the coming explosion in Gaza. It was not prophetic insight. October 7, 2023, was the 50-year anniversary of the Yom Kippur War and I fully expected a high-profile reaction. After the brutal Hamas-led assault, Israeli authorities vehemently condemned what they called 'our September 11' and a 'surprise attack.' But the hard questions were conveniently ignored – and still are. A week ago, the Israeli Defense Forces’ landmark investigations into the October 7 attack disclosed severe, deep-rooted intelligence miscalculations and fundamental misconceptions on the nature of Hamas and its intentions by both the Israeli government and military. Probing the same attack, Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, recently pointed fingers at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Typically, the prime mistakes featured the political conception of Hamas as an Israeli asset, the intelligence misjudgment that it couldn't launch a large-scale attack, and weak defensive deployment. The intriguing part of the story is that these facts were pretty well known already in the first days after October 7, 2023 – that is, more than a year ago – as I argue in The Fall of Israel. And there is more to the story. Why was the abundant intelligence on the impending Hamas attack deliberately ignored? Why were the Israeli hostages effectively abandoned? Why were the strategic border communities neglected? With all its might, backed up with U.S. military aid and financing, how did Israel fail to see the writing on the wall? Ignored intelligence After October 7, a high-level Egyptian intelligence official said Israel had ignored repeated warnings that 'an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big.' Netanyahu denied receiving any such advance warning. Yet, the Egyptian confirmed that the Israeli PM had received direct notice from Cairo’s intelligence minister. Similarly, Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters of the alleged warning. The inconvenient fact was that Israeli intelligence authorities had been aware of the threat for months yet ignored it. In November 2023, the New York Times reported that 'Israel knew Hamas’s attack plan more than a year ago.' Code-named Jericho Wall, the 40-page blueprint outlined a lethal invasion. The document had been circulated widely among Israeli military and intelligence leaders, but experts determined an attack of that scale and ambition was beyond Hamas’s capabilities. The Times report reverberated internationally. But it wasn’t a scoop. Right after October 7, several Israeli media released several reports indicating that many intelligence analysts’ warnings were ignored. What was new in the Times piece was the document verifying the story. There was also a potentially explosive issue behind the Israeli deaths. Not about 'friendly fire,' which is not uncommon amid fierce battles, but about the consequences of the Hannibal Directive, which many Israelis have charged was now the rule. This directive demands Israelis to kill their fellow soldiers and family members so that their kidnapping and the consequent prisoner exchanges can be avoided, presumably in the interest of a 'greater good.' The Hamas-led offensive was compounded by what some Israeli soldiers subsequently called a 'mass Hannibal.' Just days after October 7, testimonies from members of the mainly female lookout units bolstered accusations that Netanyahu’s leadership fatally misread the dangers from Gaza. In an Israeli TV segment, two soldiers, Yael Rotenberg and Maya Desiatnik, recounted their experiences in the months before the attack. Rotenberg frequently saw many Palestinians dressed in civilian clothing near the border fence with maps, scrutinizing the ground around it and digging holes. Once, when she passed the information on, she was told they were just farmers, and there was nothing to worry about. 'It’s infuriating,' said Desiatnik who served in Nahal Oz, where 20 other women border surveillance soldiers were murdered by Hamas. 'We saw what was happening, we told them about it, and we were the ones who were murdered.' Underpinning all these ignored warnings was the IDF’s assumption that Hamas lacked the capability to attack and would not dare to do so. The flawed supposition was fostered by two factors. First, gender bias. The longer the militarization has prevailed in Israel, the more the country’s gender gap –the difference between women and men as reflected in social, political, and economic attainments – has deepened. Today, Israel’s gender gap ranks at the level of El Salvador and Uganda. What, after all, did the 'girls' of the lookout units know? Moreover, the idea that Hamas lacked capability to attack was predicated on the belief the Palestinians were 'human animals,' as Netanyahu and the cabinet ministers called Hamas operatives. Subhumans cannot think out-of-the-box. In reality, based on over 1 year of evidence, Hamas militants had trained for the blitzattacks in at least six sites across Gaza in plain sight and less than 1.5 km from Israel’s heavily fortified and monitored border, as even the mainstream CNN concluded barely a week after October 7. Worse, many testimonies by Israeli witnesses to the Hamas attack indicate that the Israeli military killed its own citizens struggling to neutralize Palestinian gunmen, in accordance with the Hannibal Directive. As one witness said to Israel Radio: '[Israeli special forces] eliminated everyone, including the hostages.' Worse, in addition to the ignored intelligence, there were other issues that just didn’t add up, including the abandoned hostages, and the state of the long neglected Israeli communities surrounding Gaza. Abandoned hostages On October 7, 2023, as part of the overall Hamas-led offense, 251 people were abducted from Israel to the Gaza Strip, including children, women and elderly. Almost half of the hostages were foreign nationals or had multiple citizenships. The next day, Prime Minister Netanyahu appointed ex-military commander Gal Hirsch to coordinate the cross-governmental response to abducted civilians and soldiers. Internationally, the appointment was portrayed as the PM’s proactive move to ensure the timely release of the Israeli hostages. Little did they know. As brigadier general, Hirsch had commanded an IDF division during the 2006 Lebanon War, which saw the first test of the Dahiya doctrine, premised on the destruction of civilian infrastructure. Hirsch was seen as responsible for the blunder resulting in an abduction by Hezbollah militants and the battles of Bint Jbeil and Ayta ash-Sha’b, which the IDF failed to occupy, despite heavy casualties. Following a barrage of criticism, Hirsch was forced to resign. After years of career rehabilitation, he joined the dominant harsh-right party Likud at the behest of Netanyahu himself and became the favorite for the role of the national police chief in 2021 – until he and his business partners were indicted for tax evasion of $1.9 million in a case concerning arms sales to Georgia. Why did Netanyahu appoint as his hostage tsar a general who had already blundered one high-profile abduction affair, failed to protect his soldiers and had been indicted for corruption? Unsurprisingly, the families of the hostages concluded that, in the view of the Netanyahu government, the fate of the hostages was secondary to the pretext of October 7 for a massive ground assault. The realization led to bitter and divisive mass demonstrations against the government and for the release of the hostages that prevailed until recently. If the hostage families and many ordinary Israelis despised the government that seemed to ignore the fate of the abducted, they found it even harder to digest the idea that their government may have been responsible for the deliberate killing of their loved ones. Just days after October 7, early reports and interviews suggested that the IDF had detailed prior knowledge of the Hamas offensive three long weeks beforehand, based on information from military intelligence’s Unit 8200. Highlighting the extent to which the IDF’s Gaza Division was aware of a potential attack on Israel’s southern border communities, the document, which was ignored by senior officials, detailed a series of exercises conducted by Hamas’ elite Nukhba units in the weeks prior to its publication. One of the most shocking sections of the IDF report featured instructions relating to the taking of hostages, the number of which was estimated to be between 200–250, coming close to the actual 251 captives. Does this enumeration in the report reflect extraordinary foresight? Or does it – since its findings were blatantly ignored prior to October 7 – illustrate a deliberate intention to allow a certain extent of devastation, in order to permit a transformational event that would legitimize a broad-scale invasion and, ultimately, a war of obliteration? Such considerations, of course, have been quickly torpedoed as 'conspiracy theories.' However, as long as credible investigations are deferred or suppressed in advance, legitimate concerns prevail on the causes of devastation on October 7. And then, there was the odd issue of the Israeli communities surrounding the Gaza Strip, which had been regarded as 'strategic' since the creation of Israel in 1948. Why had they been ignored as if they were 'non-strategic' for several years? Neglected Israeli communities When Israel was established, its founding fathers considered its border areas strategic. Adjacent to the Gaza Strip, these are the populated areas in Israel’s Southern District located within 7 km of the border and thus within the range of mortar shells and Qassam rockets. If these areas were strategic to national security, why were they so vulnerable on October 7? It is one thing that Israeli intelligence ignored over a year of warnings about the ability and willingness of Hamas to launch a major offensive. But it is another that the security of the surrounding Israeli border areas was effectively downplayed. Some of these settlements were created at the eve of the 1948 Arab Israeli War, including Sa’ad and Nirim, the two kibbutzim. The bigger ones were established soon after the 1949 Armistice Agreement, including Sderot, a development town for Mizrahi immigrants – that is, the Jews from the Middle East – and the military Nahal Oz, designed to become a civilian settlement and serve as a first line of defense against possible Arab incursions. In the early days of the Israeli state, many new arrivals from the Arab countries found themselves treated as 'more primitive' second-class citizens by the predominantly European-born Ashkenazi-Jewish elite. These subtle and not-so-subtle ethnic differences, compounded by visible 'white' and 'non-white' distinctions, continue to haunt the Israeli civil society. Yet, the Mizrahi Jews near Gaza faced additional challenges, and there were many Ashkenazis in these communities as well. Many of these localities were neglected, while some, particularly the immigrant development towns, felt shunned by their government. When Israel occupied the Gaza Strip in 1967, border threats diminished until the First Intifada in the late 1980s and the rise of Hamas. Following Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005, cross-border shelling and rocket attacks into Israel increased accordingly. To protect these areas, which now became known as the Gaza Envelope, the Israeli parliament Knesset enacted a law to assist the 'confrontation-line communities.' But when these measures expired in 2014 – a decade before October 7 – the district command of the IDF cut the associated budgets. This enraged many of the communities. After all, the 2014 Gaza War had caused a substantial adverse impact on the proximate settlements, due to rocket and mortar attacks, tunnels, intrusions, even incendiary kites. The war was followed by another wave of violence in 2018. And on October 7, many communities in the Gaza Envelope were infiltrated, with hundreds of Israelis butchered and kidnapped. Instead of protecting its citizens, Israel had retreated from its traditional security obligations to the adjacent Israeli communities. As evidenced by the national budget for the Gaza Envelope localities in 2014–2024, these communities were, as critics said, 'slated for abandonment following the November 2022 elections.' In effect, the per capita budgets approved for the years 2023-2024 were almost a third lower than that of 2022. So, well before October 7, the strategic needs of the Gaza Envelope of adjacent Israeli communities were effectively neglected by the government. However, the huge military border barrier prevailed. Between 2017 and 2021, to counter the many tunnels Palestinians dug for infiltration, Israel also constructed an underground border wall, equipped with sensors several meters in depth along the entire border. In Israel, the high-tech security barriers were portrayed as impenetrable. And yet, the IDF was tricked by Hamas’s messaging, over-relied on a remote-controlled surveillance systems and weapons that were swiftly disabled by drones and snipers, enabling its infiltration and onslaught. Furthermore, the builder of the barrier had warned already in 2018 that it absolutely required a military presence. It was not designed to prevent mass assault on its own. Unsurprisingly, the Hamas offensive caused a full breakdown in trust between the Israeli localities and their state, with residents reluctant to return to homes until security was fully ensured. As regional escalation spread to northern Israel, it shared the Gaza Envelope’s challenges, facing the rockets of the Hezbollah. By summer 2024, local leaders were warning the Netanyahu cabinet they planned to leave if the situation wouldn’t improve. 'Where is the government?' asked the chief of the regional council, Moshe Davidovitch. 'Even a banana republic does not work like this,' he added. 'The government is destroying the North.' Convenient narratives and inconvenient truths By May 2024, new evidence indicated that Israel’s intelligence failure was the net effect of a 'chain of failures' that pervaded the entire security sector, both in the Shin Bet and the IDF. The common denominator was the fallacy that Hamas was only able of firing long-range rockets against Israel. Whatever did not fit this theory was rejected. So, the warnings of the IDF female spotters were systematically ignored. What they saw as an impending mass attack intelligence officers dismissed as 'routine Hamas training.' Second, after the Gaza war in 2021, it was decided to cease intelligence-gathering on Hamas’ tactical array and the intermediate ranks of its military arm, to focus only on few individuals. Opposing views to this intelligence concept were marginalized. These failures were coupled with a sense of disdain in the intelligence culture, which viewed the border fence, together with the underground border barrier between Israel and Gaza, as denying Hamas the possibility of invading Israel. The 'Iron Wall' was considered impenetrable; for all the wrong reasons. In effect, Hamas operatives breached the border barrier at 44 different points. Consequently, the so-called intelligence failure on October 7 can be attributed primarily to the rejection of external warnings, denial of internal evidence, suppression of tactical intelligence, autocratic culture, and inflated perception of the effectiveness of the separation barriers. The ongoing investigation of the military is likely to stress similar factors. But was that the full story or a part of the story? In effect, what was the story? In the early conventional narrative, 'intelligence failure' was framed as the prime narrative. But the thesis is hard to argue when tactical intelligence was delivered exceptionally well, despite reduced resources, and it outlined the threats in detail well before the attack, including the almost exact number anticipated to be abducted. There are too many anomalies and happy coincidences in the current narratives. So, if 'intelligence failure' is not the story, what is? This leaves open the question, was the 'neglect of intelligence evidence' just unprofessional conduct? In the United States, September 11, 2001, provided the kind of catastrophic and catalyzing event – like 'a new Pearl Harbor' – that the leading neoconservatives, gathered around the Project for the New American Century in 2000, envisioned as critical to achieve massive rearmament in America. Subsequently, it served as a flawed pretext for the war against Iraq and global war on terror. Netanyahu was well aware of this neoconservative Project; he funded some of its pioneers. The rise of neoconservatism in the U.S. went hand in hand with the emergence of Netanyahu’s Likud in Israel. It resulted in a neoconservative policy document, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, described as 'a kind of U.S.-Israeli neoconservative manifesto.' In Israel, the Hamas offensive was immediately followed by a coordinated nationwide outcry that 'October 7 is our September 11' by PM Netanyahu, who had built his rise to power in the 1990s in cooperation with the very same U.S. neoconservatives, as well as the rise of Hamas at the expense of the Palestinian Authority, which his policies had tacitly supported for years. With October 7, he used the Hamas offensive to legitimize the subsequent ground assault and genocidal atrocities, which many in his war cabinet hoped would result in ethnic expulsions that would open Gaza for Jewish resettlement. Meanwhile, his Messianic far-right cabinet partners used the fog of war to disguise their ongoing (and largely successful) effort at the effective annexation of the West Bank to Israel proper. The point is not to argue that one or another of these narratives is conclusive. Too much evidence is still missing. The point is that the current 'facts' feature many anomalies that conventional wisdom shuns, but alternate narratives can explain. Conventional wisdom may be convenient, but it is seldom either persuasive or final. The original commentary was published by Antiwar.com on March 10, 2025. This commentary draws from Dr Dan Steinbock’s new book, The Fall of Israel. a comprehensive historical and contemporary analysis of the how the path to the obliteration of Gaza was paved by the confluence of a set of longstanding forces. It focuses on the transformation of Israel, ethnic cleansing and genocidal atrocities, the Gaza War and regional escalation. It has been endorsed by two former European foreign ministers, the leading US political scientist, Israeli, Palestinian and Iranian scholars of the Middle East, and Secretary of State Colin Powell's chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson. 'When you finish the book,' Wilkerson says, 'I hope you will understand that our current national path leads us straight to hell.

A day or two before October 7, I wrote an essay on the coming explosion in Gaza. It was not prophetic insight. October 7, 2023, was the 50-year anniversary of the Yom Kippur War and I fully expected a high-profile reaction. After the brutal Hamas-led assault, Israeli authorities vehemently condemned what they called 'our September 11' and a 'surprise attack.' But the hard questions were conveniently ignored – and still are. A week ago, the Israeli Defense Forces’ landmark investigations into the October 7 attack disclosed severe, deep-rooted intelligence miscalculations and fundamental misconceptions on the nature of Hamas and its intentions by both the Israeli government and military. Probing the same attack, Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, recently pointed fingers at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Typically, the prime mistakes featured the political conception of Hamas as an Israeli asset, the intelligence misjudgment that it couldn't launch a large-scale attack, and weak defensive deployment. The intriguing part of the story is that these facts were pretty well known already in the first days after October 7, 2023 – that is, more than a year ago – as I argue in The Fall of Israel. And there is more to the story. Why was the abundant intelligence on the impending Hamas attack deliberately ignored? Why were the Israeli hostages effectively abandoned? Why were the strategic border communities neglected? With all its might, backed up with U.S. military aid and financing, how did Israel fail to see the writing on the wall? Ignored intelligence After October 7, a high-level Egyptian intelligence official said Israel had ignored repeated warnings that 'an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big.' Netanyahu denied receiving any such advance warning. Yet, the Egyptian confirmed that the Israeli PM had received direct notice from Cairo’s intelligence minister. Similarly, Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters of the alleged warning. The inconvenient fact was that Israeli intelligence authorities had been aware of the threat for months yet ignored it. In November 2023, the New York Times reported that 'Israel knew Hamas’s attack plan more than a year ago.' Code-named Jericho Wall, the 40-page blueprint outlined a lethal invasion. The document had been circulated widely among Israeli military and intelligence leaders, but experts determined an attack of that scale and ambition was beyond Hamas’s capabilities. The Times report reverberated internationally. But it wasn’t a scoop. Right after October 7, several Israeli media released several reports indicating that many intelligence analysts’ warnings were ignored. What was new in the Times piece was the document verifying the story. There was also a potentially explosive issue behind the Israeli deaths. Not about 'friendly fire,' which is not uncommon amid fierce battles, but about the consequences of the Hannibal Directive, which many Israelis have charged was now the rule. This directive demands Israelis to kill their fellow soldiers and family members so that their kidnapping and the consequent prisoner exchanges can be avoided, presumably in the interest of a 'greater good.' The Hamas-led offensive was compounded by what some Israeli soldiers subsequently called a 'mass Hannibal.' Just days after October 7, testimonies from members of the mainly female lookout units bolstered accusations that Netanyahu’s leadership fatally misread the dangers from Gaza. In an Israeli TV segment, two soldiers, Yael Rotenberg and Maya Desiatnik, recounted their experiences in the months before the attack. Rotenberg frequently saw many Palestinians dressed in civilian clothing near the border fence with maps, scrutinizing the ground around it and digging holes. Once, when she passed the information on, she was told they were just farmers, and there was nothing to worry about. 'It’s infuriating,' said Desiatnik who served in Nahal Oz, where 20 other women border surveillance soldiers were murdered by Hamas. 'We saw what was happening, we told them about it, and we were the ones who were murdered.' Underpinning all these ignored warnings was the IDF’s assumption that Hamas lacked the capability to attack and would not dare to do so. The flawed supposition was fostered by two factors. First, gender bias. The longer the militarization has prevailed in Israel, the more the country’s gender gap –the difference between women and men as reflected in social, political, and economic attainments – has deepened. Today, Israel’s gender gap ranks at the level of El Salvador and Uganda. What, after all, did the 'girls' of the lookout units know? Moreover, the idea that Hamas lacked capability to attack was predicated on the belief the Palestinians were 'human animals,' as Netanyahu and the cabinet ministers called Hamas operatives. Subhumans cannot think out-of-the-box. In reality, based on over 1 year of evidence, Hamas militants had trained for the blitzattacks in at least six sites across Gaza in plain sight and less than 1.5 km from Israel’s heavily fortified and monitored border, as even the mainstream CNN concluded barely a week after October 7. Worse, many testimonies by Israeli witnesses to the Hamas attack indicate that the Israeli military killed its own citizens struggling to neutralize Palestinian gunmen, in accordance with the Hannibal Directive. As one witness said to Israel Radio: '[Israeli special forces] eliminated everyone, including the hostages.' Worse, in addition to the ignored intelligence, there were other issues that just didn’t add up, including the abandoned hostages, and the state of the long neglected Israeli communities surrounding Gaza. Abandoned hostages On October 7, 2023, as part of the overall Hamas-led offense, 251 people were abducted from Israel to the Gaza Strip, including children, women and elderly. Almost half of the hostages were foreign nationals or had multiple citizenships. The next day, Prime Minister Netanyahu appointed ex-military commander Gal Hirsch to coordinate the cross-governmental response to abducted civilians and soldiers. Internationally, the appointment was portrayed as the PM’s proactive move to ensure the timely release of the Israeli hostages. Little did they know. As brigadier general, Hirsch had commanded an IDF division during the 2006 Lebanon War, which saw the first test of the Dahiya doctrine, premised on the destruction of civilian infrastructure. Hirsch was seen as responsible for the blunder resulting in an abduction by Hezbollah militants and the battles of Bint Jbeil and Ayta ash-Sha’b, which the IDF failed to occupy, despite heavy casualties. Following a barrage of criticism, Hirsch was forced to resign. After years of career rehabilitation, he joined the dominant harsh-right party Likud at the behest of Netanyahu himself and became the favorite for the role of the national police chief in 2021 – until he and his business partners were indicted for tax evasion of $1.9 million in a case concerning arms sales to Georgia. Why did Netanyahu appoint as his hostage tsar a general who had already blundered one high-profile abduction affair, failed to protect his soldiers and had been indicted for corruption? Unsurprisingly, the families of the hostages concluded that, in the view of the Netanyahu government, the fate of the hostages was secondary to the pretext of October 7 for a massive ground assault. The realization led to bitter and divisive mass demonstrations against the government and for the release of the hostages that prevailed until recently. If the hostage families and many ordinary Israelis despised the government that seemed to ignore the fate of the abducted, they found it even harder to digest the idea that their government may have been responsible for the deliberate killing of their loved ones. Just days after October 7, early reports and interviews suggested that the IDF had detailed prior knowledge of the Hamas offensive three long weeks beforehand, based on information from military intelligence’s Unit 8200. Highlighting the extent to which the IDF’s Gaza Division was aware of a potential attack on Israel’s southern border communities, the document, which was ignored by senior officials, detailed a series of exercises conducted by Hamas’ elite Nukhba units in the weeks prior to its publication. One of the most shocking sections of the IDF report featured instructions relating to the taking of hostages, the number of which was estimated to be between 200–250, coming close to the actual 251 captives. Does this enumeration in the report reflect extraordinary foresight? Or does it – since its findings were blatantly ignored prior to October 7 – illustrate a deliberate intention to allow a certain extent of devastation, in order to permit a transformational event that would legitimize a broad-scale invasion and, ultimately, a war of obliteration? Such considerations, of course, have been quickly torpedoed as 'conspiracy theories.' However, as long as credible investigations are deferred or suppressed in advance, legitimate concerns prevail on the causes of devastation on October 7. And then, there was the odd issue of the Israeli communities surrounding the Gaza Strip, which had been regarded as 'strategic' since the creation of Israel in 1948. Why had they been ignored as if they were 'non-strategic' for several years? Neglected Israeli communities When Israel was established, its founding fathers considered its border areas strategic. Adjacent to the Gaza Strip, these are the populated areas in Israel’s Southern District located within 7 km of the border and thus within the range of mortar shells and Qassam rockets. If these areas were strategic to national security, why were they so vulnerable on October 7? It is one thing that Israeli intelligence ignored over a year of warnings about the ability and willingness of Hamas to launch a major offensive. But it is another that the security of the surrounding Israeli border areas was effectively downplayed. Some of these settlements were created at the eve of the 1948 Arab Israeli War, including Sa’ad and Nirim, the two kibbutzim. The bigger ones were established soon after the 1949 Armistice Agreement, including Sderot, a development town for Mizrahi immigrants – that is, the Jews from the Middle East – and the military Nahal Oz, designed to become a civilian settlement and serve as a first line of defense against possible Arab incursions. In the early days of the Israeli state, many new arrivals from the Arab countries found themselves treated as 'more primitive' second-class citizens by the predominantly European-born Ashkenazi-Jewish elite. These subtle and not-so-subtle ethnic differences, compounded by visible 'white' and 'non-white' distinctions, continue to haunt the Israeli civil society. Yet, the Mizrahi Jews near Gaza faced additional challenges, and there were many Ashkenazis in these communities as well. Many of these localities were neglected, while some, particularly the immigrant development towns, felt shunned by their government. When Israel occupied the Gaza Strip in 1967, border threats diminished until the First Intifada in the late 1980s and the rise of Hamas. Following Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005, cross-border shelling and rocket attacks into Israel increased accordingly. To protect these areas, which now became known as the Gaza Envelope, the Israeli parliament Knesset enacted a law to assist the 'confrontation-line communities.' But when these measures expired in 2014 – a decade before October 7 – the district command of the IDF cut the associated budgets. This enraged many of the communities. After all, the 2014 Gaza War had caused a substantial adverse impact on the proximate settlements, due to rocket and mortar attacks, tunnels, intrusions, even incendiary kites. The war was followed by another wave of violence in 2018. And on October 7, many communities in the Gaza Envelope were infiltrated, with hundreds of Israelis butchered and kidnapped. Instead of protecting its citizens, Israel had retreated from its traditional security obligations to the adjacent Israeli communities. As evidenced by the national budget for the Gaza Envelope localities in 2014–2024, these communities were, as critics said, 'slated for abandonment following the November 2022 elections.' In effect, the per capita budgets approved for the years 2023-2024 were almost a third lower than that of 2022. So, well before October 7, the strategic needs of the Gaza Envelope of adjacent Israeli communities were effectively neglected by the government. However, the huge military border barrier prevailed. Between 2017 and 2021, to counter the many tunnels Palestinians dug for infiltration, Israel also constructed an underground border wall, equipped with sensors several meters in depth along the entire border. In Israel, the high-tech security barriers were portrayed as impenetrable. And yet, the IDF was tricked by Hamas’s messaging, over-relied on a remote-controlled surveillance systems and weapons that were swiftly disabled by drones and snipers, enabling its infiltration and onslaught. Furthermore, the builder of the barrier had warned already in 2018 that it absolutely required a military presence. It was not designed to prevent mass assault on its own. Unsurprisingly, the Hamas offensive caused a full breakdown in trust between the Israeli localities and their state, with residents reluctant to return to homes until security was fully ensured. As regional escalation spread to northern Israel, it shared the Gaza Envelope’s challenges, facing the rockets of the Hezbollah. By summer 2024, local leaders were warning the Netanyahu cabinet they planned to leave if the situation wouldn’t improve. 'Where is the government?' asked the chief of the regional council, Moshe Davidovitch. 'Even a banana republic does not work like this,' he added. 'The government is destroying the North.' Convenient narratives and inconvenient truths By May 2024, new evidence indicated that Israel’s intelligence failure was the net effect of a 'chain of failures' that pervaded the entire security sector, both in the Shin Bet and the IDF. The common denominator was the fallacy that Hamas was only able of firing long-range rockets against Israel. Whatever did not fit this theory was rejected. So, the warnings of the IDF female spotters were systematically ignored. What they saw as an impending mass attack intelligence officers dismissed as 'routine Hamas training.' Second, after the Gaza war in 2021, it was decided to cease intelligence-gathering on Hamas’ tactical array and the intermediate ranks of its military arm, to focus only on few individuals. Opposing views to this intelligence concept were marginalized. These failures were coupled with a sense of disdain in the intelligence culture, which viewed the border fence, together with the underground border barrier between Israel and Gaza, as denying Hamas the possibility of invading Israel. The 'Iron Wall' was considered impenetrable; for all the wrong reasons. In effect, Hamas operatives breached the border barrier at 44 different points. Consequently, the so-called intelligence failure on October 7 can be attributed primarily to the rejection of external warnings, denial of internal evidence, suppression of tactical intelligence, autocratic culture, and inflated perception of the effectiveness of the separation barriers. The ongoing investigation of the military is likely to stress similar factors. But was that the full story or a part of the story? In effect, what was the story? In the early conventional narrative, 'intelligence failure' was framed as the prime narrative. But the thesis is hard to argue when tactical intelligence was delivered exceptionally well, despite reduced resources, and it outlined the threats in detail well before the attack, including the almost exact number anticipated to be abducted. There are too many anomalies and happy coincidences in the current narratives. So, if 'intelligence failure' is not the story, what is? This leaves open the question, was the 'neglect of intelligence evidence' just unprofessional conduct? In the United States, September 11, 2001, provided the kind of catastrophic and catalyzing event – like 'a new Pearl Harbor' – that the leading neoconservatives, gathered around the Project for the New American Century in 2000, envisioned as critical to achieve massive rearmament in America. Subsequently, it served as a flawed pretext for the war against Iraq and global war on terror. Netanyahu was well aware of this neoconservative Project; he funded some of its pioneers. The rise of neoconservatism in the U.S. went hand in hand with the emergence of Netanyahu’s Likud in Israel. It resulted in a neoconservative policy document, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, described as 'a kind of U.S.-Israeli neoconservative manifesto.' In Israel, the Hamas offensive was immediately followed by a coordinated nationwide outcry that 'October 7 is our September 11' by PM Netanyahu, who had built his rise to power in the 1990s in cooperation with the very same U.S. neoconservatives, as well as the rise of Hamas at the expense of the Palestinian Authority, which his policies had tacitly supported for years. With October 7, he used the Hamas offensive to legitimize the subsequent ground assault and genocidal atrocities, which many in his war cabinet hoped would result in ethnic expulsions that would open Gaza for Jewish resettlement. Meanwhile, his Messianic far-right cabinet partners used the fog of war to disguise their ongoing (and largely successful) effort at the effective annexation of the West Bank to Israel proper. The point is not to argue that one or another of these narratives is conclusive. Too much evidence is still missing. The point is that the current 'facts' feature many anomalies that conventional wisdom shuns, but alternate narratives can explain. Conventional wisdom may be convenient, but it is seldom either persuasive or final. The original commentary was published by Antiwar.com on March 10, 2025. This commentary draws from Dr Dan Steinbock’s new book, The Fall of Israel. a comprehensive historical and contemporary analysis of the how the path to the obliteration of Gaza was paved by the confluence of a set of longstanding forces. It focuses on the transformation of Israel, ethnic cleansing and genocidal atrocities, the Gaza War and regional escalation. It has been endorsed by two former European foreign ministers, the leading US political scientist, Israeli, Palestinian and Iranian scholars of the Middle East, and Secretary of State Colin Powell's chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson. 'When you finish the book,' Wilkerson says, 'I hope you will understand that our current national path leads us straight to hell.

The Deepening Deterioration Of The Situation In Afghanistan – Ana...	By Zhou Chao Since the United States' hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban quickly overthrew the pro-Western government that had been supported by the U.S. and other Western nations, establishing their own regime. Subsequently, the international community maintained a long-standing stance of non-recognition and isolation towards the Taliban authorities, and the Chinese government also did not officially recognize the Taliban. However, the Chinese government and the Taliban authorities have had considerable practical contact, with China formally accepting the Taliban's appointed ambassador to China, and Chinese companies beginning to reinvest in the Afghan region. In 2023, China's Central Asia Petroleum and Natural Gas Company (CAPEIC) signed an investment agreement with the Afghan authorities totaling USD 540 million. In 2024, China and Afghanistan signed a cooperation agreement for a key supporting project of the Mes Aynak copper mining, the Baghdara hydropower project, with a total investment of USD 10 billion. In the summer of the same year, there was an official announcement on the commencement of the construction of a new road from the Kabul-Gardez intercity highway to the entrance of the Mes Aynak copper mine, marking a significant step forward in the China-invested mine project. Since the Taliban took control of the Afghan government, analyses have consistently pointed out that the internal situation in Afghanistan has not fully stabilized. Internal conflicts in Afghanistan still show signs of resurgence, and the Taliban remains isolated internationally, with economic difficulties also intensifying. However, some Chinese analyses suggest that this situation might actually present an opportunity for China to increase its investment in Afghanistan. Recently, Transparency International, in its 2024 report, stated that Afghanistan ranked 165th out of 180 countries in terms of public sector corruption. According to the report, Afghanistan scored 17 out of 100 on the Corruption Perceptions Index, 3 points lower than its score in 2023. The country had previously scored 20 points in 2023 and 24 points in 2022. Although the Taliban regime's scores have decreased in recent years, it still remains better than the situation under the previous government. In March 2024, the Taliban authority publicly stated that all forms of corruption within government departments had been eradicated and that Afghanistan would welcome foreign investment with efficiency, integrity, and a proactive attitude. Overall, the feasibility of investing in Afghanistan seems to have been strengthened. However, a series of developments in Afghanistan's internal situation since the second half of last year suggest that the possibility of the situation worsening significantly should not be underestimated. For the Taliban regime, its governance is based on Islamic law, with Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada controlling core policies through religious edicts. Military and political leaders are required to obey his decisions. Beneath the Supreme Leader, the Taliban regime is primarily divided into four factions: 1. Kandahar Faction (Akhundzada, etc.): Representing the traditional Pashtun forces, this faction emphasizes religious orthodoxy. 2. Haqqani Network: An independent military-economic group closely linked to cross-border armed organizations. 3. Doha Faction (led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, among others): Advocates for limited openness to gain international recognition, but its influence has significantly weakened in recent years. 4. Local Warlords: Some local commanders have gained more autonomy in areas such as taxation and security, creating centrifugal tendencies against the central Taliban government. Outside the Taliban regime, there are still opposition forces in Afghanistan. The more active ones include ISIS, former Afghan government officials, and opposition armed groups led by former Northern Alliance commanders. Since last year, in terms of Afghanistan's internal political and security situation, the Taliban authorities have primarily faced two major challenges. Firstly, there is a growing trend of internal power struggles within the regime. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid recently stated on social media that there are indeed differences of opinion within the Taliban, but he insisted that these differences would not escalate into violent conflict or open clashes. However, observers have pointed out that serious divisions have already emerged within the Taliban leadership and are continuing to intensify. Several months ago, the Taliban's Interior Minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani, disappeared after traveling to the UAE, while the Deputy Foreign Minister, Abbas Stanikzai, fled to the UAE after issuing harsh criticisms of the Taliban's senior leadership. Related analyses suggest that Afghanistan's supreme spiritual leader Akhundzada, is continuously consolidating power, strengthening the Kandahar faction's control over Afghanistan's highest authority. Meanwhile, the senior leadership of the Haqqani Network is being increasingly marginalized, leading to intense struggles between the two factions. The internal conflict within the Taliban seems to be intensifying, which could directly exacerbate instability in Afghanistan. A recent commentary in Pakistan's Dawn newspaper even pointed out that there is a risk of the Taliban's highest leader being overthrown. Secondly, the strength and destructive power of opposition forces have increased. The Taliban has made slow progress in establishing an inclusive government and has shown excessive bias toward the Pashtun, which has caused strong dissatisfaction among other ethnic groups in the country. Opposition armed groups have seized this opportunity to gain widespread support from Tajik, Hazara, and other ethnic communities, frequently operating in the northern and central regions of Afghanistan. Among them, the organizations led by Ahmad Massoud, leader of the National Resistance Front (NRF), and Yasin Zia, leader of the Afghanistan Freedom Front (AFF), have been the most active. Previously, the AFF has even launched attacks in Kabul, causing casualties among several Taliban members, demonstrating its strong combat capabilities and a determined spirit of resistance. Meanwhile, the NRF has been steadily expanding its forces in its operational areas, strengthening military training, and enhancing its stance against the Taliban. The resurgence of opposition forces, coupled with the intensification of internal struggles within the Taliban, is likely to accelerate the deterioration of Afghanistan's internal situation. Moreover, negative factors outside the political and security situation are also quite evident. According to a report from the World Bank, Afghanistan's GDP has declined by 26% over the past two years, with the economy continuing to suffer from a recession, high unemployment, and a large portion of the population losing their sources of income, resulting in a dire living situation. In such an economic environment, sectors like infrastructure development, education, and healthcare in Afghanistan have struggled to develop effectively, leading to a worsening quality of life for the people. In terms of international recognition, despite the Taliban authorities actively engaging in diplomatic activities, expanding foreign relations, and increasing interactions with Russia, Turkey, China, and some Gulf countries, they recently held high-level meetings with India and even sent delegations to Japan, the international community's recognition of the Taliban government remains minimal. The Taliban authorities are finding it difficult to secure the necessary aid to improve the internal situation, and a significant portion of the population, in search of a livelihood, either flee abroad or align with armed groups, ultimately creating a vicious cycle. Furthermore, the worsening relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan is also worth noting. Data released by the United Nations shows that the operational capabilities of Pakistan's largest terrorist group, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have significantly increased, severely worsening Pakistan's security situation. The report indicates that between July and December 2024, the TTP launched over 600 terrorist attacks against Pakistan, including attacks originating from Afghan territory. Despite the Taliban's assurances that Afghan territory will not be used for terrorism against any country, the Afghan Taliban continues to provide logistical support, operational space, and financial backing to the TTP, including funding for TTP leadership and establishing new training centers in Afghanistan's Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost, and Paktika provinces. Afghanistan's support for the TTP severely impacts Pakistan's security, further escalating tensions between the two countries. Recently, Pakistani authorities have made it clear that they do not rule out the possibility of fully deporting the millions of Afghan refugees still residing in Pakistan. Should Pakistan take formal action, the influx of millions of refugees would further strain Afghanistan's social resources and exacerbate the country's already volatile situation. Another important point to consider is that, with the deepening deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan, it is certain to create a regional spillover effect. Refugees and armed militants are likely to spread to neighboring countries, which would, in turn, have a negative impact on the entire Central Asian region. Final analysis conclusion: Since the Taliban's return to power, the international community generally acknowledges that violence within Afghanistan has decreased. However, existing analyses also point out that the Taliban regime has failed to effectively integrate internal forces, and its relationship with its most important neighbor, Pakistan, continues to deteriorate. Now, with the intensifying infighting within the Taliban leadership, the possibility of a deepening internal crisis in Afghanistan cannot be overlooked. If this trend continues to escalate, the regional spillover effects could be quite significant.

The Nantha Kumar Case Is Destroying The Integrity Of The Malaysia...	Its time to abolish this institutionally corrupt organization When Anwar Ibrahim became prime minister in November 2022, he promised that fighting corruption would be his first priority. The Chief Commissioner of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Azam Baki himself said, that approximately 30 percent of government spending is lost through leakage connected with corruption. Although Malaysians at first had high hopes, the further rapid decay and politicization of the MACC since Anwar came to power has created much disappointment. The Nantha Kumar case, now playing out is highlighting the lack of integrity of the MACC, which has openly appeared to have been working in cahoots with the allegedly corrupt parties to entrap an investigative journalist, who has been uncovering their illegal operations. Nantha Kumar is an investigative journalist working for the well-known independent news portal Malaysiakini. Nantha had been uncovering a 'fly' syndicate operating at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and had published a series of articles about a 'Pakistani agent' and immigration officials who have been allegedly falsifying entry and exit stamps of foreign workers, without their physical presence. Nantha cooperated with the state immigration director, and a senior official of the home ministry. Nantha also gave the names of corrupt officials allegedly involved in a medical visa scam to the home ministry Saifuddin Nasution Ismail personally. Nantha was well known within Malaysian government, civil service and media circles as an honest journalist with integrity. As part of his investigation, Nantha met with two Pakistani agents at a restaurant, which was registered under the name of a former high ranking immigration officer, where one of the agents claimed that someone had asked for RM400,000 to settle the case with the police, MACC, immigration department and Malaysiakini. They made an offer to Nantha to pay him RM 50,000 (20,000 on the spot) to stop writing about the subject. Nantha upon reporting the attempted bribe to the immigration officer said, there was no financial transaction evidence to make anything stick. This senior immigration officer asked Nantha to meet with the agents once again to gather evidence as an ‘undercover’ agent. A meeting was arranged at the Concorde Hotel in Shah Alam. Nantha informed the state immigration director, he would meet with the agents and later hand over any evidence to them. At the meeting, one of the 'Pakistani' agents handed Nantha an envelope. However, within seconds, a dozen MACC agents descended upon him. Nantha was then remanded for four days, locked up alone in a cell for 15 hours each day. He slept on a hard floor with no blanket or pillows. Treated sub-humanly as a means of humiliation. Detention aftermath The major question is why was only Nantha arrested and no the 'Pakistani' agents who remain free? This is after Nantha went out of his way to cooperate with authorities. Why had the MACC collaborated with those upon who corrupt activities were alleged? Nantha has been released for a number of days, and unlike other cases, Nantha was never taken to a court and formally charged. It appears the MACC has colluded with criminals, attacked the whistleblower, imprisoned him as a means of torture and humiliation, rather than investigate one of the numerous immigration frauds going on. This action also implicates the immigration department and home ministry. Its yet to be determined as to whether Nantha will actually be charged and given a fair opportunity for a trial. This would provide the correct platform for Nantha to tell the court the names of government officials he had dealt with. Any charges and corresponding trial would provide an opportunity for the public to see how corrupt government law enforcement agencies are, in this case both the immigration department and MACC. The attack on a hard working journalist, leaving the real perpetrators of corruption still running about and operating today, is a travesty of justice and major breach of human rights that one would only expect to see in a lawless land. Its time to abolish the MACC The MACC has long been controversial. Back in 2009, Teoh Beng Hock fell to his death from the MACC building in Shah Alam, where the truth until today has not been allowed to come out. The Teoh case shows that whistleblowers are not even safe within MACC buildings. There is no provision for an ombudsman to look at cases such as Nantha’s. Should there had been an ombudsman overseeing such arrests, whistleblowers might be better protected. What is sure, no matter, what is the outcome of the Mantha Kumar case, the integrity of the MACC has been given another blow. It is clear the MACC is not doing the job it is meant to be doing, allowing senior government officials to break the law freely. What is even more dangerous, is that these same people are only too willing to abuse their power to cover up. Structurally, the MACC is not an independent body. The MACC must have permission from the attorney general, who is also the public prosecutor to prosecute any suspects. This leaves the possibility of political interference wide open in who to investigate and prosecute. This allows the MACC to humiliate people without actually charging them with any crime. The MACC reports to the executive, so its operations are opaque. The MACC advisory board is full of members who are closely connected with the political elite, and thus harbour potential conflicts of interest. The MACC should be considered a failed organization, full of political agendas. The MACC appears to be spending a lot of time in pursuing foes of the current administration, settling old scores, where impartiality is in question. Its time to abolish the MACC, so as to clean out the embedded corruption within it. The MACC could be replaced with a fully independent anti-corruption body with the power to investigate and prosecute alleged offenders free of the interference of the attorney general and executive. An ombudsman is required to protect the interests of those taken into custody, to ensure the MACC is not over-stepping its powers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJC0zIz6vxNFk	2025-03-08T18:52:43-08:00	
China’s Ambitious Economic Roadmap For 2025: Innovation, Consumpt...	China has laid out an ambitious economic roadmap for 2025, signaling its intent to solidify its position as a global powerhouse through strategic fiscal expansion, technological innovation, and policies aimed at boosting domestic consumption. Premier Li Qiang’s government work report, delivered at the opening of the third session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) on March 5, underscores Beijing’s determination to sustain a growth target of around 5%, despite global economic uncertainties. Former United Nations Under-Secretary-General Erik Solheim emphasized China’s role as a stabilizing force in the world economy. 'With an expected economic growth of around 5% for 2025, China will continue to be the biggest source of global economic growth,' he noted in an interview with China Economic Net. This projection underscores Beijing’s confidence in its long-term strategy, even as the global economic order remains in flux. At the heart of this strategy is China’s effort to transition from an export-driven economy to one fueled by domestic consumption and cutting-edge technological advancements. The government work report outlines a proactive fiscal policy, expanding the fiscal deficit target from 3% to 4%, thereby creating additional leverage for investment in key sectors. This shift is designed to enhance economic resilience while ensuring stability amid external pressures. Bernardo Mendia, Board Advisor at the EU Young Entrepreneurs Association, described China’s evolving economic model as a shift from labor-intensive growth to capital- and technology-driven expansion. 'The planned measures to stimulate domestic consumption and the incentives for skill development provide strong endogenous power for long-term growth,' he explained. This transition is further reinforced by China’s move to inject 1.3 trillion yuan in ultra-long special treasury bonds—an increase of 300 billion yuan from last year—while issuing 4.4 trillion yuan in local government special-purpose bonds. China’s commitment to fostering a more open market for investment is another key pillar of its 2025 plan. The government has announced regulatory reforms aimed at expanding access to sectors such as telecoms, medical services, education, and the cultural industries. This move is expected to attract foreign investors by offering greater opportunities for reinvestment and deeper integration into China’s industrial supply chains. David Perez-Des Rosiers, Director of the Canada China Business Council Beijing Chapter, highlighted China’s commitment to an open business environment. 'China’s efforts to expand service sector openness and attract foreign investment offer a positive perspective for Canadian businesses, particularly in services and education, which form a large part of Canada-China bilateral trade,' he noted. A recent business survey revealed that 70% of Canadian companies still consider China a top-five priority for investment, signaling continued confidence in the Chinese market. China’s ambitious 2025 strategy also underscores its focus on innovation, with significant investments in cutting-edge sectors such as biomanufacturing, quantum technology, embodied AI, and 6G. The newly launched 'AI Plus' initiative aims to integrate artificial intelligence into manufacturing, further cementing China’s position as a global leader in technological development. Patrick Nijs, co-founder of the EU-China Joint Innovation Center, stressed the importance of collaboration in technological advancements. 'For a successful ecological transition, we need a structured platform for cooperation between Europe and China to address climate change and enhance industrial innovation,' he stated. His remarks reflect growing European recognition of China’s technological leadership and the necessity of avoiding a technological decoupling between global powers. China’s economic roadmap is also deeply intertwined with its commitment to sustainability. Solheim pointed to 'stability' and 'innovation' as the two defining themes of this year’s Two Sessions, emphasizing China’s leadership in both economic and environmental sustainability. 'Europe will realize that we need Chinese technology,' he remarked, underscoring the growing interdependence between global economies. The government’s plans also include a strong focus on employment and social welfare. In 2025, China aims to create over 12 million new urban jobs while keeping the surveyed urban unemployment rate around 5.5%. With every percentage point of GDP growth generating approximately 2.4 million jobs, this target appears well within reach. Additionally, efforts to promote free preschool education and introduce policies to boost birth rates further demonstrate China’s commitment to long-term demographic stability. In the international sphere, China is reinforcing its high-standard opening-up strategy by stabilizing foreign trade, encouraging foreign investment, and advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. Hong Kong's deputy to the NPC, Ronick Chan Chun-ying, expressed confidence in Beijing’s ability to sustain its growth trajectory. 'China has consistently sustained medium-to-high-speed economic growth, and its ability to maintain a 5% growth rate demonstrates the country’s confidence, which in turn strengthens global investor confidence,' he stated. China’s economic plan for 2025 represents a strategic pivot towards innovation-driven growth, increased domestic consumption, and financial stability. At a time of increasing global uncertainty, Beijing is sending a clear message: its long-term ambitions remain firmly intact, and it intends to achieve them through a calculated blend of fiscal expansion, technological leadership, and global cooperation. As the world watches China’s next moves, one thing remains clear—its trajectory will continue to shape the global economic landscape for years to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJD8NOjERTJH6	2025-03-08T18:51:04-08:00	
Worrying Echoes Of The Past In The Balkans – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, trade wars between America’s friends and foes — there has been no shortage of crises around the world. At times, it feels like several months’ worth of geopolitical events have taken place in just the past week alone. But another potential conflict that is not getting much attention can be found in southeastern Europe in the Balkan country of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina emerged from the aftermath of the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, followed by a very bloody inter-religious and inter-ethnic sectarian war. The Bosnian Muslim community was targeted mainly by the ethnic Serbian community. In 1995, a historic peace deal was signed in Dayton, Ohio, known now as the Dayton Peace Agreement. This resulted in Bosnia and Herzegovina being formed by two sub-state entities. One was the ethnically Bosnian and Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the other was the ethnically Serb Republika Srpska. The current leader of the latter, Milorad Dodik, has long been an advocate for independence from the rest of Bosnia. He does this with rhetoric but also with actions. In recent years, he has taken steps to undermine the legitimate state structures and institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and has started the process of creating parallel state institutions inside Republika Srpska. Dodik has long pursued independence for Republika Srpska and has actively worked to weaken the state institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The situation took a dramatic turn in January this year, when Dodik was sentenced to one year in prison and banned from holding public office for six years after refusing to comply with recommendations from the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Christian Schmidt. Even though Dodik was obligated to do so under the terms of the 1995 Dayton Agreement, he refused. If this was not enough to start a political crisis in Bosnia, this week Dodik signed into law legislation from the Republika Srpska parliament that banned Bosnia and Herzegovina’s police force and judiciary from operating inside Republika Srpska. This was viewed by many as an affront not only to Bosnia’s sovereignty but also to the Dayton Agreement, which has been the key factor in keeping the country at peace and together. Along the way, he is encouraged by his neighbor, Serbia, and also, by extension, Russia. The situation in Bosnia is made worse by developments in neighboring Serbia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who has a close and supportive relationship with Dodik, is experiencing his own political difficulties. Since November 2024, when a roof at a train station collapsed, killing 15 people, he has faced mounting anti-government street protests. These demonstrations have expanded into a broader movement against corruption, culminating in dramatic scenes this week, when opposition MPs set off smoke bombs and flares inside the Serbian parliament. Three lawmakers were injured in the chaos. Vucic is trying to find a way to solve his own domestic political challenges, and encouraging a crisis in Republika Srpska to divert attention might be seen as a solution to his problems. There are numerous examples throughout history where geopolitical circumstances that seem to be regional or even local can have a global impact. The Balkans before the First World War is a great example. There is reason to worry that the region could serve as another flashpoint for a greater conflict, especially as relations between major global powers appear to be strained. As Russia continues to ramp up the pressure over Ukraine and apply more pressure on Europeans, it could well use its influence in Serbia and Republika Srpska to cause a diversion that Europe will have to address. If ever there was a 'European problem,' then what is happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina is certainly one. It is highly unlikely that US President Donald Trump will repeat America’s response to a crisis in the region in the 1990s, when thousands of US troops were deployed as peacekeepers inside Bosnia to stop the killing, or when the US Air Force was used in 1999 to prevent genocide by Serbia against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The Trump White House is focused on dealing with Russia, Ukraine, China, and Iran, along with the situation at America’s southern border. There will likely be little bandwidth to address the situation in southeast Europe. This week, Russia called for a closed-door UN Security Council meeting to discuss the political situation in Bosnia. It will be interesting to see how the US sides in this meeting. Will there be a repeat of the US siding with Russia at the recent UN General Assembly vote over Ukraine, or will the US stick to its more traditional position of supporting the Dayton Peace Agreement and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina? Russia may even try to use this issue as a bargaining chip in the bigger issue of peace negotiations over Ukraine. With Europe focused on what it will do about Ukraine in the event that there is a ceasefire, there is likely to be little capacity for any meaningful European response if war breaks out in the Balkans. While events in the Balkans may not be on the minds of Europeans, events in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region are certainly on the minds of the local leaders. Therefore, it would be incumbent on American and European policymakers not to ignore the region and to stay committed to the hard-fought peace won in the 1990s. Even with everything going on around the world, from Eastern Europe to the Middle East to East Asia, policymakers must keep a close eye on the Balkans. The international community must remain vigilant and committed to preventing the kind of instability that led to war in the 1990s. As history has shown, tensions in the Balkans have the potential to ignite wider conflicts if left unchecked. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Greenland Elections: Go American, Stay Danish, Or Go It Alone? – ...	By Rikard Jozwiak (RFE/RL) -- Normally the elections for the 31-member Inatsisartut, the parliament of Greenland, would get scant attention. The world's biggest island, with a population of just 60,000, is rarely in the news. That changed in January, when incoming US President Donald Trump expressed an interest in taking control of the strategically located and resource-rich territory. The move sent shockwaves throughout Europe, notably for fellow NATO ally Denmark, to which Greenland in fact belongs. (While Copenhagen oversees foreign and monetary policy, Greenlanders control most domestic issues.) That has meant all eyes will now be on the March 11 elections, called by Greenland's prime minister, Mute Egede, after Trump's pronouncements. And while regular domestic issues are part of the election campaign, the overriding issue is clear: Go American, stay Danish, or aim for independence? To be clear, most Greenlanders don't want to become American, and none of the five parties in parliament is advocating for it. Along with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Egede has made clear that Greenland -- which is an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark -- is not for sale and that only Greenlanders can decide its future. Interestingly, the parliament recently passed a law banning both anonymous and foreign donations in the election campaign. But what if an offer they can't refuse comes their way? The United States first expressed an interest in the island in the 19th century, and the territory is actually closer to North America than the European continent. Greenland's security is already guaranteed by virtue of an US air base in the north. And the Arctic is certainly not off-limits for the major powers. Both China and Russia are active in the region, not only for the region's lucrative rare earth materials but also due to warmer temperatures melting sea ice and opening up lucrative trade routes. Even if the island doesn't become American anytime soon, there could be some sort of free trade or association deal with Washington in the future. Then again, the Greenlanders can be a conservative bunch. Where others may see lucrative business opportunities, many of them see a homeland that should be preserved. Only two mines currently exist in Greenland, and the last election, in 2021, was dominated by the popular decision to limit oil and gas exploration and ban the mining of uranium. It is here where Denmark comes into the picture. Three of the five political parties want independence from Denmark, including Prime Minister Egede's left-wing Community of the People party, which finished first four years ago and is likely to finish on top again. The same is true for the ruling party's current coalition partner, the social-democrat Forward party, which aims to finish second. The liberal Democrats party, which prefers to remain in a union with Denmark, is also doing well in recent polls and could well complicate any coalition-building and the direction Greenland will eventually take. While most Greenlanders say they want independence, they also want to maintain their living standards. For that the territory is largely dependent on Denmark. Loyal to the Danish crown since 1814, 50 percent of Greenland's exports go to Denmark and 60 percent of its imports are from Denmark. Half of the population works in the public sector, which Copenhagen to a large degree finances via grants. And to boost security across the island, the Danish government last month pledged 2 billion euros ($2.16 billion) to improve its Arctic defenses. There is a commission in Greenland working on what a possible divorce from Denmark would look like, but essentially it would require three steps. Firstly, there would have to be a deal with Copenhagen on what separation would look like; secondly, there would have to be a positive result in a Greenland-wide referendum on independence; and finally, the Danish parliament would need to green-light the whole endeavor. The pro-independence parties want a referendum to take place sometime during the next four-year mandate, but, given the uncertainties surrounding the territory, that certainly doesn't look like it will happen in 2025.

Ron Paul: Yes, You Can Protect Liberty And Security At The Same T...	When I served in Congress, I was regularly lectured about how the people needed big government to keep them safe and secure, whether it was through welfare and regulations to ensure their economic security, the Patriot Act to protect their personal security, or forever wars to protect global security. Of course, the government’s track record when it comes to providing economic, personal, and global security proves that Ben Franklin was right, and my fellow representatives were wrong, about the dangers of trading liberty for security. The best example of this is the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The TSA is very good at treating law-abiding airline passengers as criminal suspects—but not so good at catching real threats to passenger safety. According to the polling company YouGov, 'Homeland Security conducted an investigation in 2015 which found that undercover investigators were able to successfully smuggle mock explosives and banned weapons through TSA checkpoints in 95% of trials.' Responsibility for passenger security should be given to airlines who have an incentive to provide effective security that does not violate their passengers’ privacy and dignity. Private security companies would compete for the airlines’ business. These private companies would prove far more effective at providing safety than a federal bureaucracy like the TSA. This is because the TSA, like all government bureaucracies, is immune from market competition and thus market discipline. This means they have no incentive to improve their operations. In fact, while failures to stop future attacks would cause a private security company to lose business, government services often get their budgets increased when they fail, whilst the federal employees and agency heads are rarely held accountable for their mistakes. The TSA’s monopoly on airline security also prevents the development of innovative ways to ensure safety. While the TSA does not appear to be going anywhere anytime soon, my son, US Senator from Kentucky Rand Paul, recently helped to protect free markets with another national security matter—the National Public Warning System and Emergency Alert System, which are used to provide emergency alerts. He did this by drastically improving a bill known as the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act. Police groups, attorneys general, and other public safety leaders have stated that AM radio is currently the only communications signal with enough reliability during storms and other emergencies to power the National Public Warning System and Emergency Alert System. Fair enough. I recall during Hurricane Harvey, many of my fellow Texans had no other way of accessing this system as their cellphones and Internet remained out for days. But the problem with the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act in its 2023–2024 form was that, with no sunset provision, it would have frozen today’s AM-reliant system in place, disincentivizing private companies from ever developing newer, innovative ways to effectively deliver emergency alerts over new technologies in the future. Rand blocked the bill in 2023. As he often does, Rand took a principled stand for liberty. Now, Rand’s efforts have paid off as, to prevent the bill from being blocked again, longtime supporters of the legislation added a sunset provision to the AM radio bill when they recently reintroduced the legislation for consideration this year. The sunset provision offers incentives to entrepreneurs to develop new ways to ensure all Americans have access to emergency alerts. The sunset provision makes it a vast improvement over the prior legislation. It’s evidence that even Congress can be convinced to better respect classical liberal principles from time to time, and that’s great news all around.

Protests And Strikes In Iran: Growing Public Outrage Against Corr...	On March 8, Iran witnessed a new wave of strikes and protests in multiple cities, as workers from various sectors took to the streets to express their anger over deteriorating living conditions, widespread corruption, and the authorities’ failure to respond to their demands. These protests included employees of the Telecommunications Company of Iran, healthcare workers, truck drivers, farmers, and oil sector employees, reflecting the widespread dissatisfaction with the Iranian regime. Strikes in the telecommunications sector Several provinces in Iran, including Khorasan Razavi, experienced widespread strikes by employees of the Telecommunications Company of Iran (TCI). In Mashhad, workers protested against unpaid wages, the flawed implementation of the job classification system, and the continued presence of intermediary companies that exploit their rights without providing adequate guarantees. Protests in the healthcare sector In East Azerbaijan Province, in the city of Tabriz, the surgical staff at Imam Reza Hospital went on strike, refusing to perform surgeries in protest against the authorities’ neglect of their demands. Healthcare workers have long complained about deteriorating working conditions, low wages, and lack of government support. In northern Iran, in the city of Bandar Anzali, nurses and staff at Beheshti Hospital also went on strike, demanding the payment of their overdue salaries and Nowruz bonuses, which the government has yet to pay. This reflects the ongoing neglect of healthcare workers by the regime. Demonstrations and protests in other sectors Protests extended to other parts of the country as well. At the Turkish border, truck drivers gathered to denounce corruption in the industry and mining sector and demanded the release of their trucks, which had been unlawfully seized by authorities. In Isfahan, farmers staged a protest against the government’s failure to fulfill its promises, particularly regarding the provision of water for agriculture and compensation for their losses due to the regime’s failed agricultural policies. In the oil sector, employees who had passed the 2013 employment examination staged a protest in Ahvaz, denouncing the systemic discrimination and marginalization they face from government officials. Implications of protests These strikes and protests highlight the growing public outrage against the Iranian regime’s policies, which continue to ignore citizens’ demands and fail to provide even the most basic living conditions. The persistence and expansion of these protests indicate that Iran’s economic and political crisis is worsening. While the regime remains focused on its regional interventions instead of addressing domestic hardships, the question remains: Will the Iranian regime reverse its oppressive policies, or is the country heading toward greater escalation?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJF9R-LfGYFIe	2025-03-08T18:40:05-08:00	
Starmer Is Ditching Zelensky To Avoid Trump Tariffs And Land A Tr...	Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to Washington majored on an historic invitation for President Trump to make a second state visit to Britain. Despite considerable pre-visit hype among the UK mainstream media, Ukraine was barely mentioned. The cold truth is, Starmer is ditching Zelensky to avoid tariffs. The subtle art of diplomacy is often hard to fathom for the outsider. When Keir Starmer called on Donald Trump in the Oval Office on 27 February, there was an air of conviviality that belied what some considered to have been, hitherto, a difficult relationship. The set piece moment was the Prime Minster handing the President a letter from His Majesty, King Charles II. While it has attracted little comment, The King’s letter to President Trump was a diplomatic masterstroke. A section of the first page was captured by a photographer. These were words crafted by His Majesty himself, with his distinct syntax, rather than written by an anonymous committee of officials in 10 Down Street. The preambular second paragraph appears to contain mere niceties about a possible Trump visit to Scotland, but it was so much more. Donald Trump’s mother was born in Scotland, and the President famously owns golf courses there. The King extends a deeply personal invitation for the President to stay at Balmoral, the favoured Residence in Scotland of Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and the place she passed. There is also an offer to visit and stay at Dumfries House, which was His Majesty’s seat in Scotland before ascending to the throne, when his Royal title in Scotland was the Duke of Rothesay. He mentions that underprivileged young people are trained at the House and many end up working at the President’s golfing establishments. Scotland holds a special place in the hearts of both Heads of State. And Diplomacy, ultimately, is about human connection. This was King Charles addressing President Trump as an equal, a peer and a cherished friend. And then the coup de grace, an invitation to an historic second State visit, historic because no US President has been afforded two State visits. President Trump appears to value the form of diplomacy at least as much as its substance. The style and class of King Charles’ letter sits in stark contrast, to the truculent, unshaven President Zelensky arguing in the Oval Office on 28 February. And the theatre behind Keir Starmer’s handing the letter to President Trump was designed to reinforce two perceptions. The first was that The King continues to regard the United States as a dear and trusted friend. The second, and perhaps more significantly, that Prime Minister Starmer was the messenger, not the peer. Some British journalists jokingly referred to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday 27 February as a visit to the King. Clearly, President Trump isn’t a monarch, nor is he Elvis Presley. But in the game of diplomacy between the United States and the United Kingdom, His Majesty King Charles II and President Trump are peers as Heads of State, and Prime Minister Starmer is a more junior Head of Government. While the first sentence of the letter is not fully visible, His Majesty is clearly thanking President Trump for receiving the British Prime Minister – i.e. His Head of Government – so soon after the inauguration. I don’t believe the optics of this would have been lost on the President. The Labour Prime Minister’s has had a bad start with Donald Trump. The King’s letter brings the adults back into the conversation in a way that can only help the UK repair some of the damage caused. In inviting President Trump to Britain, with all the pomp and ceremony that Britain offers like no other country, the UK government wants to reprioritise its trade and investment relationship with the United States. As Europe and America teeter on the brink of a trade war, Britain wants a genuinely open trading relationship with America that both prevents the risk of US tariffs but also gives the UK economy a much-needed boost post-Brexit. America is Britain’s largest export partner accounting for 15.7% of business and trade in goods is fairly balanced, with a tiny surplus of £2.5bn going Britain’s way in 2023. This may help to explain why Britain appears less in the firing line for US tariffs than the European Union, which President Trump said was designed to ‘screw the US’ flooding America with a surplus of $300bn in goods trade. After President Obama famously said that Britain would have to join the back of the queue in any post-Brexit trade talks with America, UK-US trade talks were not prioritised under the Biden administration. This has now become a top priority for the UK in its relationship with the Trump administration. And Starmer has recognised that he can’t have it all – he can’t criticise Trump on Ukraine, backing Zelensky and steering Europe on a pro-war course, while at the same time landing a lucrative trade deal and avoiding Trump tariffs. He has therefore decided quietly to ditch Zelensky and to line up behind Trump’s plans for a peace deal. After Zelensky’s catastrophic Oval Office meeting on 28 February, 10 Downing Street issued a statement saying the Prime Minister had spoken to both US and Ukrainian Presidents. But while it expressed Britain’s ‘unwavering support for Ukraine’, it did not go so far as to side with President Zelensky over the dispute. Having travelled to Washington seeking to avoid causing offence to the President, the stakes are too high for Starmer now to leap onto the bandwagon of unquestioning Zelensky support. Indeed, Starmer is now positioning himself as the bridge between Europe and the US, and has indicated that, with President Macron, he will develop ideas for peace in Ukraine to put to President Trump. This represents a significant shift in UK position, recognising US leadership in landing a peace deal, rather than corralling the European wagons against a change in policy. His Lancaster House Summit of EU Leaders on 2 March, which Zelensky attended, was a long-overdue sign of the UK providing some thought leadership on Ukraine policy. At the very least, it suggests that the UK recognises the greater benefit of delivering strengthened trading relationship with America, rather than clinging on to a losing war in Ukraine. The Brits finally appear to be getting realistic.

With Hezbollah’s Influence Eroded, Can Lebanon Forge A Brighter F...	By Nadia Alfaour For the first time since its creation in 1982, Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia has seen its political and military clout diminished after a devastating war with Israel gutted its leadership, emptied its coffers, and depleted its once formidable arsenal. Despite the grand funeral of its slain leader, Hassan Nasrallah, attended by thousands of mourners at Beirut’s Camille Chamoun Stadium on Feb. 23 to project an image of resilience and strength, the group’s influence over Lebanon and the wider region is undoubtedly on the wane. 'The Lebanese are certainly ready for a new period in the country where the state has a monopoly over weapons,' Michael Young, a senior editor at the Beirut-based Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center, told Arab News. 'As for Hezbollah, it is not going to disappear, on the contrary, it is still around. The big question is whether it can transform itself or not.' The fall of the Bashar Assad regime in neighboring Syria — once a critical supply line for weapons from Iran — has compounded Hezbollah’s woes, leaving it isolated, unable to rearm, and increasingly powerless to dictate Lebanese affairs. Hezbollah is reportedly facing a financial crisis, leaving it scrambling to provide monetary support to the families of its injured members and to finance reconstruction work in its southern and eastern strongholds devastated by Israeli bombardment. 'Some Hezbollah supporters have embraced the change while others are still screaming,' a waiter at one of the cafes along Beirut’s Hamra Street who did not wanted to be identified told Arab News. 'If we have to drag them into this new era kicking and screaming, then we will. It has been about them for so many decades. They left the country broken and darkened. It’s time to move on.' Many Lebanese have warmly welcomed the end of Iranian hegemony and the crippling of its biggest proxy in the Middle East. The election of former army chief Joseph Aoun as president and ICJ judge Nawaf Salam as prime minister in January is emblematic of this shift. Backed by the US, France, and Saudi Arabia, Aoun’s election by Lebanese lawmakers is the clearest indication yet that Iran’s influence in Lebanon is spent, opening the way to reforms and international support to help pull the nation out of the mire. Aoun’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia — the first by a Lebanese leader in eight years — has been regarded as a positive step in resetting ties between the two countries. During the visit, Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman promised to reactivate a $3 billion funding package for the Lebanese army, and a released joint statement declared both sides are looking into ways to allow Saudi citizens to visit Lebanon again. Both countries are also looking into the resumption of Lebanese imports into the Kingdom, which had been halted due to the smuggling of millions of amphetamine and Captagon pills into the Arab Gulf states via Lebanon, often hidden in regular cargo. To be sure, not everyone in Lebanon is pleased with the dramatic political shift taking place. Hezbollah supporters have been left reeling since the loss of their charismatic leader and the forced acceptance of the US-brokered ceasefire with Israel, which has been interpreted as a major blow to the 'Axis of Resistance' of Iran-backed proxies throughout the region. 'The Shiite community in Lebanon had their golden days under Nasrallah, and now it’s a new phase where they’re mourning the golden days,' Hanin Ghaddar, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, said in an interview with an Israeli TV channel. Ghaddar, who is originally from southern Lebanon, said that Hezbollah called for a mass demonstration in downtown Beirut on March 8, 2005, to 'ascertain that they’re taking over, inheriting the Syrian army and taking over the Lebanese institutions.' The war between Israel and the Lebanese militia began on Oct. 8, 2023, when fighters in south Lebanon began firing rockets into northern Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which a day earlier had attacked southern Israel, triggering the war in Gaza. What began as a tit-for-tat exchange of fire along the Israel-Lebanon border suddenly escalated in September 2024 when Israel intensified its aerial bombardment of Hezbollah positions, attacked its communications networks, and mounted a ground offensive. On Sept. 17-18, thousands of pagers and hundreds of walkie-talkies in the possession of Hezbollah members suddenly exploded in synchronized waves after being sabotaged by Israel. The attack killed 42 and injured 3,500, crippling the militia’s communications. According to one of Nasrallah’s sons, Jawad, his father was left spiritually broken by the pager and walkie-talkie attack and the death of Fuad Shukr, a senior commander and long-time Hezbollah member, in an Israeli strike. In an interview with Lebanese television network Al-Manar, Jawad described his father as 'spiritless and sad' after these blows. 'You could see that he was hurt,' he said. 'There were times I could not bear to hear his voice when he was in that state. You listen to him trying to seek encouragement, but once you hear his voice, it hurts your heart. Later, I learned that he was crying.' On Sept. 27, 2024, Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on an underground Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut’s Dahiyeh suburb. The attack, carried out by Israeli F-15I fighter jets, involved more than 80 bombs, destroying the bunker and nearby buildings. The Israel military confirmed Nasrallah’s death on Sept. 28, and his body was recovered the following day. The strike resulted in at least 33 deaths and nearly 200 injuries, including civilians. As the conflict threatened to drag the US and Iran into direct confrontation, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Israel trading missile strikes, the international community acted to secure a ceasefire in November 2024, which has by and large held. Hezbollah’s battering by Israel has left it politically enfeebled, allowing independent lawmakers and parties not affiliated with the militia to establish a new government after more than two years of political deadlock. 'Up to now there are no signs that the party is going through a reassessment of its previous strategy, although some say within the party such discussions are taking place,' Carnegie Middle East Center’s Young told Arab News. 'Given the hardening of the Iranian position recently, with Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying there can be no negotiations with America, I am not sure that is correct.' Lebanon remains in the midst of a devastating economic crisis, with the local currency having lost more than 90 percent of its value since 2019 and up to 80 percent of the population living in poverty — at least 40 percent of them in extreme poverty. Unemployment rates have skyrocketed and banks continue to impose strict controls on withdrawals and transfers. Meanwhile, the World Bank estimates it will cost $8.5 billion to repair the damage of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. For the thousands of Lebanese who were forced to flee their homes in the south under Israel’s bombardment, the mere suggestion that Hezbollah was somehow victorious in the conflict, as some hardline supporters like to claim, is utterly delusional. 'If my parents return to their village, when should we expect them to be expelled again?' Ali, a university student who now lives with his parents in a cramped Beirut apartment and did not want to give his full name, told Arab News. 'How many more times? We are caught in the crossfire, doomed to be a football between Hezbollah and Israel. 'We are tired of being kicked around. It is shameful. Then you get a deluded supporter who tells you we’ve won. What did we win?' The international community and Arab donors have so far refused to release any aid funds until UN Security Council Resolution 1701 is fully implemented, which calls for the disarmament and disbanding of all armed groups in the country except for the Lebanese army. After several years of political gridlock and a power vacuum once filled by Hezbollah and the Amal bloc led by Nabih Berri, Lebanon is now in a unique position to stabilize and integrate itself once again into the Arab fold. President Aoun’s remarks during the Arab League summit in Cairo on March 4 reflect his apparent determination to set Lebanon on this new course, with some describing his speech as 'resistance through diplomacy.' The Washington Institute’s Ghaddar believes that while the current phase may not be 'the end of Hezbollah for the (Lebanese Shiite) community,' the lack of money, jobs, services, and reconstruction has led people to seek alternatives. 'It’s very clear that Hezbollah is no longer an option for them,' she said in the interview with the Israeli TV channel. Today, 'Hezbollah is a new entity, which cannot provide, cannot protect, obviously cannot preserve, and cannot rebuild.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJGeAz6S70lLV	2025-03-08T18:32:56-08:00	
The Thai Way To End Human-Elephant Conflict – Analysis	Sri Lanka could adopt Thailand's Bajrasudha Gajamurak model, which effectively balances the needs of both elephants and humans through a unique blend of traditional and modern techniques. The human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka continues unabated. Although efforts by successive governments since the 1970s have reduced the rate of attrition, the issue remains a pressing concern. Various mitigation methods have been attempted with mixed success. Given this, it may be worthwhile for the Sri Lankan government to consider adopting Thailand's Bajrasudha Gajamurak model, which successfully integrates traditional and modern strategies to harmonize human-elephant coexistence. The Significance of the Asian Elephant The Asian elephant inhabits diverse ecosystems, ranging from dry to wet forests and grasslands across 13 countries in South and Southeast Asia. While their preferred diet consists of forage plants, they have adapted to consuming a wide variety of resources depending on habitat availability. Historically, human societies in these regions have had a close association with elephants. In the past, elephants were revered rather than seen as adversaries. Even today, they hold a sacred place in religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, despite being viewed as a menace by modern villagers due to their frequent raids for food. Elephants in Hinduism and Buddhism According to Hindu mythology, the gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras or Yakshas) churned the ocean in search of the elixir of life, during which nine sacred jewels emerged—one of them being the elephant. This divine origin made the elephant a symbol of good fortune in Hinduism. The elephant-headed deity Ganesha is venerated as the remover of obstacles. In South India, before entering temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, devotees first pay homage to Ganesha. Similarly, in North Central Sri Lanka, villagers install Ganesha statues to ward off wild elephants. In both South India and Sri Lanka, elaborately decorated elephants are central to religious processions. Records of the use of elephants in Sri Lankan Buddhist rituals date back to the 3rd century BCE. Historical sources even mention the donation of elephants to temples, with the earliest recorded instance occurring in the 1st century CE. Prior to the advent of cavalry warfare, elephants were a vital asset in battles, and Sri Lanka engaged in a thriving trade of elephants with India. Despite this historical reverence, human-elephant relations have deteriorated over time. The exponential growth of the human population and encroachment on elephant habitats have intensified conflicts. However, poaching in Sri Lanka remains relatively low since only 5% of its elephants are tuskers. Rising Conflict and Slaughter Sri Lanka's Minister of Environment, Dammika Patabendi, recently reported alarming statistics in Parliament. Between 2015 and 2019, 1,466 wild elephants were killed. This number increased to 2,011 between 2020 and 2024. Human casualties also rose sharply. Between 2015 and 2019, 456 people were killed due to elephant encounters. The figure surged to 734 between 2020 and 2024. In total, Sri Lanka lost 3,477 wild elephants and 1,190 human lives from 2015 to 2024. To combat this crisis, the Sri Lankan government has implemented several measures, including: Constructing electric fences Reopening blocked elephant corridors Increasing food availability in elephant habitats Establishing wildlife reserves Deploying security task forces to deter elephant incursions into human settlements Developing regulated tourism However, these efforts require stronger enforcement, greater investment, and more strategic planning. Thailand's Effective Approach to Human-Elephant Conflict Thailand, often called the 'Land of the White Elephant,' has a long-standing cultural reverence for elephants. However, the country has faced a severe human-elephant conflict due to habitat destruction and rapid urban expansion. The issue escalated to hundreds of deaths annually among both humans and elephants. Recognizing the urgency, Thailand launched the Bajrasudha Gajamurak Project in 2019, initiated by the Thai royal family. This project, implemented in five eastern provinces—Chachoengsao, Chonburi, Rayong, Chanthaburi, and Sa Kaeo—focuses on creating a sustainable balance where both humans and elephants can coexist. Three-Zone Strategy The project strategically divides areas bordering forests into three distinct zones: Forest Conservation Zone – A designated area where elephants can thrive naturally with sufficient food and water. Buffer Zone – A transition area with food sources and artificial water bodies that prevent elephants from venturing into human settlements. Community Zone – Exclusively for human habitation, with strategies to deter elephant encroachment and promote coexistence. Forest Conservation Zone To encourage elephants to remain within their natural habitat, the project: Established 60 water sources with a combined capacity of 1.8 million cubic meters. Undertook reforestation efforts to restore natural food sources. Planted bamboo, mango, and banana trees, ensuring a sustainable food supply for elephants. Buffer Zone Buffer zones act as temporary dwellings for elephants before they are guided back to conservation areas. Key measures include: Constructing grassy meadows and check dams to ensure consistent water availability. Introducing strongly scented plants, such as climbing wattle and cassia, which elephants avoid. Establishing community forests with medicinal plants to benefit both villagers and wildlife. Use of Artificial Intelligence A Comprehensive Elephant Surveillance System equipped with AI-powered automated cameras was implemented. These cameras, installed in buffer zones, detect elephant movements and send real-time alerts via the LINE chat app to villagers and trained volunteer teams, who then guide the elephants back to their habitats. Community Zones In the community zones, local populations received: Awareness training on elephant behavior and conflict mitigation. Skill development programs to diversify livelihoods. Financial support for alternative income sources, such as medicinal herb cultivation, basket weaving, and food processing. As a result, communities transitioned from single-crop farming to multiple cropping systems, reducing dependence on land encroachment. The project fostered solidarity among villagers, strengthening communal efforts toward sustainable coexistence. Conclusion: A Model for Sri Lanka? The Bajrasudha Gajamurak model provides an effective, structured, and sustainable solution to human-elephant conflict. Sri Lanka, facing a worsening crisis, could benefit immensely from trialing a similar approach, particularly in conflict-prone areas. Implementing Thailand's zoning strategy, AI-based surveillance, and community-driven conservation could pave the way for a more harmonious coexistence between humans and elephants.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJJs92If7RKzr	2025-03-08T18:29:17-08:00	
The Return Of Geopolitics Vs. ‘America First’: Europe’s Strategic...	1. Introduction The slogan 'America First' used by the Trump administration and continued in various forms by American policy, has brought about a strong return to traditional geopolitics. This change has had and is expected to have a series of consequences for Europe. These consequences will be reflected first and foremost in the weakening of multilateralism and, above all, of NATO. This strategy, gradually but with accelerated steps, has already given signs that it is in full compliance with the project for a New World Order that is based on an equally new trajectory, which has nothing to do with the conventional trajectory of American foreign policy. His administration’s approach towards Russia, demonstrated on the third anniversary of the start of the all-out Russian war for the complete annexation of Ukraine, in the UN General Assembly [1] in relation to the resolution sponsored by Ukraine’s allies, which demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from sovereign Ukrainian territory, marks the first step towards the New World Order. The US vote in this case, aligned with Russia, was the clearest sign of the historical turning point in geopolitical realignment. All this is done by counting Russia's withdrawal from the alliance with the rising China. In this process of voting on the resolution, 93 votes were in favor, while 18 were against - among those who voted against were the US!!! With this act, the Transatlantic Alliance was severely hit... but the New World Order also took its first step. This new American course raises legitimate critical questions regarding its consequences, especially for the transatlantic alliance and global stability. The Western Hemisphere thus suffers the greatest rift in its history. What Milosevic had not achieved, despite having resisted NATO bombing for 78 days [1999], after three years of war in Ukraine, Putin achieved. 2. Strategic approach to separating Russia from China – wrong investment The US strategy to separate Russia and China has some parallels with the EU’s strategy to separate Serbia from Russian influence, despite the fact that they seem at first glance to have fundamental differences. In both cases, we are dealing with attempts to separate alliances that were and are perceived to be dangerous to Western interests. However, there are factors that make each case unique. The US strategic approach to China and Russia, like the EU’s approach to Serbia, aims to offer economic, political and diplomatic alternatives to mitigate dependence on Moscow. In this regard, both the US and the EU use economic and diplomatic means to achieve their goals, whether through investments, trade agreements, or integration into international organizations. In both cases, Russia is a key factor that does not easily accept the loss of its allies and reacts with political, economic and military pressure. In this parallel, however, there are also profound differences. Russia and China, despite their strong partnership, have historical differences and interests that do not always coincide. Serbia, on the other hand, has a deeper emotional and historical connection to Russia, which makes it more difficult for it to break away from Moscow. The EU has promised Serbia membership, but the process has been slow and often disappointing. Meanwhile, the US has difficulty detaching China from Russia because Moscow and Beijing see the West as a common threat. Russia and China are both major superpowers and can more easily resist American pressure. In the case of Russia, this resistance was clearly reflected in the three-year war in Ukraine and the insistence on not giving up on the strategic objective of creating the Russian World. Meanwhile, Serbia, although with strong ties to Russia, is more dependent on the EU economically and politically. Therefore, this investment, in both cases, seems to be wrong. In the case of the US, the attempt to separate Russia from China is very difficult and unlikely to succeed in the short term. Both countries have a strategic interest in confronting the West together. Meanwhile, in the case of the EU and Serbia, the EU's attempt to attract Serbia seemed more realistic at first glance, but the stagnation of the accession process and Brussels' hesitation, not only in relation to Serbia, but to all the countries in the region aspiring to EU accession, have made success uncertain. In both cases, the strategy turns out to be wrong. Trump’s approach to Russia is reminiscent of President Richard Nixon’s 1972 China Overture, in which Washington exploited the Sino-Soviet divide to contain Moscow. This time, however, the roles are reversed, as the United States seeks to engage Russia in an effort to weaken China’s strategic position. The administration envisions diplomatic engagement, the lifting of selected sanctions, and a possible easing of tensions over Ukraine as mechanisms to bring Russia back to a more balanced relationship with the West. [2] The premise of this strategy is based on purely transactional incentives, which cannot fail to work. Soviet Russia’s partnership with communist China at the time had a common ideological bedrock. This Russia-China partnership has for years, with emphasis since the end of the Cold War onward, been built on a shared opposition to Western dominance. 'Both countries benefit from economic cooperation, joint military exercises, and diplomatic coordination in multilateral institutions such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.'[3] The BRICS alliance is de facto led by President Putin, who is considered the initiator and architect of the multipolar world. The New World Order has precisely this objective at its core – the creation of a multipolar world. BRICS lacks the military power of the United States, but it does not lack economic power, which over time could be a good guarantee for the development of its military wing. In this regard, the likelihood of Russia abandoning BRICS, and especially its partnership with China, seems highly unrealistic. President Donald Trump’s recent statements about the withdrawal of US troops from Europe and changes in the world order have sparked numerous discussions about the possible consequences for international security and transatlantic relations. According to diplomatic sources, President Trump has proposed a reduction of about 20,000 US troops in Europe, which represents about 20% of the current US military presence on the continent. The move aims to review the US commitment to the defense of Europe and requires European countries to contribute more financially to cover the costs of the remaining troops, arguing that these forces serve as a deterrent and that the costs cannot be borne solely by US taxpayers. However, some European leaders have expressed their belief that the US has no concrete plans for a complete withdrawal of military troops. Polish President Andrzej Duda, after a meeting with the US special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, declared that 'there is absolutely no American intention to reduce activity in our part of Europe, especially in terms of security, or to reduce the number of US troops'.[4] This was the response given to the alarm raised by the German daily in its article with the headline: 'In case of an agreement between Trump and Putin: Europe in fear! Intelligence agencies fear the withdrawal of US troops'.[5] Similar statements were also made by NATO command and US officials in relation to the Balkans. Recently, reports have emerged suggesting the possibility of withdrawing US troops from the Balkans, especially from Kosovo. These reports in the media owned by the oligarchs in Kosovo have been published at lightning speed. These concerns were raised after negotiations between the United States and Russia in Saudi Arabia, where it was speculated that Russia may request the withdrawal of US troops from NATO countries that joined the alliance after 1990. However, senior US and NATO officials have denied these claims. An official from the US Mission to NATO stated that there has been no discussion about reducing or withdrawing US troops from Kosovo. A NATO official also stressed that the US commitment to the Alliance and the presence of US troops in Europe remain strong, and that KFOR continues to implement its mandate to contribute to the establishment of a secure environment in Kosovo. Currently, the US has over 600 troops stationed in Kosovo as part of the KFOR mission, playing a key role in maintaining stability in the region. Italy also contributes over 1,200 troops to this mission. Security experts warn that a possible withdrawal of US troops could have serious consequences for the stability of the region, increasing insecurity and encouraging Serbia to take military action in favor of its already promoted expansionist policies related to the objective of creating a Serbian World. Overall, despite speculation, official statements from the US and NATO confirm the continuation of the US military presence in the Balkans, especially in Kosovo, to ensure peace and stability in the region. 3. The New World Order and Trump's Strategy Authors and strategists gathered around 'MAGA' have long promoted the pro-Russian course by bringing Donald Trump and Musk back to the White House. Only the first month of Trump's return and the installation of Elon Musk in the White House has shown that this pro-Russian course is unstoppable. This process of transition to the Russian sphere, of course claiming Russia's separation from China and the dissolution of the BRICS, will be accompanied by the installation of autocracyin the USand its separation from Europe. This process is being claimed to be a fait accompli even before the mid-term elections. The US thus claims that it will also change the course of the transfer of the global balance of power under China's control. BRICS, led by Russia, China and India, is challenging dedollarization and with it the loss of the US's weight in the Western economic and political order. To avoid this course of events, the victimization of Ukraine is just irredeemable collateral damage in the logic of MAGA strategists. For this reason, they believe that the future of America lies in the creation of a united and integrated entity – a superstate that would dominate in all spheres: from the economy and technology to military and geopolitical power, as one of its authors believes. It is no coincidence that some of Trump’s vision points in this context have already been publicly affirmed, such as his talk about integrating Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal into the United States. These territories are not only geographically important - they are, according to the new MAGA strategists, crucial for the strategic and economic power of America’s future and its role in the New World Order. 'America First' alias MAGA has set forth its concrete objective, which is to completely change the paradigm that Trump had communicated to voters. The Trump administration under the influence of Elon Musk is now acting in accordance with the doctrine that would guarantee the preservation of the status of the hegemonic superpower, even strengthening it. Meanwhile, Europe, alias EU leaders have already realized that the liberal democracy established in European society, is in immediate need of an autonomous strategy that guarantees the state independence of each member and the community as a whole. The prosperity of the hegemonic doctrine of MAGA is based on the development of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, renewable energies, etc.; they require rare minerals. Today in Washington, in the name of MAGA [Make America Great Again], work is being done to change the international institutions that bear the seal of the USA. All this in the name of creating the New World Order. At the foundation of the current Order, let us remember the fact that, it is precisely the institutions created by the US itself – International Law, the UN, NATO, etc. President Trump’s policies, which are de facto the product of the experts who drafted the Make America Great Again platform, have brought about significant changes in the world order. His 'America First' approach has challenged traditional international institutions and alliances, including NATO and the European Union. This approach has raised questions about the US commitment to its allies and has prompted discussions about a new world order, where European countries may be forced to take more responsibility for their own security. In an interview with Euronews Albania, analyst Mentor Beqa emphasized that Trump’s decisions could have major consequences for the world order, including the weakening of traditional alliances and the increasing influence of other powers such as China and Russia. However, President Trump’s statements and actions regarding the withdrawal of US forces from Europe and changes in the world order have sparked debate on the future of global security and international relations. While a quarter of European leaders remain confident in the continuation of American commitment, others warn about the possible consequences of such a withdrawal. It has been a full month since a leader like Donald Trump was installed in Washington, who is challenging the liberal international order, putting narrow national interests ahead of traditional alliances (America First). If the US distances itself from Europe and withdraws from the Alliance, which is unlikely to happen, Albania risks being left without geopolitical protection. NATO may no longer be the umbrella that protects us from the storms, while EU enlargement may continue to remain an open and never-ending story, similar to the fate of the young officer in Dino Buxati’s The Tatar Desert, writes Tirana-based publicist Lutfi Dervishi. But if developments in the new world order include a closer alliance between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, this could have significant consequences for the Balkans. Given that the Balkans have been a sensitive area for the geopolitical influences of great powers, this development could create tensions and strategic shifts. 4. Changing the geopolitical balance We are currently living in an era of the return of empires. Great powers and regional powers are seeking to reclaim or redefine their spheres of influence, as was the case in the eras of classical empires. The return of great rivalries, clashes for resources, territories, and cultural and economic influence, has become more evident, especially after the major geopolitical changes of recent decades. The return of empires in a modern form does not necessarily mean the construction of classical empires with conquered and directly administered territories, but rather an expansion of economic, political, military, and cultural influence. Some superpowers and regional powers show clear tendencies towards a new imperial model. Superpowers with modern imperialist tendencies such as the United States, China, and Russia have already taken the first steps that the change in the geopolitical balance imposes. The United States of America (USA) continues to maintain a vast network of military bases around the world. It controls global financial institutions (such as the IMF and the World Bank). Meanwhile, the use of 'soft power' and 'dollar diplomacy' has enabled it to prevent the BRICS from promoting its currency. While their cultural and technological dominance through corporations such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and Hollywood is evident. China, on the other hand, has projected its rise as a power through the 'Silk Road' initiative (BRI), economically and politically connecting the world to itself. In addition, it has created the first military bases abroad (e.g., in Djibouti). Meanwhile, it uses economic capital and investments to increase its influence (in Africa, Latin America, Europe). But China also has clear ambitions for technological dominance (AI, 5G, etc.). Russia is using military power to restore influence in the post-Soviet space (Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus, Central Asia). It is deepening the diplomatic course to maintain alliances with autocratic regimes to oppose the West [case in Serbia, Hungary, Republika Srpska of Bosnia…] For years it has created a monopoly in the energy field and relies on its export as a political instrument and blackmail. Meanwhile, it continues to intensify the use of mercenaries and disinformation to influence other countries, not only in the Balkans. Regional powers with imperialist tendencies have not been left behind in this race. Turkey is reviving the Ottoman legacy through cultural and religious diplomacy in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa. It has intervened militarily in Syria, Libya, Azerbaijan and has become a key player in the Eastern Mediterranean. Its military industry is growing significantly, making it more strategically independent.Iran has built an 'empire' through militias and armed groups in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen (through the Houthis). It uses a combination of religion and ideology to expand its influence in the Shiite world. It has ambitions to become a nuclear power, challenging the West and its Arab rivals. India is increasing its influence in the Indian Ocean and is trying to rival China in Southeast Asia and Africa. It has a large military force and a rapidly growing economy. It is trying to create a sphere of influence through cultural and technological ties. In the modern era, there is no need for military conquests to build an 'empire'. Instead, economics, technology, cultural influence and clever diplomacy are used to create a large sphere of control. The US and China are the two superpowers with the most potential to build their own 'empires', while Russia, Turkey, Iran and India are trying to create their own spheres of influence. Europe is now being forced to prepare to defend Ukraine even without America. It is convinced that this is the only way it can do its best at these historic junctures. If they cannot do this together, as the EU and as Europe, then an alliance of states ready to stop Putin's march will do it. The emergency meeting in Paris proved precisely this expected and necessary strategy of action. This neighborhood of European states has clearly understood that Ukraine must be defended, even without Donald Trump's America. After the scandal during the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House, Europe wants to take the initiative. The urgently called summit on Ukraine, which was held in London on March 2, 2025, at which Zelensky was welcomed, Starmer described it as a 'unique moment for European security'. The summit, hosted by the British prime minister, was attended by a dozen European heads of state and government. It came against the backdrop of a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump and his vice president J.D. Vance at the White House on Friday. [6] British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced after a special summit in London what steps Ukraine’s allies had agreed to maintain support for the Russian-occupied country. Starmer said Britain, France and others had agreed to work with Ukraine 'on a plan to end the fighting.' [7] That ceasefire plan would then be discussed with the Trump administration in the United States 'and taken forward together.' Starmer stressed the importance of continued US support. What are the US president’s options after this meeting? The first is about waiting for Zelensky to bow to him, apologize, and agree to sign a deal on Ukraine’s mineral resources without the additional US security guarantees that Kiev and key European countries – the UK, France, and the EU – insist on. Trump, on the other hand, believes that this deal is a sufficient guarantee that the Russians will not be able to launch any new military campaigns against Ukraine in the future, i.e. most of it will remain under Kiev’s control. The second option is for Trump to abandon Ukraine altogether and leave it to the fate of European aid in its ongoing war with Russia, if they so wish. This option is a nightmare for Europe (and certainly for Ukraine, which knows very well who its main strategic partner is and why it managed to preserve its statehood in the first place). Because the European political elites would gladly wage war with Russia with Ukrainian soldiers 'until final victory,' but without sending their own soldiers, as was the case for three years under Joe Biden. They would send them only if the US provided them with security guarantees and only after signing a peace agreement.[8] 4.1 The Curse of Geopolitics: Does the EU Want the Ukraine Negotiations to Fail? Big Issues Are Changing Alliances. Meanwhile, EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas is boldly asserting that the 'free world' needs a new leader and that Europe is the right leader. This statement is widely seen in geopolitical decision-making circles as a Brussels bubble and is not taken seriously. But the negotiations that de facto have not yet taken place are another matter. The bloodshed of a section of European diplomacy over the failure of Trump’s diplomacy in Ukraine is another matter. It seems that Americans and Europeans have returned to the Cold War era, but with opposite roles than they had before. The Trump administration has questioned the US commitment to NATO, demanding that European countries increase their military spending. Even after the changes in the Biden administration, the pressure on Europe to take on more defense responsibilities continues. This has prompted some countries, such as Germany and France, to push for a common European defense, although with no concrete results yet. Meanwhile, as the war in Ukraine continued, Europe was forced to increase its military capabilities and find long-term security solutions without relying solely on the United States. Now it is the Europeans who are advocating tough stances towards Moscow, while Washington is seeking understanding.[9] The different views within the Alliance today have to do exclusively with realpolitik, they are the result of a different geopolitical situation. During the Cold War, Europeans feared that their continent would become a battlefield for a limited nuclear war. For a long time, conflict management through detente seemed to be the best solution for Europe.[10] The new US administration is pursuing its own version of the Heart of the Earth Theory. From this perspective, China and Russia are the heart of Eurasia that will continue to decide the fate of the world in the 21st century. But the real fact that has changed on the ground is China. It is now the dominant power, while Russia is its vassal within the BRICS and vis-à-visthe USA. Moscow, in this context of the curse of geopolitics, especially in relation to Ukraine, has the possibility of becoming a pawn of its own kind in the game of chess. 4.2 Triarchy Plus In 1841, the Jewish-German philosopher Moses Hess published the book 'The European Triarchy'. Hess's basic thesis was that the fate of Europe was determined by three states: Great Britain, France and Germany. Moses Hess, in his theory of the triarchy, focused his analysis on the three main European powers of the 19th century: Great Britain, Germany and France. He argued that these three powers represented three different aspects of political and social development: 1. France as a symbol of revolution and social equality. 2. Germany as a representative of philosophy and intellectual development. 3. Great Britain as a symbol of capitalism and industrialization. Meanwhile, Poland was added to the theory of the triarchy, with emphasis during the course of the war in Ukraine, thus creating a more stable quadrilateral for the new geopolitical circumstances. The war in Ukraine has revealed its role in a modern context, naturally contributing to the shaping of the thesis on the Triarchy Plus. Poland can be considered in many ways as a typical representative of nationalism and self-determination as well as a center of security and geopolitical balance in Central Europe, being at the same time also as a mediator between East and West. So, a Triarchy Plus could function in this way: • Great Britain –representative of the Anglo-Saxon tradition and free-market capitalism. • France – as a leader of European integration and the republican spirit. • Germany – as an economic locomotive and a model of social-democratic stability. • Poland – as the center of a new Europe, which is defining its own strategic role in the East. The role of Poland in the strategic plane in the East could easily be played by Albania and Kosovo in Southeast Europe. 4.3 An imposed peace on Ukraine does not guarantee long-term security in Europe 'America First' has inspired populist and nationalist movements in Europe, fueling more skepticism towards the EU and international institutions. Political forces that follow this approach have gained ground in countries such as Italy, France, Hungary and Poland. Meanwhile, the American intervention [by the Trump administration] in favor of the AfD on the eve of the elections in Germany has raised concerns throughout the liberal and progressive camp. The new German government is meanwhile expected to position itself clearly in support of the course already proclaimed by its European partners such as France, Great Britain, Poland and other states; they are facing a battle to save not only Ukraine. An imposed peace on Ukraine does not guarantee long-term security in Europe. All that the proclaimed agreement can be expected to provide is a ceasefire for an indefinite period. Russia’s expansionist policies continue. Especially in relation to countries that have Russian minorities within their territory. See for this, Putin's Russia must be stopped. The creation of a resistance front is in the interest of European security; it guarantees freedom and life itself. Europe at these historical moments is facing a major geopolitical dilemma. It must strengthen its strategic autonomy in order not to depend on the US for security and economy. In any case, the return of geopolitics is forcing Europe to take more responsibility for its fate. 4.4 The Balkans Faced with a Geopolitical Dilemma In these circumstances, the Balkans are once again faced with the geopolitical dilemma of the pre-Cold War era. Each alternative could have significant strategic, economic or military consequences. This confrontation is related to the challenges and limitations that come from the international environment, the balance of power and national interests. But in this context, if for Albania and the Albanians, as well as for most of the countries in the region, there is no geopolitical dilemma, Serbia, Bulgaria and Hungary are faced with a more serious geopolitical dilemma. Their decisions in this geopolitical confrontation could have profound consequences for the European security architecture, but also for the international order and the balance of power. Serbia is once again faced with the pressure to choose between different alliances - between the EU and Russia. Some Balkan countries, especially those with real aspirations to join the EU, should, in these circumstances, seek greater support and engagement from the European Union to safeguard regional stability. This development could lead to an increase in military tensions in the Balkans, with the possibility of scenarios of direct or indirect involvement of major powers in local conflicts. There could be increased opportunities for destabilization, as is the case with efforts to maintain control over territories that Serbia marks as 'disputed' whether in Bosnia [Republika Srpska] or Kosovo [its north]. In these circumstances, the Balkans could easily become an arena for competition between major powers, such as Russia and China on the one hand, and Turkey and the West on the other. If the Trump-Putin alliance strengthens, Russian and Chinese influence in the region could increase, improving investment, helping the economic development of some Balkan states, and increasing the influence of these states in global politics. Overall, the consequences for the Balkans will depend on how the region reacts to these changes and how international powers coordinate to maintain stability and security in this part of the world. 4.5 The EU and its future In this changing geopolitical balance, the EU continues to be one of the most powerful organizations in the world. At the same time, it is also demonstrating the real possibilities for its transformation into a Military Alliance. However, current challenges show that its future will depend on the ability to maintain unity; on a clear position in favor of Ukrainian sovereignty and finding ways to create the preconditions for a long-term ceasefire or the imposition of peace between Ukraine and Russia; and on its ability to address economic and political crises and adapt its strategies to an increasingly complex world. A closer alliance between Trump and Putin could fuel tensions between Balkan countries that are aligned with the West and those that have closer ties to Russia. Countries like Serbia, which has maintained a stable policy, if not outright vassalage, towards Russia, can feel supported, while the two Albanian republics – Albania and Kosovo, which are engaged side by side with NATO and the European Union, can and should increase the pressure to protect their territorial integrity and independence from Russian influences. In fact, the two Albanian republics in this situation urgently need to move towards the unification of the Strategy, namely the creation of a single defense command. 5. Conclusion: the position of the Albanians The essence of parliamentary democracy and its applied form in established Western liberal democracies is currently under pressure, both from within and from without. Seen in the light of developments on the global level, first of all after the return of Donald Trump to the White House, Transatlantic relations are entering a new historical phase that is expected to face profound tectonic upheaval. The EU is currently facing a threat coming from three directions simultaneously: first, from Russia and its expansionist project; second, from Donald Trump’s America; [11] third, from neo-fascism that is returning in the form of aggressive nationalism within the largest European states themselves. In addition to this upheaval that the age of the New World Order is imposing, the EU and the future of democracy are facing unusual competition with authoritarian-technocratic and authoritarian-autocratic systems. Meanwhile, in the environments of the Nation-State and the EU institutions, democracy is facing the storms brought by the return of neo-fascism in the form of political populism and especially the significant and growing loss of the importance of explicit political engagement by the Western intellectual elite and in particular the social democratic parties which have lost the role they had as functional equivalents since the end of the Second World War. However, the existence of the Nation-State and democracy itself is completely dependent on the presence of the latter in the active life of citizens and the commitment to preserving and establishing the nation-state and democracy simultaneously. The Nation-State turns out to be the bed where democracy can continue to thrive, but with the precondition imposed by the new realignment, namely the New World Order in the making and postmodern geopolitics. In this context, the future of democracy and the nation-state takes on a new meaning, but it is clear that at this historical stage both democracy and the nation-state are expected to undergo profound changes. In this terrain of geopolitical developments, reviewing the future position of our two republics - political Albania and the Republic of Kosovo, but also the Nation as a whole, is crucial. A decisive step in the field of security and defense, see for this, must be taken urgently. This act must be accompanied by the legal-political one, that is, by organizing a referendum on the unification of our two republics. This step will be crucial at the beginning of the process of creating the Albanian Federation and positioning the Nation within the concept of an autonomous European strategy, as an adequate response to the new geopolitical changes that are taking place. 1.

Trust Erodes In India’s Electoral System – OpEd	On March 4, 2025, as I sit to unpack the unfolding saga of duplicate Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) numbers in India, the air feels thick with suspicion, political maneuvering, and a palpable sense of betrayal among voters. The allegations, spearheaded by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal, have cracked open a Pandora’s box, revealing a glitch in the electoral system that the Election Commission of India (ECI) now scrambles to address. The claim is stark: voters in Haryana and West Bengal share identical EPIC numbers, voter IDs meant to be unique, raising questions about the sanctity of the democratic process. The ECI’s admission in a press note dated March 2, 2025, that this mess stems from a decentralized, manual system predating the ERONET platform, only deepens the intrigue. How did this happen? Why was it overlooked? And what does it mean for India’s elections, past and future? Let us start with the basics. The EPIC number, a 10-digit alphanumeric code, is the backbone of voter identification in India. Introduced under the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, and later bolstered by the digital ERONET system, it is designed to ensure every voter has a distinct identity, safeguarding against impersonation and fraud. The ECI has long touted its uniqueness, back in June 2019, it tweeted confidently that 'Every EPIC or Elector’s Photo Identity Card has a unique EPIC Number which can be used to check one’s name in the Electoral Roll.' That assurance now rings hollow as evidence mounts of overlapping numbers across state lines. The TMC’s allegations are not just a regional grumble; they have ignited a national debate, with opposition parties smelling blood and citizens questioning the very foundation of their electoral trust. The ECI’s explanation, detailed in its March 2 press note, offers some clarity but little comfort. Before ERONET, a web-based platform for managing electoral rolls, came into play, voter registration relied on a fragmented, manual process. Different state Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) offices, operating in silos, sometimes used the same alphanumeric series for EPIC numbers. The result? Voters in Haryana and West Bengal, for instance, might share an identical EPIC number, a flaw the ECI insists does not translate to fake voters or fraud. Why? Because these voters are registered in different constituencies, with distinct demographic details and polling booths, making it improbable for one to impersonate another across state borders. It is a technical defense, rooted in logistics rather than intent, but it is done little to quell the storm. Digging deeper, the ECI’s press note and subsequent clarifications, reported by outlets like The Hindu and The Times of India, promise a fix. ERONET 2.0, the next iteration of the platform, is being rolled out to ensure every EPIC number is unique. It is a forward-looking commitment, but it does not erase the past. If duplicates existed for years, how many elections were affected? The ECI insists there is no evidence of fraud, each voter’s identity remains tied to their specific constituency, but the opposition is not buying it. TMC leaders, including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, have cried 'voter fraud,' alleging 'fake' and 'outsider' voters propped up the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in past polls. The Congress has joined the chorus, slamming the ECI’s oversight as 'bizarre,' while calls for Supreme Court intervention and election boycotts gain traction. This brings us to a proposed solution that is both tantalizing and divisive: linking EPIC numbers with Aadhaar, India’s 12-digit biometric identification number. Proponents argue it is the silver bullet, tie every voter to a unique Aadhaar ID, and duplicates vanish overnight. The ECI already offers a voluntary linking program, with step-by-step guides circulating online. Fill out Form 6B, submit your Aadhaar details, and you are synced. Simple, right? Not quite. Privacy advocates balk at the idea, warning of data breaches and surveillance creep. Yet, as critics point out, Aadhaar is already demanded for everything from bank accounts to mobile SIMs, why the uproar when it comes to voting? The ECI, for its part, keeps it optional, assuring no voter will be excluded for not linking. That stance, while diplomatic, leaves the core issue unresolved: voluntary measures will not catch every duplicate. The political stakes could not be higher. In West Bengal, where TMC faces a resurgent BJP, the duplicate EPIC scandal is a rallying cry. Banerjee’s claims of electoral manipulation, outsiders ferried in to vote with bogus IDs, echo a narrative of systemic sabotage. The Quint reports her pointing to this as a prelude to the 2026 state elections, a warning shot to both the ECI and her rivals. Across the aisle, the BJP dismisses it as sour grapes, but the ECI’s admission lends credence to at least part of the opposition’s case: the system was not watertight. Meanwhile, overseas Indian voters, who pay taxes but often lack voter IDs or Aadhaar, add another layer of grievance. Why, they ask, cannot the system streamline identity for all citizens, wherever they reside? The ECI’s credibility is on trial here. Once hailed as a pillar of Indian democracy, it is now mocked as a 'caged parrot,' singing to the tune of political masters, an allusion to its perceived coziness with the ruling duo of BJP and its allies. That 2019 tweet, boasting of EPIC’s uniqueness, has come back to haunt it, exposing a gap between rhetoric and reality. The Handbook for Electoral Registration Officers, a dense ECI manual, lays out the process for issuing EPICs, but it is silent on how duplicates slipped through. Citizens like one exasperated X user, struggling for three months to correct a voter ID online, vent frustration at a bureaucracy that preaches digitization while stumbling over basics. 'No voter left behind,' the ECI proclaims, yet the reality feels more like 'no glitch left unexposed.' Could this be the tip of an iceberg? Theories swirl that BJP’s electoral victories, particularly in tight races, owe something to voter roll manipulation. Bogus IDs, duplicate voters, and lax oversight form a shadowy trinity in these accusations, though hard evidence remains elusive. The ECI’s defense, that duplicates do not equal fraud, holds water logically but not emotionally. Trust, once cracked, does not mend with press notes. Opposition leaders demand accountability, with some suggesting a return to ballot paper voting, a nostalgic but impractical fix in a digital age. Others, like legal minds cited on X, urge the Supreme Court to step in, arguing that only judicial oversight can force transparency and punish culprits. Let us weigh the options. The ECI’s ERONET upgrade is a start, promising unique IDs through better tech. It is less invasive than Aadhaar linking, sidestepping privacy debates, but its success hinges on execution, something the ECI’s track record now casts doubt on. Aadhaar, by contrast, offers a robust check, leveraging biometrics to root out overlaps. Yet, making it mandatory risks alienating voters and sparking lawsuits, while keeping it voluntary limits its reach. A hybrid approach, mandatory Aadhaar with ironclad data safeguards, might split the difference, but political will and public buy-in are shaky. For now, the ECI’s hurried note feels like a Band-Aid on a festering wound. The fallout is undeniable. Faith in institutions, already fragile in an era of polarized politics, takes another hit. The ECI, once a referee above the fray, now looks like a player caught off-guard. Opposition parties have a cause to rally around, but their boycott threats could backfire, alienating voters who want reform, not chaos. Civil society, from lawyers to activists, has a role to play, pushing for answers, not just outrage. And the public? They are left sifting through the noise, wondering if their vote, that sacred act, is as secure as they were told. In the end, this is not just about duplicate numbers, it is about what they symbolize: a system stretched thin, a democracy tested, and a trust betrayed. The ECI must do more than patch the holes; it needs to rebuild confidence with transparency, accountability, and perhaps a dash of humility. Linking EPIC to Aadhaar could be part of the fix, but only if paired with guarantees that privacy is not the price. As India barrels toward its next elections, the stakes are too high for half-measures. The dirty linen is out; now, it is time to clean it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJIHRyY6yUCqE	2025-03-08T18:21:31-08:00	
HHS Is Opposing Experimental Bird Flu ‘Vaccines’ For Poultry: USD...	Last week, I wrote about experimental 'vaccines' that the United States government has been working with pharmaceutical companies to develop — different ones for poultry and people. I asked if Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Brooke Rollins, both new to their jobs in February, would stand up against this and other aspects of 'the US government’s bird flu scheme ramped up during the previous presidential administration.' Here is an update. In a new interview at Fox Nation, Kennedy indicated that HHS opposes giving chickens the bird flu 'vaccine.' Kennedy stated: 'There’s no indication that those vaccines actually provide sterilizing immunity, and all three of my health agencies at NIH, CDC, and FDA — the acting heads of those agencies — have all recommended against the use of the bird flu vaccine.' This conclusion is supported, Kennedy stated, by the fact that 'the vaccine could actually promote antigenic shift, which means your turning those birds into mutant factories, and that could actually accelerate the jump [of the bird flu] to human beings.' The catch, though, is that the authority over this in regard to poultry raised in America largely resides in the USDA. Therefore, it is important what Rollins decides. So far, she seems to be 'on the vaccine train' as was her predecessor in the Joe Biden administration. On February 26, Rollin released the USDA’s Five-Pronged Approach to Address Avian Flu that includes substantial boosting of giving a bird flu 'vaccine' to poultry in its fourth of five sections. Here is that section: Explore Pathways toward Vaccines, Therapeutics, and Other Strategies for Protecting Egg Laying Chickens to Reduce Instances of Depopulation USDA will be hyper-focused on a targeted and thoughtful strategy for potential new generation vaccines, therapeutics, and other innovative solutions to minimize depopulation of egg laying chickens along with increased bio-surveillance and other innovative solutions targeted at egg laying chickens in and around outbreaks. Up to a $100 million investment will be available for innovation in this area. Importantly, USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Additionally, USDA will work alongside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure the public health and safety of any such approaches include considerations of tradeoffs between public health and infectious disease strategy. USDA will solicit public input on solutions, and will involve Governors, State Departments of Agriculture, state veterinarians, and poultry and dairy farmers on vaccine and therapeutics strategy, logistics, and surveillance. USDA will immediately begin holding biweekly discussions on this and will also brief the public on its progress biweekly until further notice. Will President Donald Trump step in to settle any disagreement between HHS and USDA on the matter? Notably, the USDA report also indicated that USDA will continue to back the mass slaughter of poultry in the name of countering bird flu, stating that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 'will continue to indemnify producers whose flocks must be depopulated to control the further spread of HPAI.' HPAI is short for highly pathogenic avian influenza — bird flu. As I wrote last week, Kennedy has in his early actions provided reason to expect that he would support ending US involvement in developing and promoting bird flu shots for people, something under the control of his department. He has yet to implement such a change. This article was published at Ron Paul Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJLjmhE2TKDTJ	2025-03-08T18:17:54-08:00	
Myanmar Junta Chief Says Election To Be Held By January 2026	Myanmar will hold parliamentary elections by January next year, the leader of the ruling military said, without setting a date for a vote that the generals who seized power in 2021 will be hoping will end widespread opposition to their grip on politics. The junta’s opponents say a vote under the military while the most popular politicians are locked up and their parties banned will be a sham. The junta is in control of only about half the country after significant losses to pro-democracy and ethnic minority insurgents fighting to end military rule. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing announced the timing of the election while on a visit to Belarus on Friday, the military-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported. 'The election is slated for December 2025, with the possibility of … January 2026,' the newspaper quoted Min Aung Hlaing as saying. There was no immediate comment from forces opposed to military rule but a parallel civilian government in exile, the National Unity Government, has previously dismissed the junta’s plan for an election as window-dressing to bolster the military’s legitimacy at home and abroad. Allied ethnic minority insurgent groups fighting for self-determination have also rejected an election under military rule. Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi – by far the most popular political leader in Myanmar – has been jailed since the military ousted her elected government on Feb. 1, 2021. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, which swept elections in 2015 and 2020, has been dissolved under military regulations and thousands of its members and supporters are in jail or have fled to rebel zones or into self-exile. China, which has major investments in Myanmar and is keen to see an end to its turmoil, supports the vote and has offered help to organize it, as have some of Myanmar’s Southeast Asian neighbors. Min Aung Hlaing, in a speech in Belarus, said 53 political parties had submitted paperwork to take part in the election. 'We also invite the observation teams from Belarus to come and observe,' he said. Voting is expected to be held in fewer than half of Myanmar’s 330 townships in the first phase of a staggered vote, a political party official said late last year after discussion with the election organizers. In Myanmar’s last election in 2020, voting was held in 315 out of the 330 townships. After Suu Kyi’s party swept the vote, as it did in a 2015 election, the army complained of cheating and overthrew her government. She has been jailed for 27 years. Election organizers said at the time there was no evidence of any significant cheating. Min Aung Hlaing was in Belarus after a visit to Russia where he held talks with President Vladimir Putin.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJHBLrZUSNRzZ	2025-03-08T18:14:00-08:00	
Germany’s Coalition Deal Inches Closer	By Bárbara Machado (EurActiv) -- Germany's Christian Democrats and Social Democrats are ready to start formal coalition negotiations, after exploratory talks ended positively. Christian Democrats (CDU) leader Friederich Merz, who won Germany's federal elections last month, told reporters on Saturday that preliminary talks on a future coalition with the SPD ended in agreement, Tagesschau reports. After exploratory talks, the conservatives and SPD agreed on a final paper, based on which negotiations can now start. According to Taggeschau, Merz said in Berlin that an agreement was reached on several issues, including migration and finance, topics that until now divided the groups. Formal negotiations to close a governing coalition can begin as early as next week, and should last until Easter.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJDDFtH9RotFd	2025-03-08T18:07:20-08:00	
Pray For A Peaceful Al-Aqsa Mosque – OpEd	Tens of thousands of Muslim worshipers prayed peacefully at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem on the first Friday of Ramadan despite fears of unrest due to tensions over the Gaza war. The Islamic Waqf, which manages the holy site, announced that some 90,000 people attended the Friday midday prayer. Israel had implemented safety restrictions at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's Old City during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. During Ramadan, over ninety thousand Palestinians came to pray at Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam that is located in East Jerusalem. This year Ramadan coincides with a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which has largely halted fighting after a devastating war that left many thousands dead in Israel and Gaza. Last year, amid the Gaza war, Israeli authorities imposed restrictions on visitors coming to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Only men aged 55 and older and women over 50 were allowed to enter the mosque compound for security reasons, while thousands of Israeli police officers were deployed across Jerusalem's Old City and no major violence occurred. By long standing convention, Jews are allowed to visit but not pray in the compound, which they revere as the site of their second temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD. The Israeli government has said repeatedly that it intends to uphold the status quo at the Mosque, but many Palestinian use fears about the future of the Mosque as a flashpoint for violence. Last year, Israel allowed Muslims to worship at Al-Aqsa Mosque in the same numbers as in the previous year despite the war raging in Gaza and no major violence occurred. There is open land on the Temple Mount, and a small Jewish house of worship 'hologram', which is a 3D projection created with lasers, could be built adjacent to the Dome of the Rock and 600 feet north of the Al-Aksa Mosque, provided that Muslims would agree to cooperate. Anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be important, and anyone who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions, 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, Jewish/Christian/Muslim agreements establishing world wide peace would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each Jewish-Christian-Muslim community could consider its leadership to be essentially Messianic, Indeed, such Jewish/Christian/Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its own leadership to be essential Messianic aids as is foretold: 'Saviors [plural] will come up on mount Zion' (Prophet Obadiah 1:21) and this would fulfill the culminating verses of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy as enlarged upon by Prophet Micah (4:3-5): 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him, for it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk, each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' If each people truly follows the best of its own religious teachings; the Messianic Age of world wide peace will surely have arrived, and then-and only then-will the Jerusalem Temple of Solomon be rebuilt, and God's Holy Kingdom established on earth. A total of 51,600 deaths in Gaza were reported by the UN, as of January 14, 2025, including 7,000 from natural causes and 2,000 killed by Hamas. War-related fatalities were: 22,600 civilians and 20,000 combatants for a civilian/combatant ratio: ~1:1 The writer, a board member of Honest Reporting, has closely reviewed the data for 15 months. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib says, 'From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.' I say we can make it truly aspirational by making it focus on both people first and the land second. 'From the river to the sea Palestinians and Israelis should be freed of hatred and suffering by 'a two state for two peoples sharing of the land peacefully solution.'' As the Qur'an states: 'Good and evil deeds are not equal. Repel evil with what is better; then you will see that one who was once your enemy has become your dearest friend...' (41:34) And as the Qur'an states: ''Believers, be steadfast in the cause of God and bear witness with justice. Do not let your enmity for others turn you away from justice. Deal justly; that is nearest to being God-fearing.' (5:8)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJCUZlNZE-2vR	2025-03-08T18:05:06-08:00	
Trump Confident Putin Wants Peace Despite ‘Bombing The Hell Out O...	By Jeff Seldin Russia’s latest aerial barrage against targets in Ukraine is not dampening expectations by U.S. President Donald Trump that he can broker a deal to end the fighting between Moscow and Kyiv. Ukrainian officials Friday accused Russia of launching more than 200 overnight missile and drone strikes against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure across a broad swath of the nation, hitting targets in five regions while damaging residential buildings and injuring residents. But Trump, speaking to reporters Friday in the Oval Office, said he takes Russian President Vladimir Putin at his word when Putin says he wants peace. 'I believe him. I think we're doing very well with Russia,' Trump said, acknowledging that for the moment 'they're bombing the hell out of Ukraine.' 'He’s doing what anybody else would do,' the U.S. president said of Putin. 'I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.' Trump also expressed continued frustration with Kyiv. 'I'm finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine. They don’t have the cards,' he told reporters. When asked if the United States would consider giving Ukraine additional air defenses, Trump said it depended on Ukraine. 'I have to know that they want to settle. I don’t know that they want to settle,' he said. 'If they don't want to settle, we're out of there because we want them to settle.' Other U.S. officials, meanwhile, have pushed back against the notion that Trump’s tactics to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table — which has included a pause on military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv — have made Ukraine more vulnerable. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told Fox News late Thursday that the pause on intelligence sharing is designed only to prevent Ukraine from launching offensive operations against Russia. 'Any intelligence going toward defending Ukraine against attacks coming into their country would continue,' Gabbard said. A U.S. defense official Friday confirmed to VOA that there has been no pause on intelligence that would allow Ukraine to defend itself, adding that Ukraine also maintains access to Starlink, the satellite internet system owned by Trump ally Elon Musk. As for the overnight attack by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted on social media that many of the drones were taken out by antiaircraft defenses. He said that for the first time, French-made Mirage fighter jets were deployed in air defense, and that U.S-made F-16s were also used. Zelenskyy, in a statement on his X social media account Friday, said that despite the Russian attacks, Kyiv is committed to seeking peace. 'Intense work with President Trump’s team has been ongoing at various levels — numerous calls,' he wrote. 'The topic is clear — peace as soon as possible, security as reliably as possible. Ukraine is fully committed to a constructive approach.' In a separate statement on Telegram, however, Zelenskyy expressed frustration with Moscow. 'Every day, new Russian attacks and reality itself prove that it is Russia that must be forced to make peace — to stop the war, to engage in real diplomacy,' he said, according to a translation of his comments. The latest barrage of Russian missiles and the responses from the U.S. and Ukraine come as Zelenskyy plans to travel to Saudi Arabia Monday for meetings with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss a possible ceasefire with Russia. The meeting would be the first between Zelenskyy and U.S. officials since the Ukrainian leader’s contentious White House meeting last week with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, as reporters looked on. Earlier this week in a letter sent to Trump, Zelenskyy said the way the meeting went was 'regrettable' and Ukraine was 'ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible.' VOA’s Patsy Widakuswara and Jeff Custer contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJDwEB3BCQvc6	2025-03-08T18:00:12-08:00	
Cutting Off Terror’s Lifeline – OpEd	Yet once again, a troubled geopolitical landscape in Afghanistan has become the focus of international attention. The fears were revived that nation could once again become a fertile breeding ground for global terrorism since the U.S. withdrew in 2021. The development of this crisis hinges on the deeply disturbing fact that donations of humanitarian and monetary aid meant to assist Afghanistan’s civilian population are being used to perpetuate terrorist networks. U.S. legislators, however, have rose up rising to the situation in the form of the ‘No Taxpayer Funding for Terrorists Act’—a legislative move that aims at reconstructing the United States approach in providing aid for than the Taliban has profited with the help of international help. The financial leakage is overwhelmingly high. The United Nations and non-governmental organizations, according to reports, receive roughly $40 million a week in U.S. aid to flow into Afghanistan’s Central Bank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has confirmed that the transfers to these funds are ostensibly earmarked for humanitarian relief, but the Taliban regime withdraws nearly $10 million from these transfers in tribute to the oppressive governance it implements — and to its army of influence including Al-Qaeda and ISIS-K. This diversion points to a depressing paradox: well-intended aid is in fact subsidizing precisely the perpetrators of violence and instability for whom the world’s most severe humanitarian crisis is desperately needed. A further tactic of Taliban’s strategic co-opting of international aid channels and stealing the goodwill of the greater global sympathy is that it leaves Afghan citizens caught between their deprivation and terror. Senator Tim Sheehy’s legislation is aimed at cutting this lifeline. The law, called ‘The ‘No Taxpayer Funding for Terrorists Act’, introduced by Congressman Tim Burchett, prevents U.S. financial aid to Afghanistan under current oversight guidelines, a status critics say creates loopholes and easy avenues for them to funnel money in. Wading into unfamiliar territory with a change of face to the Taliban has given momentum to the bill that previously languished in Senate committees. The sort of hardening consensus reflected by the act, with robust support in the House, is that America’s $2.35 billion per year in aid to Afghanistan should entail stringent safeguards or outright cessation to avoid further infiltration by malign actors. By pushing further, Sheehy pursues a broader Biden administration strategy to recalibrate counterterrorism to financial attrition through economic erosion of the economic infrastructure supporting extremist operations. Nevertheless, there’s dissent among lawmakers. It is humanitarian organizations that warn about the potential increase in Afghanistan’s crises, as the 28 million people there rely on external aid for their very survival. Afghans survive on 3$ a day and there is rampant food insecurity and collapsing healthcare systems, says the UN estimates, 97 percent live in poverty. They argue that isolating the Taliban economically would merely expose it to collective punishment, further destabilize the area and help radicalization. However, proponents say it is necessary to suspend the system because the current aid arrangement is not transparent enough to prevent abuse and it should only resume when clear safeguards are in place. What you have here is this idea of dichotomy, moral obligations to civilians being soothed against this imperative of neutralising the existential threats, this is the ethical dilemma of modern counter terrorism. The U.S.’s stance also represents a drastic change in foreign policy from a reactive military to a pre-emptive financial containment. Washington is targeting revenue streams to tear down terrorism’s economic underpinnings, a tactic adopted around the world after it was proven successful in forcing melancholy on Iran and North Korea. This approach forces Afghanistan to rely on multilateral collaboration to shut down the banking operations of Taliban financed institutions and facilitate aid through other delivery mechanisms, either through direct partnerships at the grassroots level or via secure digital platforms. The problem involves not only fashioning a method neither entirely leaving Afghan civilians nor stiffening up at their oppressors but doing so with diplomatic delicacy and technological flair. Following Recommendations Build up a NATO, EU and UN partner team to develop a unified task force to audit aid disbursement and implement tough accountability protocols. The aid should proceed through decentralized ledgers in real time to bypass Taliban controlled channels. Imposing secondary sanctions against foreign entities that engage with Taliban linked businesses to disrupt illicit financing related to narcotics, mining, or taxation. Work with neighbouring countries Pakistan and Uzbekistan to agree on an aid route on the border managed by trusted NGOs and international observers. Public and diplomatic pressure on to delegitimize the Taliban’s governance, amplify the voices of Afghan civil society through international platforms.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJH4RBoSl11hh	2025-03-08T17:52:57-08:00	
Pakistan And Azerbaijan: Strengthening Bilateral Cooperation – Op...	Recently, Pakistan and Azerbaijan have signed several agreements and Memorandums of understandings (MoUs) to boost bilateral cooperation in their trade as well as energy sectors. The visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Baku proved to be a watershed visit where he held productive exchange of views with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. These things are the beginning of a good and strategic partnership to the two countries. The agreements mark a milestone in the transformation of Pakistan Azerbaijan relations to much more substantive economic cooperation than what has been possible by limited traditional diplomatic ties. However, the most important of all agreements includes the act of increasing bilateral investments to $2 billion through projects which will be beneficial to both parties. Beyond showing Azerbaijan’s confidence in Pakistan’s economic potential, this financial commitment helps boost Pakistan’s readiness as a profitable investment location. These collaborative efforts will be upgraded further with the signing of formal agreements during the upcoming visit of President Aliyev to Pakistan. The next important development in this context is the MoU signed between the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organization (FWO) and Pakistan State Oil (PSO). The MoU outlines collaborative efforts in association with Machike Thallian Tarujabba White Oil Pipeline Project- a strategic initiative to augment Pakistan’s energy security and reducing of transportation cost. The project will hold significant importance in ensuring easy transportation of oil and its use for the sake of progress of Pakistan’s industrial and economic landscape. In the tourism and education fields, outside the energy field, there is more long-term profit that can be derived. These sectors where the MoUs have been inked will encourage cultural exchange, educational cooperation and will help to strengthen the people to people ties between the two nations. Both Pakistan and Azerbaijan have a rich cultural history, and the scenery are beautiful, and these agreements will pave new ways for students, professionals, and investors to come and enjoy it as well as academic and tourism collaboration. In addition, the agreements further focused on strengthening the bilateral defense ties. Pakistan and Azerbaijan have agreed to produce defense equipment in joint manufacturing, that has economic and strategic importance. JF 17 Thunder fighter jet sale to Azerbaijan is a fulfillment of Pakistan’s growing ability to produce defense production and confidence of the international community of Pakistan defense manufacturing capabilities. Besides increasing Pakistan’s defense exports, this deal fortifies Azerbaijan’s military capabilities. In fact, Pakistan’s struggle to overcome its long-standing energy shortages is a long fought battle. But the recent agreements with Azerbaijan come at a turning point. Smooth flow of oil shall be taken care of in White Oil Pipeline and for greater flexibility in procuring energy supply agreements of LNG are given. Consequently, Pakistan would be able to cut down financial burden on its foreign exchange reserves, to procure energy in a manner which is sustainable and cost effective. Now, the economic collaboration between Pakistan and Azerbaijan also reflects the improvement taking place in Pakistan’s business environment. Azerbaijan’s plan to invest in Pakistan is a result of the country’s increasing attractiveness as investment destination as the government is focusing on policy reforms and ease of doing business. Currently the two countries conduct trade worth $55 million in total, yet with the newly signed agreements and development projects, the trade volume between two countries is expected to cross $2 billion within the next few years. This is milestone in the economic growth and regional integration of Pakistan. Additionally, both Pakistan and Azerbaijan hold significant geostrategic importance. Both Pakistan is a gateway to South Asia and the Middle East and so is Azerbaijan bridging Europe and Central Asia. Increased trade and connectivity between the two countries will enhance their economic cooperation as both strengthen the performance of regional economies at large. The partnership portends a model of regional economic collaboration particularly amongst the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states. The agreements also fit into Pakistan’s long-term aspirations to diversify its energy sources. As a player in the oil and gas sector, Azerbaijan is an apt partner to help Pakistan transit to a sustainable energy future. The ventures on LNG and pipeline projects will allow technological advancements and expertise to enter Pakistan for the benefits of the energy infrastructure. Moreover, Pakistan’s emerging manufacturing industry is also recognized worldwide as Azerbaijan continues buying Pakistan defense products. This is an indication of the country’s capacity to generate high quality exports of goods and the country being a strong player in defense industry as well as the world industrial fields. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor in conjunction with these new trade agreements, is locking Pakistan into a position as a trade hub to South and Central Asia. The Pakistan – Azerbaijan agreements strengthen this position by adding further to infrastructure and logistical and investment channels.

Iran Rules Out Talks With US Under Maximum Pressure	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Tehran won’t hold any negotiations about its nuclear program with the US as long as the Trump administration applies its 'maximum pressure' policy. Iran will maintain talks with other negotiators but will not engage with the US under Trump's approach of ramping up sanctions, Araqchi said in an interview with AFP in Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah on Friday. AFP: Is Iran prepared to reopen negotiations with the US on its nuclear program? Araqchi: We will not enter any direct negotiations with the US so long as they continue their maximum pressure policy and their threats but it doesn't mean that regarding our nuclear program, we will not negotiate with other parties; we are talking with the three European countries, we are negotiating with Russia and China, other members of the JCPOA, and these talks can continue and I think we can reach a result from this path too. As long as the US government continues its pressure, we will also continue our resistance. If America wants to return to a new nuclear agreement with Iran, naturally it should observe the conditions of a fair and just negotiation and we have proven that we will not answer the language of pressure and threat but will respond to the language of respect and dignity as we did in the past. Regarding our nuclear program, I repeat, we are currently engaged in negotiations with the three European countries. We are in close consultation with Russia and China, and we are continuing our discussions with other countries that are interested. It is natural that our points of view will be conveyed by these countries to the American government. AFP: How do you respond to Israel's threat to attack Iran's nuclear program? Araqchi: Look, first of all, Iran's nuclear program cannot be destroyed through military operations, for several reasons. The first reason is that this is a technology that we have achieved, and the technology is in the brains and cannot be bombed. Second, Iran's nuclear facilities are scattered in many different parts of the country and are properly protected, and we are sure that they cannot be destroyed. Third, we have the ability to respond very strongly and in a completely proportionate and balanced manner. The Israelis themselves know, and others in the region know, that any action taken against Iran will be followed by a similar action against Israel. Therefore, I think that the threat of war against Iran is a threat that is just talked about. Implementing this threat would be a very big danger and would turn into a widespread fire. I think that if the Israelis or others were sure that they would achieve their goals through a military attack, they would have done so by now, but such a possibility is not feasible. I believe that if an attack on Iran were to take place, this attack could turn into a widespread fire in the region; not that we will do that. It is Israel's desire to involve the other countries in the region in a war. It is Israel's desire to draw America into a war. This is precisely an Israeli plan to drag America into war, and America is extremely vulnerable if it enters a war in the region. They themselves know this. I think that both Israel and America and others are fully aware of our capabilities, and therefore, if rationality prevails, even the permission for threatening Iran should not be given, let alone an actual military attack. AFP: Turkey has accused Iran of using militias to destabilize other countries. How do you respond? Araqchi: I don't think anyone doubts that the developments in Syria were directly influenced by Turkey and a few other countries, and therefore the problems that have arisen now, such as the widespread occupation of Syrian territory by Israel, the destruction of all of Syria's defense and scientific infrastructure by Israel, and all of the conflicts that exist, naturally, the responsibility lies with those who carried out these changes and developments. However, this does not mean that we are in conflict with Turkey; no, we will continue our friendly relations and continue our consultations on regional issues. AFP: Will Iran establish ties with the new Syrian government? Araqchi: There are many illegal groups in Syria, some of which are still on the UN list of terrorist groups. The policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is quite clear. We want stability and peace in Syria. We want to preserve the territorial integrity of Syria. We want to preserve the territorial unity of Syria and oppose the division of Syria. We want an end to the foreign occupation in Syria. We want the progress and development of the Syrian people. Finally, we want the formation of an inclusive government in Syria. Any military confrontation with the people, any incident that leads to the death of people, and any military conflict that destabilizes Syria are condemned in our opinion and must be prevented. The Islamic Republic of Iran is currently only an observer of Syrian issues; we have no relationship with the current Syrian government, and we are not in a hurry in this regard. However, we hope that the developments in Syria will move towards an inclusive popular government, and we hope that all illegal groups whose work has led to the instability in Syria will return to the rule of law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJE3v2dZmQm4T	2025-03-08T17:47:06-08:00	
Three Scenarios For The War In Ukraine – Analysis	By Can Kasapoğlu Battlefield Assessment Last week both sides won modest tactical gains. But no strategic changes altered the map significantly. In eastern Ukraine, areas adjacent to Pokrovsk saw continued intensive combat, while the southern theater was relatively calm. In occupied Kherson, the Ukrainian Separate 14th Regiment successfully targeted a Russian training ground with cluster munitions. In Ukraine’s north, near Kharkiv, Russia conducted air and missile strikes. The Russian military continued to suffer more than 1,000 casualties per day, and Ukraine carried out multiple loitering munitions salvos targeting the Russian hydrocarbon network. Kursk was a notable exception to the general battlefield stasis. Russia has been pushing hard in Kursk following the return of North Korean servicemen to combat operations. Alarmingly, the Ukrainian military lost 15 to 20 square miles in less than a week. Ukrainian defense intelligence officials announced that they have been tracking a serious hike in Russian drone proliferation efforts, with the joint Russia-Iran drone plant in the Russian Republic of Tatarstan boosting production capacity. According to other Ukrainian officials, the Russian military has long sought to achieve the capability to launch 500 drones at Ukraine in a single salvo, a dangerous strike pattern if it can be realized. The increase in Russia’s drone production is an important trend that this report will continue to monitor. Three Scenarios for the Future of the Conflict in Ukraine While the conflict in Ukraine continues to evolve and the diplomatic picture remains dynamic, three possible outcomes seem most likely. Scenario 1: Managed Decline The first plausible outcome is that Ukraine manages to stabilize the front lines through tactical withdrawals in the face of mounting losses. In this scenario, the Ukrainian military continues to demonstrate resilience despite its declining capabilities and the rupture in Kyiv’s partnership with the United States. Nonetheless, Ukraine would need to withdraw its forces from Kursk to augment defensive operations at home, costing Kyiv invaluable leverage. Ukraine would endure a slow decline in its military capabilities while forestalling collapse. Ukraine’s domestic drone proliferation edge and extensive antipersonnel and anti-armor mine capabilities would help it stabilize the front. Yet it would continue to face challenges from manpower shortages. Kyiv’s indigenous loitering munitions and hybrid weapons would help it target Russian energy and defense hubs. But Russian, North Korean, and Iranian weapons would continue to pound Ukrainian cities, where the Ukrainian military would have to prioritize protecting high-value targets. This scenario would likely involve continued deterioration in bilateral security and defense ties between Washington and Kyiv, but not a rapid halt in arms flows. Pending arms transfers already in the pipeline would continue, particularly under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a framework that has created new contracts between Kyiv and American defense suppliers. Under this scenario arms flows to Ukraine could continue until 2028, though likely dropping below $1 billion in volume by the second quarter of 2027. This would mean the battlefield geometry in Ukraine would remain largely the same. Still, losing control over its territory in Kursk would deprive Kyiv of critical diplomatic leverage to negotiate a return of its Russian-occupied territories. Scenario 2: The Worst Case In the second plausible scenario for the future of the conflict, Russian and North Korean fighters overpower Ukraine with a massive surge, attaining a decisive force-on-force ratio in multiple sectors. In the absence of US military aid and intelligence support, Ukraine faces serious setbacks in its defensive combat operations. Kyiv is forced to surrender, and European nations offer only diplomatic gestures. This is no doubt a worst-case scenario for Ukraine. In the absence of American intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assistance at the strategic and operational levels, Ukraine would face catastrophic personnel losses. Without sufficient support, Russia could break Ukraine’s defensive lines and force its government to capitulate—the original political aim of Russia’s full-scale invasion. In this scenario, North Korean troops would play a decisive role in turning the tide for Russia. The US Defense Intelligence Agency has concluded that the bulk of Pyongyang’s combat formations in Kursk belong to North Korea’s 11th Corps, a strategic force trained to open a second front in a conventional conflict or attack an enemy’s rear area. According to the South Korean intelligence service, this North Korean contingent recently resumed combat operations in Kursk following a rotation period. In a worst-case scenario, North Korea could increase its force size from division-level to corps-level and begin to fight on Ukrainian territory, rather than just in Kursk. Russia could initiate another limited mobilization effort in the meantime. Together with forces from North Korea, such an effort could add between 300,000 and 350,000 troops to the 580,000 to 620,000 servicemen Russia has already deployed in Ukraine and Kursk. Ukraine’s forces number roughly 800,000, but only one-fourth of this force has been sent to direct combat roles on the front lines. The force-on-force ratio between Ukrainian and Russian troop concentrations already favors the invader at varying proportions in different sectors, ranging from 1:2 to 1:6. A Russian and North Korean force-generation push would make things even worse for Ukraine. Sadly, Europe’s defense industry is not in a position to support Ukraine in a prolonged conflict where Russia and its allies can ramp up production at will. The European Union, following extensive discussions, aims to boost its annual artillery production to 2 million rounds in 2025. Yet North Korea alone can produce the same amount in peacetime. Pyongyang has delivered up to 6 million rounds to the Russian military in two years, hinting at its wartime production capacity. Russia’s annual round-production capacity is believed to be somewhere between 3 million rounds and 4.5 million rounds for principal guns. Türkiye, which is in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but not the EU, is the only European nation that produces multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS). European nations largely rely on American M-270 and M-142 HIMARS systems, though some turn to Israel or South Korea for stopgap procurements. Europe also lags in the production of air and missile defense interceptors, a troubling trend while Russia hammers Ukraine with Iran-made drones. Since September 2024 Russia has launched at least 1,000 Shahed drones per month. November 2024 and January 2025 each saw over 2,500 loitering munitions launched at Ukrainian population centers. American-made Patriot systems have been the primary long-range and high-altitude layer of Ukraine’s surface-to-air missile defenses. While the European SAMP/T could theoretically replace the American Patriot, the European solution has a more focused design that aims at ballistic missiles and aircraft but lacks the Patriot’s ability to target broad-spectrum threats from drones to cruise missiles. Intercepting drones does not require the use of long-range SAMs. But these robotic systems complicate the air picture and overwhelm layered air defenses, paving the way for follow-on ballistic missile and cruise missile salvos. More important, the Patriot has a larger market share and a more substantial production capacity for its PAC-2 and PAC-3 interceptors. Moreover, the Patriot is the only reliable weapons system Kyiv has against high-hypersonic aeroballistic missiles like the Russian Kinzhal. Given its air defense challenges, Ukraine needs a constant flow of Patriot interceptors to protect its skies. In a collapse scenario, Ukraine’s manpower shortages and difficulty stabilizing the front would only exacerbate its air defense troubles. Major breaches in Ukrainian lines of defense in the east and a successful Russian push on various flashpoints like Pokrovsk could spell doom for Ukraine. In this scenario, the Kremlin could force Kyiv to capitulate. Ukraine could be compelled to swallow a partial demilitarization and the loss of almost 20 percent of its territory. NATO and its member states would not legally recognize this outcome, but in the absence of credible US deterrents, the de facto arrangement could quickly become the status quo. Scenario 3: The Best Case The final possible scenario for the future of Ukraine is a significant shift in the conflict’s dynamics. It would see a revival of US-Ukraine relations, marked by the signing of a valuable minerals deal and the introduction of new indigenous and foreign loitering munitions systems and drone-missile hybrid weapons to drastically enhance Ukraine’s long-range strike capabilities. In this scenario, systematic Ukrainian attacks continue to damage Russian hydrocarbon revenues. The Ukrainian occupation of Kursk deepens and stabilizes. US-led diplomatic pressure prompts Russia’s political leadership to discuss a comprehensive ceasefire, including a territorial swap. Ukraine retains near-ally status with NATO and faces no restrictions in keeping its military capacity in the aftermath of the war. This scenario, if realized, could significantly alter Ukraine’s future—and the Kremlin’s geopolitical orientation. This would require a revival of bilateral ties between Washington and Kyiv. A minerals deal between the two countries would catalyze Western investment opportunities in Ukraine, creating a tangible deterrent against further Russian escalation. In the meantime, the Ukrainian military would continue to benefit from the nation’s growing defense industries, which have gradually integrated themselves into the West’s defense technological and industrial base. Ukraine’s developing drone and missile warfare prowess would inflict unbearable damage on Russian energy and defense industrial targets. NATO members would make clear that they would not tolerate tactical nuclear action from the Russian military in Europe. Emboldened by lucrative arms deals with Washington in return for valuable resources and boosted European defense assistance funds, Ukraine would deepen its territorial gains in Kursk. In this final scenario, the Kremlin could agree to a comprehensive ceasefire deal following American diplomatic efforts. Ukrainian and Russian diplomats could consider a swap of occupied territory. A multi-brigade European security assurance force could deploy to Ukrainian territory, and Ukraine could gain host-nation status for the NATO Force Model.

Counterterrorism Shortcomings In Mali, Burkina Faso, And Niger – ...	By Michael DeAngelo Policy Problem (FPRI) -- As the global epicenter of Salafi-jihadi activity, the Sahel in 2023 accounted for 26 percent of global terrorist attacks, which caused 47 percent of terrorist-related deaths. Burkina Faso is ranked as the country most affected by terrorism in the world, followed by Mali in third place and Niger in tenth. Both would be one spot higher if not for Hamas’s October 2023 attacks in Israel. These standings show the prevalence and lethality of jihadist groups in the Sahel. The situation has not always been this dire. After Malian and French security forces regained control of northern Mali from jihadists in 2014, terrorist attacks were infrequent. There was little evidence of insurgencies until 2016. However, jihadist activity rose steadily from 2017 until 2021, and since 2021, jihadist attacks have doubled and resulting deaths have tripled. Mali has little control over its northern regions and is constantly contested in its central regions. Jihadist groups control or contest over half of Burkina Faso. In all three countries, jihadists are encircling areas closer to the capitals. Attacks have spread to coastal countries Benin, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire. Thus, jihadist groups have reconstituted since their 2014 setback to wage escalating insurgencies and conduct complex terrorist attacks. Origins The sources of the current insurgencies are ethnic tensions and weak governments. The Sahel is very diverse, which creates competing interests; several ethnic groups make their livelihoods in ways that conflict with each other. For example, many Fulani, a primarily Muslim ethnic group residing throughout West Africa, rely on livestock herding, which often leads to conflicts with groups that rely on agriculture such as the Dogon and Mossi. This has caused the oppression of some groups at the hands of others, which sometimes is either ignored or encouraged by their governments. Therefore, parts of the population distrust the government’s intentions, a view furthered by the government’s inability to provide basic services. Sahelian governments have historically taken an elite-centric approach, developing capitals while neglecting rural areas. This has created ungoverned spaces where the government is not present, especially in border areas. A variety of criminal and insurgent groups render these areas insecure. Thus, the populations in many areas outside of the capitals view their government as indifferent and, when it is present, ineffective and ill-intentioned. Jihadist groups view this shortcoming as an opportunity to control territory by providing security and governance. With the drivers of the jihadist insurgencies in place, the Libyan and Malian civil wars sparked them beginning in 2011 and 2012. Armed Tuareg, a primarily Muslim, pastoralist ethnic group historically marginalized in the Sahel, began pushing Malian security forces out of northern Mali in early 2012. An assortment of jihadist groups both directly and loosely affiliated with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb opportunistically joined the fight. A massive proliferation of arms smuggled from unguarded Libyan depots after Muammar Qaddafi’s fall aided them. Jihadist groups quickly assumed control of territory and established a proto-caliphate that included the regional capital, Timbuktu. They provided security and governance, complete with justice and education systems. When French and Malian security forces pushed them out during Operation Serval (2013–14), jihadist groups spent multiple years regrouping in ungoverned spaces like the cross-border areas of Mali, Niger, and Algeria. They accessed arms easily and recruited militants from still-marginalized ethnic groups. They funded their activity through crimes such as drug and contraband smuggling and kidnapping; ransom payment is one of their primary sources of income. They increased attacks throughout 2015 and 2016, eventually beginning another insurgency. JNIM vs. ISSP The wide range of jihadist groups consolidated in 2017, becoming Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM)—the Support Group for Islam and Muslims—and pledging allegiance to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and al-Qaeda central. This merger formalized ties between groups and increased their geographical reach to Burkina Faso and Niger. The U.S. Department of State subsequently designated JNIM as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018. One of the merged groups is Katiba Macina, and a closely affiliated group is Ansarul Islam; both are Fulani-dominated, the former operating in central Mali and the latter in Burkina Faso. The inclusion of the Fulani is vital, as they are populous but have been historically marginalized across the Sahel due to their pastoralism. This has put them in conflict with sedentary farming communities. While JNIM is still led and heavily influenced by the Tuareg, it is more diverse and decentralized than the groups in 2012. This allows it to navigate ethnic tensions and recruit more broadly from the population of the Sahel. The other predominant jihadist group is the Islamic State–Sahel Province (ISSP). Formed from JNIM splinter groups, ISSP pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after he declared an Islamic State caliphate. The U.S. Department of State also designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018. Although JNIM initially remained the primary jihadist actor in the Sahel, ISSP has drastically increased its activity since 2020; this is why it was recently named an Islamic State province. Both groups have the same goals: to eliminate secular and Western influence, and to establish an Islamist state in West Africa. However, differences between their central organizations have disrupted collaboration and caused conflict. Al-Qaeda favors a localized approach to jihad that can bridge ethnic tensions and gradually implement Islamic law. The Islamic State favors a universal approach that targets alleged non-believers and rapidly implements maximalist Islamic law. ISSP has justified 'war' against JNIM due to the latter’s 'apostate leaders,' specifically when it comes to their more permissive approach to civilians and Christians. Conflict has been sporadic; in late 2023, ISSP pushed JNIM out of the Menaka region of Mali. They are both prevalent in the tri-border area of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. JNIM is more prevalent in Mali and Burkina Faso, while ISSP is so in Niger. Thus, JNIM and ISSP are waging simultaneous insurgencies that clash intermittently. A Strategy of Insurgency While these jihadists are often portrayed as terrorists in Western media, they are primarily insurgents who employ terrorism tactically. If they had a strategy of terrorism, jihadists would mostly target civilians; their goal would be to shock the government into a policy change, provoke repression, or instigate political and societal disorder. Instead, their activity is aligned with a strategy of insurgency; they mainly target security forces with the goal of controlling territory and governing. Jihadists target security forces using a variety of means, including ambushes, base raids, and the use of improvised explosive devices. By increasing the human and resource costs of holding territory, they compel security forces to limit their activities or pull out altogether. For example, there are hardly any security forces present in the problematic tri-border area of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger anymore. Since 2014, jihadists have avoided large-scale, conventional battles for control of population centers. However, this does not mean they are satisfied with controlling mostly rural areas. Rather, they besiege the centers to gradually pressure and delegitimize security forces at little cost to themselves. JNIM has done this in Timbuktu since August 2023, while ISSP has done so in Menaka since May 2023. They are taking a lower-risk, long-term approach; their goal is to drive out security forces and persuade a weary population to accept their governance. In areas that jihadist groups control or contest, they move quickly to establish forms of governance. Their activities include levying taxes, regulating and controlling businesses, operating courts, and providing services like education and healthcare. Because many areas did not have effective or any government presence, civilians often view jihadist groups as more just and effective than the government. Most terrorist attacks are meant to coerce civilians or undermine the government in localities jihadist groups control or hope to control. JNIM targets events, offices, schools, and infrastructure if it believes the target is in violation of its Islamist beliefs. It also targets civilians suspected of collaborating with the government. JNIM balances governance by fear with localized governance; it wants to be perceived as a just, responsive governing entity by civilians. In practice, this consists of co-opting local leaders and promoting cohesion between ethnic groups by arbitrating disputes. In exchange, they adhere to broader JNIM directives. This arrangement helps JNIM’s recruitment because it is viewed as a protector of marginalized groups. ISSP relies on governance by fear, coercing civilians to adhere to its maximalist Islamist beliefs. This is done through public demonstrations of force, including executions and amputations. The emphasis on force has attracted Fulanis seeking reprisals against ethnic militias, including those affiliated with the Dogon and Mossi. Jihadists have also conducted traditional terrorist attacks in the Sahel and coastal West Africa, including bombing hotels frequented by Westerners. This contributes to their goal of eliminating Western influence because it intimidates Westerners and related businesses. It also draws attention to the worldwide cause of their parent organizations, al-Qaeda and ISIS. More attention can attract more recruits and fundraising. However, jihadist groups are not relying on terrorist attacks to overthrow Sahelian governments or induce concessions to establish an Islamist state. That is what their insurgencies are intended to do. Significance These escalating insurgencies pose a threat to several actors, chiefly Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. They have ceded substantial territory to jihadists and do not control swaths of their countries. The deteriorating situation has caused economic hardship in the already underdeveloped countries, along with forced displacement, human rights violations, and increasing violence around population centers. It has also contributed to political instability; each country has experienced military coups at least partially inspired by the perception that the government cannot provide security. As jihadists take control of key roads, capitals are now under threat of attack and siege. If the insurgencies continue gaining strength at their current rate, they will be positioned to force the government out of population centers. This would render these countries collapsed states and allow jihadist groups to establish an Islamist state. Thus, the insurgencies encompass the key sectors of Sahelian countries: security, governance, and development. The insurgencies also pose an increasing transnational threat, particularly to countries in West Africa. Jihadist groups are not just interested in the Sahel; JNIM has expanded its activity to Benin, Togo, and Côte D’Ivoire. JNIM and ISSP have recruited militants from these countries, as well as Ghana, Mauritania, and Senegal, by appealing to ethnic groups like the Fulani. Jihadist groups spread the message that they protect marginalized groups through targeted media campaigns beyond the Sahel. Because other West African countries share challenges with their Sahelian neighbors—ethnic tensions, ineffective governance, underdevelopment—jihadist groups might be able to export their insurgencies if they continue to grow stronger in the Sahel. They have stated their intention to do so and will likely take advantage of any openings. In addition, Europe, the United States, and the international community are at risk. Terrorist attacks outside of the Sahel can benefit al-Qaeda and ISIS, to which JNIM and ISSP have allegiance despite their local focus. These Sahelian jihadist groups have threatened terrorist attacks on Western countries in the past and want to eliminate Western influence from West Africa, where attacks against Western assets and personnel have already been conducted. As jihadist groups control more territory, they have more resources at their disposal. This allows them to enhance their training, logistical capacity, and ability to conduct external attacks. Foreign militants have been traveling to the Sahel to train and fight with jihadist groups, especially ISSP. This is consistent with other Islamic State provinces like ISIS-Khorasan that have used their territory to train foreign militants to conduct external attacks. Because many foreign militants in the Sahel are from countries with established migration and smuggling routes to Europe, this is a clear threat. Moreover, the inability of the United States to control its southern border has attracted migrants from West Africa. Jihadists are involved in migration and smuggling routes, which increases the risk of militants infiltrating the United States. In conclusion, escalating jihadist insurgencies threaten to take control of Sahelian countries and destabilize West Africa. Their success only benefits worldwide al-Qaeda and Islamic State fundraising, recruitment, and operations. Counterterrorism Strategies To address the insurgencies, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have employed a strategy of counterterrorism. Of the three counterterrorism strategies a government can pursue—repression, decapitation, and persuasion—they have tried each simultaneously. However, they have relied on repression and decapitation, employing security forces to clear areas and kill and capture terrorists, especially the leaders. They have inconsistently employed persuasion, which can involve negotiations to reduce violence or to demobilize and splinter groups. It can also consist of policy measures to address drivers of terrorist activity, including lack of economic opportunity. One reason Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have failed to stop jihadists is because their counterterrorism strategy is unaligned with the reality of the insurgencies. It is not only a war of killing and capturing jihadists; it is a war of securing the population and providing effective governance to address the drivers of the insurgencies. Counterterrorism in Mali Mali has largely relied on the same approach since the proto-caliphate in northern Mali was overthrown in 2014, despite the consolidation and escalation of the insurgencies. From 2013 to 2014, Malian and French security forces waged conventional warfare to regain control of population centers. Jihadists had established a government but failed to defend it against Malian and French conventional weapons and tactics. They scattered to ungoverned spaces, especially in cross-border areas, from which they employed a strategy of terrorism for multiple years. In collaboration with Mali and other Sahelian countries, France rolled out Operation Barkhane in 2014 to hunt remnants of jihadist groups. Therefore, Mali pursued a strategy of repression and decapitation. Malian and French security forces, which combined to number 35,000–40,000 members, conducted raids and gathered intelligence to target jihadist leaders. Their aim was to disrupt jihadist groups with kill or capture operations so they could not reconstitute. The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), which consisted of 15,000 troops from a variety of African, Asian, and European countries, patrolled major roads and population centers to secure areas. The G5 Sahel Joint Force was formed between Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, and Mauritania in 2014 to conduct operations in cross-border areas. The counterterrorism strategy achieved tactical successes such as the killing of some senior leaders, but it did not prevent the reconstitution of jihadist groups. By 2016, they had transitioned from ungoverned spaces to more densely populated areas to launch insurgencies. Mali did not respond by overhauling its counterterrorism strategy or waging counterinsurgency. It doubled down on repression by allowing self-interested militias to conduct unsupervised operations against suspected jihadists, leading to ethnic reprisals. Excluding hostage release talks, Mali did not take any steps to negotiate with jihadist groups beyond declaring its openness to dialogue. In fact, it excluded them from the 2015 Algiers Accords, which ended the civil war. The insurgencies continued intensifying, as attacks and deaths of civilians and security forces rose sharply. Eventually, the military’s dissatisfaction over the escalating insurgencies combined with governance shortcomings to spur military coups in 2020 and 2021. However, the ruling junta’s policy changes have been reducing international support and intensifying repression. It removed Operation Barkhane and MINUSMA forces and pulled out of the G5 Sahel. The junta has repositioned units to the capital to consolidate its authority. What it lacks in manpower, it tries to make up for in coercion. The junta has significantly increased indiscriminate targeting during counterterrorism operations, negatively affecting civilians. The junta’s acceptance of a Wagner Group contingent has compounded this trend. The contingent of one thousand mercenaries conducts counterterrorism operations alongside Malian security forces. Four out of five people killed in Wagner operations have been civilians. This includes a March 2022 massacre in which Wagner and Malian security forces killed over five hundred civilians in central Mali. In 2022, Wagner and Malian security forces were responsible for 40 percent of violent civilian deaths. Intensified repression has coincided with strengthening insurgencies. Mali’s approach has failed because it is a counterterrorism strategy rather than a counterinsurgency one. Counterterrorism operations may subdue high-value targets or clear areas temporarily, but Malian and partner security forces have not held areas or prevented jihadist groups from regrouping. Consequently, jihadists have regrouped in ungoverned spaces after being pushed out of population centers. This is due to both manpower restraints over a vast geographic area and ineffective strategy. Counterterrorism operations are not coupled with efforts to establish effective governance, especially in rural areas. The same factors that contributed to the outbreak of the Malian civil war—ethnic marginalization and lack of basic services—remain unaddressed. Security force abuses have reinforced civilians’ belief that the government cannot protect its population. Jihadist groups have thereby sustained their insurgencies among a population distrustful of the government and susceptible to jihadist recruitment. Counterterrorism in Burkina Faso In response to the insurgencies, Burkina Faso has escalated its approach, although it still does not reflect a strategy of counterinsurgency. Unlike in Mali, insurgencies in Burkina Faso did not become an urgent security threat until 2018. This coincided with JNIM’s consolidation and ISSP’s emergence. Up to that point, Burkina Faso relied on Operation Barkhane forces, the G5 Sahel Joint Force, and U.S. military aid to decapitate jihadist groups and undertake limited repression through raids. Its security forces were small, consisting of roughly ten thousand members. As jihadists began infiltrating northern Burkina Faso from central Mali, Burkinabé security forces increased their presence in the affected provinces. By the end of 2019, though, deaths due to the insurgencies had increased over 700 percent from the previous year. Burkina Faso responded by forming a militia called Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (Volontaires pour la défense de la patrie, or VDP). The VDP is supposed to train and arm civilians of all ethnicities to defend their localities alongside traditional security forces. They are used for more than defense, however, also conducting offensive operations like raids. While the VDP is supposed to be inclusive, it has systematically excluded Fulani due to paranoia about their potential ties to jihadists. The VDP’s formation is representative of a shift toward widespread repression, as it mobilized the entire country to fight jihadists. Burkina Faso did allow localities to pursue short-term ceasefires with jihadist groups in 2020–21, which contributed to short-term reductions in violence. However, authorities did not renew these ceasefires, and the insurgencies have substantially worsened since. The deteriorating security situation added to preexisting dissatisfaction over government corruption and ineffectiveness to cause two military coups in 2022. The ruling junta has responded similarly to Mali’s, reducing international support and intensifying repression. It removed Operation Barkhane forces and pulled out of the G5 Sahel in 2023. To consolidate its authority, the junta repositioned units from northern and eastern regions that were fighting jihadists to the capital. To address the manpower deficit, the junta has relied more on the VDP and drones. The VDP has increased its ranks by roughly 50,000 militiamen, who collect intelligence and conduct raids and ambushes. The junta purchased drones from Turkey in 2022 and used them to attack suspected jihadists in areas inaccessible to security forces. Along with indiscriminate targeting during counterterrorism operations, these factors have caused a substantial number of civilian deaths. Symbolic of the junta’s intensified repression, an Africa Corps contingent of one hundred mercenaries representing the rebranded Wagner Group arrived in January 2024. While intensified repression has achieved limited tactical successes in killing and capturing jihadists and defending some localities, the insurgencies continue to escalate. Burkina Faso’s approach has failed because it has prioritized counterterrorism operations over addressing the drivers of the insurgencies. The insurgencies are not happening because Burkina Faso is failing to kill and capture enough jihadists; they spilled over from Mali due to the marginalization of ethnic groups like the Fulani and a lack of governance. Vulnerable civilians view jihadist groups as protectors who provide justice and services. Security force abuses and an anemic government presence in the tri-border area with Mali and Niger further this perception. While the junta has incorporated limited counterinsurgency by tasking the VDP with helping to hold areas, a lack of oversight and resources hampers the efforts. Consequently, they are not enough to close security and governance gaps that jihadists exploit. The short-term benefits of drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations will not make up for the governance deficit in the long term. Counterterrorism in Niger Niger is an outlier when compared to Mali and Burkina Faso, as it used a multi-faceted counterterrorism approach with some counterinsurgency methods to contain the insurgencies. Only after a military coup caused more by infighting than insecurity did Niger’s approach mirror Mali’s and Burkina Faso’s. This has coincided with worsening insurgencies. Until the fall of 2023, the insurgencies in Niger were at a relatively steady state. While there was a notable amount of jihadist activity in the tri-border area with Mali and Burkina Faso, it was mostly contained. Niger had employed a strategy of decapitation and limited repression. Niger benefitted from France’s reallocation of troops after their removal from Mali and Burkina Faso. Alongside the G5 Sahel Joint Force and several thousand Operation Barkhane and U.S. troops, Niger used its roughly 35,000 to 40,000 security force members to target jihadist leaders and conduct disciplined raids. Niger’s robust security force presence prevented the insurgencies from expanding beyond its tri-border regions. When combined with persuasion, this strategy helped Niger temporarily avoid the significant escalation experienced by Mali and Burkina Faso. The biggest difference between Niger and the other two countries was its use of persuasion to reduce violence and demobilize jihadists. When former President Mohamed Bazoum took office in 2021, he facilitated negotiations with jihadist groups. His administration conducted local outreach to identify what jihadists want as well as their vulnerabilities. Bazoum proved his credibility by releasing reformed jihadist leaders from prison and meeting with them to address their concerns. This counterinsurgency method was included in the government’s broader counterterrorism strategy, as it tried to be more accountable and responsive. The most substantive dialogue was geared toward jihadists’ demobilization. Rather than punish former jihadists, the government set up facilities to deradicalize them. After completing this process, they were given employment resources to assist with their reintegration into society. Bazoum also appointed a peace minister to settle the ethnic tensions that jihadists often exploit to recruit. As a result, the Fulani and Zarma ethnic groups signed a local peace agreement in western Niger. Niger’s approach of targeted counterterrorism operations and negotiations paid dividends, as jihadist activity in the first half of 2023 reached its lowest levels since 2018. Despite a positive security outlook, the population and security forces had dealt with jihadist activity for several years by July 2023. While political infighting was the primary cause of that month’s military coup, dissatisfaction with the government’s inability to completely stop the insurgencies helped justify it. The ruling junta has used this dissatisfaction to change its strategy using the same playbook as Mali and Burkina Faso: reduced international support, intensified repression, and stalled negotiations with jihadist groups. It removed Operation Barkhane and U.S. forces and pulled out of the G5 Sahel. It repositioned units combatting jihadists to the capital to consolidate its authority. Negotiations have been set aside in favor of counterterrorism operations with indiscriminate targeting, negatively affecting civilians. The junta has increased its use of airstrikes, which has resulted in civilian deaths on multiple occasions. Militias outlawed by former President Bazoum due to ethnic reprisals are now operating without oversight. In another sign of intensifying repression, a Wagner Africa Corps contingent of one hundred mercenaries arrived in April 2024. In a stark contrast to the pre-coup security situation, JNIM and ISSP have exponentially increased their activity and gained territory near the capital. Niger’s pre-coup approach was a limited success, while its post-coup approach is a failure. Its pre-coup approach recognized the drivers of the insurgencies. Its robust security force presence in Western regions limited the ungoverned spaces jihadists could exploit. Along with pursuing official dialogue to reduce ethnic tensions, this provided security for the population. In addition, Niger created a framework to demobilize and deradicalize jihadists. Its steps toward accountable, responsive governance disrupted jihadist activity and recruitment. However, long-standing shortcomings in infrastructure and other services left the population disillusioned, which helps explain the military coup. Its post-coup approach has ignored and, in some cases, worsened the drivers of the insurgencies. Niger has prioritized undisciplined counterterrorism operations over a robust security force presence, reduction of ethnic tensions, and demobilization of jihadists. This has given jihadist groups an opening to recruit from a marginalized and underserved population and gain territory. Policy Recommendations If Sahelian governments are to weaken jihadist insurgencies, they must revise their strategy to reflect counterinsurgency methods. Their policy objectives should not be jihadist-centric, such as killing and capturing as many jihadists as possible. Rather, their objectives should be population-centric, focused on securing localities and improving governance. That their populations perceive jihadist groups as, in some cases, providing better security and governance shows the extent of their shortcomings. The population must be convinced that the government can protect them and serve their interests. If this happens, localities will be resilient to jihadist incursions and recruitment. Recommendation #1. Prioritize clearing and holding operations over raids and high-value targets. To secure the population, Sahelian governments must enhance their security force presence to limit ungoverned spaces and jihadist territorial control. Under the current counterterrorism strategies of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, the emphasis is on targeting jihadist leaders and clearing areas with raids. Because jihadist groups have adopted a strategy of insurgency rather than terrorism, these operations are insufficient. Security forces are moving from one operation to the next, allowing jihadists to regroup and return to areas that were recently cleared. The only way to prevent this is by holding territory with a consistent security force presence, reflecting a strategy of counterinsurgency. This can be accomplished through security force augmentation. Whether it is military, law enforcement, or, if necessary, militias, security forces need more people to secure ungoverned spaces, especially the tri-border area. In 2023, Mali and Burkina Faso spent approximately 4 percent of their gross domestic product on military expenditures, while Niger spent approximately 2 percent. For countries that are unsuccessfully fighting for their survival, this is not enough. They should maximize their military expenditures, prioritizing personnel and training over conventional weaponry like artillery and aircraft. This type of weaponry is not as useful for combatting insurgencies, and only trained personnel can hold territory. Sahelian countries have long struggled with inexperienced and unmotivated security forces, making it vital to properly pay and train them. If increased expenditures and prioritization do not field enough security force members, governments should employ militias. Militias are more cost-effective than traditional security forces because their members are not full-time security professionals. However, militias come with the risks of ineffectiveness and abuses against civilians. Because jihadist groups exploit ethnic tensions and abuses against civilians to recruit, militias must be inclusive and unbiased. Therefore, they should be integrated into the government’s security forces, similar to the VDP in Burkina Faso but with more oversight. Integration will allow governments to provide training, arms, and oversight. At least one military officer should be deployed to oversee each localities’ militiamen. Given their controversial track record with offensive operations, militias must be employed exclusively for defensive purposes. They can collect intelligence and share it with traditional security forces, who will then act on it. To deny jihadists territory, governments must shift from prioritizing counterterrorism operations to counterinsurgency ones. If jihadist groups cannot control territory or thrive in ungoverned spaces, they will no longer be able to wage insurgencies. Recommendation #2. Expand cooperation with international partners. Another way Sahelian governments should augment their security forces is with international partnerships. Because vast swaths of territory need to be cleared and held, the more security forces, the better. The best bet for partnerships is between the Sahelian countries themselves. The newly formed Association of Sahelian States—consisting of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger—should stand up a joint military force. It can be used to stabilize the problematic tri-border area shared by the three countries. By pooling their resources, they can make up for their individual shortcomings. They should also attempt to convince Chad and Mauritania to join, as all these countries worked together on counterterrorism in the G5 Sahel. Chad and Mauritania have been more effective than Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger in securing their borders and conducting anti-jihadist operations. If possible, Sahelian countries should partner with the United Nations and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). While a United Nations partnership is unlikely given Mali’s removal of MINUSMA, a decision Burkina Faso and Niger approved of, it would add needed manpower. The same goes for ECOWAS given Sahelian countries’ withdrawal from the regional bloc. However, ECOWAS has recently conducted outreach to convince them to rejoin. They should respond favorably and prioritize rejoining because the insurgencies threaten ECOWAS member countries as well. This might make the bloc more likely to provide security assistance. In addition, Sahelian countries should seek partnerships with Western countries, which have vast financial and logistical capabilities as well as experience in the Sahel and Afghanistan. Western countries are also concerned about the threat jihadists pose to their interests and homelands. However, the complicating factor is that each Sahelian country has already terminated partnerships with some Western countries. Therefore, international partnerships between the Sahelian countries should be prioritized to increase their capacity to hold territory and secure their populations. Recommendation #3. Enhance governance, particularly in rural areas. Once localities are more secure, Sahelian governments must increase their presence, especially in rural areas vulnerable to jihadist incursions. The insurgencies exploit governance gaps to appeal to marginalized ethnic groups and underserved populations. Governments must challenge the narrative that jihadist groups provide more effective governance in these communities. This involves bolstering local services and the justice system. Governments should co-opt local leaders as liaisons between localities and the government. Liaisons will engage with the population to evaluate needs and report back to the government. Governments will complement liaisons’ efforts by establishing multiple outposts in each of their regions. These outposts will be manned by government representatives, who will use information from liaisons to satisfy local needs. Liaisons should also ensure the justice system is arbitrating disputes, particularly ethnic tensions. This initiative is cost-effective because it co-opts local leaders without sending representatives to every locality. It replaces marginalization with representation, improving the population’s perception of the government. The population will be less likely to tolerate, let alone join, jihadist groups if it believes the government treats them fairly and serves their needs. Recommendation #4. Pursue negotiations to demobilize jihadists and ease ethnic tensions. Improving security and governance will address the drivers of the insurgencies, opening an opportunity for negotiation. Using Niger’s former approach, Sahelian governments should open an official office within a ministry that handles negotiations, ethnic disputes, and demobilization. Government sponsorship increases the legitimacy of dialogue. Negotiations should not cede territory to jihadists; they want to replace the current state with an Islamist one, and territorial control furthers that cause. However, negotiations should offer amnesty to jihadists willing to go through a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration process. This process requires that demobilization facilities complete with employment assistance be established in each region. Governments should seek funding and assistance from the United Nations, which has an office dedicated to disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration. In addition, governments should facilitate dialogue between feuding ethnic groups, using civil society and religious leaders as mediators. By reducing ethnic tensions, governments will deprive jihadists of a key recruitment tool. Moreover, sponsoring negotiations for the purpose of demobilization will deprive jihadist groups of the members they need to wage insurgencies. Recommendation #5. Stop paying to release hostages. Sahelian governments should make the difficult decision to stop ransom payments because they are a primary source of funding for jihadist groups. Payments help fund their insurgencies in the present and incentivize future kidnappings. Not only should governments not partake in ransom payments, but they also should implement laws preventing private citizens from doing so. If foreigners try to make payments, Sahelian governments should protest through diplomatic channels. They can justify this policy by pointing to the severity of the security situation and the transnational threat it poses. Governments have direct control over a key source of funding for destabilizing insurgencies, so they should immediately cut it. Conclusion Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger must align their security strategy with their security situation. The situation is deteriorating, as jihadist insurgencies claim more land and encircle population centers. Meanwhile, the governments are pursuing tactical counterterrorism victories using means incompatible with strategic counterinsurgency victory. The only way they can prevail is by addressing the drivers of the insurgencies. The population needs security and governance, both of which are currently absent. Therefore, governments must be more present, accountable, and responsive to win the trust of the population. Only security and governance will prevent jihadists from controlling territory, thereby restoring stability in Sahel and reducing the transnational threat. If Sahelian countries fail to do so, the insurgencies will likely pose progressively larger threats in the Sahel, West Africa, and the international community, particularly Western countries.

Asian Democracies In Doubt About DeepSeek – Analysis	By Seth Hays The release of China’s DeepSeek R1 generative AI model, purportedly built on significantly less computing power and money than comparable models, made headlines across the world. While much discussion is focused on how this moves US–China AI competition, the rest of Asia is assessing the impact of this new player on their AI governance and industrial policies from practical and rights-based perspectives. Examining policy moves by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in response to DeepSeek shows the importance of AI governance. Particularly in the areas of privacy protection and national security, AI governance is necessary for a successful cross-border AI industry to thrive in Asia and positioning these countries to take advantage of industry volatility. South Korea’s Personal Information Privacy Commission suspended the use of DeepSeek in South Korea due to concerns about the company’s collection and processing of personal data. The privacy regulator indicated that DeepSeek expressed its interest in actively cooperating with the authorities by appointing a local agent. South Korea’s approach has been balanced in that it noted that the deficiencies can be remedied and the services restored after improvements are made. It cited similar concerns that were raised by US-based AI services, such as OpenAI and Google AI services. South Korea is not favouring US-based AI over China’s tech sector, despite being a US ally, and privacy rules for AI companies are applied in a geopolitically non-discriminatory way. But the government’s actions do underscore the important role that AI governance will play in the country’s AI sector. This follows the passage of South Korea’s AI Basic Act, which contains provisions on AI governance, such as requirements for transparency, accountability and a risk-based tiered system of regulation. Such legislation is aligned with the growing international consensus on trustworthy AI, such as the OECD framework. At the same time, it promotes industrial policy to foster the AI industry at home and support the creation of more data centres, accessible training data and education for AI talent. In Taiwan, the Ministry of Digital Affairs imposed a moratorium on the use of DeepSeek in the public sector, citing national security concerns about data leakage. The concerns are bolstered by reports that DeepSeek spouts Chinese Communist Party propaganda regarding the status of Taiwan as an independent democratic society. Though Taiwan has blocked other Chinese apps from being used by the public sector, its overall policy regarding AI and algorithmic technology from China has been based on principles supporting freedom of speech and access to technology. Taiwan has not blocked TikTok, despite concerns from civil society that the app could be used to manipulate public opinion or spread disinformation. Taiwan also expects to pass an AI Basic Act, which will institutionalise the need for AI governance processes to adhere to international standards on trust, accountability and transparency. In Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has taken note of the implications of DeepSeek’s release as a reason to continue moving towards the passage of an AI Basic Act. He said that legislation on AI, expected to come in 2025, should boost the technology while minimising risks and dangers. Tokyo banned the use of DeepSeek on government devices, as did numerous companies, citing data security and privacy concerns. Should the claims about DeepSeek’s compute intensity be accurate — and doubts exist about the very low price tag — this also spells an opportunity for many countries in Asia to enter the AI race without access to the advanced chips available in larger economies. But the moral of the DeepSeek story is that ignoring AI governance, including data security and privacy concerns, is not a recipe for long-term success. Countries that foster trustworthy AI, respect privacy and data protection and do not have objectionable political bias will be able to compete long-term across borders. Policies that ensure data and AI governance rules are interoperable will be key for building internationally competitive AI. Japan has led the way in developing rules for data free flow with trust at multilateral venues, such as APEC and the OECD. South Korea has taken the lead in global AI governance discussions. In 2024, it hosted the second iteration of the AI Safety Summit and the Responsible AI in the Military Domain Conference. Taiwan’s importance to global AI efforts cannot be understated, given that it produces the vast majority of the world’s advanced chips. The current administration has emphasised the importance of Taiwan to the ‘Democratic Supply Chain’. Taiwan is also considering an AI Basic Act to foster responsible AI development and use. With the right policies, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are well positioned to boost their domestic AI industries, despite regional volatility and geopolitical tension between the United States and China. As low-cost providers like DeepSeek continue to pick up steam, AI governance — complemented by rational infrastructure inputs — is crucial for a democratic AI supply chain.

Trump’s Tariff Policy And The Fragility Of The US Economy – Analy...	By Wei Hongxu Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump has once again brought up the issue of tariffs. He announced that starting in March, he would impose a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico. Additionally, he stated that tariffs on Chinese imports would increase by another 10%, bringing the total tariff on Chinese goods to 20%. This move has caused the capital markets, which had previously relaxed after Trump delayed tariff hikes, to become tense once again. It has also triggered a ripple effect in international markets. How will Trump's tariff policy impact the economy? What is the outlook for the U.S. economy? These questions are once again raising concerns and uncertainties in the market. In reality, whether Trump delayed tariffs as he did earlier or reinstated and increased them now, tariffs remain a political tool for him. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated not long ago that the Trump administration 'was working to bolster the private sector's contribution to job creation, partly by slashing regulations, extending tax cuts and rebalancing the U.S. economy through tariff policies'. In this context, tariff policy can be seen as one of the key pillars of Trump's 'Make America Great Again' agenda. Of course, this is different from Trump's earlier focus on restoring trade balance in the U.S. In this new phase, the flexibility of tariffs targets a broader range of goals, including revitalizing the economy, encouraging investment to return, reducing the budget deficit, and more. Tariff policy is now intertwined with issues like immigration, investment, and the war on drugs, demonstrating its flexibility. However, this also increases the uncertainty surrounding the policy. Tariffs may be delayed or reduced if certain goals are met, or they may be increased if other issues worsen. This is why Trump's tariff policy seems to be in a constant state of flux, which is also why the market feels so confused. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policy is closely tied to the evolving structural contradictions within the U.S. economy and society. A senior researcher at ANBOUND has previously pointed out that Trump's obsession with the trade war is driven by three main factors. First, the geopolitical tools available to him are not very effective, with tariffs being one of the few easily usable options. Second, based on the theory of 'buyer-seller market imbalance' (2010, ANBOUND), Trump firmly believes that being the 'buyer', he has the upper hand. Third, Trump views the impact on inflation as limited, hoping to leverage the external effects of tariffs to resolve internal contradictions within the U.S. economy. In this sense, the fluctuation of Trump's tariff policy is closely tied to the current economic situation in the U.S., and this is also leading to the increasing politicization of the American economy. After a period of sustained prosperity during the Biden administration, the U.S. economy is increasingly showing signs of sluggish growth. The latest data reveals that the U.S. real GDP annualized quarterly growth rate for the fourth quarter of last year was 2.3%, unchanged from the initial estimate. However, compared to previous quarters, it indicates a continued slowdown. Following a 2.8% growth in 2024, the latest forecasts show that U.S. GDP will grow by just 2.3% this year, as slowing job growth has dampened consumer demand. Data from January shows a 0.2% decline in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), and after adjusting for inflation, real PCE fell by 0.5%, marking the largest monthly decline in nearly four years. These figures suggest that, after the retreat of 'Bidenomics', Trump 2.0 faces increasing challenges in maintaining sustained economic growth in the U.S. In fact, the senior researcher at ANBOUND has been warning about the fragility of the U.S. economy as early as 2024. Especially concerning employment and inflation, it has been pointed out that one should not only look at the seemingly impressive overall data to analyze and understand the issues within the U.S. economy, which is far from as healthy as the data suggests. The new U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent has recently acknowledged that the underlying vulnerability of the U.S. economy is much greater than what the economic indicators show. He pointed out that while U.S. GDP growth is strong and unemployment is low, factors like interest rate volatility, sticky inflation, and job growth heavily reliant on the public sector are hindering economic development. Bessent attributed 'sticky inflation' primarily to the excessive government spending and regulatory barriers that occurred under former President Biden’s leadership. He said, 'The previous administration's over-reliance on excessive government spending and overbearing regulation left us with an economy that may have exhibited some reasonable metrics but ultimately was brittle underneath'. He also highlighted that, over the past 12 months, 95% of job growth has been concentrated in public and government-related sectors, such as healthcare and education, where wages grow more slowly and productivity is lower compared to the private sector. At the same time, employment in manufacturing, metals, mining, and information technology sectors has shrunk or stagnated during the same period. 'The private sector has been in recession', Bessent said. 'Our goal is to re-privatize the economy'. What Bessent said is not merely a political attack against the Biden administration. According to official statistics, in 2024, the total non-farm employment in the U.S. exceeded 159 million people, an increase of 2.32 million from 2023. However, the main contributors to job growth were concentrated in five sectors: education and healthcare, government, trade and transportation, leisure and hospitality, and infrastructure. Together, these sectors accounted for more than 2.1 million new jobs. The sector with the most significant growth was education and healthcare, which added 970,000 jobs over the year. In contrast, the manufacturing sector saw a decline. In 2024, manufacturing employment dropped by 87,000, with 24,000 of those jobs lost in computer and electronics manufacturing. Even more puzzling is that, despite the surge in AI investment, the information services sector saw a decrease of 8,000 jobs. This might be one of the reasons why Silicon Valley has seen increasing support for Trump. This structural shift in employment raises questions about whether the Biden administration might have 'played it smart' by increasing public sector jobs, especially temporary positions, to boost employment figures. In this regard, the highly 'politicized' employment policies of the Biden administration, while pushing various indicators towards an impression of 'prosperity', have also deepened the structural contradictions in U.S. employment and economic performance. The ongoing decline in manufacturing and the job losses it brings have, in fact, boosted support for Trump’s 'Make America Great Again' campaign. This can be seen as a key factor contributing to his potential return to power. Therefore, it is natural for Trump in his '2.0' phase to focus on using his economic policies to win over voters. For Trump, promoting the return of manufacturing through tariff barriers not only helps reduce the trade deficit but also creates jobs, serving as a crucial method for transforming the U.S. economic structure. Previously, when meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Trump emphasized that he wanted to impose 'comprehensive tariffs' to achieve the goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. It was not just Apple. Trump had similar plans for pharmaceutical industry giants as well. According to insiders, Trump had met privately with the CEOs of companies like Eli Lilly, Merck, and Pfizer, warning them that tariffs were coming and urging these companies to shift their overseas production back to the U.S. It should be noted that the Biden administration's approach of increasing public sector jobs is also one of the reasons why U.S. inflation has been slow to ease. The latest data shows that the U.S. January PCE price index rose by 2.5% year-over-year. While this meets expectations and is a slight decrease from the 2.6% reported in December, the month-on-month inflation level has risen again. The January PCE price index increased by 0.3% compared to December, matching the previous month's increase. Inflation in the services sector remains high. In January, core service prices, excluding housing and energy, increased by 0.2% month-on-month, while goods prices, excluding food and energy, rose by 0.4%, marking the largest monthly increase since early 2023. The overall core inflation, excluding estimated prices, which the Federal Reserve has particularly focused on in recent months, also rose by 0.2% in January. Given that Trump had just taken office in January, the persistent inflation in January is less likely to be attributed to the 'threat' of Trump's tariff policies and more to what Trump himself would call the 'Biden effect'. This is closely related to the Fed's decision last year to lower interest rates despite inflation's persistence. Trump had repeatedly criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for making 'inappropriate' rate cuts, which he argued were aimed at helping Biden's re-election campaign. Trump's overwhelming victory last year was largely attributed to how 'Bidenomics' during the Biden administration fueled inflation in the U.S. To address inflation, Trump will undoubtedly continue to use political means, adjusting both economic and trade structures as part of his broader strategy. Importantly, for Trump, the impact of tariff policies on inflation carries a lot of uncertainties. In particular, he hopes to reduce fiscal spending and the deficit through new departments under Elon Musk, which could help ease inflationary pressure. This would also lead to cuts in public sector jobs, which could suppress demand. Apollo Global Management has pointed out that layoffs related to efficiency measures in government departments could reach 300,000, and when including affected contractors, the total number of job losses could approach 1 million. The firm is concerned that in the short term, the economy and markets could face downside risks. This 'counterattack' against the Biden administration will certainly have an impact on inflation and consumer demand. It will also bring changes to employment and economic structures, aligning with Bessent's goal of boosting private sector growth. In this context, whether it is through tax cuts, spending reductions, or tariff increases, these policies are essentially part of a broader fiscal tightening process, leading to an overall reduction in the fiscal deficit. Tariffs may play a role in balancing the effects between tax cuts and spending reductions. Therefore, the level of tariffs not only reflects changes in trade and employment but also depends on inflationary trends, fiscal balance, and the state of the fiscal deficit. Final analysis conclusion: While 'Bidenomics' brought prosperity to the U.S. economy, it also led to an increasingly fragile economic structure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the underlying vulnerability of the U.S. economy is greater than what the economic indicators show. The Trump administration is working to strengthen the private sector’s contribution to job creation, with measures including regulatory cuts, extending tax cuts, and using tariff policies to rebalance the U.S. economy. This means that in the future, Trump’s economic policies will become increasingly politically driven, with tariffs serving as one of the tools to achieve his political goals.

How Indonesian Textile Giant Sritex Collapsed – Analysis	By Arie Firdaus What began as a small fabric shop in Central Java nearly 60 years ago grew into one of Southeast Asia’s biggest textile manufacturers, outfitting military forces and supplying clothing to major global retailers. But on March 1, the Sritex factory floors in Solo (Surakarta) fell silent. The company, brought down by mounting debts and a court-declared bankruptcy, officially ceased operations, leaving more than 10,000 workers jobless, Many of them had spent their entire careers at Sritex. The collapse marks one of the largest industrial shutdowns in Indonesia’s recent history, raising concerns about the fate of the nation’s textile sector, a key driver of its economy. How did Sritex become a textile giant? The Sritex journey began in 1966 when Muhammad Lukminto opened a small shop in Solo. By 1968, the business had expanded into textile production, and by 1978, had become a limited liability company, according to the company’s website. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Sritex evolved into a vertically integrated textile manufacturer. That meant it controlled stages of production in turning raw materials into finished goods. During this time, it became the official supplier of uniforms for the Indonesian Armed Forces before securing contracts with the German military and NATO. The company also produced garments for retailers such as Walmart, Sears, H&M, Uniqlo and Zara. By 2019, Sritex had reached annual sales of U.S. $1.3 billion (21.1 trillion rupiah) What led to Sritex’s financial collapse? Sritex’s troubles began in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and weakened consumer demand. Sales plummeted to $847 million (13.7 trillion rupiah), leading to the company’s first recorded loss since going public, according to its financial reports. By mid-2024, Sritex’s total obligations had ballooned to $1.6 billion (26.2 trillion rupiah), nearly double its 2019 debt level. Despite reaching a temporary debt restructuring deal in 2022, creditors lost confidence. Last October, creditor PT Indo Bharat Rayon filed for Sritex bankruptcy, arguing the company had failed to meet its debt obligations. The court ruled in favor of Indo Bharat Rayon and Indonesia’s Supreme Court upheld the decision in December, making the bankruptcy legally binding. What happened to the workers? In the first two months of 2025, at least 10,665 employees lost their jobs across Sritex Group’s four factories in Central Java. Labor unions have expressed concerns about the timing of the shutdown, which occurred as the Ramadan fasting month began in Indonesia. Many workers suspect this was a strategy to avoid paying Eid al-Fitr bonuses. 'We’re asking: Is this a way to deny us our rightful bonuses?' said Slamet Kaswanto, head of the Sritex Workers’ Union, during a parliamentary hearing. Meanwhile, the Indonesian government has pledged to assist affected workers, with the Ministry of Manpower working to ensure that severance payments and unemployment benefits are disbursed. Did the government try to intervene? Sritex’s collapse drew national attention, prompting President Prabowo Subianto’s new administration to consider intervention. In late 2024, the government assigned four ministries, including the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, to explore rescue options. Despite these efforts, the bankruptcy ruling led to mass layoffs. The government has since shifted its focus toward reemploying former Sritex workers, with officials claiming that new investors are interested in leasing Sritex’s equipment to restart production. Does this signal a decline in Indonesia’s textile industry? Sritex is not the only textile company struggling. Between 2019 and mid-2024, at least 36 Indonesian textile firms shut down, including PT Pismatex, a company that had operated since 1972, according to the Confederation of Nusantara Trade Unions (KSPN). In the first half of 2024 alone, 10 textile companies laid off nearly 14,000 workers, the union said. Bhima Yudhistira, director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS), blamed the weakening of Indonesia’s manufacturing competitiveness on high costs, inconsistent government policies and rising interest rates. Additionally, Indonesia has struggled to compete with countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, which offer lower production costs to attract major global fashion brands, he said. Jemmy Kartiwa Sastraatmadja, chairman of the Indonesian Textile Association (API), said trade protection policies implemented by several countries to limit exports to major textile producers such as China had led to overstocked inventories. 'As a result, the surplus is being exported to countries with weak trade protection policies, such as Indonesia,' Jemmy told BenarNews. In January, Redma Gita Wirawasta, who chairs the Indonesian Filament Yarn and Fiber Producers Association, told journalists that Indonesian factories have struggled to compete with cheap clothing from China flooding the market. What are the economic consequences? Sritex’s downfall is expected to have a ripple effect on Indonesia’s economy beyond its former employees. CELIOS estimates the bankruptcy could reduce Indonesia’s national GDP by 0.1% and cut regional GDP in areas where Sritex operated by 0.5%. Investor confidence in Indonesia’s textile sector is also likely to suffer, potentially discouraging future foreign investment, the think-tank said. Is Indonesia facing deindustrialization? Sritex’s bankruptcy highlights a broader issue – the steady decline of Indonesia’s manufacturing sector. Since 2010, manufacturing’s share of the GDP gradually shrank to where it remained below 20% between 2019 and 2024, according to government data – a figure that worries analysts. The government must increase the manufacturing sector’s contribution to 25% of Indonesia’s GDP to achieve its economic growth target of 8%, said Marco Kamiya, the U.N. Industrial Development Organization’s (UNIDO) representative for Indonesia. 'The manufacturing sector must be a key focus if Indonesia aims to achieve its ‘Golden Indonesia 2045’ vision,' Kamiya told an economic forum last month, referring to the government’s goal of Indonesia becoming a high-income country by its centennial.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyLQZXxa8ebAa	2025-03-07T18:36:31-08:00	
The Hidden Cost Of Tariffs: A Lesson From Bastiat’s Seen And Unse...	By Richard Martin Tariffs are often portrayed as a simple solution to protect domestic industries and create jobs. Politicians, like Trump, have used them as a political tool, promising immediate benefits through reduced competition and increased domestic production. However, this narrative overlooks the fundamental economic lesson articulated by Frédéric Bastiat in his principle of the seen and the unseen. When applied to tariffs, this lesson reveals the hidden and long-term damage that protectionist policies can inflict on an economy. For Canada, reacting to US tariffs with retaliation would only amplify the problem—instead, Canada must adopt a strategy that maximizes economic freedom and embraces structural reform. What Is Bastiat’s Principle of the Seen and Unseen? In his famous essay That Which Is Seen, and What Is Not Seen, Bastiat argued that economic decisions produce both immediate, visible effects (what is seen) and hidden, long-term effects (what is unseen). Policymakers often focus on the seen—the direct benefits of a policy—without accounting for the cascading, often negative, effects that remain hidden until it’s too late. When it comes to tariffs, the seen effect is easy to understand. Higher prices on foreign goods are supposed to encourage consumers to buy domestic products, thereby protecting local industries and jobs. But what is unseen? The answer lies in the broader, long-term impacts on productivity, the structure of production, trade relationships, and economic growth. The Seen: Temporary Protection for Domestic Industries When tariffs are imposed, domestic producers initially benefit. By making imported goods more expensive, tariffs give local industries a competitive advantage in the short term. Politicians highlight this benefit as evidence that tariffs 'work' to protect jobs and boost domestic production. However, this temporary protection comes at a significant cost. The Unseen: Long-Term Damage to the Economy Higher Costs for Consumers and Businesses: Tariffs act as a tax on consumers, who are forced to pay higher prices for imported goods or their domestic substitutes. What remains unseen is the cumulative effect on household budgets and reduced spending in other areas of the economy. Businesses that rely on imported materials or components face higher input costs, making them less competitive domestically and internationally. Disrupted Supply Chains: Modern production processes, especially in industries like automotive and manufacturing, involve complex cross-border supply chains. A single car, for example, may cross the US-Canada border multiple times during its production. When tariffs are applied at each crossing, the costs escalate quickly, making final products more expensive and less competitive. The unseen effect is the cascading disruption of entire industries that depend on smooth, tariff-free supply chains. Retaliation and Trade Wars: Tariffs rarely exist in isolation. When one country imposes tariffs, trading partners often retaliate, leading to a downward spiral of reduced trade. Canada experienced this firsthand during the Smoot-Hawley era of the 1930s, when global retaliation to US tariffs contributed to a 60 percent decline in world trade. The unseen damage includes lost export opportunities, reduced foreign investment, and weakened trade relationships. Reduced Productivity and Innovation: Protectionist policies shield domestic industries from competition, reducing the incentive to innovate or improve efficiency. Over time, this leads to stagnation and declining productivity. What remains unseen is the opportunity cost: the lost growth that could have been achieved through free competition and exposure to global markets. Long-Term Structural Damage: As tariffs distort market incentives, resources are allocated inefficiently. Industries that may not be competitive without protection receive an artificial boost, while more efficient sectors suffer from reduced investment. The unseen consequence is long-term structural weakness, making the economy more vulnerable to external shocks. Canada’s Strategic Response: Embracing Economic Freedom Trump’s tariff threats, particularly against Canada, are part of a broader strategy of economic nationalism. While retaliating may seem like a natural response and provides a certain emotional satisfaction, it would exacerbate the unseen damage by deepening the economic dislocation caused by protectionist policies. Instead of retaliating, Canada should take the opportunity to address long-standing structural issues that have limited its economic potential. Here’s how: Lower All Tariffs and Trade Barriers Globally: By unilaterally lowering tariffs, Canada can reduce costs for consumers and businesses, making its industries more competitive. This approach also signals a commitment to free trade, attracting international investment. Eliminate Interprovincial Trade Barriers: Canada’s internal barriers to trade are a major drag on productivity. Removing these barriers would allow for the free flow of goods, services, and labor, unlocking significant economic growth. Encourage Investment by Eliminating the Capital Gains Tax: The capital gains tax discourages long-term investment and entrepreneurship. Eliminating it would unlock capital, fuel innovation, and drive economic diversification. Repeal Restrictions on Resource Development: Canada’s vast natural resources are a key economic advantage, but restrictive regulations have limited their development. Removing these obstacles would boost exports, create jobs, and reduce dependence on the US market. Diversify Trade Relationships: Expanding trade agreements with Europe, Asia, and emerging markets would reduce Canada’s reliance on the US and open new opportunities for growth. Conclusion: Long-Term Prosperity and Resilience Through Economic Freedom Bastiat’s lesson of the seen and unseen reminds us that the true cost of protectionism lies beyond what is immediately visible. By focusing on short-term benefits, countries risk long-term economic stagnation and structural damage. For Canada (and America and all nations), the path forward is clear: embrace maximum economic freedom, lower trade barriers, and implement structural reforms that unleash productivity and innovation. Instead of reacting to protectionist threats, Canada can lead by example—creating a resilient, globally-competitive economy that thrives on free trade and open markets.

President Trump’s Shout-Out To The Military-Industrial Complex – ...	President Donald Trump’s efforts, through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and otherwise, to reduce United States government spending is the focus of much attention. Indeed, in his speech Tuesday night in the US Capitol, Trump listed several expenditures his administration had uncovered that he categorized as 'appalling waste.' He also declared that his administration would balance the budget, something he noted had not been accomplished in 24 years. It was thus peculiar that Trump slipped into his over hour and a half speech a shout-out to one of the groups most notorious for involvement in massive spending by the United States government — the military-industrial complex. The shout-out, though, was likely not understood by most people. This is because Trump did not use the term 'military industrial complex.' The term 'military-industrial complex' was first used by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his farewell speech in the context of a warning to the American people. 'In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex,' declared Eisenhower on January 17, 1961. Continuing, Eisenhower warned that this military-industrial complex threatened to 'endanger our liberties or democratic processes.' Over the decades since, the term has been regularly used by other individuals who have warned, like Eisenhower did, against this particularly dangerous and expensive public-private venture. Instead of stating 'military-industrial complex,' Trump used the more public relations approved substitute term of 'defense industrial base.' Declared Trump: To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.We used to make so many ships. We don’t make them anymore very much, but we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact. And Trump’s proclaimed effort to boost the military-industrial complex goes beyond starting a vast program for shipbuilding. Just preceding these shipbuilding comments, Trump declared his commitment to pursuing another huge program through the military-industrial complex: As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I’m asking Congress to fund a state of the art 'golden dome' missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A. Trump did in his Tuesday night speech mention Eisenhower approvingly. But, Trump talked only about Eisenhower’s effort as president to deport people from America. Hopefully, Trump will further consider Eisenhower’s presidency and heed the warning about the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower offered. In the meantime, beneficiaries of the military-industrial complex will be anticipating ocean-spanning and sky-high profit.

Russia Scrambling To Cope With Mounting Shortage Of Policemen – O...	Russia is a police state with an unusual problem: it doesn't have enough policemen to man the front lines. As a result, it is using police from foreign countries, relying on ethnic militias, employing CCTV to track people, and shifting police from one region of the country to another to fill gaps. Russian policemen have been leaving the service to get higher pay by fighting in Ukraine or joining private security companies, with units in many parts of the country short of staff by as much as a third. And now the problem has become so critical, given rising crime rates, that it has attracted the attention of Vladimir Putin. The interior ministry began sounding the alarm on this point at the end of last year (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/11/russia-facing-increasingly-serious.html), and now Putin has added his voice to complaints but without any suggestion that he will spend more money on the country's police force or has any long-term plans (vkrizis.info/vlast/nekomplekt-vnutrennih-del/). Among the steps the Russian government has taken to dry to deal with this problem without spending more money, something very difficult at a time of budgetary stringency brought on by Putin's war in Ukraine, are the following: -- Bringing in police from Central Asian countries (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/12/to-cope-with-enormous-shortage-of.html and windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/12/to-cope-with-enormous-shortage-of.html); -- Shifting police from one region to another as needed, including from those dominated by one ethnic group to those dominated by another (fortanga.org/2025/03/otryad-policzii-iz-udmurtii-polgoda-budet-rabotat-na-dorogah-ingushetii/); -- Relying on non-Russian ethnic units as well as on the notorious Black Hundreds-type Russian nationalist Russian Community to perform basic policing functions and engage in crowd control (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/11/spread-of-immigrant-militia-units-in.html and windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2024/10/another-black-hundreds-group-revived-in.html); -- Turning to the Russian army and other security forces to perform basic police functions (vkrizis.info/vlast/nekomplekt-vnutrennih-del/); and -- Increasingly relying on electronic means such as CCTV to monitor what Russians are doing at lower cost (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2025/02/another-move-toward-new-totalitarianism.html).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyBn6CWnESyXZ	2025-03-07T18:10:06-08:00	
Trump’s Dead People On Social Security Lie – OpEd	Donald Trump told many lies in his address to Congress the other night, but the one I found especially galling was when he repeated the absurd claim that millions of dead people are receiving Social Security benefits. My anger probably is part due to the fact that I spent many years studying and defending the program. Part of the story is that I look to soon be getting benefits from the program myself. But a big part of the story is that it is just such an obvious lie. It is infuriating to see Trump keep repeating it and then have all his MAGA cronies nod their heads like it somehow makes sense. There have been extensive analyses of the problem of people continuing to get checks after they are dead by the Social Security Administration (SSA) itself. It does happen occasionally, largely because families often don’t contact the SSA immediately after a person has died. But in almost all cases, the checks are stopped a month or two after death and most of the money paid out is returned. The biggest obstacle to ensuring that payments don’t go to dead people is that we don’t have a centralized national death registry. The reason we don’t have such a system is that Republicans would block it as an intrusion of the deep state. So, in keeping with that great Republican tradition, they blame the government for a problem they themselves created. But we don’t need to trust the work done by the SSA or outside investigators to know that millions of dead people are not getting Social Security. As I showed a few weeks back, we just need to trust arithmetic. Mr. Arithmetic Shows Donald Trump is Lying The basis point is very simple. The SSA gives us very good data on the number of people getting benefits by age, as well as their average benefit. We can add that up (even the 'super high IQ' DOGE boys should be able to do this) and calculate how much Social Security is paying out to people who are alive, or at least who are at ages where we expect them to be alive. When we add up the numbers, we find that the payments we can identify as going to living people come out to be pretty much exactly the amount of spending in the budget reported for Social Security. In other words, there is no room for the checks that are supposedly going to millions of dead people. Let me try to explain this point so that even Donald Trump might be able to understand. The SSA can identify real living people getting Social Security benefits. They also know how much money they get in benefits. We can check the SSA data against other sources. The Census gives us good data on how many people are in each group. For example, we can use the Census data to see how many people in the country are between ages 70 to 74 or 75 to 79. We can see that these data pretty much align with how many people SSA tells us are getting benefits in these age groups. We also know roughly how much these people should be getting in benefits. Social Security has a well-defined benefit formula, so we know roughly what we would expect an average 75-year-old or 80-year-old to be getting in benefits. There are also surveys that tell us how much people report getting in Social Security benefits each year. We could see if SSA was putting out obviously bogus numbers for the average benefit size. This means that we can be fairly confident that the SSA numbers on the total number of living people getting benefits are close to the mark. We also can be fairly confident that the number they are reporting for the amount of benefits they are getting is close to the mark. Since this total is equal to the amount of money that the government reports it pays out for Social Security each year, there is no room for the benefits going to Donald Trump’s millions of dead people. And just to be clear, there is no room for a hidden pool of money being paid to dead people. If there were hundreds of billions of dollars of unreported payments, they wouldn’t be in the budget by definition – they are unreported. So, Elon Musk, the DOGE boys, and Donald Trump would not be finding fraud in the budget. They would then be claiming that the government is making hundreds of billions in payments that no one knows about, and the deficit is far larger than anyone realized. Maybe this somehow makes sense in Trump World, but it is getting outside the bounds even allowed for the Twilight Zone. Repeating the Social Security Zombie Lie Given its obvious absurdity, the repetition of the lie about Social Security zombies has the same function as asserting the 2020 election was stolen or that Ukraine started the war with Russia. It’s Trump asserting the right to create his own reality in obvious defiance of the facts. It speaks volumes about the Republican Party that almost all of them are willing to go along with this obvious lie. Unfortunately, the media have largely given in at this point. The fact that Trump would tell an outlandish lie about the country’s most important social program, on which tens of millions of people depend for their livelihood, is barely even news. This originally appeared on Dean Baker’s Beat the Press blog.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyI1Zni5pjlPY	2025-03-07T18:04:14-08:00	
Ukraine Forced To Saudi Talks With Fewer Cards Than Ever – Analys...	By Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- Ukraine is a recalcitrant mule that’s been smashed on the nose with a plank of wood. This colorful image is a paraphrase of a telling remark this week by US special envoy Keith Kellogg that sums up Washington’s view of Ukraine’s rocky road from the bust-up in the White House to new talks with US negotiators in Saudi Arabia. Kellogg was discussing the US decision to pause military supplies to Ukraine and suspend intelligence cooperation. The aim, he said, was to compel Ukraine to join talks. 'The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose,' Kellogg said. 'You got their attention.' In other words, Ukraine’s biggest military backer has wielded a big stick to get its way, and it seems to have worked. 'The push is to get them to engage in diplomatic activities.... The bottom line is that it’s a forcing function to get them to the table,' Kellogg said at an event in Washington on March 6. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy heads to Riyadh on March 10 to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, followed by talks between Ukrainian and US delegations in Jeddah later in the week. This view of the dynamic of the last few days, and where it now leaves Ukraine, was shared by one analyst who spoke to RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service on March 7. 'They decided to put pressure on the weakest party,' said Yevhen Mahda, a Ukrainian political scientist and director of Kyiv's Institute of World Policy. 'The United States is not just turning the world order upside down. They are demonstrating, you know, a kind of caricature of policy,' Mahda said. The bitterness in these words echoes that heard in comments made by Ukraine’s ambassador to London, Valeriy Zaluzhniy, who this week accused the United States of 'destroying' the rules-based international order. Nevertheless, the presence of Ukrainian negotiators in Jeddah next week suggests that officials in Kyiv have accepted they have -- right now -- few options. Or, as US President Donald Trump put it, few cards. Zelenskyy’s tone of contrition in recent days also speaks to this. 'Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable,' he tweeted on March 4. 'I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership.' Kellogg was sitting right behind US Vice President JD Vance and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when the Oval Office meeting blew up. 'I had a ringside seat,' he said, adding that Zelenskyy 'misread the room.' 'You don’t try to challenge the president of the United States in the Oval Office.' While Kellogg’s mule quote made some headlines, his other comments offer further insight into how Washington wants things to go from here. A key first step will be to sign the minerals deal that was supposed to be signed in Washington. 'That is a big deal for us because President Trump is a transactional leader, and transactional starts with economics,' he said. Kellogg suggested -- in broad brush rather than in detail -- that this would be followed by Ukrainian officials setting out their 'term sheet' of basic positions. He said Russia had already done this. 'Do we have a term sheet from the Russians broadly? Do we have a term sheet with the Ukrainians? The answer is yes and no.' Mahda, the Ukrainian analyst, complained that Trump was not putting any kind of pressure at all on Russia, 'despite the fact that Ukraine is fighting a war for its independence.' On March 7, Trump took to Truth Social to wave some kind of stick at Russia, too. 'I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED,' he wrote. 'To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late.' This framing of the situation as two sides with equal status is clearly painful for Ukrainians. But Zelenskyy’s attempt to persuade Trump that his country, as the victim of aggression, has a moral case for support appears to have fallen on deaf ears. Kellogg said that, instead of acting as Ukraine’s ally, Washington would play 'an objective interlocutor role.' The fear in Kyiv and many other European capitals is that Washington is not even going to do this. Rather, that it sees its own interests as aligned with Moscow’s. This perception has driven European efforts this week to bolster its own defense capabilities. Zelenskyy appeared genuinely moved by European expressions of support and solidarity at meetings in London and Brussels in recent days. Alongside the now traditional mantra of sticking with Ukraine for as long as it takes, there were announcements that British and French intelligence would try to fill the gap left by the Americans. But the reality is that this is second-best assistance. It can help Ukraine hold the line for a time, but it cannot quickly replace the kind of US backing Ukraine has had until now. 'We have to understand that European equivalents of (US-made) Patriot missiles…won’t come quickly, by waving a magic wand,' said Mahda. Ray Furlong is a Senior International Correspondent for RFE/RL.

Cutlass Express Highlights Partnership At Sea	The threats of terrorism, piracy, smuggling and trafficking in East Africa loomed over Exercise Cutlass Express, which urged more than 1,000 participants from 20 nations to forge closer ties in the Western Indian Ocean. Participants trained to expand their capacity and capability for multinational maritime security operations throughout the 15th iteration of the event. Sponsored by U.S. Africa Command and facilitated by the U.S. 6th Fleet, it took place from February 10 to 21 in Mauritius, the Seychelles and Tanzania. Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Mhona, chief of Training and Combat Readiness for the Tanzania People’s Defence Force (TPDF), said the event emphasized the need for regional, continental and international collaboration. 'When we talk about terrorism, human trafficking and cybercrime, these are global issues,' he said during the closing ceremony on February 21. 'Since we share similar challenges, it is imperative that we tackle them together. However, effective collaboration is only possible if we train together. Interoperability is a fundamental aspect of our preparedness.' Comoros, Djibouti, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal, Somalia and Tunisia were among the other African nations participating in Cutlass Express 2025, where Tanzania reinforced its role as a regional leader in addressing transnational maritime challenges with multilateral coordination. Two national maritime operation centers in Tanzania took part in exercises to collaborate on real-time scenarios linked to visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) training in Tanga. 'We value the TPDF’s role as a regional leader in deploying peacekeeping forces, countering violent extremist organizations and promoting maritime security,' Andrew Lentz, chargé d’affaires ad interim of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania, said during the closing ceremony. 'Through exercises like Cutlass Express, we are building the readiness of our militaries and deepening the bilateral and multilateral relationships required to confront today’s most complex security challenges.' In the Seychelles, a weeklong rule of law course allowed participants to share and refine tactics for interdiction operations and for holding malign actors accountable for crimes at sea. 'Ensuring the free flow of commerce within the region, especially over critical sea lines of communication and the vast expanse of this maritime environment, is vital to the economic stability and security of the region,' U.S. Navy Rear Adm. David E. Ludwa said. Exercise Cutlass Express 2025 linked up with Exercise Justified Accord, which also took place in Tanzania, to improve coordination between land- and sea-based operations. 'This exercise was important for fostering cooperation to address global security challenges,' Mhona said. '[It] was designed to involve multiple nations because the challenges we face in Africa are the same as those encountered in other parts of the world.' AFRICOM Deputy Commander Lt. Gen. John Brennan underscored Tanzania’s significance. 'Tanzania is one of our strategic partners, not only in East Africa but across the entire continent, one of our most valued partnerships,' he said. The event featured a number of satisfied participants, including Seychelles Defence Forces Lance Cpl. Kenny Vidot, who relished his role as an instructor in the VBSS trainings in Tanzania. He said 12 of his Seychellois colleagues participated in the same exercise in Mauritius. '[We are] training to support collaborative maritime security operations in the region,' he said on February 14. 'This exercise is important for us to increase maritime capabilities and to promote regional cooperation in the Indian Ocean.' The VBSS training in Port Louis, Mauritius, on February 19 was an important experience for Mozambican 2nd Lt. Jose Chitengo. 'Cutlass Express has been good, and we are learning a lot,' he said. 'All of it was very positive knowledge. I believe it will be useful to apply these practices in my country.' After the VBSS training, Kenyan Senior Pvt. Faith Gitonha called the event 'a unique opportunity for hands-on learning.' 'It is so fascinating to see the variations in how different countries tackle a similar challenge. It has really emphasized teamwork, and that helps build a diverse set of skills. I feel more equipped to tackle multinational military challenges.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyKqp4F6L4sFw	2025-03-07T17:57:52-08:00	
China Warns US Against Containment As Trump’s Second Term Reshape...	By Taejun Kang and Alan Lu No country should expect to suppress China and maintain good relations with it, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday, as he warned of a reaction if the United States tried to contain his country. But in response to questions about U.S. relations as President Donald Trump begins his second term, Wang also held out the prospect of a successful partnership between the world’s two biggest economies. 'No country should fantasize that it can suppress China and maintain a good relationship with China at the same time,' Wang told a news conference on the sidelines of China’s annual parliamentary meeting in Beijing. 'Such two-faced acts are not good for the stability of bilateral relations or for building mutual trust.' The United States has imposed tariffs of 20% on Chinese goods since Trump took office – 10% last month and a further 10% coming into effect on Tuesday. Trump imposed the tariffs in retaliation for what he says is China’s refusal to stop the outflow of precursors for the synthetic opioid fentanyl. U.S. officials blame fentanyl for tens of thousands of deaths each year. China moved swiftly to retaliate with tariffs of its own on American agricultural and food products while accusing the United States of 'bullying.' Wang said the U.S. should reassess its policies, particularly on tariffs. He also dismissed U.S. criticism over fentanyl, describing it as a domestic issue that the U.S. must confront internally. The U.S. 'should not repay kindness with grievances, let alone impose tariffs without reason,' he said, adding that China had provided the United States with 'various assistance' to tackle the flow of fentanyl precursor drugs into the U.S. 'If one side blindly exerts pressure, China will resolutely counter that,' Wang said. Wang warned of the 'law of the jungle' in international relations if powerful countries bullied smaller ones. 'Small and weak countries will get burned first, and the international order and rules will be under severe shock,' he said. 'Major countries should undertake their international obligations … and not seek to profit from and bully the weak.' He said China welcomed more countries into a 'community of a shared future.' 'History proves that the only way to be a real winner is to care for everyone,' he added. ‘Playing with fire’ On broader U.S.-China relations, Wang denounced 'unjustified external suppression' of China’s technology sector and reiterated Beijing’s opposition to Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy. Wang called on the U.S. to foster 'positive and pragmatic cooperation and dialogue,' while emphasizing that mutual respect remained the foundation of U.S.-China ties, and their economic and trade ties were interdependent. 'The two countries can be partners that contribute to each other’s success,' he said. Wang held out the prospect of good ties with the European Union as well, noting that annual China-EU trade has grown to US$780 billion. 'We also believe that Europe can be a reliable partner. Both sides have the ability and wisdom to properly handle existing issues through friendly consultations,' he said. Wang reaffirmed Beijing’s position on self-ruled Taiwan and accused outside powers of fueling instability, adding that anyone supporting Taiwan’s independence would get burned. 'Taiwan has never been a country; it was not in the past, and it will never be in the future,' he said, warning that 'allowing Taiwan independence undermines stability in the Taiwan Strait.' Wang further criticized 'external support' for the island’s independence. 'Supporting Taiwan independence is playing with fire,' he said. On the war in Ukraine, Wang repeated China’s stance of support for political negotiations to end a conflict that he said 'could have been avoided.' 'China has been advocating for peace talks since the first day of the crisis,' he said. 'All parties should learn something from the crisis,' he said. 'Among many other things, security should be mutual and equal, and no country should build its security on the insecurity of another,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyNEgazzIRWOq	2025-03-07T17:53:06-08:00	
Poland: Tusk Plans To Offer Military Training To All Polish Men	By Nicoletta Ionta (EurActiv) -- Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced plans to encourage military training for every adult man in Poland in a speech on Friday, with a model outlining how to stand up the expanded military training expected by the end of 2025. The goal, according to Tusk, is to make sure that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war and that Poland has military reserves 'adequate to potential threats'. He added that women would also have the option to participate in the training. Tusk said that 'work is on the way' to ensure all Polish men receive military training in a speech on Friday to the Sejm, the lower house of Poland's parliament. He did not provide details of how the training scheme would work, but suggested that it would be voluntary. E'very healthy man should want to train to be able to defend the homeland if necessary,' Tusk said. However, Tusk dismissed concerns about a return to compulsory military service. 'If I had proposed a return to basic service, I would have said so,' he stated. Tusk highlighted the growing military imbalance in the region, noting that Ukraine's army stands at 800,000 troops, while Russia fields 1.3 million soldiers. Given these numbers, he Poland’s need to strengthen its defence, said Tusk. 'We are talking about the need for a 500,000-strong Polish army, including reservists,' he stated. Poland's military currently has more than 200,000 soldiers, with ambitions to continue growing in size. The country ended conscription in 2008. Tusk's remarks came after returning from Thursday's EU summit in Brussels to discuss needed investments in European defence, where all 27 EU leaders agreed to move forward on a European Commission plan for €150 billion in defence spending, although there was fierce debate ensued over financing for additional military funding. 'Today in Europe, we are setting an example of how to act rationally, pragmatically, without cosseting, without rushing into unnecessary conflicts,' Tusk said in Warsaw on Friday. Despite Poland’s push for stronger defense capabilities, Warsaw has remained firm on excluding troop deployments to Ukraine, even as part of a possible peacekeeping mission. 'Poland's task is to guard its eastern border, which is also the border of Nato and the European Union,' Tusk affirmed. Also on Friday, Katarzyna Pelczynska-Nalecz, the Polish minister responsible for development and regional policy, announced that Poland will be reallocating 30 billion zlotys (€7.2 billion) from its recovery fund to a different pot for security and defence. The fund will support civil defence, dual-use projects, shelters, roads, and defence industry research and development. Talks with the European Commission are in the final stages, with more reallocations toward defence expected, Pelczynska-Nalecz said. 'A very serious race awaits us. And this is a race for security, not a race to war,' Tusk said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyHQLtH_1CJh_	2025-03-07T17:47:01-08:00	
Trump Confirms Direct Talks With Hamas	By Patsy Widakuswara President Donald Trump on Thursday confirmed that his administration was negotiating with Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, to free the remaining hostages, and he doubled down on his earlier ultimatum that there would be 'hell to pay' in Gaza if they were not released immediately. 'You’re going to find out,' Trump said from the Oval Office when asked by a reporter what he meant. Trump highlighted his Wednesday meeting with freed Israeli hostages. 'I had the honor of spending a lot of time yesterday with quite a few of the people that we got out, and I can't believe how badly treated they were,' he said. Earlier Thursday, Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy to the Middle East, told reporters at the White House there could be 'some action taken' by the administration that could be done 'jointly with the Israelis.' 'Hamas has an opportunity to act reasonably, to do what's right, and then to walk out,' Witkoff said, referring to U.S. and Israeli demands that Hamas not have any military or political role in postwar Gaza. Neither Trump nor the White House responded to queries on whether the options being considered would include military action. In the past, officials have said they will not send American troops to Gaza. Trump’s decision to begin direct talks with Hamas to release hostages, led by special envoy for hostages Adam Boehler, marks a departure from Washington’s long-standing policy to not negotiate with terrorists. 'We are helping Israel in those discussions, because we're talking about Israeli hostages. And we're not doing anything in terms of Hamas. We're not giving cash,' Trump said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that Israel 'has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas.' Hamas said the best path to free the hostages was through ceasefire negotiations. It added that threats from Trump were encouraging Israel to walk away from the multiphase Gaza ceasefire deal reached on Jan. 19, a day before Trump took office. 'The language of threats does not intimidate us; it only complicates matters further,' Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said in a statement posted on a Telegram channel affiliated with the group. Wednesday on Truth Social, Trump posted, 'Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you. ... I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say.' His administration sent $4 billion in weapons to Israel this week, the second time in a month it bypassed congressional approval for sending arms to the country. The U.S.-Hamas talks appear to be a new diplomatic track, separate from ongoing negotiations between Hamas and Israel, with mediation by Qatar and the U.S., to secure phase two of the Gaza ceasefire. Hamas accused the U.S. and Israel of trying to back out of negotiations as phase one ended last weekend. 'Most people are expecting the ceasefire will collapse because they are expecting that Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to start pounding Gaza again,' said Mirette Mabrouk, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'And as soon as that happens, there will be no more hostage releases,' she told VOA. Arab counterproposal In addition to the two negotiation tracks, Arab nations on Tuesday endorsed a counterproposal to Trump’s call to expel Palestinians and turn Gaza into a beach destination. Under the Arab plan, Palestinians will remain there, and Hamas will be excluded from governance. Israel has rejected the plan, but Washington sees it as a 'good-faith first step,' Witkoff said in response to VOA’s question during a gathering of reporters at the White House on Thursday. 'We're evaluating everything there. So, it's a little bit early to comment,' he said. Israel has also blocked all aid into Gaza since Sunday, repeating long-standing charges that it is being diverted to Hamas, which international agencies deny. There’s now a fuel shortage in the territory, further jeopardizing basic services such as trash removal. The war in Gaza began with the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and resulted in about 250 people being taken hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 48,400 Palestinians, about half being women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyBsJh51FAnYE	2025-03-07T17:43:21-08:00	
Brazil: Economy Grows 3.4% In 2024, Highest Rise Since 2021	By Bruno de Freitas Moura The Brazilian economy grew by 3.4 percent in 2024, marking the largest expansion since 2021. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which measures the total value of goods and services produced in the country, was released on Friday morning (Mar. 7) by the government´s statistics agency IBGE. The result represents the fourth consecutive year of growth. According to IBGE, Brazil's GDP totaled BRL 11.7 trillion. The services and industrial sectors pushed GDP up, with increases of 3.7 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively, compared to 2023. In contrast, agriculture and livestock production declined by 3.2 percent. Growth in recent years: 2020 (start of the pandemic): -3,3% 2021: 4,8% 2022: 3% 2023: 3,2% 2024: 3,4% GDP can be calculated from either the production perspective (analyzing the performance of economic activities) or the consumption perspective (examining spending and investments). On the production side, IBGE points out that three segments were responsible for approximately half of GDP growth in 2024: - Other service activities (5.3%) - Manufacturing (3.8%) - Trade (3.8%) Specifically within industry, the highlight was construction, up 4.3 percent. Agriculture and livestock production declined after growing by 16.3 percent in 2023. The downturn was largely due to various climatic factors that affected key crops, with soybeans (-4.6%) and corn (-12.5%) being particularly impacted. Consumption On the consumption side, household consumption was the standout, growing by 4.8 percent. According to Rebeca Palis, coordinator of the IBGE's National Accounts, this increase is attributed to the greater availability of income for the population. 'For household consumption, we saw a favorable combination of factors, including government income transfer programs, continued improvement in the job market, and interest rates that were, on average, lower than in 2023,' Palis explains. Brazil ended 2024 with an unemployment rate of 6.6 percent, the lowest ever recorded. Fourth quarter In the fourth quarter, the economy expanded by 0.2 percent, reflecting considerable stability. According to Palis, one reason for the modest growth in the final three months of the year was inflation and the rise in interest rates—measures implemented by the Central Bank to curb price increases, but which had a dampening effect on economic activity. 'In the fourth quarter of 2024, what stands out is that GDP remained almost stable, with growth in investments but a decline in household consumption. This was due to a slight acceleration in inflation, particularly food prices,' says Palis. GDP per capita, calculated by dividing GDP by the population, reached BRL 55,247.45, marking a 3 percent increase compared to 2023, after adjusting for inflation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyPNkVyX-PEsM	2025-03-07T17:39:11-08:00	
The Egyptian Plan Has Become Arab … What Next? – OpEd	By Dr. Abdellatif El-Menawy The emergency Arab summit, held in Cairo on Tuesday, aimed to discuss ways to rebuild Gaza and address the ongoing repercussions of the war there. The summit witnessed a unified Arab stance against attempts to displace Palestinians, while emphasizing the two-state solution as the main path to achieving peace and stability in the region. One of the most significant outcomes of the summit was the adoption of the Egyptian plan for the reconstruction of Gaza, a proposal that spans five years and has an estimated cost of $53 billion. The plan focuses on rebuilding infrastructure, providing housing solutions for displaced Palestinians within the territory, empowering the Palestinian Authority to govern and removing Hamas from power. Additionally, it includes the formation of a 'Gaza Administration Committee,' a nonpartisan body comprising 15 Palestinian technocrats to manage daily affairs during the first six months of recovery. The plan is divided into three phases. The first phase involves clearing rubble and establishing temporary housing for approximately 1.5 million Palestinians. The second phase transitions to constructing new housing units, an airport, a seaport and economic and tourism projects. The final phase aims to pave the way for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state through direct negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis under international supervision. The plan faces significant challenges, as US President Donald Trump’s administration has expressed reservations about its security and political aspects, particularly concerning governance in Gaza and the future of Hamas. Meanwhile, Trump is promoting an alternative plan that involves relocating Palestinians from Gaza and transforming the sector into a luxurious tourist destination — an idea that was strongly rejected by the Arab summit. US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff further fueled concerns by stating that Israel demands Hamas be excluded from any future governance and disarmed as a prerequisite for reconstruction, a condition Hamas considers a 'red line.' Despite US and Israeli pressure, Arab nations have leverage they can use to support the Egyptian plan, including diplomatic relations with Israel and the normalization agreements signed in recent years. Analysts suggest that presenting a comprehensive vision that entices Washington — such as involving American companies in reconstruction projects and linking the plan to the normalization of Saudi-Israeli relations — could push Trump toward supporting the Arab initiative. At the end of the summit, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi announced that Cairo would host an international conference on Gaza reconstruction in April to secure the necessary funding and coordinate contributions from donor countries. This conference is seen as a test of the Arab world’s ability to rally international support for the reconstruction initiative. The key question remains: Can the Arab nations succeed in this endeavor? The implementation of Egypt’s Gaza reconstruction plan and the outcomes of the emergency summit largely depend on the position taken by the US administration—whether it chooses to support the plan or continues backing Israel’s efforts to obstruct its execution, especially given the fragile ceasefire agreement, which remains at risk of collapse. A joint Egyptian-Arab delegation is scheduled to visit Washington next week to meet with Trump administration officials, lawmakers in Congress and key decision-making centers to present the plan and persuade the US to support it. This visit will be followed by trips to European capitals. Trump’s stance has fluctuated between insisting that his plan to relocate Palestinians and develop luxury resorts in Gaza is the most viable and implementable solution and a softer message that he would not impose his ideas on anyone. Trump reinforced his position in a video created using artificial intelligence, which he shared on his Truth Social platform, reaffirming his vision of transforming Gaza into a high-end tourist destination. While the summit was taking place in Cairo, the US State Department announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reaffirm the US’ unwavering support for Israel as a top priority for the Trump administration. During the call, Rubio pledged to expedite the delivery of $4 billion in military aid to Israel. In return, Netanyahu expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of Witkoff in efforts to free hostages and extend the ceasefire in Gaza. While the Trump administration is open to considering the Egyptian plan, it has many questions regarding governance in Gaza, postwar security management and the potential involvement of international peacekeeping forces in both Gaza and the West Bank. Additionally, the US has concerns about disarming Hamas and minimizing its role, as the group remains the dominant force in Gaza. Arab nations worry about the continued US support for Israel, the uncertainty surrounding the durability of the ceasefire and Israeli actions in the West Bank, including the forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians. These concerns are compounded by fears that Israel is exploiting the US’ backing to advance its plan to annex the West Bank. There is growing concern that Washington might support Israel’s conditions that exclude both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority from any future governance in Gaza. Israel is also pushing for the extension of the ceasefire’s initial phase, securing hostage releases without committing to withdrawing its forces from Gaza. Last month, Witkoff stated in an interview with CBS News that one of Washington’s firm stances on Gaza’s future was the removal of Hamas from the territory. Egyptian officials acknowledge the difficulty of disarming Palestinian factions in Gaza, meaning they face challenges in persuading donors to fund reconstruction, given concerns that Israel might resume bombing the sector even after significant investments in rebuilding homes and infrastructure. The fragile nature of the ceasefire further amplifies these concerns. However, if Trump perceives that endorsing the Arab plan could bolster his image as a peacemaker and potentially secure him a Nobel Peace Prize, he might be more inclined to support it. To succeed, Arab nations must win over American public opinion and pressure the Trump administration to push Israel toward maintaining the ceasefire and accepting a peace plan. Some experts argue that the best hope lies in Trump losing patience with Netanyahu, who might jeopardize part of the US president’s regional strategy and complicate efforts to secure hostage releases. If Trump manages to broker a major diplomatic breakthrough — securing the release of hostages, ensuring peace in Gaza without Hamas and expanding the Abraham Accords to include more Arab and Muslim nations — he could claim a significant foreign policy victory. The Arab summit firmly rejected Trump’s proposal to relocate more than 2 million Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan while transforming Gaza into a 'Middle Eastern Riviera.' Instead, Cairo presented a phased reconstruction plan aimed at keeping Palestinians in Gaza, removing Hamas from governance and ultimately restoring PA control. During the first phase of the Egyptian proposal, direct negotiations between Israel and Palestinian representatives would begin, addressing final-status issues such as territorial borders and the status of Jerusalem. The plan also includes Egypt and Jordan training a Palestinian police force to maintain security. The Egyptian plan reaffirms the two-state solution, warning that any attempt to undermine Palestinian statehood will fuel further conflict and instability. However, Israel’s hard-line stance against Hamas and right-wing opposition to a Palestinian state raise doubts about its commitment to peace talks.

Trump Says Letter Sent To Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei About New Dea...	US President Donald Trump said he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran and sent a letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei on Thursday, claiming he hoped they would agree to talk. 'I said I hope you're going to negotiate, because it's going to be a lot better for Iran,' Trump said in the interview with Fox Business Network broadcast Friday. 'I think they want to get that letter. The other alternative is we have to do something, because you can't let another nuclear weapon,' the US president said, Reuters reported. The letter appeared to have been addressed to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei. The White House did not immediately respond to a request about that.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyEvBjkOTU-k-	2025-03-07T17:28:40-08:00	
Vatican Expresses Solidarity With Muslims During Ramadan Fast	By Hannah Brockhaus The Vatican has expressed its solidarity with Muslims participating in the Ramadan fast, noting that Catholics also fast and do penance during the season of Lent and inviting greater dialogue and friendship between people of the two religions. 'Our world is thirsting for fraternity and genuine dialogue,' a March 7 message from the Vatican’s Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue said. 'Together, Muslims and Christians can bear witness to this hope in the conviction that friendship is possible despite the burden of history and ideologies that promote exclusion.' 'Hope,' it continued, 'is no mere optimism: It is a virtue rooted in faith in God, the Merciful, our Creator.' In 2025, Ramadan runs from approximately Feb. 28 to March 29. It concludes with the three-day celebration of Eid al-Fitr. The Christian season of Lent began on March 5 and will end on April 17 with the three days known as the Triduum — Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday — followed by Easter Sunday. 'This year, Ramadan largely coincides with Lent, which for Christians is a period of fasting, supplication, and conversion to Christ,' the dicastery said. 'This proximity in the spiritual calendar offers us a unique opportunity to walk side by side, Christians and Muslims, in a common process of purification, prayer, and charity.' The Vatican’s annual message for Ramadan was signed by the dicastery’s new prefect, Cardinal George Jacob Koovakad, and its secretary, Father Indunil Janakaratne Kodithuwakku Kankanamalage. Pope Francis appointed Koovakad prefect of the dicastery at the end of January, filling the vacancy left by Cardinal Miguel Ángel Ayuso Guixot, who died in late 2024. An Indian from the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Koovakad was previously responsible for the organization of papal trips. In its message, the interreligious dicastery noted similarities between the Muslim observance of Ramadan and the Catholic observance of Lent. 'By abstaining from food and drink, Muslims learn to control their desires and turn to what is essential. This time of spiritual discipline is an invitation to cultivate piety, the virtue that brings one closer to God and opens the heart to others,' it said. 'In the Christian tradition, the holy season of Lent invites us to follow a similar path: Through fasting, prayer, and almsgiving we seek to purify our hearts and refocus on the One who guides and directs our lives,' it went on. 'These spiritual practices, though expressed differently, remind us that faith is not merely about outward expressions but a path of inner conversion.' The dicastery said it wanted to reflect on how Christians and Muslims can become 'genuine brothers and sisters, bearing common witness to God’s friendship with all humanity.' 'Our trust in God,' Koovakad’s message underlined, 'is a treasure that unites us, far beyond our differences. It reminds us that we are all spiritual, incarnate, beloved creatures, called to live in dignity and mutual respect.' 'What is more, we desire to become guardians of this sacred dignity by rejecting all forms of violence, discrimination, and exclusion,' the dicastery continued. 'This year, as our two spiritual traditions converge in celebrating Ramadan and Lent, we have a unique opportunity to show the world that faith transforms people and societies and that it is a force for unity and reconciliation.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyDQiPXg-0Q6P	2025-03-07T17:26:08-08:00	
More Guns, Less Butter: Starmer’s Defense Spending Splash – OpEd	The urge to throw more money at defence budgets across a number of countries has become infectious. It was bound to happen with Donald Trump’s return to the White House, given his previous insistence that US allies do more to fatten their own armies rather than rely on the largesse of Washington’s power. Spend, spend, spend is the theme, and the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has shown himself willing to join this wasteful indulgence. On February 25, just prior to his visit to Washington, Starmer announced that spending on defence would reach 2.5% of GDP from April 2027. In the next parliament, it would rise to 3%. 'In recent years,' states a UK government press release, 'the world has been reshaped by global instability, including Russian aggression in Ukraine, increasing threats from malign actors, rapid technological change, and the accelerating impacts of climate change.' Almost predictably, the term 'Cold War' makes its retro appearance, with the spending increase the largest since that conflict of wilful misunderstandings and calculated paranoia. Russia figures prominently, as do 'malign actors' who have burdened 'the working people of Britain' with 'increased energy bills, or threats to British interests and values.' The governing Labour Party has also gone a bit gung-ho with the military-industrial establishment. In an open letter reported by the Financial Times, over 100 Labour MPs and peers thought it wise that ethical rules restricting investment by banks and investment firms in defence companies be relaxed. Financial institutions, the letter argues, should 'rethink ESG [environmental, social and governance] mechanisms that often wrongly exclude all defence investment'. It was also important to address the issue of those 'unnecessary barriers' defence firms face when 'doing business in the UK'. Among such barriers are those irritating matters such as money laundering checks banks are obliged to conduct when considering the finance needs of defence and security firms, along with seeking assurances that they are not financing weapons banned under international law. That these uncontroversial rules are now being seen as needless barriers to an industry that persists in shirking accountability is a sign of creeping moral flabbiness. Across Europe, the defence and arms lobbyists, those great exploiters of fictional insecurity, are feeling more confident than they have in years. They can rely on such figures as European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who stated on March 4 that, 'We are in an era of rearmament. And Europe is ready to massively boost its defence spending.' To pursue such rearmament, Starmer has decided to take the axe to the aid budget, reducing it from its current level of 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027. It was, as the press release goes on to mention, a 'difficult choice' and part of 'the evolving nature of the threat and the strategic shift required to meet it'. The Conservatives approved the measure, and the populist Reform UK would have little reason to object, seeing it had been its policy suggestion at the last election. It was a decision that sufficiently troubled the international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, to quit the cabinet. In a letter to the prime minister, Dodds remarked that, while Starmer wished 'to continue support for Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine; for vaccination; for climate; and for rules-based systems', doing so would 'be impossible … given the depth of the cut'. Making the Office of Overseas Development Assistance absorb such a reduction would also see Britain 'pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations – at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence.' It would be isolated from various multilateral bodies, see 'a withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank'. Influence would also be lost at such international fora as the G7 and G20. Defence establishment figures have also regarded the decision to reduce aid with some consternation. General Lord Richards, former Chief of Defence Staff, saw the sense of an increase in military spending but not at the expense of the aid budget. 'The notion that we must weaken one to strengthen the other is not just misleading but dangerous,' opined Richards in The Telegraph. 'A lack of investment and development will only fuel greater instability, increase security threats and place a heavier burden on our Armed Forces.' The aid budgets of wealthy states should never be seen as benevolent projects. Behind the charitable endeavour is a calculation that speaks more to power (euphemised as 'soft') than kindness. Aid keeps the natives of other countries clothed, fed and sufficiently sustained not to want to stray to other contenders. The sentiment was expressed all too clearly by a disappointed Dodds: a smaller UK aid budget would embolden an already daring Russia to fill the vacuum. How fascinating, then, that a daring Russia, its threatening posture inflated and exaggerated, is one of the primary reasons prompting an increase in Britain’s defence spending in the first place.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBsqgKsSgTyPGulsZuxtn_	2025-03-07T17:24:41-08:00	
Trump’s Leverage Over Ukraine Grows As Zelenskyy Softens His Stan...	Volodymyr Zelenskyy's latest letter to Donald Trump marks a turning point in Ukraine's war diplomacy. By expressing readiness for peace negotiations, the Ukrainian president has shifted his tone, a move that may inadvertently embolden Trump to further pressure U.S. allies. Trump's narrative of portraying Zelenskyy as an ungrateful recipient of American aid has set the stage for a new dynamic - one where the Ukrainian leader now finds himself maneuvering carefully to secure continued U.S. support. The abrupt shift in Zelenskyy's approach comes in the wake of his contentious meeting with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Trump's repeated assertion that Ukraine is prolonging the war for its own interests, coupled with his claim of receiving 'strong signals' from Moscow about its willingness to negotiate, has placed Zelenskyy in a difficult position. By adopting a more conciliatory stance, the Ukrainian president seeks to ensure that Washington remains engaged, even as Trump recalibrates America's role in the conflict. While Trump celebrates this as a victory for his deal-making persona, the broader consequences for European allies are far more complex. The minerals deal that was initially stalled due to Zelenskyy's premature departure from Washington is now reportedly back on the table. This agreement, allowing American investment in Ukraine's rare earth minerals, is being framed by the Trump administration as a security guarantee - one that would supposedly deter Russia from further aggression. Yet, the deal raises deeper concerns for European nations, particularly those that have shouldered much of the economic and strategic burden of supporting Ukraine. Washington's direct stake in Ukraine's mineral wealth threatens to sideline European interests, reinforcing the view that Trump's approach is transactional rather than rooted in long-term security commitments. Putin's response to Zelenskyy's softened tone is predictable. For Moscow, this represents an opportunity to dictate terms in any ceasefire agreement. The truce proposal, which includes a halt to missile and drone attacks and a pause on targeting energy infrastructure, places the burden on Russia to reciprocate. However, the Kremlin is unlikely to accept such conditions without extracting major concessions. From Putin's perspective, the mere fact that Zelenskyy is now engaging in a language of de-escalation signals Ukraine's vulnerability. This provides Moscow with leverage to demand recognition of territorial gains and a weakening of Ukraine's ties with Western military alliances. Russia's outright rejection of European peacekeeping forces further underscores its broader objective: ensuring that any post-war settlement keeps Ukraine within its sphere of influence. European leaders, from Keir Starmer to Emmanuel Macron, have expressed willingness to deploy peacekeepers as part of a broader stabilization effort. Yet, Moscow's resistance - coupled with Trump's apparent alignment with Russian demands - casts doubt on the feasibility of such an initiative. If past trends hold, Trump's administration is unlikely to push back against Kremlin opposition, raising questions about the future of European involvement in Ukraine's security architecture. Zelenskyy's attempt to reassure Washington about his gratitude for American assistance further highlights the precarious nature of Ukraine's position. His social media post, saturated with acknowledgments of past U.S. support, reflects a strategic effort to mend ties with Trump's administration. But the underlying reality remains unchanged: Trump's willingness to pause military aid and prioritize economic arrangements like the minerals deal demonstrates a shift away from the unwavering military backing that Ukraine once enjoyed under previous U.S. administrations. The uncertainty surrounding these developments leaves Europe in a difficult position. If the U.S. continues to prioritize its own strategic and economic interests over a unified Western approach, European nations may find themselves shouldering an even greater burden. At the same time, Russia's patience remains a key factor. Moscow can afford to wait, observing whether European resolve weakens under pressure or if fractures within the Western alliance widen further. For now, the contours of a potential ceasefire remain vague. Zelenskyy's outreach to Trump reflects a tactical shift, but it also signals a deeper geopolitical recalibration—one where Ukraine's fate is increasingly shaped by forces beyond its control. The coming months will reveal whether Trump's approach to the war cements a new balance of power or merely sets the stage for a more perilous phase of geopolitical maneuvering.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl4kRYL6TkpJg	2025-03-07T09:48:15-08:00	
Implementing Phase Two – OpEd	Will the Gaza ceasefire deal survive its first phase? That was the unanswerable question hanging over the formal end of phase one on March 2 and the scheduled start of phase two. Some commentators believe that Israel simply wants to extend phase one for the time being. They point out that, under the terms of the agreement, Israel was supposed to begin withdrawing from the Philadelphi Corridor – the strip of land on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt – on the last day of the first phase and complete their evacuation within eight days. But on February 27 an Israeli official told the media that to prevent weapons smuggling, the IDF will be remaining in position. That decision may have been in reaction to an announcement by Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem on February 18. He suddenly declared that Hamas was interested in speeding up the hostage release process – but in return for a major concession. Hamas, he said, had submitted a new proposal to the mediators offering to release all the remaining hostages in phase two. The quid pro quo, said Qassem, would be for Israel to agree to an immediate permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi Corridor. This 'offer' would place Hamas in a much stronger position to secure its long-term intention of remaining the ruling power in Gaza. On February 19, Rami Igra, former head of the Mossad’s Prisoners and Missing Persons Division, warned in a radio interview that Hamas is seeking to establish a Hezbollah-style rule in Gaza. Using the PA as a front, Hamas aims to retain effective control; to be, in effect, 'the power behind the throne. By infiltrating the government in Lebanon, Hezbollah was able to build itself into a formidable power bloc, rivaling the state itself and its institutions. 'They want to continue ruling Gaza,' said Igra. 'They will do everything to make that happen.' Israel is unlikely to be wooed into a premature withdrawal from Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said repeatedly that the IDF will not evacuate the Strip completely until it is clear that Hamas’s military and political capabilities have been so degraded that it can no longer rearm or govern Gaza. The mediators – the US, Egypt, and Qatar – will soon have to grapple with the problem of how Gaza is to be governed when the war ends – and get both sides to agree about it.There is no support from the Arab world for Hamas to stay in control. Some Arab states wish to see neither Hamas nor the PA controlling a post-war Gaza; some Arab commentators have favored a role for a perhaps reformed PA. Trump’s proposal for the US to take over the Gaza Strip and evacuate the population generated instant rejection from the Arab world. In reaction, some Arab nations initiated substantive discussions aimed at developing a comprehensive plan for Gaza’s future governance and reconstruction, but based on upholding the rights of the Gazan population. Some speculate that it was Trump’s intention from the start to goad the Arab world into considering Gaza’s future and how to achieve it. It is significant that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio seems far from wedded to Trump’s vision of Gaza’s future. On February 13, he said on an American radio show 'If the Arab countries have a better plan, then that’s great.' On February 20, Saudi Arabia hosted a summit in Riyadh, bringing together leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Its primary purpose was to consider Egypt’s counter-proposal to Trump’s suggested solution. After intensive diplomatic activity, Egypt presented a comprehensive three-phase reconstruction plan for Gaza, and has apparently garnered support from European nations, including France and Germany, as well as regional Arab countries. It favors the creation of 'secure areas' within Gaza to house displaced residents temporarily as essential infrastructure is rebuilt. A significant aspect of the proposal is the establishment of a new Palestinian administration in Gaza, distinct from both Hamas and the current PA, to oversee the reconstruction efforts. A police force composed of former PA officers would be established. Egypt’s plan maintains that Hamas has agreed to a governance structure that excludes its participation. Financial backing for the reconstruction, estimated at $53 billion, is expected to come from the oil-rich Gulf states. Some, but not all, of the proposals in Egypt’s plan received instant endorsement from the conference participants. The leaders reached a consensus on the necessity of sidelining Hamas, but some apparently favored reinstating the authority of the PA in Gaza during the reconstruction phase. A follow-up summit, scheduled for March 4 in Cairo, is aimed at finalizing a unified Arab plan for Gaza’s reconstruction, crucially reaffirming opposition to any forced displacement of its population. Since Egypt, along with Qatar and the US, is acting as a mediator in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas over the Gaza ceasefire deal, the Arab 'day after' plan being constructed under Egypt’s leadership will probably be put to both sides in due course. How Israel will react is far from clear. During a joint press conference with Rubio on February 16, Netanyahu said: 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public – including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them.' Two days later, following a meeting of Israel’s Security Council, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters: 'We need a total demilitarization of Gaza and no presence of the Palestinian Authority.' So it seems clear that, as part of phase two, if it eventually comes into effect, Israel will be demanding the release of all hostages in addition to the dismantling of the Hamas military and, possibly, the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza. Only then would Israel consider withdrawing from the Philadelphi Corridor. Hamas is not likely to accept these demands. However, while keeping its true long-term aims under wraps, Hamas might go along with the Egyptian proposals, especially if they emerge as a unified Arab plan. All in all, the auguries for a successful outcome to phase two – even if negotiations get underway – are not good.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl15SL3YbcQ6R	2025-03-07T09:46:32-08:00	
India’s Indigenous Women Demand Justice – OpEd	In the remote villages of Odisha, a 14-year-old Munda girl's story echoes a pattern of injustice plaguing India's Indigenous communities. Gang-raped by non-tribal men in 2022, she remained silent for weeks, her family paralyzed by fear of police retaliation and social ostracism. Her case represents thousands of similar stories that never make headlines. 'They told us to keep quiet if we wanted to live in peace,' says her mother, requesting anonymity for safety concerns. 'The police station is a four-hour walk. Even if we reported it, who would believe us?' Despite constituting 8.6% of India's population, Indigenous women—officially recognized as Scheduled Tribes—face an epidemic of violence hidden behind a veil of institutional neglect and data gaps. While the National Crime Records Bureau tracks violence against women nationally, activists say statistics fail to capture the full extent of abuse in tribal communities. 'We estimate over 40% of Adivasi women experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime,' says Shalini Gera, a human rights lawyer working with tribal communities in Chhattisgarh. 'But the real number is likely much higher due to chronic underreporting.' Justice Denied India boasts progressive legislation on paper. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (2005) and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (1989) (PoA Act) should provide robust protection. Reality tells a different story. In the mineral-rich forests of Bastar, Sunita Markam (name changed) alleges sexual assault by security forces during a routine patrol in her village. When she attempted to file a complaint, officials questioned her character and suggested she was aiding Maoist insurgents. 'They treated me like a criminal,' Markam recalls. 'One officer asked why I was in the forest alone. Another said women like me make false accusations.' Court records from five states with significant tribal populations reveal conviction rates under the PoA Act hovering below 5%. Cases routinely drag on for years, with victims facing intimidation and procedural barriers at every turn. 'The legal system isn't designed for Indigenous women,' explains Aditi Malhotra, a Supreme Court advocate. 'Language barriers, geographic isolation, and cultural insensitivity create insurmountable obstacles. Many victims abandon cases out of exhaustion or fear.' Grassroots Response In the absence of state support, grassroots organizations have become lifelines. In Gujarat, the Adivasi Mahila Sangathan operates safe houses for survivors and provides paralegal training to community volunteers. 'When government fails, we must protect our own,' says Kamla Bhaiya, the organization's founder. 'Our women learn to document evidence, accompany survivors to hospitals and police stations, and navigate courts.' These organizations operate on minimal resources. An RTI application revealed that less than 3% of the government's Nirbhaya Fund—established after the 2012 Delhi gang rape to support women's safety initiatives—reached tribal areas between 2015-2022. Success stories exist despite these constraints. In Nagaland, the Naga Women's Union successfully advocated for Indigenous women's inclusion in peace negotiations, leading to decreased incidents of conflict-related sexual violence. 'When we have resources, we create change,' says Rosemary Dzüvichü, a senior member. 'The problem isn't our capacity—it's that our work is chronically underfunded and undervalued.' The Missing Piece of Political Representation Rama Devi, 38, was elected to her village panchayat in Jharkhand three years ago under women's reservation quotas. Yet her experience illustrates a common pattern. 'The male leaders make all decisions,' she confides. 'When officials visit, they direct questions to my husband. If I speak independently, I face hostility at home and in the community.' Statistics highlight this marginalization. Since India's independence, only four Adivasi women have served in the Lok Sabha. State legislatures show similarly dismal representation. 'Political exclusion means policies affecting Indigenous women are created without their input,' says Dr. Nandita Haksar, a human rights lawyer and author. 'From forest rights to mining approvals, decisions impacting their lives happen in rooms where they have no voice.' This exclusion has concrete consequences. When the Forest Rights Act was implemented, land titles predominantly went to male household heads despite women's traditional role in forest management. Deeper Roots of Violence Beyond immediate triggers lies structural violence embedded in India's development model. Massive displacement due to mining, dams, and industrial projects has uprooted tribal communities from ancestral lands, destabilizing traditional protections. 'When communities are displaced, women bear the heaviest burden,' explains Dr. Felix, anthropologist and author of several books on tribal issues. 'Economic precarity forces men to migrate, while militarization introduces new forms of violence.' Environmental degradation compounds these vulnerabilities. Deforestation forces women to walk longer distances for water and firewood, increasing exposure to assault. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed these fractures dramatically. A survey by the Indigenous Women's Forum of Northeast India documented a 60% increase in domestic violence cases during lockdowns, with victims unable to access help lines or shelters. 'The pandemic wasn't just a health crisis—it was a shadow pandemic of violence,' says Manipur-based activist Binalakshmi Nepram. 'Government response completely overlooked Indigenous women's specific vulnerabilities.' The Path Forward Activists and experts emphasize that addressing this crisis requires multifaceted approaches. Legal reforms must be paired with implementation mechanisms, including special courts with Indigenous representation and mobile legal clinics serving remote areas. Police sensitivity training is essential, but must be coupled with accountability measures for officers who dismiss or mishandle cases. 'Laws exist, but enforcement remains captive to prejudice,' notes former High Court Justice Chandru K. 'We need structural changes in how justice is delivered.' Funding structures must prioritize Indigenous-led organizations. International donors increasingly recognize the effectiveness of participatory grant-making, allowing communities to determine resource allocation. Political representation requires both reserved seats and support systems to help Indigenous women navigate institutional barriers. Several states are considering legislation similar to the model in Nagaland, where tribal councils must include 33% women members. Most importantly, solutions must center Indigenous women's agency and leadership. 'We don't need saviors telling us how to solve our problems,' asserts Meenakshi Munda, addressing a recent gathering of tribal rights activists in Delhi. 'We need allies who will stand beside us as we dismantle the systems oppressing us.' As one Santhal elder from West Bengal put it: 'Our struggle is not just against violence. It's for the recognition that our lives matter—that we deserve justice not as an afterthought, but as our birthright.' This article is based on interviews with over 30 Indigenous women activists, legal experts, and survivors across six states conducted between November 2024 and January 2025. Some names have been changed to protect identities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl78ond_4ajfq	2025-03-07T09:44:46-08:00	
Iranian Women’s Struggle For Freedom: A Call For Global Support –...	Last week, I met my Iranian friend, an intelligent woman who left Iran in 2022. She shared a heart-breaking story about her sister, who was summoned to court and ordered to pay a penalty for not wearing the hijab. Her sister, an educated woman who has worked tirelessly since a young age, now faces punishment simply for choosing her attire. This is just one example of the many injustices Iranian women endure under the regime’s oppressive laws. As we mark International Women’s Day 2025, a recent report published (1) by the Women’s Committee of the National Council Resistance of Iran exposes the horrifying reality that Iranian women continue to face. The report confirms that penalties for not following the hijab law have intensified. The Iranian regime is enforcing the Chastity and Hijab Law with strict measures. The regime’s crackdown is particularly targeting female students. Universities are now heavily monitored, with security stationed at entrances, surveillance cameras installed, and 'Guidance Ambassadors' deployed to enforce hijab laws. Many female students have been expelled, suspended, or relocated to remote universities for refusing to comply. Some, like Motahareh Gooneii, have even been imprisoned for protesting, while others, such as Shaqayeq Akbari, have been suspended for speaking out against the university’s policies. At Amir Kabir University alone, over 200 students were denied entry for their dress choices. Despite this repression, student activism remains strong. Women are leading strikes and boycotts, resisting the regime’s efforts to silence them. The government, fearing growing dissent, has launched a full-scale effort to suppress universities, yet the fight for freedom continues. The slogan 'Woman, Resistance, Freedom' has become the message of women and Resistance Units in Iran, as well as the Iranian diaspora protests. I had the opportunity to attend the International Women’s Day conference (IWD2025) (2) in Paris, which gathered political leaders, activists, and human rights defenders to shed light on the struggle for women’s rights and democracy. Among the notable speakers were: Sharron Davies MBE – Olympic Medalist, UK; Theresa Villiers – Former Minister, UK; Baroness O’Loan – Member, UK House of Lords; and Helen Goodman – Former UK Shadow Minister. The event showcased the vital role of women in the fight for freedom, with Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), delivering a powerful keynote address. In her speech, 'Women, Pioneers of Freedom,' she honoured the countless Iranian heroines who have faced arrest, torture, and execution for resisting the regime. Mrs. Rajavi emphasised that the fight for women’s freedom is a 44-year-long struggle against religious fascism in Iran. She pointed out that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei himself acknowledges this battle as a ‘civil war,’ proving the regime’s reliance on oppression and nuclear threats for its survival. However, she confidently declared that the regime’s collapse is imminent, drawing parallels to the Shah’s (former dictator in Iran) overthrow decades ago. Mrs. Rajavi further criticised the monarchical and clerical systems, both of which marginalise women and exclude them from power. She denounced the absolute authority granted to the Supreme Leader and reaffirmed that Iranian women are at the forefront of the movement to bring democracy and equality to their country. In February 2025 alone, 100 people were executed in Iran, and currently, political prisoners Behrouz Ehsani and Mehdi Hassani face imminent execution. These cases are not isolated; countless political prisoners are at risk as the regime seeks to silence opposition through fear and death. The fight of my sisters in Iran will not stop until the country is free. On behalf of Iranian women worldwide, I urge global leaders to stand with the Iranian people and particularly the suppressed women. It is time to end appeasement policies and demand that all negotiations with the Iranian regime be conditional on halting executions, repealing the hijab law, and ending gender-based oppression. In solidarity, 650 prominent women from 80 countries across five continents have signed a statement supporting Mrs. Maryam Rajavi’s call to condemn the oppressive chastity and hijab law. The statement also endorses her 10-Point Plan for a democratic transition (3) and the 12-point plan (4) for women's freedoms. It amplifies her message: 'No to compulsory hijab, no to compulsory religion, and no to compulsory government.' This movement represents a global stand for women's rights and democracy. The women of Iran are leading a revolution. It is our duty to support them in their fight for justice, equality, and freedom.

Fusion Energy, Eni And UKAEA To Build The World’s Largest And Mos...	The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), the UK’s national organisation responsible for the research and delivery of sustainable fusion energy, and Eni, have entered into a collaboration agreement to jointly conduct research and development activities in the field of fusion energy. The collaboration primary starts with the construction of the world’s largest and most advanced tritium fuel cycle facility, a vital fuel for future fusion power stations. The 'UKAEA-Eni H3AT (pronounced ‘heat’) Tritium Loop Facility', located at Culham Campus will be complete in 2028. Tritium recovery and re-use will play a fundamental role in the supply and generation of the fuel in future fusion power plants and will be crucial in making the technology increasingly efficient. Fusion is a form of energy whereby the power of the Sun is replicated on Earth. The fusion process sees two hydrogen isotopes fuse together under intense heat and pressure to form a helium atom, releasing large amounts of emissions-free energy through a safe, cleaner and virtually inexhaustible process. Fusion energy could be transformational to contribute to energy security and decarbonisation. The 'UKAEA-Eni H3AT Tritium Loop Facility' is designed to serve as a world-class facility providing industry and academia the opportunity to study how to process, store and recycle tritium. UKAEA and Eni will collaborate to develop advanced technological solutions in fusion energy and related technologies, including skills transfer initiatives. Eni will contribute to the H3AT project with its expertise in managing and developing large-scale projects, helping to de-risk its roadmap. This partnership combines UKAEA’s extensive expertise in fusion research and development with Eni’s established industrial-scale capabilities in plant engineering, commissioning, and operations. UK Climate Minister, Kerry McCarthy, said: 'We are proud to be at the forefront of global innovation in clean energy fusion technologies, and this collaboration with Eni marks a significant step towards unlocking the potential of fusion energy, supporting our missions for economic growth, clean power and energy independence. The UKAEA-Eni H3AT Tritium Loop Facility will not only position the UK as a leader in the development of fusion fuel technologies but also accelerate progress towards a future of safe, sustainable, and abundant clean energy.' Professor Sir Ian Chapman, CEO of UKAEA, said: 'We are delighted to be working with Eni who have shown great commitment to fusion. We believe that fusion energy can contribute to a net zero future, including going beyond the decarbonisation of electricity. The H3AT demonstration plant will set a new benchmark as the largest and most advanced tritium fuel cycle facility in the world, paving the way for innovative offerings in fusion fuel and demonstrating the UK’s leadership in this crucial area of research and development.' Claudio Descalzi, Eni CEO said: 'Fusion energy is meant to revolutionise the global energy transition path, accelerating the decarbonisation of our economic and industrial systems, helping to spread access to energy, and reducing energy dependency ties within a more equitable transition framework. Eni is strongly committed to various areas of research and development of this complex technology, in which it has always firmly believed. Today with our UK partners we are laying the foundations for further progress towards the goal of fusion which—if we consider its enormous scope of technological innovation—is increasingly concrete and not so far off in time. To continue this virtuous development, international system-level technological partnerships like this one are indispensable'. Eni supports a socially fair energy transition with the aim of promoting efficient and progressively more sustainable access to energy resources. Eni places innovation at the centre of its strategic vision and it has transformed the businesses by investing significantly in research, development, and the implementation of technologies to progressively decarbonising its energy mix and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. UKAEA’s mission is to lead the delivery of sustainable fusion energy and maximise the scientific and economic benefit. It aims to solve the challenges of this new energy source, from design through to decommissioning with world-leading science and engineering. UKAEA enables partners to design, deliver, and operate commercial fusion power plants around the globe and fosters the creation of clusters that accelerate innovation and help drive economic growth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl8_b2zlU8YvJ	2025-03-07T09:42:13-08:00	
Artificial Intelligence And Strategic Transformation In The Indo-...	The Indo-Pacific, a vast and geopolitically significant region stretching from the east coast of Africa to the Pacific Islands, has emerged as a focal point of global technological evolution. At the heart of this transformation lies artificial intelligence (AI), a disruptive force reshaping economic, security, and strategic dynamics. As countries in the Indo-Pacific harness AI for military applications, economic growth, and governance, its impact is both promising and concerning. AI-driven automation, big data analytics, and machine learning are being deployed to enhance competitiveness, fortify national security, and drive social transformation. However, the rise of AI also presents challenges, including ethical dilemmas, cyber vulnerabilities, workforce displacement, and geopolitical tensions. This article explores the multifaceted use and impact of AI in the Indo-Pacific, highlighting its role in economic development, security and defense, governance, and diplomatic interactions while critically examining the risks and challenges associated with its adoption. AI and Economic Development in the Indo-Pacific Transforming Industry and Trade The Indo-Pacific is home to some of the world's largest economies, including China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, alongside dynamic emerging markets such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. AI is playing a crucial role in accelerating economic growth by optimizing supply chains, improving manufacturing efficiency, and enhancing digital trade. Manufacturing and Smart Automation: Countries like China and Japan are leading the way in AI-driven smart manufacturing, integrating robotics and AI-powered systems into production lines to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. The 'Made in China 2025' strategy emphasizes AI as a cornerstone of industrial modernization, while Japan's Society 5.0 initiative aims to harmonize AI with human workers in a highly automated society. Agriculture and Resource Management: AI applications in agriculture, such as precision farming, soil monitoring, and predictive analytics, are helping countries like India and Indonesia maximize agricultural output while minimizing resource wastage. AI-driven irrigation systems and pest control mechanisms are improving food security in the region. Financial Technology (FinTech): AI-powered FinTech solutions, including algorithmic trading, fraud detection, and digital banking, are transforming financial systems in the Indo-Pacific. Singapore and Australia are pioneering AI-driven financial regulatory mechanisms, ensuring greater transparency and efficiency in banking operations. Workforce Disruptions and Opportunities While AI-driven automation enhances productivity, it also disrupts traditional job markets. Countries like India, with a massive workforce dependent on traditional industries, face the challenge of reskilling workers to adapt to AI-driven transformations. Governments across the region are investing in digital literacy and AI education to prepare future generations for AI-centric economies. AI in Security and Defense: Strategic Implications Militarization of AI in the Indo-Pacific The Indo-Pacific is a region marked by strategic rivalries, particularly between China, the United States, and India. AI is increasingly becoming a cornerstone of military modernization, with advanced nations integrating AI into defense strategies. Autonomous Weapons and Drones: China and the United States are at the forefront of developing AI-powered autonomous weapons, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) capable of decision-making without direct human intervention. India and Australia are also investing in AI-driven defense capabilities to strengthen their military preparedness. Cyber Warfare and AI-Driven Threats: AI is revolutionizing cybersecurity by enabling advanced threat detection and response mechanisms. However, it also introduces new vulnerabilities, as AI-powered cyberattacks become more sophisticated.

Regional cooperation in AI governance, regulatory frameworks, and multilateral partnerships will be crucial in ensuring AI's benefits are equitably distributed while mitigating risks. Conclusion AI is a double-edged sword in the Indo-Pacific. While it offers unprecedented economic, security, and governance opportunities, it also amplifies strategic rivalries, ethical dilemmas, and societal disruptions. The region's future will depend on how well governments, industries, and international institutions navigate the complexities of AI adoption, ensuring it serves humanity rather than becoming a tool for domination and division.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl4U0VkLp0ZGj	2025-03-07T09:40:42-08:00	
Robert Reich: The Biggest Ponzi Scheme In History – OpEd	I remain optimistic about the longer term, but I still awaken each morning with a sense of dread. I’m sure some of you do, too. Start with Elon Musk’s bonkers comment that Social Security is 'the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.' In a Ponzi scheme, a con artist lures investors into a fake investment project, pockets the cash, and then gets new 'investors' to funnel their cash to the earlier investors — until there are no new recruits and the whole thing collapses. The last ones in are suckers left holding worthless bags. Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme. It’s a high-functioning, universal, and exceptionally efficient part of the American social safety net — the opposite of a Ponzi scheme. Which is why the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose cutting it. Social Security is a simple 'pay as you go' program. Current workers, via the payroll tax, fund payouts for retirees and disabled people. In 2024, about 1 in 5 U.S. residents received Social Security. I used to be a trustee of the Social Security trust fund. I know what I’m talking about. As the Social Security Administration explains, 'In 2025, when you work, about 85 cents of every Social Security tax dollar you pay goes to a trust fund. This fund pays monthly benefits to current retirees and their families and to surviving spouses and children of workers who have died. About 15 cents goes to a trust fund that pays benefits to people with disabilities and their families.' The only reason that the Social Security trust fund is slowly running out of money is the trustees never anticipated that so much of the nation’s total income would be in the hands of so few people (such as Elon Musk). The simple way to fix this is to lift the cap on income subject to Social Security payroll taxes, which is now $176,100. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg fulfilled their 2025 Social Security payroll tax obligations a few minutes past midnight on January 1. Most Americans continue paying payroll taxes all year. If you want to see a real Ponzi scheme, look no further than the crypto investments Musk and Trump have hyped. Trump’s new cryptocurrency, '$Trump,' soared and then crashed, just like every other Ponzi scheme. It generated enormous profits for insiders like Trump, but a cumulative $2 billion in losses for more than 800,000 other investors. Trump claims ignorance. 'I don’t know if it benefited' me, he said. 'I don’t know much about it.' (The Trump family and its business partners earned nearly $100 million in trading fees alone on the coin.) Musk has been promoting 'dogecoin' since 2019. In the days following Trump’s announcement of the launch of Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the value of dogecoin soared over 70 percent. Since then, it’s dropped like a rock. Another classic Ponzi scheme. With Trump now in office, crypto is back to its Ponzi ways. It’s emerging from a four-year federal crackdown on crypto fraud, market manipulation, and other scams following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX in 2022 — one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in recent memory. Tomorrow, Trump is even holding a 'crypto summit' at which he’ll promote the idea of a federal crypto reserve that will give crypto schemes a temporary boost by increasing demand for them. But why should American taxpayers foot the bill for a crypto reserve? The most obvious winner will be Trump, whose own crypto venture carries millions of dollars in tokens that are to be included in the reserve. Other winners will be crypto executives, many of whom donated extensively to Trump’s reelection effort. One example: Ripple, whose XRP token is one of the five that Trump said would be included in the reserve — and which donated $45 million to an industrywide PAC that sought to help elect Trump and other Republicans. Trump’s crypto efforts are ways to curry his favor by paying him off. Consider Justin Sun, a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur whom the Securities and Exchange Commission charged with securities fraud in March 2023. After Trump was elected in 2024, Sun bought $30 million worth of Trump’s World Liberty Financial crypto tokens, putting $18 million directly into Trump’s pockets. Since then, Sun has invested another $45 million in WLF. Altogether, Sun’s investments have netted Trump more than $50 million. Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission just dropped its prosecution of Sun. The SEC also dropped its case against the crypto trading platform Coinbase after the platform donated $75 million to a political action committee associated with Trump and $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. To top it off, the SEC just ruled that 'memecoins' aren’t securities, meaning that Trump’s novelty crypto tokens won’t be subject to any regulatory oversight. An open invitation to more Trump Ponzi schemes. My real dread has to do with the much bigger Ponzi scheme that Trump and Musk are peddling. They’re promising huge 'savings' from destroying the federal government — including programs like Social Security and Medicaid — savings that will go to America’s wealthy and big corporations in the form of tax cuts. At Musk’s urging, the Social Security Administration recently announced it will consolidate the current 10 regional offices it maintains into four and cut at least 7,000 jobs from an agency already at a 50-year staffing low. The Republican budget recently pushed through the House cuts over $880 billion out of Medicaid. Who will get left holding the bag? Most Americans. Zoom out and you’ll see the biggest Ponzi scheme of them all — the entire Trump 2 regime. Trump is promising to 'make America great again' by raising tariffs, deporting more than 11 million people, taking a wrecking ball to the federal government, pulverizing democracy, and joining Putin and other global dictators. Trump is the con artist behind this giant Ponzi scheme. He lured voters into this fake MAGA project, pocketed some of the cash and rewarded his billionaire backers and friends (including Musk) with more, and will leave most Americans with a corrupt and decimated society. I’m still optimistic about our power to overcome this and our resilience in bouncing back from it. But the dread I feel when I open my eyes in the morning concerns the sheer magnitude of the largest and most cynical Ponzi scheme in history.

Giving New Lease Of Life To 160-Year-Old School For Girl-Students...	Long before the western world had realised the power of education to transform society, in the Princely State of Udaipur-Mewar in Rajasthan was established the first-ever school for girl-students in 1864 near The City Palace of Udaipur. It was during the reign of Maharana Shambhu Singh that the school, exclusively for girl students, opened its doors. On International Women's Day, it is appropriate to laud this singular achievement as the school - the H.H. The Maharana Girls High School - was located quite in the heart of the city of Udaipur ensuring enrolment of the maximum number of girl-students. Said Dr Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar of Udaipur, trustee of the Maharana of Mewar Charitable Foundation (MMCF), 'What transpired in 1864 with the setting up of the H.H. The Maharana Girls High School is nothing short of being revolutionary by any yardstick. Not only did my illustrious forefather, Maharana Shambhu Singh, establish the school for girls, he ensured its continuity. It should also be remembered that the Maharana was not formally educated himself, yet he gave paramount importance to formal education, and promoting opportunities for girl students to benefit from education. I must add that over these 160 years, education and promotion, establishment of educational institutions have been a continuing priority for the Maharanas of Mewar.' Through the 1880’s to 1940’s, every generation of the Maharanas contributed to the growth of education: high schools, universities and institutes were set up during the reigns of Maharana Fateh Singh and Maharana Bhupal Singh. A major contribution was made by Maharana Fateh Singhji towards the establishment of the Banaras Hindu University. Similarly grants to Mayo College, Ajmer and other prestigious centres of education were routinely made. Even though the H.H. The Maharana Girls High School, now known as the Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School (GGSSS), was being administered by the District Education Officer (Secondary), Udaipur under the Directorate of Education of the Rajasthan government, the MMCF continued its commitment towards the maintenance of the school. In 2014, it was reported that the main building of the school needed major repairs and restoration. When the school authorities approached Arvind Singh Mewar of Udaipur, chairman and managing trustee of MMCF to repair and restore the main building, the Board of Trustees of MMCF pulled out all stops to support the project. The GGSSS, though it had gained prominence in the region over the years, had made insufficient investment made towards repairs and maintenance of the school infrastructure. Consequently, the GGSSS building was in a dilapidated state. Moreover, the District Education Officer, the authority responsible for the school expressed her inability to get any funds released from the Government for the GGSSS. For MMCF, the historic relationship between the GGSSS and the House of Mewar was sacrosanct. 'We also had vast experience to undertake restoration projects in such buildings, with the in-house availability of numerous consultants, a large pool of master craftsmen and traditional skilled workmen,' said Dr. Mayank Gupta, CEO of the Foundation. MMCF was fully committed towards the restoration of GGSSS, without charging any fee for any work undertaken. It was expected that an acknowledgment for its contribution in executing this project be placed on record and displayed on the premises.

Photo credit: Media Office, The City Palace, Udaipur On 17 July 2014, the restoration project commenced with Ms Nivritti Kumari Mewar of Udaipur doing the honours of putting the first paste of lime on the wall. It was planned that the eastern and western façade of the school building would be restored in Phase 1. When it was time for the 150th anniversary celebrations on 28 January 2015, the GGSSS school had been given a new lease of life. MMCF spent ₹33 lakhs on the project through its internal funding. The restoration story did not end with 2015, says Dr Mayank Gupta. 'MMCF undertook the second phase of restoration and renovation which included a big hall, four classrooms and two laboratories on the first floor of the school building. The project cost was ₹30 lakh and we titled the project as ‘Education in Udaipur’ initiated by MMCF.' In the third phase, extensive repairs and renovation of ground floor consisting of six classrooms, toilets of the school building and entrance ramps was completed by July 2016. The ongoing restoration process is being carried out by experienced conservation professionals and traditional craftsmen. During the 150th anniversary celebrations of the GGSSS, the omnibus publication ‘Haqiqat Bahida’ an eye glass view of Maharana Shambhu Singh’s life was launched. The Maharana had been the 71st Custodian of The House of Mewar (period of reign: 1861 – 1874 AD), and the Haqiqat Bahida is the daily journal of The City Palace. Ms. Nivritti Kumari Mewar of Udaipur launched the publication at the school premises, acknowledging the work done by MMCF officials, Mr. Bhupendra Singh Auwa, and researchers-writers of the Maharana Mewar Historical Publications Trust and the Maharana Mewar Research Institute. The Haqiqat Bahidas go a long way in shattering the myth propagated by the British rulers that the Princely Courts did not have systems for documentation nor were records catalogued. At the Maharana Mewar Research Institute hand-written detailed Court records of the last five hundred years are available. The digitization and catalogue work has been in progress, said Dr Gupta, pointing out that researchers from India, UK and the US have been utilizing the records.

Photo credit: Media Office, The City Palace, Udaipur Government awards The Government of Rajasthan has been appreciative of the efforts of the MMCF to voluntarily restore and develop the heritage school. In fact in 2015, the prestigious 21st Bhamashah State Level Award was bestowed to the MMCF by the Department of Education, Government of Rajasthan for the development of Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School. This award is given out to individuals, corporate and organisations who have spent more than ₹10 lakh in a financial year for the betterment and development of Government Schools in Rajasthan. In 2017, at the 23rd Bhamashah Samman, MMCF was once again honoured by the-then chief minister Ms Vasundhara Raje and state officials. In June 2023 further demonstrating its commitment to the school’s betterment, MMCF undertook a painting project infusing the school premises with a vibrant new look. This comprehensive renovation has transformed the school, creating a modern and inspiring learning environment. The renovation work at GGSSS is a beacon of MMCF’s dedication to preserving the school’s heritage with the objective of providing better educational amenities for the girl-students, said Dr Gupta. Presently 500 girls are studying in the school. On 2 November 2023, Dr. Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar sponsored the complete tuition fees for all the girls at GGSSS for the academic year 2023-2024. 'We must make concerted efforts to strengthen girls’ education and ensure universal access. Many girls yearn to learn, yet domestic or financial constraints force them to abandon their studies. I see my contribution as simply upholding the time-honored Mewar tradition of promoting knowledge,' he said, with the humility that comes with compassion and conviction in one’s legacies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvly0zIz6vxNFk	2025-03-07T09:38:13-08:00	
NATO Deputy Secretary General Highlights French Support And Discu...	NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Shekerinska visited Paris today (7 March 2025), meeting French senior officials to discuss the current security situation, and Alliance priorities. In Paris, Ms Shekerinska praised France’s pivotal role amid today’s volatile global agenda. She commended France for its significant contributions in support of Ukraine, stressing that battlefield needs remain urgent and that a lasting peace requires unified efforts from Europe, the United States, and Ukraine. 'We cannot have a Minsk 3.0,' she remarked, thanking France for its proactive leadership and engagement with Allied nations. She emphasised unity as NATO’s core strength. Deputy Secretary General Shekerinska also expressed gratitude for France’s substantial contributions to NATO’s deterrence and defence, including its deployments to NATO Forces in Romania and Estonia. She welcomed President Macron’s openness to raising defence spending to 3.5% of GDP, encouraging all Allies to invest more. On NATO-EU cooperation, she underscored the need for complementary and interoperable defence efforts. Ms Shekerinska’s meeting in Paris was preceded by a visit with NATO Permanent Representatives to Istres Air Base in southern France, which included briefings on French nuclear deterrence and its strategic role within the Alliance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvlyPbNtJYvzz5	2025-03-07T09:37:01-08:00	
China: Communism Means Zero Freedom Of Expression – OpEd	While the world watches the race of competition between the USA and China in imposing tariffs on products from other countries, even more, perhaps more substantial differences than those in the management of the economic policy of the two countries are coming to light. These differences have to do with freedom of speech and respect for human rights. In the West (which until recently, no matter how difficult it is to admit, was dominated by woke culture), we have such freedom of speech that allows us to openly disagree either through statements in the media or through the freedom of assembly with the ills of the government and society. To the perception of some that the capitalist states of Europe, which follow developments in America with a twenty-year delay, are restricting freedom of speech, the latest developments of blatant human rights violations by the communist state of China provide the best response. The Chinese government imposed systematic repression of human rights across the country in 2024, Human Rights Watch stated in the Global Report 2025 in early March. The repression of fundamental human rights was particularly severe in the Tibetan regions and in Xinjiang among the Uyghurs. Human Rights Watch examined human rights practices in more than 100 countries in a 546-page global report, in its 35th edition. In much of the world, Executive Director Tirana Hassan writes in her introductory essay, 'the government of China repressed and unlawfully detained and imprisoned political opponents, activists, and journalists. Armed groups and government forces unlawfully killed civilians, displaced many from their homes, and obstructed access to humanitarian aid.' 'From freedom of expression to religious freedoms, the Chinese government maintains a suffocating control over the country throughout 2024,' said Maya Wang, Deputy Director of China at Human Rights Watch. She added that 'the Chinese government has imposed even stricter abusive laws and has imprisoned critics and rights defenders, while making it increasingly difficult to report government abuses across the country.' What are the living conditions under Xi Jinping's regime? The truth is that there is no independent civil society, nor freedom of expression, assembly, unionization, or religion, and human rights defenders and other perceived government critics are persecuted. The government considers culturally and ethnically distinct Tibetans and Uyghurs as threats and subjects them to particularly severe repression. Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs remain imprisoned as part of the government's crimes against humanity in the region. It has also terminated long-protected individual freedoms in Hong Kong. Beyond the Uyghurs, of course, religious minorities are also in the crosshairs of the Communist Party. The Chinese government allows people to practice only five officially recognized religions in approved venues and maintains control over personnel appointments, publications, finances, and applications for theological schools. The concept of minority protection is an unknown notion in China. The police systematically arrest, detain, and harass leaders and members of various 'illegal' religious groups, including those Catholic and Protestant communities (or 'house churches') that refuse to join the official churches, and disrupt their peaceful activities. Throughout 2024, these individuals were charged and convicted of fabricated crimes. In July, Zhang Qingli, leader of a house church called the Ren'ai Reformed Church, was sentenced to five years in prison for 'inciting subversion' and 'fraud.' The government continues to classify certain religious groups, particularly Falun Gong, as 'evil cults' and subjects their members to harassment, arbitrary detention, and torture. In October, the Vatican renewed the 2018 China-Vatican agreement for the third time, which gives Chinese authorities the power to appoint Catholic bishops, while they continue to persecute Catholic house churches and their leaders, particularly Bishop Cui Tai. The novel 1984 by George Orwell unfortunately aligns in many ways with the curtailment of freedom of speech by the administration of Xi Jinping. The Chinese government controls all major information channels, such as television, radio, and print publications. The 'Great Firewall' blocks people in China from accessing information that is usually available on the internet. It also imposes ideological control on the educational system. While most people in China usually self-censor, certain stories—those that do not challenge the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party—occasionally reach the wider public. An investigative report by a Chinese media outlet on cooking oil contamination in July and the post by Chinese lawyer Yi Se-gua in August revealing an illegal human organ trade drew widespread public attention. Official censorship and penalties quickly followed. There have been many instances of censorship throughout the year. In January, the Shanghai police arrested director Chen Pinlin ('Plato') for a documentary about the 2022 White Paper protests. The authorities continued to update the country's censorship and surveillance regime to increase control. In February, the Official Secrets Act was revised, and the implementation regulations were published in July, extending the already overly broad scope of the law. In July, the government proposed a new national digital identity system. The cards, which are ostensibly optional, would give state agencies even more capability to monitor people online and offline. Previously tolerated topics have become forbidden. With the Chinese economy faltering, the government has banned discussions about its economic policies and punished those who criticize them. In September, a top economist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences disappeared after criticizing President Xi's economic policies in a private WeChat group. Also in September, Beijing police detained artist Zhao Zhen, who resides in the U.S. and is known for his work criticizing the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong, for 'slandering the heroes and martyrs of China' during his visit to the country. Both topics—the economic policies of China and the destructive legacy of Mao—were subjects that could be openly discussed in China until recently. The stringent information control by the Chinese government has international implications, as it has targeted exiled critics of China. Among them are intellectuals who cannot find fertile ground in China and leave for abroad where they broadcast what they have experienced. However, Chinese government officials often find them even abroad. The journalist nicknamed 'Master Li,' who collects news and videos from all over China and broadcasts them on X, revealed that he had been harassed in Italy, where he resides. The Chinese police had also interrogated his followers in China. In August 2024, investigative reports revealed how individuals connected to the Chinese government had intimidated and attacked Chinese, Hong Kong, and Tibetan protesters during Xi Jinping's visit to San Francisco earlier. The nine-year sentence of Taiwanese political activist Yang Chih-yuan for 'separatism' by the Chinese government and the suspended death sentence of naturalized Australian writer Yang Hengjun for 'espionage' have caused widespread global attention. In February 2022, it was found that the prestigious Hugo Award for science fiction had self-censored and excluded certain authors from consideration for the 2023 award before the ceremony in China. The French Enlightenment thinker Voltaire said, 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it,' or 'I do not agree with a word you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say what you believe.' Certainly, the Western capitalist society we live in is not perfect, as there are significant areas for improvement in the realm of the welfare state. However, looking at examples of communist countries like China, we understand that the beginning and end of change lie in the fundamental individual political right of a person to freely criticize the wrongdoings of the regime they live under. After all, this characteristic is the most important aspect of our human existence: the right to self-negation and negation in general.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl2eAz6S70lLV	2025-03-07T09:35:18-08:00	
Blasphemy Allegations: Pakistan Must Reconsider Its Anti-Blasphem...	A Lahore sessions court recently sentenced a man to death for committing blasphemy. Last month, six individuals were sentenced to death in under a week for sharing blasphemous content online—a court in Rawalpindi issued death sentences to four persons, and an Islamabad sessions court handed out capital punishment to two individuals. Although the country has not executed anyone yet for committing blasphemy, several suspects have been killed in the past—targeted killings, police encounters, mob lynchings, and burning the accused alive. Dr. Shah Nawaz Kumbhar, accused of sharing blasphemous content on social media, was shot dead by the police in an alleged staged encounter in September last year. The week before this tragic incident, another blasphemy accused, Abdul Ali alias Lala from Quetta, was killed by a police officer in a similar fashion. In May last year, a mob attacked a 72-year-old man in Punjab after accusing him of disrespecting the Quran. The man later died in the hospital. A month after that, a mob broke into a police station in Swat, took a blasphemy suspect held there, and burned him alive along with the police station and police vehicles. The incidents might seem to be spontaneous, but the pattern and frequency of such incidents suggest the perpetrators are driven by hate and extremism that seem less spontaneous and more the result of systematic brainwashing, mixing religion with state institutions, and hate mongering—hate that refuses to die even after the murder. For instance, the radicals took Dr. Kumbhar’s dead body and tried to burn it to prevent his family from giving him a dignified funeral. The burning of the blasphemy suspect in Swat was recorded on videos with the crowd cheering as if it was a bonfire to celebrate some festival. First blasphemy accusation-related murder in Pakistan Although the year 2024 saw a number of murders related to blasphemy allegations, such incidents aren’t new in Pakistan. The first murder, or rather mob lynching, related to a blasphemy accusation in Pakistan occurred soon after its independence. In 1948, a young military officer, Major Mahmud, an Ahmadi man in Quetta, was 'literally stoned and stabbed to death, his entire gut having come out.'. He was returning from a visit to a patient and happened to pass by the place where the meeting of the Muslim Railways Employees Association was being held. Maulvis were addressing the crowd and giving speeches on the subject of khatm-e-nubuwwat (end of the prophethood). References were made to the Ahmadiyya community and their 'sin' (Ahmadis are not considered Muslims by the orthodox Muslim groups). Mahmud’s car stopped accidentally nearby and failed to restart. The mob came, and the young officer was lynched to death. Two more persons from the Ahmadiyya community were killed in 1950. After this, there was no blasphemy related death until 1992, as per the data in a report by Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS). The number of blasphemy-related cases and deaths increased during the 1990s and afterwards. Blasphemy accusations, Religious Intolerance, Nationalism The tendency to make unsubstantiated blasphemy allegations is rooted in religious intolerance which in turn has been linked with nationalism in Pakistan. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, declared in his famous 11 Aug 1947 speech, 'You are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques, or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the State…we are all equal citizens of one State.' But his successors did the exact opposite. Efforts were made to block his famous speech from the mainstream media and textbooks. Religion was increasingly mixed with the state affairs and was intertwined with the Pakistani identity. India was projected as Hindu and Pakistan was projected as Muslim. Aspersions were cast on the loyalty of non-Muslims towards Pakistan. Since Pakistan was created out of India, Pakistan’s forefathers found it easy to build a national identity that was anti-India. Pakistan was created for the Muslims of the subcontinent; hence, there was the notion of making it an Islamic state despite the concerns of leaders like Husain Shaheed Suhrawardy, who didn’t want Pakistan to turn into a communal state and wanted a 'mutual relationship between the dominion of Pakistan and the sister dominion of India.'. Religious intolerance was also promoted by Pakistan's military regimes. Field Marshal Ayub Khan and General Yahya Khan 'characterized Hindus as ‘the other' and emphasized Islam as Pakistan’s raison d’etre.'. The generals didn’t hesitate in mixing religion with the institution of the army. When the 1965 war broke out with India, Syed Abul Ala Maududi, founder of the Jamaat-e-Islami Party, declared a jihad to liberate Kashmir on Radio Pakistan at the behest of President Ayub Khan. This language is used even today. For instance, General Asim Munir announced last year, 'We do not consider those as Pakistanis who do not follow Shariah and the Constitution.' A year before that, he called the Pakistan army 'the army of martyrs whose motto is imaan, taqwa aur jihad fi Sabeelillah (faith, piety, and jihad in the Path of Allah)'. During the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, the army committed atrocities against all Bengalis but Hindus were especially targeted. Big yellow 'H's' were painted on properties owned by Hindus for easier identification. General Zia-ul-Haq took the process of Islamization of the military as well as the society to another level. It was he who changed the motto of the Pakistan Army from 'ittehad, yaqeen aur tanzeem' (unity, faith, and discipline) to 'imaan, taqwa, jihad fi sabilillah' (faith, piety, holy war in the path of Allah). Intensification and Islamization of Blasphemy Laws Pakistan inherited the blasphemy laws from the British, but the country intensified and made them exclusionary in the sense that the laws provide for severe punishments when the blasphemy is committed against Islam or its holy figures. There were calls by the hardliners to declare Ahmadis non-Muslims as early as 1953 but the state rejected these demands. PM Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, a rather secular leader, finally fulfilled this demand through the second amendment of Pakistan’s constitution in 1974. After Zia-ul-Haq took the reins of the country in a 1977 coup, things went further downhill. He brought a number of legal changes between 1980 and 1986 that made the blasphemy laws more severe and further underlined that Ahmadis weren’t Muslims. The effects were seen in the subsequent years and are continued to be seen even today. Only 14 blasphemy-related cases were reported till 1986 after which the number shot up and from 1987 to 2017 over 1500 people were charged under blasphemy laws. As of 2021, Pakistan has seen 89 extrajudicial killings pertaining to blasphemy accusations. 79 of these killings occurred after 2000. The actual numbers are believed to be higher since not all cases are reported. Section 298-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) made the use of insulting remarks in respect of holy personages punishable by three years. Section 298-B made it unlawful for the Ahmadiyya community to refer to their call for prayer as azaan and their place of worship as masjid. Section 298-C prohibited the Ahmadiyya group from calling themselves Muslims and their faith Islam and also forbade them from preaching their faith. It also punishes them for hurting the religious feelings of the Muslims. Article 295-A of PPC provides imprisonment for up to two years, a fine, or both for outraging the religious feelings of any community whereas section 295-B provides for life imprisonment for desecrating the Holy Quran and section 295-C provides capital punishment for using derogatory remarks in respect of the Holy Prophet. The incidents of desecration of churches, temples, and bibles do happen in the country and hurt not only the sentiments of religious minorities but also hurt their lives and properties. But these incidents are not portrayed as blasphemous. The 2023 Jaranwala incident made quite the headlines, where 22 churches and 80 homes belonging to Christian families were destroyed in response to unverified allegations of blasphemy. The law is invoked when the desecration of Islamic holy entities occurs. After the mob vandalized churches and homes in Jaranwala, instead of charging the perpetrators under Section 295-A, the police registered an FIR against the accused under sections 295-B (defiling of the Quran) and 295-C (derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad) of the PPC. When blasphemy allegations are made, the argument of the accusers is that committing blasphemy in Pakistan is prohibited by law, and if someone violates the law, they must be punished accordingly. It’s a different matter altogether that the due process of law is thrown out the window and the accused is killed before they are brought before the court, as seen in the cases mentioned earlier. Blasphemy allegations have become weapons of persecution, mob lynchings, and lawlessness in Pakistan. Blasphemy laws are often used as cover for these evils. Blasphemy laws, if at all, should exist to protect the religious sentiments of the people of all faiths equally and to maintain the communal harmony in society. They should not be discriminatory against minority groups and a tool to torture them. While it’s unlikely for any political party in power to undo the blasphemy laws, a gradual approach towards the reforms must be adopted, and whenever a case of blasphemy is reported, an objective investigation and the due process of law must take place.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl5s92If7RKzr	2025-03-07T09:33:37-08:00	
Pakistan: Where Army Wields Power Sans Accountability – OpEd	He may have said it out of conviction or perhaps to please Rawalpindi. But by demanding that former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa 'must be questioned about why he resettled these [Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP] militants,' Pakistan Defence Minister Khwaja Asif could well have unwittingly annoyed the top brass of the country’s all-powerful military [appropriately referred to as the 'establishment'], which is well known for fiercely protecting the dubious actions of its leadership from public scrutiny. Even at the cost of digressing, it would be in order to mention that some may argue that the arrest and ongoing court martial of former Director General [DG] of Pakistan army’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence [ISI] Lt Gen Faiz Hameed [Retired] contradicts claims regarding existence of some sort of covert arrangement within the army that provides extra-constitutional immunity to Generals. While Lt Gen Hameed’s case may give the impression that as far as Rawalpindi is concerned, no one irrespective of rank is above the law, however, this notion is far from reality. The fact of the matter is that the former DGISI’s trial is part of an elaborate plan entailing the killing of two birds with one stone conceived by Pakistan army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir with twin objectives. One, securing his own position as Pakistan’s supreme leader by politically emasculating Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf [PTI] chief Imran Khan who has dared question Rawalpindi’s extrajudicial authority and is hence a potential threat, and two, avenging the humiliation of being unceremoniously removed from the prestigious post of DG ISI by Khan in 2019 to make place for the PTI chief’s favourite Lt Gen Hameed. Returning to Defence Minister Asif’s demand for questioning Gen Bajwa, there’s no doubt that the Pakistan army is, through omission/commission [or both], solely responsible for the massive influx of TTP terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP], particularly in Swat Valley in 2022. Readers would recall that in August that year, Swat Valley saw massive public protests against burgeoning presence of TTP fighters and this issue acquired such menacing proportions that it even came up for discussion in the National Assembly with Defence Minister Asif expressing serious apprehensions regarding success of the then ongoing peace talks between the army and TTP that were cloaked in secrecy. However, Pakistan army’s media wing Inter Services Public Relations [ISPR] inexplicably played down this serious threat. It issued a statement that 'During the past few days, a misperception about the alleged presence of [a] large number of proscribed-organisation TTP’s armed members in Swat Valley has been created on social media,' it outrightly rejected the same calling it 'grossly exaggerated and misleading.' To give this big fat lie a semblance of authenticity, ISPR added that 'Presence of a small number of armed men on a few mountain tops between Swat and Dir has been observed, located far away from the population.' Since this deliberate attempt by Rawalpindi to deceive both the executive and public through an official communication occurred under Gen Bajwa’s charge, the defence minister’s view that the then army chief should be questioned is perfectly in order as well as essential from the accountability angle. However, given the embarrassing details that would emerge should this happen, there’s no possibility of Gen Munir giving a go-ahead to this request. How damaging the disclosures could be can be gauged by the source-based revelation by British-Pakistani journalist Gul Bukhari that the Pakistan army’s secret deal with TTP involved 'signing away fundamental rights of citizens in return for peace'! Furthermore, since no Pakistan army chief has ever been asked to justify his ill-considered actions that harmed the nation, why should Gen Munir set a precedent that could threaten Rawalpindi's vulnerability? Field Marshal Ayub Khan didn’t have to explain the rationale of going ahead with ‘Operation Gibraltar’, a ludicrous military plan to wrest control of J&K by inciting a local insurrection orchestrated and led by regular soldiers disguised as razakars [civilian volunteers] that pushed Pakistan into a full blown war with India in 1965. Gen Yahya Khan was never called to give reasons for approving ‘Operation Torchlight’ in 1971, a pogrom that gave the army unbridled powers to indiscriminately kill, maim, torture and violate civilians in what was then known as East Pakistan that accelerated the country’s dismemberment. Gen Pervez Musharraf was the only army chief who had to face charges of high treason, as the judiciary refused to be cowed down by Rawalpindi. But he never appeared in court, thanks to the personal intervention of the then Pakistan army chief Gen Raheel Sharif. Gen Musharraf himself revealed that 'I have been his [Gen Sharif’s] boss and I have been the army chief before him. He helped [me] out …' He went on to elaborate that 'Once he [Gen Sharif] got the government to relieve the pressure that they were exerting, the courts gave their judgment and allowed me to go abroad for treatment.' True to its tradition of keeping the army top brass beyond the reach of law, the Pakistan army ensured that its former chief indefinitely extended his treatment period abroad so that he wouldn’t have to face a trial. And when Gen Musharraf took the impulsive decision to return and participate in elections as well as fight his court cases, Rawalpindi again came to his rescue. Dawn reported a source disclosing that the then DGISI Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha had 'held a meeting with him [Musharraf] in Dubai and advised him not to return to the country as the situation is not conducive for his return.' The constitution of Pakistan stipulates that 'the Federal Government shall have control and command of the Armed Forces,' and as such the Ministry of Defence is empowered to order any serving/retired member of the armed forces to be called-in for questioning. So, when the defence minister is convinced that Gen Bajwa 'must be questioned about why he resettled these [TTP] militants,' he can always order the same. However, there’s a catch- though it technically qualifies as a democracy with an elected government, in practice Pakistan has a unique military-dominant hybrid form of governance, where the army and not legislature has the final say, and the 'Dawn Leak' incident exposes the absolute power the Pakistan army enjoys. Readers would recall that in 2017, when Dawn reported that the Pakistan army top brass had been told by the government that 'military-led intelligence agencies are not to interfere if law enforcement acts against militant groups that are banned or until now considered off-limits for civilian action,' all hell broke loose. Rawalpindi demanded that this news leak be investigated at the highest levels and action taken against those responsible and the Prime Minister's Office [PMO] dutifully complied. However, when the PMO released the inquiry report, DG ISPR, who was just a two-star General publicly scoffed the same saying, 'Notification on Dawn Leak is incomplete and not in line with recommendations by the Inquiry Board. Notification is rejected.' Now, when a two-star General can outrightly 'reject' a notification issued by the PMO, how can one expect the defence minister to have the courage to summon a four-star General [albeit retired], who had once headed the Pakistan army? And therein lies Pakistan's problem.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl4HRyY6yUCqE	2025-03-07T09:31:39-08:00	
Written And Oral Scriptures Creativity – OpEd	The Qur'an (2:183) says 'Oh you who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that you may (learn) self-restraint.' What self-restraint discipline is Hinduism, Islam and Judaism trying to teach us? What spiritual benefits can humans attain when we fast? For Hindus, Krishna says in The Bhagavad-Gita Chapter 17: 8–10: 'Foods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one's existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such nourishing foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion. Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean, is food liked by people in the mode of ignorance.' For Jews, fasting should be combined with the study of Torah (the five books of Moses specifically or Jewish Scriptural texts in general). Indeed, the more one studies, the less one needs to fast. A medieval text states, 'Better to eat a little and study twice as much, for the study of Torah is superior to fasting.' Nevertheless, fasting is a very personal, experiential offering that one makes from one's own body. Study is also a personal experience, but it takes place with a text and/or a teacher and the Divine is often more readily and truly experienced in dialogue with others than in solitary meditation. But, fasting by itself does have many spiritual benefits. The sacred scriptures of the Vedas in Hinduism and the Torah in Judaism begin with centuries of extensive oral transmission of both dramatic narratives and complex priestly details. Everyone who has read the Book of Exodus in the Torah, has noted the major change that takes place after chapter 24; from dramatic narratives of escape from Egyptian oppression, and the experiencing of God's covenant revelation at Mount Sinai; to the tiny details of the Tabernacle and its priests: 'According to all that I am going to show you; use the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture, so you shall construct it.' (Exodus chapters 25: 8 to 31:11) Not only are the Tabernacle's details tiny, but all attempts to actually construct a Tabernacle according to the Torah's detailed directions, and its furniture, and its priest's garments, have failed. So why were these chapters of an unbuildable Tabernacle placed into the Torah? Perhaps because avoiding uncreative and unbuildable religious perfectionist ideals might be the lesson the Torah is teaching us. God chooses Bezalel, his assistant Oholiab, and every skilled craftsman that God has found (male or female) ( 31:1-6) Skilled craftsmen, like God, are creative. They, like the Sabbath, are the creative partners of God's covenant, and to use their creativity to reject the Sabbath is to die Jewishly. So the text suddenly turns to the Sabbath (Exodus 31:12): 'And the Lord said to Moses, 13 'Speak to the people of Israel and say, 'Above all you shall keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the Lord, sanctify you. 14 You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you.' The Sabbath was created for people. People were not created for the Sabbath. Creativity reforms the perfectionist. As Prophet King Solomon taught: 'Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?' (Ecclesiastes 7:16) 'Everyone who profanes it (the Sabbath) shall be put to death. Whoever does any (profitable) work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. Exodus 31:15 'Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any (uncreative) work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death. 16 Therefore the people of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a forever covenant. 17 It is an ongoing sign between me and the people of Israel that in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he paused and was (spiritually and vitally) refreshed.'' The seven day week now is a worldwide experience that shows the spiritual creativity of both Jews and non-Jews, and thus:18 he gave to Moses, when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.' For more than 3,200 years, the Jews kept the Sabbath experience, and the creative Sabbath experience has kept the Jewish People alive. Now the dramatic narrative of the experience of God's covenant at Mount Sinai continues until 35:3 when the tiny details of the Tabernacle continue into the details of the Jerusalem Temple's Priestly offerings which end with Leviticus 9:24. These Temple Priestly offerings ended with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 C.E. which enabled the scholarly, literary, creativity of the rabbis and Torah study, to replace the thousand years of Jerusalem's Temple Priestly animal offerings, and the twelve hundred years of looking at the high priest's complex designed garments. Most of the early Oral Torah was developed by the Pharisees during the two centuries preceding the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple; and then was greatly expanded in the post Temple two centuries by the rabbis. Judaism today is very different from Torah Judaism because the rabbis found it necessary to adapt and develop Torah laws. These adaptations, called the Oral Torah, began as early as the time of the middle of the Second Temple period. The Hanukah holiday is a good example of rabbinic development. One of the most expansive and detailed areas of rabbinic law are the regulations around dietary practice, known as kashrut. The Written Torah states twice, in Exodus 23:19 and Deuteronomy 14:21, that it is forbidden to 'boil a kid in its mother's milk.' Without further elaboration, one might understand those verses to be proscribing only the cooking of a young goat in the milk of its mother. But the rabbinic Oral Torah says that these verses indicate a vast array of practices, including the complete ban on eating any kind of land animal with any kind of dairy product, the requirement of separate sets of cooking equipment and serving utensils for meat and dairy, and the obligation to wait some period of time after eating meat before eating dairy. None of these rules are obvious from the Written Torah. The Oral Law was not universally accepted by Jews neither in antiquity nor today. In ancient times, the Sadducee Priests famously rejected the authority of the oral traditions. Among modern Jews, however, religious life would be unrecognizable without some of the traditions recorded in the Oral Law, though the three denominations differ significantly in their views of it. For Orthodox Jews, the obligations recorded in the Oral Law are as binding as those recorded in the Written Torah. Liberal Jews take a very different approach. As a general rule, Reform Judaism does not accept the binding nature of Jewish law, or halacha, seeing the Oral Law as the product of human beings operating within the assumptions and beliefs of a specific historical moment rather than an extension of divine revelation. Conservative Judaism officially accepts the binding nature of the oral tradition, but offers much more flexibility within its strictures than Orthodox Jews; and claims for modern rabbis much greater authority to depart from rabbinic rulings made many centuries ago.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl7jmhE2TKDTJ	2025-03-07T09:29:57-08:00	
Pakistan’s Maritime Vision: Transforming Gwadar Into A Global Tra...	With this immense potential, the maritime sector of Pakistan can act as a catalyst for economic expansion and regional trade connectivity and can play its role in increasing the geopolitical importance of the country. Pakistan realizes that for its key role in regional or global ventures to be validated, development of its maritime infrastructure is essential — especially Gwadar Port — as it strategically sits at a global trade crossroad. However, the country is currently embarking on a strategic plan to craft and optimize port operations, build a strong foreign investment package and turn Gwadar into a world class trade hub. In order to make Pakistan a global maritime hub, the country is developing its major ports such as Karachi, Port Qasim and Gwadar on massive infrastructure development program. Presently, Pakistan’s ports are working at 50 per cent of their potential capacity, resulting into inefficiencies that are stifling further trade expansion. Pakistan’s investment in deep sea facilities, container terminals and modern logistics is aimed at bringing port capacity to maximum and improving its trade operations. To increase port efficiency, the government intends to make the port digitalized, automated, and have an improved cargo handling mechanism to house giant vessels of up to 20,000 containers. Especially, Gwadar is the focus of these modernization efforts. Given this, Gwadar is set to become a regional transshipment hub for achieving regional trade needs in Asia, Middle East and Africa, as Gwadar is an important economic driver supported by the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Free zones, warehousing facility, integrated customs management system are some of the serious infrastructure upgrades the port is undergoing to facilitate seamless trade operations. Being situated between Arabian Sea and having good access to global trade routes, Pakistan has the potential to become one of the regional trade powerhouses. And, for the government of Azerbaijan the maritime sector is identified as a key driver for economic growth and the country’s geographic advantage is to be used in order to create the trade connectivity with Central Asian Republics (CARs), Gulf States and beyond. Investment in modern transport corridors, rail networks and road infrastructure linking Gwadar with regional markets will allow Pakistan to become a gateway to trade around the world. Moreover, Pakistan’s maritime vision is aimed at growing exports from $32 billion to $60 billion by using ports to maximum capacity. The country can reduce the related logistics costs, and improve port efficiency to give local exporters a competitive advantage that will create a more favorable ease of doing business and increase participation in international trade. In order to sustain in the long term, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) in maritime sector of Pakistan is essential. The government is planning policies to make Pakistan’s port infrastructure more investor friendly with increasing global interest in Pakistan’s port infrastructure. They encourage the development of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) near ports, tax incentives for shipping companies and public private partnership in logistics and maritime industries, for the purpose of economic growth. In the other hand, Fisheries sector is a significant component of Pakistan’s blue economy that is in the waiting for investment. It is expected that Pakistan’s seafood industry with a current value of $400 million can compete with regional players once sustainable fishing practices are adopted, modern seafood processing units are established and export facilitation measures are provided. Fisheries infrastructure is meant to be modernized to increase seafood exports by complying with international food safety standards. To metamorphose Gwadar in to a global trade hub of the world, extensive infrastructural development, streamlined regulations and world class logistics are required. As part of the development of its two main strategic ports at Gwadar in Baluchistan and Karachi, the government has the vision to operate the Gwadar deep sea port as a hub for bulk cargo and to minimize the use of the traditional ports for trade purposes. Gwadar’s potential is being unlocked thanks to the CPEC, as China has started pouring billions in the port after investing in the Gwadar Free Zone, new international airport and industrial parks. Due to port’s strategic depth, the port is now a regional shipping and logistics hub making shipping lines from all over the world bend over to won. Favorable legal and regulatory framework to ease business is being worked out and Gwadar is being developed as a lucrative destination for commercial activities for international traders and investors, he added. Pakistan’s maritime vision is very strong in exporting and diversifying its exports. Better port logistics and better trade facilitation have the ability to substantially increase the nontraditional exports like IT services, value added textiles and processed foods. In order to support export driven industries, the government has devised policies in such a way that efficient shipping services are available for the purpose of catering international customers. Like other SAIS countries, Pakistan also plans to leverage regional trade agreements which includes Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to augment its export expanse. Therefore, through enhancement of trade ties with the emerging economies of the world and regional cooperation, Pakistan can enhance its global trade share relatively reducing the dependency on traditional markets. Pakistan’s sustainable maritime development is part and parcel of the country’s long term strategy. Green port initiatives by the government aim at environmental sustainability, renewable energy solution, ports waste management. The incorporation of digital trade facilitation, paperless transactions along with ecofriendly port operations is a step by Pakistan towards synchronization of its maritime sector with the global standards of sustainability. A comprehensive maritime policy, which will spell out a way forward for future growth is to be announced by the government. Under this policy, regulatory reforms, infrastructure development, and international partnerships would be concentrated on for profitability on Pakistan’s maritime sector in the long run. To monitor policy implementation, special oversight committees and task forces will be created to ascertain if target goals will be reached effectively. Despite recent setbacks, Pakistan can become a major maritime nation through strategic investments, strengthened governance, and enhanced connectivity, and in turn promote economic growth and regional prosperity. Through allocating Gwadar into a blueprint as a global trade hub, Pakistan will benefit it’ economy, and help in making it a leading country in influencing the global trade development. Following Recommendations Develop advanced automation and digitalized systems to increase capacity of port handling and to reduce delay in operations. Boost competitiveness of export through simplifying customs procedures, improving logistics infrastructure and include digital trade platforms. Provide policies that are investor friendly and have tax incentives and regulatory framework aimed at attracting global investment in maritime infrastructure. Expand Pakistan’s export market by enhancing central Asia, Middle East, and Africa trade ties. Modern seafood processing should be invested in improved sustainable fishing practices should be adopted, standards of international compliance should be improved. Create maritime training institutes and skill development programs to develop high quality manpower. Promote the use of renewable energy, promote the reduction of carbon footprints and practice of sustainable waste management. Task forces are to be created on the basis of dedicated maritime policies, the progress of which will be monitored and evaluated from a sectoral standpoint. Promote maritime education, research and innovation to position Pakistan amongst the ranks of the maritime nations of the world in international shipping and trade. Developing supporting industries and infrastructure to maximize Gwadar’s strategic role in CPEC. 'The sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.' — Jacques Cousteau Pakistan’s maritime vision is very ambitious but, at the same time, very achievable. The strategically transforming of Gwadar into a global trade hub is destined to unlock unprecedented economic potential, lead to regional integration and qualify Pakistan as a virtuous player in the new generation of global maritime.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl3BLrZUSNRzZ	2025-03-07T09:28:27-08:00	
The ‘India Out’ Phenomenon: A New Era In South Asian Politics – O...	South Asia is witnessing a gradual shift in its geopolitical landscape which has high resistance level against India's influence in South Asian countries. The 'India Out' movement taking shape in Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan is a collective voice rising against India’s aggressive interventions. Previously seen as a regional guardian, India is today on the receiving end of allegations of political manipulation, economic coercion and even harnessing its intelligence agencies for installing India friendly leadership in its neighboring states. It is also part of larger movement of smaller South Asian nations asserting their sovereignty vis a vis India's march to be a superpower. For decades, India has presented itself as an emerging power for balancing South Asia, largely preoccupied with the rationale of intervention for the sake of regional security. Yet the tone of its maneuvers has of late increasingly begun to be seen as double edged. As China makes deep inroads into South Asia through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), India has carried out counter measures against the rising Chinese influence using a combination of diplomatic, economic pressures and intelligence operations. Publically, India wishes to have amicable relations with China, and its behavior is competitive in reality. Neighboring nations have reason to suspect India in its 'double game' of diplomacy and strategic containment. Growing discontent with Indian interference, meanwhile, has prompted the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, which have always traded and secured on India’s goodwill, to rethink their relations with New Delhi. Another aspect of the 'Rodina nadvliga' movement is in revealing the Indian attempts to tamper with affairs of domestic politics in India's neighboring states in secrecy. India’s regional ambitions have been questioned from backing pro-India leaders to suppressing nationalist movements. Sheikh Hasina Sheikh Hasina’s fall has long been considered an ally of New Delhi; it showed how far India was involved in keeping the regime that suited its interests. India's dominance in trade and security is helped by an oppressive government that its political opposition in Bangladesh have accused it of backing. Similarly, Nepal’s democratic movements are in conflict with Indian interference. Nepal’s sovereignty has been undermined by India’s intelligence agencies that have been alleged to be meddling in electoral outcomes in an attempt to install pro-India governments. Traditionally a close ally of India, Bhutan too is seeing increasing frustration with Indian economic and political dominance that prevents its foreign relations with China and other international players. The 'India Out' movement has particularly targeted the Maldives, especially following the election of as President Mohamed Muizzu who has been vocal in his opposition to Indian military presence in Maldives. This is a major shift from the Maldives foreign policy since his administration’s expulsion of Indian military personnel, which has closer alignment to China. The move comes after the unsurprising revelation that India secretly meddled as part of its efforts to topple pro-China Muizzu, through bribery and political manipulation. Public anger was moreover fed by reports that Indian intelligence agents have been coordinating with Maldivian politicians, and anti-India sentiments spread across the archipelago. They added to tensions, however, caused by derogatory remarks about Maldivian leadership by Indian officials. Having the strategic location along the major maritime trade routes, the Maldives is the critical geopolitical player. This displacement of India’s influence in the country, as China’s reach grows increasingly stronger, is a realignment of power in the Indian Ocean region. Growing anti-India sentiments across South Asia have little to do with politics and a great deal to do with economics. Traditionally, India has held the primacy in regional trade, infrastructure projects and investment flows. But the power that its economic leverage used to give it is now seen as a tool of coercion, not cooperation. Therefore, countries like Bangladesh and Maldives are diversifying their economic partnership to reduce likelihood on India and have bigger partnership from China, Middle East and western countries. The boycott of Indian products and entertainment under the ‘India Out’ movement in Bangladesh is a political and cultural boycott as much as it is an economic one. This move is not borne out of India’s economic interests as much as it is about achieving economic sovereignty and a more equitable trade relationship. The critics say India has no longer adhered to its democratic ideals in foreign policy as it has continued to crush political opposition to its presence in neighboring countries. Critics of Indian interference, however, have been exiled, imprisoned or politically suppressed as opposition leaders, journalists and activists. The networks involved in controlling media narratives, tracking political dissidents, and blackmailing officials to hold ‘friendly’ governments seem to stem from India’s intelligence networks. Bangladeshi political activist Pinaki Bhattacharya, who has led the ‘India Out’ movement from France, also highlights the transnational nature of India’s suppression tactics. While advocacy groups like Bhattacharya continue to directly challenge India’s role in Bangladesh, local opposition parties like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat e Islami remain prudent and keep their distance at least as part of a tacit strategy to fend off an immediate confrontation. While the India Out phenomenon serves as an isolated expression of political dissent, it is a wider shift that is symptomatic of a broader, regional change for sovereignty and self-determination. South Asian nations repositioned to check Indian hegemony in the region. Although India still exercises considerable strategic sway, the rise of China as a counterweight gives the rest some new diplomatic and economic options.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvlzDFtH9RotFd	2025-03-07T09:25:00-08:00	
We All Loved Each Other So Much (C’eravamo Tanto Amati): European...	One of the most beautiful Italian films of the post-war period is a perfect representation of the events of the difficulties of European progressive intellectuals after Biden. In the movie 'C’eravamo tanto amati' (We All Loved Each Other So Much) directed by Ettore Scola, three friends, part of the Italian resistance movement against the Nazis and the fascists, split up after the end of the war. In the Post-Biden era, France, Germany, Italy are divided in relation to Russia. The film follows their lives and how they deal with disillusionment. Everyone takes their own very different path for each, just as it seems to happening today in Europe. The female character, on the other hand, differs. In the film a wonderful Stefania Sandrelli who goes to bed with all three friends, remains faithful in the final choice to the popular anti-Nazi principles. In the European political affair the President of the Commission, Von der Lyden who obviously does not stand up to aesthetic comparison with Stepania, betrays the popular anti-Nazi vision, continuing to take sides for a senseless war against Russia. But what must be emphasized in positive terms is the reconnaissance of the popular illusions of the characters in the film when they are together, which is completely lacking in European progressives in the face of Trump's decision to immediately end the most stupid war against Russia, because even if it was started by Russia it is clear that it was a NATO war against Russia. This brings up several questions. Question 1: Why did Biden's America support NATO to encircle the former USSR to the point of wanting to push Ukraine into Russia's backyard? Question 2. Is it really in the interest of the European left to support NATO, when it wants to balkanize Russia as it did for Yugoslavia? Question 3: On what cultural basis did European progressives decided to support NATO's aggression via Ukraine? The answers to these questions, if given with reversed progression, can explain a lot the title of this article. Given the incredible cultural, historical ties of Europe with Russia – it must be said once and for all that Russia is Europe. The violence of the cultural ostracism given to our neighbors is ridiculous from a continent whose progressive intellectuals are inspired by the empiricism and liberalism of Locke, the enlightenment of Voltaire, to the humanism of Petrarch, to the pictorial universality of Michelangelo, Altiero Spinelli, Alcide De Gasperi, Jean Monnet and Robert Schumann, Joseph Beck, Paul-Henri Spaak would be horrified at the mere idea of considering Russia extraneous to Europe. Even Germany's Adenauer would have decisively slammed Ursula von der Leyen for her violent attitude towards our neighbors. The founding fathers of Europe always dreamed of a Europe that stretched from the Urals to the Atlantic. France can partially justify itself in the name of an enduring policy of force de frappe, which has its own logic – remembering that De Gaulle, the most lucid political visionary of the post-war period, wanted the nuclear foce de frappe, but was the first Western leader to go to Moscow in the middle of the Cold War. Ursula's fury against Russia – because it is a fury – can only be explained as a deficient cultural vision and poverty, historical diplomatic attitude. The Roman Empire collapsed due to Christian infiltration into the powerful bureaucratic-military structure, but it was pulverized by the 'barbarian' waves from the east. Does she want that to happen again? What someone should explain to the unrealistic President of the European Community is that Russia, with the Urals, is the most powerful geopolitical barrier to tribal invasions from the east. Balkanizing it as NATO seems to want is a historic mistake for a unitary Europe because it opens the way to the new Mongols capable of pulverizing the continent. But while alternative diplomatic visions are possible, the cultural violence of European progressives against Russia is an idiocy that can only be fueled by an evident poverty of cultural spirit that is not of the European left and that the President obviously ignores. How can Russia be excluded from Europe's cultural heritage? It is a blasphemy of clear Nazi totalitarian inspiration, which should have been condemned unequivocally – and did not happen - blackmailed – by the so called 'Putinism'. In the name of the Real Politck - Atlantic Pact - one can also justify a reluctant adherence to support Ukraine in Europe, but only and exclusively in a neutralist form, as was the case for Austria in its time. But it is a cultural-historical crime that does not belong to the left to boycott all cultural relations with Russia as has been vulgarly done. That is a vulgar approach, of a pure cultural Nazism style, that offends Voltaire, Diderot, beacons of the world enlightenment who dialogued with Catherine's Russia. Dragged into this absurd pro-NATO encirclement war, the European left suddenly found itself displaced by Trump's decisive anti-war Russia. In this regard, Trump must be appreciated in no uncertain terms, for having immediately made it clear without equivocation that this war had to end immediately. Perhaps Trump's decision can also be seen as a function of a break in the Russia-China axis, but defusing the nuclear war that has been touched is a decision for which all of progressive Europe should be grateful. Biden's left-wing European orphans, having not been able to maintain their cultural dignity, are now agitating in search of a leader who does not exist, and are able to detach themselves fron a EU President who has not yet understood that Russia is Europe, and not an enemy of Europe. The film 'We loved each other so much', in an anti-Nazi and anti-fascist theme that remained after the war, serves to remind progessives to not forget that Europe is free from those Nazi wounds to humanity, and which included the sacrifice of 25 million Russians, while Ukraine instead gave the green light to the Nazi army. The European left has culpably forgotten all this, so it can be said that more than an orphan of Biden, it is an orphan of itself.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvlzwEB3BCQvc6	2025-03-07T09:23:14-08:00	
The Taliban’s House Of Cards: A Regime Riven By Factionalism And ...	When the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the world watched with bated breath. Would this radical regime, after two decades of insurgency, succeed in transforming itself from a militant force to a functioning government? The answer is becoming increasingly clear: the Taliban’s fragile grip on power is unraveling, and the cracks are too deep to ignore. In his recent article, 'Taliban's Internal Power Struggle: A Regime on the Brink,' Matin Bek in The Cipher highlights a startling reality: the Taliban are in the midst of a slow-motion collapse, driven by profound internal fractures, economic mismanagement, and failed governance. Beneath the carefully cultivated image of unity, multiple factions within the Taliban are engaged in a high-stakes power struggle, each vying for control of a regime that has proven incapable of stabilizing the country. On the surface, the primary divide appears to be between the factions in Kabul and Kandahar, the two symbolic capitals of the Taliban's rule. However, this is a far too simplistic view of the situation. The true fractures go deeper and are rooted in ethnic, tribal, and ideological fault lines. The most significant divide lies within the leadership itself, where figures like Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada struggle to maintain control over a movement increasingly splintered by identity-based factionalism. Unlike his predecessor Mullah Omar, Akhundzada has neither the charisma nor the leadership capacity to unify the diverse elements of the Taliban. His reliance on the Noorzai tribe has only fueled discontent, alienating other factions and reinforcing the perception that his leadership is more fragile than it appears. Despite three years in power, the Taliban have failed to transition from an insurgency to a functioning government. Instead of providing the stability and economic growth that many Afghans had hoped for, they have monopolized the country’s resources, most notably the lucrative mining sector. Figures like Haji Bashir Noorzai, a key player in the Taliban’s economic network, have further entrenched their power, but the broader Afghan population is paying the price. Economic mismanagement is at the heart of the regime’s dysfunction. Inflation is rising, unemployment is rampant, and a once-dependent economy is now in freefall. The Taliban’s reliance on U.S. financial aid to prop up their rule has only deepened Afghanistan’s vulnerability, especially as international conversations about halting that aid gain traction. But the Taliban’s failure is not just economic. Their governance has alienated the international community, and their rejection of diplomacy and international legitimacy has left Afghanistan isolated. The Taliban’s extreme social policies—particularly their insistence on gender apartheid—have led to widespread condemnation, undermining any hope of achieving diplomatic recognition. The goodwill the Taliban once enjoyed during the Doha process has evaporated, and now their rule is largely defined by isolation. Perhaps the most telling sign of the Taliban’s instability is the rising internal discontent. Recently, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for several senior Taliban leaders, including Akhundzada. This legal challenge has provided an opportunity for rival factions within the movement to further undermine his authority. The prospect of criminal prosecution has eroded Akhundzada’s power, leading some commanders to question his leadership and fueling divisions within the Taliban. This growing disunity signals that the Taliban’s days may be numbered. To accelerate the regime’s decline, the international community must act strategically. The ICC warrant is a critical tool in delegitimizing the Taliban’s rule, and it should be used to drive deeper wedges between the factions vying for control. Diplomatic and legal pressure must be sustained, ensuring that the Taliban’s international isolation continues to grow. The United States, in particular, has an important role to play. Instead of providing direct aid to the Taliban, the U.S. should restructure its assistance to bypass the regime and deliver support directly to the Afghan people. This would weaken the Taliban’s financial grip on power and expose the true extent of their governance failures. A more nuanced approach is also needed in dealing with Afghanistan’s opposition forces. While the Taliban remain entrenched in Kabul and Kandahar, other groups—many of them tribal and ethnic-based—are gaining momentum. The U.S. and its allies should engage with these opposition groups strategically, fostering internal pressure on the Taliban. This engagement could influence elements within the Taliban to shift toward a more pragmatic governance model, a necessary step for their survival. Encouraging division within the Taliban could force elements of the movement to seek a more pragmatic governance model, one that might help to address Afghanistan's dire needs while undermining the Taliban's claim to unchallenged rule. The road ahead for Afghanistan is long and uncertain, but one thing is clear: the Taliban are teetering on the edge of collapse. By capitalizing on their internal divisions, exploiting diplomatic opportunities, and sustaining pressure on their leadership, the international community can help accelerate the process. The question is no longer whether the Taliban will fracture—it’s how soon their own internal divisions will send them into oblivion. Time is running out for the Taliban.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl2mqW57PoU7Q	2025-03-07T09:17:37-08:00	
Pakistan: Maritime Potential, Economic Growth And Regional Connec...	These days Pakistan's maritime sector remains a dormant force that presents exceptional opportunities for both economic growth and regional connectivity as well as trade expansion. Between Central Asia and the Middle East exists natural maritime trade advantages for Pakistan because its port facilities provide essential passage to worldwide shipping routes. The Pakistani government initiated a broad strategy to support port transformation and trading optimization which seeks to build Gwadar into an international trading facility. The strategic maritime initiatives will develop business possibilities and enhance regional bonds which will establish Pakistan as an influential maritime trading nation. The core element of Pakistan's maritime strategy involves modernizing its three strategic maritime ports starting with Karachi followed by Port Qasim and eventually Gwadar. Pakistan's maritime infrastructure depends heavily on these ports which were not optimally used until the recent past. Pakistan will establish its position in global shipping networks after the government achieves its objective of directing 60% of official trade through Gwadar while converting it into a worldwide trade hub. The ports will achieve world-class functional capabilities when upgraded with modern facilities for logistics management as well as enhanced deep-sea container handling capabilities. Present operations at the ports remain fifty percent lower than what their maximum capacity could support. The country's untapped maritime potential exists because of suboptimal port utilization. The government plans to optimize port operations fully which will resolve current inefficiencies. Infrastructure upgrades at the ports will enable operations of large vessels which can transport 20,000 containers although global trade expands. New developments focus on both building state-of-the-art logistics systems and digitized trade facilitation programs that improve customs procedures and cargo management. The advantageous position of Pakistan enables the nation to play a critical role in uniting trade connections between Central Asia and the Middle East and the international market. Better port infrastructure improvements in Pakistan will allow the nation to serve Central Asian landlocked nations by providing ship route access to international channels through Gwadar and Karachi. These landlocked countries will experience a major shift in their trading landscape because they now depend increasingly on Pakistani ports for worldwide commerce. The growth of trading connections will deliver economic advantages to Pakistan’s domestic market. The existing imports and exports of Pakistan total around $90 billion. Upgraded practices alongside purposeful policies will enable this number to reach double its current value in the following four years. The improvements in maritime trade performance will enable Pakistan to fulfill its expanding regional market requirements while attracting worldwide investors to boost its international market standing. The expansion of trade depends heavily on the Gwadar Port's planned development process. With its position as Pakistan’s key maritime asset Gwadar features infrastructure designed to meet global trade requirements which enable efficient loading and distribution of substantial export volumes. A transformation of Gwadar into a regional trade center will secure its regional position and promote economic expansion across surrounding regions as well as local community prosperity. The maritime sector of Pakistan aims to both modernize foundation infrastructure and enable trade activities and bring forth foreign investment to shipping logistics and fisheries businesses. Foreign direct investment initiatives have already gained support from the government because a thriving maritime economy links economic expansion to multiple sectors. The investment enables Pakistan to develop its maritime capabilities which will allow it to compete internationally. Pakistan should leverage investment opportunities in its seafood business sector. The authorities aim to enlarge seafood export values that currently stand at $400 million. Pakistan will become a prominent seafood export force in the region thanks to modernized fisheries operations and improved port logistics infrastructure which allow competition with established market participants. The sustainable development of fisheries together with marine tourism as part of the blue economy initiative supports economic diversification while creating new business opportunities for communal residents. Port optimization combined with trade facilitation improvements seeks to grow Pakistan’s exports from $32 billion to $60 billion. Getting there is ambitious but reaching this goal will trigger expanded economic growth and create Numerous employment opportunities which boost national economic stability and reduce joblessness. These changes will impact Pakistan's nation as a whole through a chain of effects that boosts its overall economic system. The government of Pakistan makes sustainability an equal priority with economic growth in its maritime strategy. Pakistan remains dedicated to implementing environmentally friendly port initiatives because climate change alongside environmental matters have intensified thus demanding reduce maritime operations' carbon emissions. The sector will maintain modern and efficient performance through digital trade facilitation that conforms to global sustainable infrastructure and smart development trends. The blue economy development represents a major component of this transition when it promotes environmentally conscious procedures in fishing industry alongside coastal tourism and sustainable ocean resource search. Pakistan will establish itself as a responsible global maritime participant only when it achieves an appropriate economic growth rate and environmental sustainability balance to protect its resources for upcoming generations. The maritime sector of Pakistan possesses substantial power to serve as a leading economic development force while enhancing regional linkages and advancing international trade. Strategic investments in port infrastructure along with global trade hub development in Gwadar while focusing on sustainable trade methods will enable Pakistan to transform its maritime sector into an economic progress engine. Future development strategies from the government confirm the essential role maritime activities will play for Pakistan's overall expansion. The enhancement of export capacity has enabled Pakistan to secure foreign investment and improve regional trade links which together establish the country for maritime greatness and economic prosperity. The upcoming period will show the emergence of a new economic period in Pakistan driven by its strengthening position in international maritime commerce networks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl03v2dZmQm4T	2025-03-07T09:14:25-08:00

Navigating Pakistan’s Future: Challenges And Opportunities – OpEd	Pakistan, a nation with rich cultural diversity, faces challenges that are as multifaceted as its people. From political instability to economic inequality, from social fragmentation to the mounting threats of climate change, Pakistan stands at a crossroads. In these trying times, the discourse of 'Pakistan First' offers a guiding light — one that prioritizes national unity and stability above all else. This approach isn't merely aspirational; it’s vital for addressing the core issues that continue to hinder the nation’s progress. Through strategic, inclusive reforms, Pakistan can unlock a future of cohesion, prosperity, and sustainability. For decades, Pakistan has been ensnared in cycles of political instability. The constant shifting between civilian and military rule has disrupted governance, with each transition bringing with it discontinuity in policy and a lack of long-term vision. This political volatility has eroded public trust, fostering a climate of disillusionment and apathy among the populace. Meanwhile, the erosion of democratic norms has only compounded the problem. Persistent conflicts between political parties and the military establishment have undermined democratic institutions, weakening the very foundations upon which the nation stands. Instead of focusing on the nation's welfare, political elites often engage in power struggles that detract from the pressing issues that ordinary Pakistanis face. The nation’s economic disparities are even starker. According to the World Bank, approximately 40.5% of Pakistan’s population lives below the lower-middle-income poverty line, and in recent years, an additional 2.6 million people have fallen into poverty. With an economy that struggles to create enough jobs for its growing youth population, Pakistan is at risk of economic alienation. Unemployment and underemployment, especially among youth, contribute to widespread discontent and frustration. In addition to these economic woes, Pakistan's rich ethnic and linguistic diversity, while a cultural asset, at times fuels social tensions. Misunderstandings between communities often spiral into conflict, further eroding the fabric of national unity. Religious intolerance, exacerbated by extremism, has intensified these divides, threatening the social cohesion necessary for a peaceful and prosperous society. But the challenges don’t end there. Pakistan is also acutely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Ranked 37th out of 191 countries in terms of vulnerability, Pakistan faces increased risks from natural disasters, which strain an already fragile economy. Climate-related disasters frequently divert resources away from long-term development to immediate disaster response and recovery, creating a vicious cycle that hinders progress. To overcome these challenges, Pakistan must adopt a holistic approach that centers on unity, equity, and sustainability. The 'Pakistan First' philosophy must be embedded in every level of governance, policy, and societal interaction. Here are the key areas for action: Transparent, free, and fair elections are the cornerstone of any democratic society. Pakistan must reform its electoral processes to restore public confidence in its institutions. Building robust democratic institutions that transcend partisan conflicts is critical for long-term political stability. One of the root causes of political instability in Pakistan has been the blurred lines between civilian and military governance. To preserve democratic integrity, there must be clear delineation of roles between the two. Civilian leadership must regain control of policy direction, while the military’s role should be confined to defense and national security. Pakistan’s economic policies must focus on equitable growth, targeting the marginalized communities that have been left behind. By implementing pro-poor economic policies, including poverty alleviation programs, Pakistan can ensure that the benefits of growth are shared by all citizens, reducing inequality and social unrest. Pakistan’s youth, which constitutes a significant portion of its population, remains one of the country’s greatest assets — yet it is also its most neglected. A complete overhaul of the education system is necessary, with a focus on skills development that aligns with market demands. Providing young people with quality education and job opportunities will help reduce unemployment and foster economic growth. Pakistan’s diversity is both a blessing and a challenge. To strengthen national unity, the government must invest in interfaith and interethnic dialogue platforms that foster mutual respect and understanding. By celebrating diversity, Pakistan can forge a more inclusive national identity, one that embraces all its citizens, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, or language. Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate change requires urgent attention. Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable agriculture, and disaster preparedness will mitigate the negative impacts of natural disasters. Additionally, international collaboration is essential to secure funding and expertise to adapt to climate change. Pakistan must reform its educational curriculum to instill values of tolerance, respect, and social harmony from an early age. This will lay the foundation for a more cohesive society in the future, where religious and ethnic differences are celebrated, not feared. Given Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate-related disasters, international partnerships are vital for securing the necessary resources and expertise for adaptation. By engaging with global institutions, Pakistan can access the tools required to mitigate the risks of climate change and protect its citizens. By embracing a 'Pakistan First' philosophy, the nation can begin to address the multifaceted challenges that have held it back for so long. Political stability, economic equity, social harmony, and environmental sustainability must be prioritized to create a resilient and prosperous Pakistan. This approach will not only ensure national unity but also pave the way for a brighter future — one where Pakistan stands as a model of inclusivity, progress, and global cooperation. The time for change is now, and it begins with a collective commitment to place Pakistan First.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVZ9-hv4zvl_3axTY5jW56	2025-03-07T09:09:50-08:00	
The Risk Of Foreign Intrusion In Presidential Elections In Cote d...	By Arthur Palix Tensions Loom Over the Ballot (FPRI) -- On October 25, 2025, voters in Cote d’Ivoire will head to the polls to elect their next president in a high-stakes election shaped by past controversies and ongoing political uncertainty. A key point of contention remains the potential candidacy of Alassane Ouattara, who has led the country since 2010 and is currently serving his third term despite the Ivorian constitution limiting the presidency to two. The Independent Electoral Commission, led by Ibrahim Coulibaly-Kuibiert, plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the vote, by compiling and revising voter lists, as well as managing elections nationwide. Recent electoral history in Cote d’Ivoire has been marred by turmoil. The 2010 presidential race, a defining moment in the nation’s political trajectory, saw Ouattara challenge incumbent Laurent Gbagbo. Despite Ouattara securing 54 percent of the vote, Gbagbo contested the results, triggering a post-electoral crisis that left over 3,000 civilians dead in violent clashes between rival supporters. A military intervention led to Gbagbo’s arrest and subsequent twenty-year sentence by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity. In 2015, the Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI), Gbagbo’s party, boycotted the vote, claiming the process was rigged, thereby facilitating Ouattara’s re-election. In 2020, the sudden death of Amadou Gon Coulibaly, the ruling party’s designated candidate, prompted Ouattara to run for a controversial third term. The election, held in a climate of heightened tensions, saw widespread disruptions, the closure of polling stations, and low voter turnout. As Cote d’Ivoire prepares for yet another electoral test, the issue of national reconciliation—long promised but never fully achieved—has become central to the political discourse. With lingering tensions from past elections and growing concerns over political stability, the 2025 vote is set to be one of the most decisive in the country’s recent history. A Fragmented Political Landscape While the 2010 election featured fourteen contenders in the first round, this year’s vote is expected to see roughly half that number—though this reduction does not necessarily signal a clearer political landscape. With less than a year to go, both declared and prospective candidates are maneuvering for a position in what is set to be a high-stakes battle. Incumbent Ouattara, in power since 2010, remains the preferred candidate of the ruling Rassemblement des Houphouëtistes pour la Démocratie et la Paix (RHDP), confirming he is ready to continue serving his country. However, opposition parties strongly oppose the prospect of his re-election, arguing that a fourth term would be unconstitutional. Among the main opposition figures is former president Gbagbo, who is running under the Parti des Peuples Africains – Côte d’Ivoire (PPA-CI). Although acquitted by the ICC and pardoned by Ouattara, Gbagbo has not been granted full amnesty for his role in the 2010 post-election violence, rendering him ineligible to run. A similar fate has befallen Charles Blé Goudé, former minister under Gbagbo and leader of the Congrès Panafricain pour la Justice et l’Égalité des Peuples (COJEP). Despite his acquittal by the ICC, Blé Goudé remains convicted in Cote d’Ivoire, preventing him from contesting the election. Another well-known name in Ivorian politics is former First Lady Simone Ehivet Gbagbo, who is running under the banner of the Mouvement des Générations Capables (MGC), which she founded in 2022. For its part, Pascal Affi N’Guessan, leader of the FPI, is focusing his campaign on governance, poverty reduction, and strengthening ties with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). This fragmented opposition raises concerns, as the multiple left-leaning candidates from the PPA-CI, FPI, MGC, and COJEP could weaken its ability to challenge the RHDP effectively. Tensions are not limited to left-wing parties. The Parti Démocratique de Côte d’Ivoire – Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (PDCI-RDA) is grappling with internal divisions over its candidate. Former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam has been named the party’s official nominee. Jean-Louis Billon, a former Minister of Trade and influential PDCI-RDA member, has rejected this nomination and has declared his own candidacy, criticizing Thiam as out of touch. An Unstable Climate Conducive to Foreign Interference It is in this uncertain context, with the electorate still scarred by past electoral violence and a list of candidates unsettled, that the Ivorian electorate will have to choose its future president for the next five years. Meanwhile, across sub-Saharan Africa, a growing tide of pan-African sovereignty is reshaping regional alliances and challenging traditional foreign influence. The withdrawal of French forces from the 43rd Marine Infantry Battalion in Port-Bouët marks another step in the decline of France’s military presence in West Africa and comes just months after similar withdrawals from Senegal and Chad. Earlier, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali, now members of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), ordered the withdrawal of French military forces involved in the fight against regional terrorism for over ten years. The Alliance of Sahel States: A Revival of Pan-African Enthusiasm Formed in 2023, the AES is a mutual defense pact promoting sovereignty, Pan-Africanism, and anti-colonial ideals. The bloc has positioned itself as an alternative to the ECOWAS, a fifteen-member organization that includes Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Senegal, and Benin. In January 2024, the AES officially broke away from ECOWAS, deepening the divide between the two regional bodies. AES countries have positioned themselves as leaders of this generalized pan-Africanist movement, turning down not only the French presence but, more generally, the idea of foreign economic predation from which African countries have suffered for too long. In August 2024, Burkina Faso’s President Ibrahima Traoré rejected an IMF loan, stating that 'Africa does not need international financial institutions to develop.' Present in Mali since 1976, TotalEnergies recently lost its contract to a new partnership between Malian firm Coly Energy and Beninese company Benin Petrol SA. Russia: A Quest for Strategic Influence For some observers, this growing desire for distancing from Western influence in Africa is the result of vast campaigns of manipulation and disinformation orchestrated by powers such as Russia and China. While the existence and impact of these disinformation campaigns remain open to debate, they do raise the question of the extent of such interference during election periods. Two European countries were recently confronted with this type of abuse. In Georgia, the pro-Russian, Eurosceptic 'Georgian Dream' party faced accusations of vote-buying and voter intimidation during the 2024 national elections. Similarly, in Romania, Russian actors were accused of backing far-right candidate Călin Georgescu in the 2024 presidential race. A recent report by the Center for Strategic Studies in Africa highlights Russia’s growing involvement in African electoral processes, with the democratic scores of thirty-one African nations declining over the past five years. The analysis reveals that Cote d’Ivoire has already been targeted by Russian disinformation campaigns, particularly in support of Gbagbo. In a context where the PPA-CI is struggling to establish itself on the Ivorian political scene (winning two communes out of 201 and no region out of the thirty-one in the 2023 local elections), the hypothesis of a rapprochement with Russia raises questions about the influence strategies at play. The interests of the two parties seem to converge. Russia’s influence in Africa has expanded through military and economic cooperation, particularly with the AES. Through the Africa Corp (formerly Wagner Group), Russia provides military equipment, training, and security services to these nations. In January 2025, AES countries signed a Telecommunications and Remote Sensing Satellite Agreement with Russia aimed at enhancing border surveillance and disaster monitoring. For his part, Gbagbo has been a vocal critic of ECOWAS, accusing it of promoting French interests in West Africa. In an interview with AFO Media, he expressed a willingness to normalize relations with AES states should he return to power. While some analysts view this as a continuation of his long-standing rivalry with Ouattara, others see Russia’s potential backing of Gbagbo as a strategic move to increase its foothold in Cote d’Ivoire and the broader West African region. China: A Key Economic Partner China has solidified its position as a major player in the region, becoming 2023 Cote d’Ivoire’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $5.28 billion—an increase of 21 percent from the previous year. Beijing also maintains strong ties with AES nations. In June 2024, Colonel Assimi Goita, Mali’s Head of State, emphasized the benefits of the AES, which has enabled its members 'to move away from facade and ineffective partnerships towards sincere partners' such as Russia and China. A few months later, he even declared that Mali shared 'the same principles and values with the People’s Republic of China, namely respect for the sovereignty of our States, the defense of the interests of our peoples, non-interference in internal affairs, but above all the rejection of manipulation linked to human rights issues.' China’s influence extends to strategic sectors such as energy and infrastructure. In Niger, the China National Petroleum Corporation operates the Agadem oil field—the largest in Africa. Amid growing security concerns, Niger has also tasked China with protecting its energy assets. The potential return of Gbagbo to power could shift Cote d’Ivoire further away from Western alliances, particularly with France and the United States, given Paris’ backing of Ouattara during the 2010 post-election crisis. France: A Contested Historical Partner France maintains long-standing historical and economic ties with Cote d’Ivoire which it inherited from the colonial era. On the commercial front, France remains Cote d’Ivoire’s top trading partner within the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). In 2023, Cote d’Ivoire accounted for 38 percent of all French exports to WAEMU while also being the region’s leading exporter to France. However, these economic ties do not shield France from mounting criticism from Ivorian public opinion. The retrocession of the Port-Bouët military camp, perceived by some as a symbol of national sovereignty (and by others as a win-win deal between Cote d’Ivoire and France), comes at a time when anti-French rhetoric is gaining ground in French-speaking Africa. As journalist Alain Foka noted in a May 2023 analysis, younger generations born after independence are questioning the economic and military influence France continues to exert over its former colonies, seen as predatory rather than beneficial. On the other hand, analysts suggest that military cooperation between Paris and Abidjan is far from over. Political expert Seidik Aba predicts that Ouattara, while formally ending France’s direct military presence, may pursue a different model of collaboration, focusing on training programs and intelligence sharing rather than deploying troops on Ivorian soil. Billon could also be seen as a candidate whose election could stabilize relations France and Cote d’Ivoire. A prominent businessman and former Minister of Commerce, Billon ran the Société Immobilière et Financière de la Côte Africaine (SIFCA)—one of Cote d’Ivoire’s largest agro-industrial firms, founded by his father in 1964. SIFCA’s financial ties with France are significant. Over the past decade, Société Générale and Proparco (a subsidiary of the French Development Agency) have invested 85 million euros in SIFCA’s development projects. Billon’s leadership in agriculture and industry positions him as a pro-business figure with strong international connections, particularly in France, Senegal, and Nigeria. However, Billon is not yet an official candidate for his party, the PDCI-RDA, which is currently chaired by Thiam. Thiam has long-standing ties with France and international financial institutions. In a 2009 interview with the Institut Montaigne, he declared that 'France will live. France will continue to shine. My France is an idea, and ideas never die.' Graduated from the École Polytechnique the Mines de Paris, the former Crédit Suisse executive maintains close relationships with French and Anglo-American financial circles. More recently, Thiam suggested international funding for Cote d’Ivoire’s electoral commission to facilitate the updating of the electoral roll. The United States and Israel: Waning Influence or Strategic Shift? The direction of US foreign policy in Africa under the second administration of President Donald Trump remains uncertain. Alhaji Bouba Nouhou from the Michel de Montaigne University in Bordeaux suggests this could pave the way for emerging powers like Iran to deepen their involvement in AES countries, particularly in technology and defense cooperation. A long-standing ally of the United States, Israel also plays a strategic role in West Africa, with Cote d’Ivoire serving as a key partner for Tel Aviv. In October 2024, an agreement was signed for the sale of a patrol boat manufactured by Israel Shipyard. A framework agreement also links the two countries, granting Ivorian access to Israeli expertise in cybersecurity, agriculture, and water management. The foregoing notwithstanding, Israel has announced a reduction in military exports to Cote d’Ivoire, aiming to prevent its weapons from being used in potential election-related violence. A re-election of Ouattara could be favorable for Washington and Tel Aviv, reinforcing Western influence in the region against Russian, Chinese, and Iranian interests. A Decisive Ballot The prospect of foreign interference in Cote d’Ivoire’s 2025 presidential election remains a sensitive issue. As of now, there have been no confirmed efforts to manipulate or destabilize the election process, making any claims of such interference premature. While international actors may hold strategic interests in the country, reducing the election to a mere battleground for external influence risks oversimplifying Ivorian’s complex political landscape, its electoral autonomy, and the ability of candidates to run independent campaigns free from overt propaganda. A pragmatic and evidence-based approach is crucial in addressing the issue—avoiding conspiracy theories and the blanket demonization of any side. Should foreign interference emerge in Cote d’Ivoire’s elections, its true impact will only become clear once the facts and electoral dynamics unfold. That said, electoral interference is not a theoretical concern. Last year, the United States faced attempts of influence from Iran during its 2024 election, while Canada condemned Chinese interference targeting its own electoral process, serving as stark reminders that such risks are real. In this fragile context, ensuring stability and sovereignty are the watchwords for a nation striving for national reconciliation, still bearing the scars of past crises and the hopes of a brighter future. As a strategic crossroads in West Africa, Cote d’Ivoire is both a stakeholder and a player in this dynamic. The outcome of this election could redefine its relations with its international partners and influence the equilibrium of the balance of power in the region. In 2025, Cote d’Ivoire will not only appoint a new leader, but it will also make a decisive choice about the democratic path it wishes to take. Between security concerns, economic transformations, and political tensions, this election will be a defining moment—one that reveals both the progress made and the challenges that lie ahead.

What Are The Origins Of The Money We Use Today? Revisiting Heinri...	The pioneering research by one of the founders of economic anthropology is essential for understanding the social and institutional processes that gave rise to money as we know it. The late 19th century saw economists, mainly German and Austrian, create a mythology of money's origins that is still repeated in today's textbooks. Money is said to have originated as just another commodity being bartered, with metal preferred because it is nonperishable (and hence amenable to being saved), supposedly standardized (despite fraud if not minted in temples), and thought to be easily divisible—as if silver could have been used for small marketplace exchanges, which was unrealistic given the rough character of ancient scales for weights of a few grams.1 This mythology does not recognize government as having played any role as a monetary innovator, sponsor, or regulator, or as giving money its value by accepting it as a vehicle to pay taxes, buy public services, or make religious contributions. Also downplayed is money's function as a standard of value for denominating and paying debts.2 Although there is no empirical evidence for the commodity-barter origin myth, it has survived on purely hypothetical grounds because of its political bias that serves the anti-socialist Austrian school and subsequent 'free market' creditor interests opposing government money creation. Schurtz's Treatment of Money as Part of the Overall Social System As one of the founders of economic anthropology, Heinrich Schurtz approached the origins of money as being much more complex than the 'economic' view that it emerged simply as a result of families going to the marketplace to barter. Surveying a wide range of Indigenous communities, his 1898 book, An Outline of the Origins of Money, described their trade and money in the context of the institutional system within which members sought status and wealth. Schurtz described these monetary systems as involving a wide array of social functions and dimensions, which today's 'economic' theorizing excludes as external to its analytic scope. Placing money in the context of the community's overall system of social organization, Schurtz warned that anyone who detaches 'sociological and economic problems from the environment in which they emerged... their native land... only carries away a part of the whole organism and fails to understand the vital forces that have created and sustained it.' Looking at Indigenous communities as having preserved presumably archaic traditions, Schurtz viewed trade with outsiders as leading wealth to take an increasingly monetary form that eroded the balance of internal social relations. Schurtz deemed the linkage between money, debt, and land tenure to lie beyond the area on which he focused, nor did he mention contributions to group feasts (which historian Bernard Laum suggested as the germ from which Greek obols and drachmas may have evolved).3 The paradigmatic forms of Indigenous wealth were jewelry and other items of personal adornment, decorations, and trophies, especially foreign exotic products in the form of shells and gemstones or items with a long and prestigious history that gave their wearers or owners status. Thorstein Veblen would call the ownership and display of such items conspicuous consumption in his 1899 book, The Theory of the Leisure Class. They had an exchange value, as they do today, but that did not make them monetary means of exchange. Schurtz saw many gray areas in their monetization: 'Beads made of clay and stone are also crafted by Indigenous people and widely used as ornaments but rarely as money.' At issue was how a money economy differs from barter and from the circulation and exchange of useful and valued items in a social economy. Was Indigenous exchange and wealth pre-monetary, an archaic seed that led to money's 'more ideal forms?' Schurtz's Distinction Between Inside-Money and Outside-Money Exchange with outsiders was typically conducted by political leaders as the face of their communities to the outside world. Trade (and also payment of tribute) involved fiscal and social relations whose monetary functions differed from those of the domestic economy but ended up dovetailing with them to give money a hybrid character. Schurtz distinguished what he called outside-money from inside-money, with outside-money ultimately dominating the inside monetary system. 'The concept of money,' he wrote, originated 'from two distinct sources: What functions as the foundation of wealth and measure of value for property and serves social ends within a tribe is, in its origins, something entirely different from the means of exchange that travels from tribe to tribe and eventually transforms itself, as a universally welcomed commodity, into a kind of currency.' Inside-money was used within communities for their own exchange and wealth. Outside-money was derived from transactions with outsiders. And what was 'outside' was a set of practices governing trade outside the jurisdiction of local governance.4 Schurtz's distinction emphasized a characteristic of trade that has continued down through today's world: the contrast between domestic payments subject to checks and balances to protect basic needs and navigating status hierarchies but (ideally) limiting sharp wealth disparities, and exchange with outsiders, often conducted on islands, quay areas, or other venues socially outside the community's boundaries, subject to more impersonal standardized rules. Throughout the ancient world, we find offshore island entrepots wherever they are conveniently located for conducting trade with outsiders. These islands kept foreign contact at arm's length to prevent mercantile relations from disturbing the local economic balance. Egypt restricted foreign contacts to the Delta region where the Nile flowed into the Mediterranean. For the Etruscans, the island of Ischia/Pithekoussai became the base for Phoenician and Greek merchants to deal with the Italian mainland in the eighth and seventh centuries BCE. North Germans seem to have conducted the Baltic amber trade through the sacred island of Helgoland. 'The emergence of specific internal monetary systems is always supported by the inclination to transform outside-money into inside-money, and to employ money not to facilitate external trade, as one might assume according to common theories, but rather to obstruct it,' Schurtz concluded. In his chapter, 'Metal as Ornament and Money,' he pointed out that it was foreign trade that led metal to become the primary form of money. 'While most varieties of ornament-money gradually lose their significance, one of them, metal-money, asserts its ground all the more and finally pushes its competitors out of the field.' He added that: 'Metal-money made from noble metals is not a pure sign-money, it is at the same time a valuable commodity, the value of which depends on supply and demand. In its mature form, it therefore in itself embodies the fusion of inside-money with outside-money, of the sign of value and valuable property with the means of exchange.'5 This merging of inside- and outside-money is documented already in the third millennium BCE in the Near East. Silver-money was used for long-distance trade and came to be used for domestic enterprise as well, while grain remained the monetary vehicle for denominating agrarian production, taxes, and debt service on the land, and for distribution to dependent labor in Mesopotamia's temples and palaces. Schurtz also questioned whether the dominance of metallic money emerged spontaneously in many places or whether there was a diffusion from a singular origin, that is, 'whether a cultural institution has grown in situ or whether it has been transferred from other regions through migration and contact between societies.' The diffusion of Mesopotamian weights is associated with silver points to its diffusion from that region, as does the spread of the region's practice of setting interest rates simply for ease of calculation in terms of the local fractional arithmetic system (60ths in Mesopotamia for a shekel per mina a month, 10ths or percentages in decimalized Greece, and 12ths in Rome for a troy ounce per pound each year). Checks and Balances to Prevent the Selfish Concentration of Wealth What does seem to have developed spontaneously were social attitudes and policies to prevent the concentration of wealth from injuring economic balance. Wealth concentration, especially when achieved by depriving cultivators of their means of livelihood, would have violated the ethic of mutual aid that low-surplus economies need as a condition for their resilience. Viewing money as part of the overall social context, Schurtz described 'the social transformation brought about by wealth' as a result of monetizing trade and its commercial pursuit of profit, or 'acquisitiveness': '[E]veryone is now compelled to join in the competition for property or he will be pulled into the vortex created by one of the newly emerging centers of power and property, where he will need to work hard to be able to live at all. For the property owner, no temporal limit constrains his view on the perpetual increase of his wealth.' Schurtz characterized the economic mentality as a drive for 'the unlimited accumulation of movable property,' to be passed on to one's children, leading to the creation of a wealthy hereditary class. If archaic societies had this ethic, could ancient civilizations have taken off? How did they prevent the growth of wealth from fostering an oligarchy seeking to increase its wealth at the expense of the community at large and its resilience? Schurtz reviewed how Indigenous communities typically avoided that fate by shaping a social value system that would steer wealth away from being used to achieve predatory power over others. He cited numerous examples in which 'immense treasures often accumulate without reentering the transactions of daily life.' One widespread way to do this was simply to bury wealth. 'The primitive man,' he wrote, 'believes that he will have access to all the goods given to him in the grave, even in the afterlife. Thus, he too knows no bounds to acquisition.' Taking his greed and wealth with him to use in the hereafter prevents hoarded wealth from being inherited 'and growing into a dangerous instrument of power' by becoming dynastic; ultimately operating 'on the belief that the deceased does not give up his rights of ownership but jealously guards over his property to ensure that no heir makes use of it.' A less destructive removal of wealth from its owners was to create an ethic of peer pressure in which individuals gained status and popular acclaim by accumulating wealth to give away. Schurtz wrote: '[R]emnants of the ancient communism remain alive enough for a long time to effectively block attempts to amass as many assets as possible in a single hand. And in places without an actual system of debt and interest, the powerful individual, into whose house the tributes of the people flow, has indeed little choice but to 'represent' by way of his wealth: in other words, to allow the people to participate in his indulgences.' Such an individual achieves philanthropic renown by generously distributing his possessions to 'his friends and followers, winning their hearts and thereby establishing real power based on loyal devotion.' One widespread practice was to celebrate marriages, funerals, and other rites of passage by providing great feasts. This 'extraordinary... destruction and squandering of valuable property, particularly livestock and food, during those grand festivals of the dead that evolved out of sacrifices and are, among some peoples, not only an effective obstacle to the accumulation of wealth but have turned into economic calamities' when families feel obliged to take on debt to host such extravagant displays. Religious officials and temples often played a role in such rituals. Noting that 'money, trade, and religion had a good relationship with one another in antiquity,' Schurtz cited the practice of donating wealth to temples or their priesthoods. But he recognized that this might enable them to 'gain dominance through the ownership of money' under their control. 'The communist countermeasures against wealth generally do not endure,' Schurtz wrote. 'Certain kinds of property seem to favor greed directly, especially cattle farming, which can literally turn into a hoarding addiction.' He described communalistic values of mutual aid as tending to break down as economies polarized with the increase in commercial wealth. Schurtz also noted that the social checks on personal wealth-seeking did not apply to economies that developed a 'system of debt and interest.' Wealth in the form of monetary claims on debtors was not buried and could hardly be redistributed to the population at large, whose members typically were debtors to the rising creditor interest. The only way to prevent such debts from polarizing society was to cancel them. That is what Near Eastern rulers did, but Schurtz's generation had no way of knowing about their Clean Slate proclamations. Starting with the very outset of debt records c. 2500 BCE in Sumer, and continuing down through Babylonia, Assyria, to their neighbors, and on through the early first millennium BCE, rulers annulled financial claims on agrarian debtors. That prevented creditors from concentrating money and land in their own hands. One might say that these debt cancellations and land redistributions were the Near Eastern alternative to destroying material wealth to preserve balance. These royal acts did not destroy physical wealth but simply wiped out the debt overhead to maintain widespread land tenure and liberty for the population at large. Canceling agrarian debt was politically feasible because most personal debts were owed to the palace sector and its temples or their officials. Royal Clean Slates seemed so unthinkable when they began to be translated around the turn of the last century that early readers hardly could believe that they actually were enforced in practice. François Thureau-Dangin's French translation of the Sumerian ruler Enmetena's (c. 2400 BCE) proclamation in 1905 was believed by many observers to be too utopian and socially disruptive to have been followed in practice, as was the Biblical Jubilee Year of Leviticus 25.6 But so many such proclamations have been found, extending so continuously over thousands of years—along with lawsuits in which judges upheld their increasing detail—that there is no doubt that these acts did indeed reconcile the accumulation of monetary wealth with social resilience by blocking the creation of predatory oligarchies such as those that would emerge in classical Greece and Rome and indeed survive into today's world. Monetary Innovations in the Bronze Age Near Eastern Palaces and Temples Economic documentation in Schurtz's day was able to trace monetary practice only as far back as classical Greece and Rome. There was a general belief that their practices must have evolved from Indigenous Indo-European speakers. Marcel Mauss would soon treat the gift exchange of the Kwakiutl tribe of the Canadian Pacific Northwest (with their competitive one-upmanship) as the prototype for the idea of charging interest. But monetary interest has a specific stipulated rate, with payments due on specific periodic dates set by written contracts. That practice stems from Sumer in the third millennium BCE, along with silver (and grain) money and related financial innovations in the economic big bang that has shaped subsequent Western economic evolution. Money's function as a standard of valuation did not play a big role in Schurtz's survey. But subsequent archaeological research has revealed that money's emergence as part of an overall institutional framework cannot be understood without reference to written account-keeping, denominating debt accruals, and fiscal relations. Money, credit/debt, and fiscal obligations have all gone together since the origins of written records in the ancient Near East. Near Eastern fiscal and financial records describe a development of money, credit, and interest-bearing debt that neither the barter theory nor Schurtz's ethnographic studies had imagined. Mesopotamia's 'more ideal' money evolved out of the fiscal organization of account-keeping and credit in the palaces and temples of Sumer, Babylonia, and their Bronze Age neighbors (3200–1200 BCE). These Near Eastern economies were larger in scale and much more complex and multilayered than most of the Indigenous communities surveyed by Schurtz. In contrast to largely self-sufficient communities, southern Mesopotamia was obliged to engage in large-scale and long-distance trade because the region's river-deposited soil lacked metal, stone, and even hardwood. The region's need for raw materials was far different from the trade and 'monetization' of luxuries by the relatively small-scale and self-sufficient communities studied by Schurtz and hypothesized by economists imagining individuals bartering at their local market. In these communities, he noted: 'The amount of metal shaped into ornaments almost always far outweighs the amount transformed into practical tools.' Mesopotamia's trade had to go far beyond personal decorative luxuries and prestige commodities or trophy items. An entrepreneurial merchant class was needed to obtain these raw materials, along with a specialized labor force, which was employed by the temples and palaces that produced most export handicrafts, provisioned corvée labor to work on public infrastructure, served as mints and overseers of weights and measures, and mediated most monetary wealth and debt. This required forward planning and account-keeping to feed and supply labor (war widows, orphans, and slaves) in their weaving and other handicraft workshops and to consign their output to merchants for export. Calculating the cost of distributing food and raw materials within these large institutions and valuing their consignment of goods to merchants required designing standard weights and measures as the basis for this forward planning. Selecting monetary units was part of this standardization of measuring costs and value. This made possible the calculation of expected rental income or shortfalls, along with profit-and-loss statements and balance sheets. The typical commodity to be distributed was grain, which served as a standard of value for agrarian transactions and credit balances that mounted up during the crop year for advances to sharecroppers, consumption such as beer from ale-women, and payments to priests for performing ceremonial functions. Their value in grain was to be paid at harvest time. The calculation of food rations for distribution to the various grades of labor (male, female, and children) enabled the costs to be expressed in grain or in workday equivalents. Schurtz would have called this grain 'inside-money,' and regarded as 'outside-money' the silver minted by temples for dealing with foreign trade and as the basic measure of value for business transactions with the palace economy and for settling commercial obligations. A mina (60 shekels) of silver was set as equal to a corresponding unit of grain as measured on the threshing floor. That enabled accounts to be kept simultaneously in silver and grain. The result was a bi-monetary grain-silver standard reflecting the bifurcation of early Mesopotamian economies between the agrarian families on the land (using grain as 'inside-money') and the palatial economy with its workshops, foreign trade, and associated commercial enterprise (using silver as 'outside-money'). Prices for market transactions with outsiders might vary, but prices for debt payments, taxes, and other transactions with large institutions were fixed. Schurtz's conclusion that the rising dominance of commercial money tended to break down domestic checks and balances protecting the Indigenous communities that he studied is indeed what happened when commercial debt practices were brought from the Near East to the Aegean and Mediterranean lands around the eighth century BCE. Having no tradition of royal debt cancellations as had existed in the Near East ever since the formative period of interest-bearing debt, the resulting decontextualization of credit practices fostered financial oligarchies in classical Greece and Rome. After early debt cancellations and land redistribution by populist 'tyrants' in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, the ensuing classical oligarchies resisted popular revolts demanding a revival of such policies. The dynamics of interest-bearing debt and the pro-creditor debt laws of classical antiquity's creditor oligarchies caused economic polarization that led to five centuries of civil warfare. These upheavals were not the result of the coinage that began to be minted around the eighth century BCE, as many 19th-century observers believed, mistakenly thinking that Aegean coinage was the first metallic money. Silver-money had been the norm for two millennia throughout the Near East, without causing disruption like that experienced by classical antiquity. What polarized classical antiquity's economies were pro-creditor debt laws backed by political violence, not money. Conclusion and Discussion Schurtz's starting point was how communities organized the laws of motion governing their distribution of wealth and property. He viewed money as emerging from this institutional function with a basically communalistic ethic. A key characteristic of Indigenous economic resilience was social pressure expecting the wealthy to contribute to social support. That was the condition set by unwritten customs for letting some individuals and their families become rich. Schurtz and subsequent ethnologists found a universal solution for reconciling wealth-seeking with community-wide prosperity to be social pressure for wealthy families (that was the basic unit, not individuals) to distribute their wealth to the citizenry by reciprocal exchange, gift-giving, mutual aid, and other forms of redistribution, and providing large feasts, especially for rites of passage. This was a much broader view than the individualistic economic assumption that personal gain-seeking and, indeed, selfishness were the driving forces of overall prosperity. The idea of monetizing economic life under communalistic mutual aid or palace direction was and remains anathema to mainstream economists, reflecting the worldview of modern creditors and financial elites. Schurtz recognized that mercantile wealth-seeking required checks and balances to prevent economies from impoverishing their members. The problem for any successfully growing society to solve was how to prevent the undue concentration of wealth obtained by exploitative means that impaired overall welfare and the ability of community members to be self-supporting. Otherwise, economic polarization and dependency would lead members to flee from the community, or perhaps it simply would shrink and end up being defeated by outsiders who sustained themselves by more successful mutual aid. As noted above, Schurtz treated the monetization of wealth in the form of creditor claims on debtors as too post-archaic to be a characteristic of his ethnographic subjects. But what shaped the context for monetization and led 'outside-money' to take priority over inside-money were wealth accumulation by moneylending and the fiscal and military uses of money. Schurtz correctly rejected Bruno Hildebrand's characterization of money as developing in stages, from small-scale barter to monetized economies becoming more sophisticated as they evolved into financialized credit economies.7 And, in fact, the actual historical sequence was the reverse. From Mesopotamia to medieval Europe, agrarian economies operated on credit during the crop year. Monetary payment occurred at harvest time to settle the obligations that had accumulated since the last harvest and to pay taxes. This need to pay debts was a major factor requiring money's development in the first place. Barter became antiquity's final monetary 'stage' as Rome's economy collapsed after its creditor oligarchy imposed debt bondage and took control of the land. When emperors were unable to tax this oligarchy, they debased the coinage, and life throughout the empire devolved into local subsistence production and quasi-barter. Foreign trade was mainly for luxuries brought by Arabs and other Near Easterners. The optimistic sequence that Hildebrand imagined not only mistakenly adopted the barter myth of monetary origins but also failed to take debt polarization into account as economies became monetarized and financialized. Schurtz described how the aim of preventing the maldistribution of wealth was at the heart of Indigenous social structuring. But it broke down for various reasons. Economies in which family wealth took the form of cattle, he found, tended to become increasingly oppressive to maintain the polarizing inequality that developed. The same might be said of credit economies under the rising burden of interest-bearing debt. Schurtz noted the practice of charging debtors double the loan value—and any rate of interest indeed involves an implicit doubling time. That exponential dynamic is what polarizes financialized economies. In contrast to Schurtz, mainstream economists of his generation avoided dealing with the effect of monetary innovation and debt on the distribution of wealth. The tendency was to treat money as merely a 'veil' of price changes for goods and services, without analyzing how credit polarizes the economy's balance sheet of assets and debt liabilities. Yet, the distinguishing feature of credit economies was the use of moneylending as a lever to enrich creditors by impoverishing debtors. That was more than just a monetary problem. It was a political creditor/debtor problem and, ultimately, a public/private problem. The issue was whether a ruler or civic public checks would steer the rise in monetary wealth in ways that avoided the creation of creditor oligarchies. Most 19th-century and even subsequent economic writers shied away from confronting this political context, leaving the most glaring gap in modern economic analysis. It was left to the discovery of cuneiform documentation to understand how money first became institutionalized as a vehicle to pay debts. This monetization was accompanied by remarkable success in sustaining rising wealth while preventing its concentration in the hands of a hereditary oligarchy. That Near Eastern success highlights what the smaller and more anarchic Western economies failed to achieve when interest-bearing debt practices were brought to the Mediterranean lands without being checked by the tradition of regular cancellation of personal nonbusiness debt. Credit and monetary wealth were privatized in the hands of what became an increasingly self-destructive set of classical oligarchies culminating in that of Rome, which fought for centuries against popular revolts seeking protection from impoverishing economic polarization. The devastating effects of transplanting Near Eastern debt practices into the Mediterranean world's less communalistic groupings show the need to discuss the political, fiscal, and social-moral context for money and debt. Schurtz placed monetary analysis in the context of society's political institutions and moral values and explained how money is a product of this context and, indeed, how monetization tends to transform it—in a way that tends to break down social protection. His book has remained relatively unknown over the last century, largely because his institutional anthropological perspective is too broad for an economics discipline that has been narrowed by pro-creditor ideologues who have applauded the 'free market' destruction of social regulation aimed at protecting the interests of debtors. That attitude avoids recognizing the challenges that led the Indigenous communities studied by Schurtz, and also the formative Bronze Age Near East, to protect their resilience against the concentration of wealth, a phenomenon that has plagued economies ever since classical antiquity's decontextualization of Near Eastern debt practices.

The barter theory has been refuted by modern research uncovering the Bronze Age Near Eastern institutional origins of money, which I discuss in chapters 1 and 3 of Temples of Enterprise (Hudson, 2024). My criticisms of this theory are in 'Origins of Money and Interest: Palatial Credit, Not Barter' (Hudson, Michael, 2020). 2 See the papers collected in Wray, L. Randall, 2004. 3 Mauss, Marcel (1925), 2016; Laum, Bernard, 1924. Schurtz mentions spit-money in passing but finds trade in food relatively unimportant. 4 I discuss this in 'From Sacred Enclave to Temple to City' (Hudson, Michael, 1999) and Chapter 10 of Temples of Enterprise (Hudson, Michael, 2024). 5 Schurtz cited as an example of how monetary authorities could substitute sign-money for metal-money the case of 'Kublai Khan, the ruler of the Mongolian empire, [who] drove out metal-money with sign-money, specifically stamped pieces of paper, evidently following the Chinese example; Marco Polo's accounts indicate that the endeavor must have temporarily succeeded only because of the tremendous power and authority of the ruler, with the result of a vast accumulation of gold and silver in the Khan's residence.' But he made disparaging remarks about the French government's paper money assignats and called John Law a 'swindler,' dismissing government money creation. 6 Thureau-Dangin, François (1905: 86–87), translated the Sumerian term for 'justice' (amargi) to mean specifically that officials and wealthy individuals ('the powerful') would have no legal claims for debt foreclosure. 7 Hildebrand, Bruno (1864), classified economies as passing from Naturalwirtschaft ('barter economy') to Geldwirtschaft ('gold/commodity money economy') and finally Kreditwirtschaft ('credit economy').

Malaysia: Recent Video Mocking Hinduism Reflects Growing Religiou...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof A seven-second video clip on social media targeting a Hindu festival is the latest incident that reflects growing polarization in multi-faith, multi-ethnic Malaysia, analysts say. The clip, posted Tuesday on a radio station’s social media platform, showed three Malay Muslim on-air personalities mimicking devotees in a trance during a Hindu festival celebrated by the country’s ethnic Indian community. The Thaipusam festival was held last month. Era FM, the station owned by the country’s largest broadcaster, Astro Radio, deleted the video on the same day it was posted but not before it was widely viewed. Malaysia’s largest Indian political party, the Malaysian Indian Congress, condemned the clip as a blatant insult to Hinduism. Political analyst Azmil Tayeb said the incident reflected 'growing insensitivity that is the result of the polarization we are seeing' in Malaysian society. 'Every slight, perceived or otherwise, can easily trigger raw emotions and be seen as an attack against one’s community. Polarization hardens people’s sense of ethnic and religious identity,' Azmil, from Universiti Sains Malaysia, told BenarNews. Ethnic Malays comprise 70% of Malaysia’s population, followed by ethnic Chinese (22.6%) and ethnic Indians (6.6%). Rituals performed during Thaipusam hold deep significance for Hindu devotees. The festival honors a goddess’ gift of a spear to vanquish evil given to another. Devotees pierce their bodies with hooks and skewers while chanting 'Vel, Vel,' a reference to the sacred spear. That was the chant the radio station’s staff had mimicked in the video. Aziff Azuddin of IMAN Research, a local think-tank, said attacks on faiths were a result of ignorance and inter-ethnic resentment. 'Non-Muslims feel like their faith or way of living is increasingly being sidelined by the Muslim majority,' he told BenarNews. 'And the Muslim majority is increasingly feeling like non-Muslims are becoming more antagonistic toward them. Both things can be true at once.' Incident reports The three Era FM staff featured in the video posted an apology clip online and the station suspended them. The broadcasting, telecommunications and internet regulator, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, on Wednesday issued a notice of intent to revoke the radio station’s license. Police Inspector-General Razaruddin Husain said police had received 73 reports about the video clip. 'The case is being investigated under Section 298 of the Penal Code for deliberately insulting other religions and Section 233 of the Communication Act. The case file has been handed to the Attorney General’s Chambers for further action,' the nation’s police chief told BenarNews. Gayathry Venkiteswaran, an analyst from the University of Nottingham Malaysia, raised concerns about the incident’s impact on the nation. 'It does set a bad precedent in the sense that it almost creates the kind of normalization of attacks against minorities,' Venkiteswaran, an assistant professor of media, languages and cultures, told BenarNews. And yet, she warned against legal action in such cases. 'Instead of taking the criminal investigation path, there has to be more public calling out of this behavior, more ethical responsibility from broadcasters and a stronger emphasis on professional conduct,' she said. Leaders must urge influential media figures to conduct themselves ethically, she added. '[This is] an opportunity for them to show how to have conversations about differences in society,' the professor said. Ongoing incidents In other action on Wednesday, the MCMC fined comedian Harith Iskandar and a Facebook user named Cecilia Yap 10,000 ringgit (U.S. $2,260) each for joking about a ham sandwich that a store, KK Mart, had labeled as halal in January. This incident was perceived as disrespecting Islam, because Muslims are forbidden from eating pork products such as ham, which means they are not halal. The owner of KK Mart and a supplier has been fined 60,000 ringgit ($13,550) last year for 'wounding religious feelings' by selling socks with the word 'Allah' printed on them. Last month, a grilled corn vendor was fined 400 ringgit ($90) for displaying a racially charged sign targeting the Indian community. In 2024, a movie director and producer were charged with allegedly 'wounding religious feelings' in a feature film about a young Muslim girl exploring other faiths. ‘Firm message’ Meanwhile on Thursday, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim warned citizens against using such incidents to stir up tensions. 'This is a firm message to all Malaysians to stop the culture of insulting any religion, culture, and ethnicity in any space in Malaysia,' his office said in a statement. 'Do not let petty issues weaken us at a time when the country is growing and on a good trajectory.'

Silenced And Struggling In Myanmar: How Polycrisis Fuels Period P...	By Naychi Thel Kyaw Tun Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) in Myanmar faces significant challenges due to the ongoing polycrisis: political turmoil, cultural taboos, economic constraints, and limited access to sanitation facilities, particularly in rural and conflict-affected areas. Key Takeaways: The Myanmar crisis, worsened by the military coup, has driven up the cost of menstrual products, making them unaffordable and forcing reliance on unhygienic alternatives, risking health and dignity. Cultural taboos and poor sanitation, especially in rural and conflict areas, limit access to menstrual products, leading to health risks and social isolation. Reusable products like cloth pads and cups offer a sustainable solution, but education and better sanitation are vital for widespread adoption in low-income and rural areas. Many women and girls struggle to afford disposable pads, leading to reliance on unhygienic alternatives, while inadequate waste management contributes to environmental pollution. The situation worsens in emergency settings, such as internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, where access to menstrual products and privacy is severely limited. Since the military coup in February 2021, Myanmar has experienced severe economic turmoil, leading to a sharp increase in the prices of essential goods, including menstrual hygiene products. Before the coup, a pack of eight to ten sanitary pads cost approximately 400 kyats. By mid-2024, the same pack will cost 1,500 and 2,000 kyats, representing a price surge of over 300%, according to Frontier Myanmar. Myanmar Fight For Period Poverty report by the Purple Feminists Group, published in February 2025, further highlights that nearly half of respondents spend between 1,000 and 5,000 kyats on disposable pads, while reusable products such as menstrual discs, cups, and tampons cost over 10,000 kyats, making them unaffordable for many low- and middle-income families. This sharp increase in menstrual product prices has exacerbated period poverty, making it increasingly difficult for women and girls to afford essential hygiene products. Although awareness of sustainable options like reusable cloth pads and menstrual cups is growing, cultural acceptance, affordability, and access to clean water remain barriers. A balanced approach is needed to address immediate menstrual needs and long-term sustainability, ensuring dignity, health, and environmental responsibility for women and girls across Myanmar. Immediate Needs in Urgent Situations In crisis settings, the priority is to provide women and girls with reliable and safe menstrual products to maintain their health and dignity. Disposable sanitary pads are often the go-to solution due to their ease of use and immediate availability. However, the distribution of these products in Myanmar's IDP camps has faced obstacles, including cultural stigmas and logistical challenges. A study on conflict and health highlighted that many women and girls in these camps lack access to adequate MHM materials and facilities, exacerbating health risks and social isolation. Myanmar Fight For Period Poverty report further emphasizes the struggles of menstruators in Myanmar, revealing that many lack awareness and access to proper menstrual products, leading to health risks and social stigmatization. The report calls for educational initiatives, improved accessibility, and dismantling of cultural stigmas to combat period poverty effectively. Disposable pads' immediate availability and convenience make them a practical option in emergencies. However, there are several challenges associated with their distribution and use. First, the cost of these products has increased dramatically, making it difficult for humanitarian organizations to provide them at scale. Second, many women in rural and displaced communities lack access to private and sanitary disposal facilities, leading to improper disposal methods that contribute to environmental pollution. Third, the stigma surrounding menstruation in Myanmar means that many women feel ashamed or embarrassed to ask for menstrual products, further limiting their access. To address these challenges, humanitarian organizations and government agencies must prioritize menstrual health in emergency response efforts. This includes ensuring the inclusion of menstrual products in aid packages, setting up designated safe spaces for menstrual hygiene management in IDP camps, and conducting awareness campaigns to break down cultural stigmas. Additionally, donors and international organizations must provide financial support for menstrual product distribution, helping offset the rising costs due to economic instability. Sustainable Solutions for Long-Term Impact While addressing immediate needs is crucial, it is equally important to consider the environmental impact and sustainability of menstrual products. Reusable options, such as cloth pads and menstrual cups, offer a viable alternative. These products reduce environmental waste and prove to be cost-effective over time. In Myanmar, initiatives have been launched to produce reusable sanitary pads locally, empowering women economically and providing a sustainable solution for menstrual hygiene. For instance, a pilot program from UNFPA trained women in IDP camps to manufacture 'Safepads,' reusable pads designed for day and night use. This initiative supplied necessary products and created income opportunities for the women involved. Reusable products offer multiple benefits beyond sustainability. First, they are cost-effective in the long run, reducing the financial burden on low-income families. A menstrual cup, for example, can last up to ten years, whereas disposable pads need to be purchased every month. Second, reusable products significantly reduce menstrual waste, helping to address the growing environmental concerns associated with disposable pads. Third, locally produced reusable pads can generate employment opportunities for women, fostering economic independence and empowerment. However, despite these advantages, there are still barriers to the widespread adoption of reusable menstrual products in Myanmar. Cultural resistance remains strong, with many women hesitant to use menstrual cups due to misconceptions and a lack of proper education on their benefits. Moreover, access to clean water and sanitation is a major concern, as proper hygiene practices are necessary to maintain reusable products safely. Reusable products may pose health risks without adequate washing facilities rather than serve as a sustainable solution. Targeted education and awareness campaigns are essential to encourage sustainable menstrual products. Schools and community groups should incorporate menstrual hygiene education into their programs, teaching young girls about the benefits and proper use of reusable products. Financial assistance programs should also be established to make these products accessible to low-income households. Government support is also critical, whether through subsidies, tax reductions on menstrual products, or investments in better sanitation infrastructure. However, the current political landscape in Myanmar can’t expect a government-led initiative for MHM either from State Administration Council (SAC) or the National Unity Government (NUG). Conclusion Balancing feasibility and sustainability in menstrual hygiene management in Myanmar requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Cultural acceptance remains a significant barrier, as menstrual cups and reusable pads may face resistance due to societal norms and misconceptions. Community education is essential to shift perceptions and promote the benefits of sustainable products. Access to clean water and sanitation is another crucial factor, as reusable products require proper cleaning, making disposable options more practical in areas lacking these facilities. Economic challenges also play a role, with the initial cost of reusable products posing a barrier for many women. Programs that subsidize these products or provide them for free can help alleviate this issue. Additionally, the environmental impact of disposable pads is substantial, making promoting reusable products a necessary step towards sustainability. A multi-faceted approach is needed to address the menstrual health crisis in Myanmar effectively. This includes emergency response efforts to provide immediate relief, long-term strategies to promote sustainable menstrual products, and policy reforms to improve overall menstrual health management. By tackling both the short-term and long-term challenges, Myanmar can ensure that all women and girls have access to safe, dignified, and sustainable menstrual hygiene solutions, regardless of their economic or social status.

The AI Boom And The Future Of Data Centers: How Artificial Intell...	The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to an unprecedented surge in demand for high-performance computing power. At the heart of this revolution lies the data center, a critical infrastructure that enables AI development, cloud computing, and big data analytics. As AI-driven applications become more sophisticated, the need for advanced, scalable, and efficient data centers is growing at an exponential rate. This article explores the relationship between AI and data centers, analyzing how the AI boom is fueling a transformation in data center design, infrastructure, energy consumption, and the future of digital ecosystems. Understanding Data Centers and Their Role in AI A data center is a facility equipped with powerful servers, networking hardware, and storage systems designed to process and manage vast amounts of data. These centers serve as the backbone of modern computing, supporting applications ranging from enterprise cloud services to complex AI models. The increasing integration of AI technologies is pushing data centers to adopt more robust and efficient infrastructures to meet the growing computational demands. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), relies on massive datasets for training and inference. This process demands high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities, which are provided by data centers equipped with specialized AI hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and custom AI accelerators. AI workloads require: High computational power for training deep neural networks. Scalable storage solutions to handle large datasets. High-speed networking to facilitate rapid data transfers. Efficient cooling systems to manage the heat generated by AI processors. The Growth of AI-Driven Data Centers The AI revolution is significantly impacting data center growth in several key ways: 1. Hyperscale Data Centers Hyperscale data centers are massive facilities designed to accommodate large-scale computing workloads. These centers are primarily operated by tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and NVIDIA, all of whom are investing billions in building AI-ready data centers worldwide. AI-driven businesses require greater scalability, leading to the rise of massive hyperscale facilities with thousands of interconnected servers. These data centers use advanced cooling techniques, including liquid cooling and immersion cooling, to handle AI's intensive processing requirements. The need for high-speed, low-latency networking is driving investments in fiber-optic networks and edge computing solutions. 2. Edge Computing and AI While hyperscale data centers dominate AI development, edge computing is playing an increasing role in real-time AI applications. Edge computing brings computational power closer to end-users, reducing latency and improving performance for AI-driven technologies such as: Autonomous vehicles, which require instant processing of sensor data. Smart cities, where AI processes video surveillance, traffic management, and energy distribution in real-time. IoT devices, including smart appliances, medical devices, and industrial automation systems. As AI applications proliferate, data centers must evolve to incorporate edge computing nodes, creating a decentralized computing ecosystem that enhances efficiency and responsiveness. 3. Energy Demands and Sustainability Challenges One of the biggest challenges of AI-driven data centers is energy consumption. AI models require enormous processing power, leading to higher electricity usage and increased environmental impact. According to estimates, AI workloads could consume up to 20% of global electricity by 2030 if sustainable solutions are not implemented. To address these challenges, companies are: Investing in renewable energy-powered data centers, utilizing solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Exploring small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) as a stable energy source for high-performance computing. Implementing AI-driven energy optimization to reduce power consumption through smart cooling systems and energy-efficient hardware. 4. The Role of AI in Optimizing Data Centers Interestingly, AI itself is being used to enhance data center operations. AI-driven management systems analyze real-time data to optimize cooling, power distribution, and resource allocation. Some key AI applications in data centers include: AI-based cooling systems, which dynamically adjust temperatures to maximize efficiency. Predictive maintenance, where AI detects hardware failures before they occur, reducing downtime. Workload distribution, where AI directs computational tasks to the most energy-efficient servers, minimizing power wastage. Companies like Google have already implemented AI-driven cooling management, reducing energy consumption by up to 40% in some data centers. The Future of Data Centers in the Age of AI As AI continues to evolve, data centers will undergo further transformations to support emerging technologies. Several key trends will shape the future of AI-driven data centers: 1. AI-Optimized Hardware and Chips Traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs) are no longer sufficient for AI workloads. Instead, specialized AI chips are becoming the new standard. Companies like NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD are developing AI-optimized processors, including: Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), designed for deep learning tasks. Neuromorphic chips, which mimic the human brain's neural processing. Quantum computing, which has the potential to revolutionize AI training by exponentially increasing processing speeds. 2. AI-Powered Data Centers as a Service (DCaaS) The concept of Data Center as a Service (DCaaS) is gaining momentum, where businesses can rent AI-optimized computing resources from cloud providers instead of building their own infrastructure. This allows startups and enterprises to scale their AI operations without massive capital investment in hardware. Cloud-based AI training enables researchers and companies to train models remotely. AIaaS (AI as a Service) provides pre-trained models and computing power to organizations without requiring on-premises infrastructure. Serverless AI computing allows businesses to deploy AI applications dynamically, only using computational power when needed. 3. The Rise of Modular and Self-Sustaining Data Centers To improve scalability and sustainability, the data center industry is shifting towards modular designs that can be deployed quickly and efficiently. Prefabricated data centers are gaining popularity, allowing organizations to establish AI-ready infrastructure in record time. Additionally, companies are investing in self-sustaining data centers that operate independently of traditional power grids. Some innovative approaches include: Underwater data centers, which use ocean water for cooling. AI-driven microgrids, which generate their own electricity using renewable sources. Bio-computing, where AI models are run using biological processors instead of silicon-based chips. Conclusion The boom of artificial intelligence is reshaping the landscape of data centers, driving demand for more powerful, scalable, and sustainable infrastructure. Hyperscale data centers are expanding, edge computing is becoming essential, and new energy-efficient solutions are being developed to handle the surge in AI workloads. At the same time, AI itself is revolutionizing how data centers operate, optimizing energy use, managing workloads, and ensuring reliability. As we move forward, the synergy between AI and data centers will continue to evolve, creating a new era of intelligent, efficient, and self-sustaining digital infrastructure. The future of AI depends on data centers, and the future of data centers depends on innovation in AI—a cycle of continuous progress that will define the next phase of the digital revolution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufvhg6exDPqRd	2025-03-06T17:43:20-08:00	
Ukraine’s Reputation For Corruption Is Legion: Has It Gotten Bett...	By Mike Eckel and Heorhiy Shabayev (RFE/RL) -- Before he was appointed head of Ukraine’s Anti-Monopoly Committee in 2023, Pavlo Kyrylenko served as the top official in the Donetsk regional administration, overseeing the Ukrainian-controlled parts of a region partially occupied by Russian forces. During that time, his in-laws were also real estate investors, acquiring 21 properties including commercial office space, land plots, and apartments in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Uzhhorod. His wife, whose relatives’ names appeared on the property ownership papers, also drove a luxury BMW X3 sport utility vehicle. To make matters worse, there were major omissions on his legally required financial disclosure forms. Moreover, his wife did not appear to have any income that would legitimately explain how they acquired 70 million hryvnias (around $1.8 million) in assets. Those revelations, first made by Schemes, RFE/RL’s Ukrainian investigative unit , ultimately led to Kyrylenko being charged with 'illegal enrichment' and 'declaration of false information.' A modest victory for anti-corruption campaigners, Kyrylenko’s charges were another reminder of the issue that Ukraine has been struggling with for a decade or more: endemic, prolific corruption, in the public and private sectors. 'Obviously, we still have a lot of work to do. That’s correct, and of course there is still corruption in Ukraine,' said Daria Kalenyuk, a respected activist and executive director of the Kyiv-based Anti-Corruption Action Center, which was founded in 2012. 'However, I can compare today with what was here 13 years ago…and it's like the results are unbelievable.' Corruption Scandals Three years into Russia’s all-out invasion, Ukrainian society continues on a war footing, galvanized to support the armed forces in the fight against an external, existential threat -- while also rallying behind President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s wartime leadership. But corruption remains a persistent internal threat, illustrated by a series of scandals in recent years involving the Defense Ministry, national prosecutors, and wealthy businessmen. The predecessor to the current defense minister lost his job due to a scandal involving inflated food prices. 'It's good that it is possible in Ukraine, during the [fourth] year of the large-scale invasion, to actually freely expose corruption, and that there are tools which allow [people] to do that,' she told RFE/RL. 'So it's actually an indication that we have an open society and still a system of checks and balances, that we are a free country, free society.' The struggle to clean up the country’s reputation as a swamp has been messy at times, said Andriy Borovyk, the executive director of the corruption watchdog, Transparency International Ukraine. But not every mess is necessarily a sign of corruption, he said. 'Should we talk about corruption during war? I think yes -- it’s necessary,' Borovyk told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service. 'But in Ukrainian society, there’s a tendency to label any inefficiency or stupidity as corruption right away. That’s just how things are perceived here.' 'Yes, corruption must be exposed, but not every inefficiency should be immediately equated with corruption,' he said. Wartime Corruption Under Zelenskyy Disgust with graft is often cited as one of the leading causes for the 2013-2014 Maidan demonstrations, where thousands of Ukrainians took to Kyiv’s streets for months to protest. After President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in February 2014, and Russia launched a campaign of covert and overt military action in the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine’s military struggled to mount an effective defense, in some cases lacking weaponry that had been contracted but never supplied. The problem was largely attributed to graft. For many, the nadir came with the post-Maidan discoveries at Yanukovych’s Versailles-like complex called Mezhyhirya , where he built an opulent mansion along with guesthouses, lakes, a collection of classic luxury cars, and a dock with a mock 18th century Spanish warship. Zelenskyy’s landslide election victory in 2019 was widely seen as another push to try to move society beyond old habits: away from bribery and kickbacks -- big and small -- and toward transparency and accountability. Russia’s war has made it more difficult. During the invasion, defense planners have been raked over the coals for several eye-popping procurement scandals -- something that appears to resonate more deeply with Ukrainians eager to support the armed forces. Military contracts had been classified following the 2022 invasion. However, that changed in January 2023, when investigative reporters found a military supplier who was charging the government nearly 2 1/2 times the retail price for eggs. Schemes later found additional contracts with suppliers wxho were providing the armed forces with food items at above-market rates. Public pressure led to Zelenskyy sacking Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov in September 2023. Under pressure from the United States and Western countries aiding Ukraine, the Zelenskyy government set up a specialized entity -- the Defense Procurement Agency -- to streamline how weaponry was contracted, purchased, and supplied. On January 28, 2025, the Cabinet fired a deputy defense minister as part of a shake-up of the procurement operations. That same day , the National Anti-Corruption Bureau -- a dedicated graft-fighting law enforcement agency -- opened a criminal probe of Umerov for refusing to extend Bezrukova’s contract . But Reznikov’s successor as defense minister, Rustem Umerov, criticized the Defense Procurement Agency for what he said was inefficiency and lax governance. Defenders of its director, Maryna Bezrukova, who took over in early 2024, said she helped clean up a murky but essential system. 'Unfortunately, monitoring defense expenditures remains a highly opaque process, and the public learns about irregularities only in isolated cases,' said Serhiy Mytkalyk, who heads a nongovernmental organization called Anti-Corruption Headquarters. How Corrupt Is Ukraine? Transparency International, whose corruption perception ratings are closely watched around the world, said Ukraine had improved markedly in recent years due to 'reforms aimed at European integration and the fulfillment of international obligations.' However, the country slipped last year, the group said, due to reforms 'being implemented only formally,' or the implementation was 'being deliberately stalled.'Overall, Ukraine rated in 105th place out of 180 countries in the organization’s 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index -- ahead of Russia and Belarus, but behind Moldova, Hungary, and Romania. The United States was in 28th place. Last year, Dmytro Verbytskiy, a top official in the national Prosecutor-General’s Office, was found to be living in a rented suburban townhouse that his nephew had bought at a grossly underpriced value, according to another Schemes investigation. Schemes also discovered evidence suggesting the nephew was in fact a straw-man buyer, secretly representing an Odesa businessman. Experts said the arrangement might constitute tax evasion, though the deputy prosecutor denied wrongdoing. Schemes later uncovered details about Verbytskiy’s girlfriend, who in 2024 became the owner of a new Porsche automobile and a 3-story cottage in the same tony subdivision where Verbytskiy was living—even though her declared income was substantially lower. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau later launched a criminal investigation into Verbytskiy’s assets. Weeks after the revelations, and the subsequent investigation, Verbytskiy officially resigned from the prosecutor’s office. Anti-corruption activist Kalenyuk argued the fact that these scandals and investigations are in the public eye wasn’t a sign of unremitting corruption; rather, she said, it was a healthy sign that Ukrainian public and civil society were reacting to the problem. 'It's like saying that there is no corruption in Belarus. Nobody is talking about corruption in Belarus, absolutely nobody. But it doesn't mean that there is no corruption,' she said. 'It just means that if you are talking about corruption in Belarus, you will be jailed, tortured, extorted, imprisoned, intimidated, killed, whatever.' As for Kyrylenko, who was charged with 'illegal enrichment' for his shady property deals, prosecutors requested he be detained, but instead the court ordered him released on August 28, 2024, pending trial, with an electronic monitoring bracelet, and bail of 30 million hryvnia ($730,000). The bail, Schemes found , was paid not by Kyrylenko, however, but by a businessman that owns a company currently under investigation by a regional unit of the Anti-Monopoly Committee. Mike Eckel is a senior international correspondent reporting on political and economic developments in Russia, Ukraine, and around the former Soviet Union, as well as news involving cybercrime and espionage. He's reported on the ground on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the wars in Chechnya and Georgia, and the 2004 Beslan hostage crisis, as well as the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Why We’re Stuck With The Term ‘Classical Liberalism’ – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken Near the beginning of his ten-hour lecture series on the history of political thought, the great free-market historian Ralph Raico takes a little time to define his terms. In the first lecture he says: 'What I’m going to be discussing this week is classical liberalism. I might slip and just call it liberalism from time to time, but you’ll understand what I’m saying. We’ll be discussing its growth, its development, and finally, I’ll say something about the possible future of liberalism.' As the lectures progress, it becomes apparent that Raico is using the term liberalism to mean the philosophy of freedom and laissez-faire. To many average Americans who think of themselves as being of the party of freedom and free markets, they may think this is rather odd. Many Americans in this group—especially the variety who are not prone to reading history books—might be confused by this. After all, don’t talk show hosts like Sean Hannity use the term 'liberal' to describe todays social democrats? Isn’t it proper to use the term 'conservative' to describe the free-market group? If one tends to think of the 1940s as the murky, distant past, then yes, the current use of the terms 'conservative' and 'liberal' seems fine. On the other hand, for people who actually study history and try to make sense of intellectual movement and their origins, it is usually obvious that the way the term 'liberal' is used by pundits at Fox News and MSNBC simply doesn’t work. This is because the term 'liberal,' as used by people in the past, clearly meant the party of freedom and free markets. The term 'conservative,' meanwhile, denotes no specific ideological content, and depends on which country one is talking about. The post-1945 ideological movement we now call 'conservative' has never really been an heir to the classical liberals. This can be seen in the American conservative movement’s obsession with war, and in the fact that its founder, William F. Buckley, literally supported the adoption of militarist totalitarianism. Indeed, the free-market aspect of conservatism was never more than a thin patina applied to the movement to help the conservative leaders attract the disaffected free-market supporters of the Old Right. American conservatism in practice has never prioritized freedom as historical liberals have. Indeed, some of the conservative movement’s own theorists, such as Russell Kirk, explicitly sought to separate the conservative movement from the free-market liberals of the nineteenth century. (See Kirk’s book The Conservative Mind.) To describe a free-market person as 'conservative' in 1910 or 1850 would have just been confusing to everyone involved. Libertarianism is the Radical Wing of Classical Liberalism This is an important issue for libertarians since, as Raico shows, the ideology we call 'libertarianism' is simply the radical wing of the intellectual movement known as classical liberalism. This, however, hasn’t stopped many modern day classical liberalism and libertarians from claiming that there is some sort of bright shining line between libertarians and free-market liberals. Often, the claim is that libertarians and classical liberals are fundamentally incompatible because libertarians are all supposedly hard-core anarcho-capitalists while classical liberals demand the existence of a state. This attempt at inserting a hard separation between the two groups does not survive a look at the historical reality, however. For instance, we can find plenty of theorists with anarchist views who were well ensconced and highy influential in liberal circles. Perhaps most notable is Gustave de Molinari, the grand old man of liberalism by the late nineteenth century, but also arguably the first anarcho-capitalist. Molinari denied that a state was necessary and generally took a very radical laissez-faire, anti-statist view. He was also the editor of the flagship liberal journal Journal des Économistes for decades. It would be absurd to claim that Molinari cannot be counted among the liberals because of his anarchist views. We might also look to Jean-Baptiste Say who was clear that he did not regard the state as necessary. It’s hard to overstate Say’s prestige and influence among liberals in the nineteenth century. Yet, he was clearly part of the liberal world, and it makes no sense to claim that his anarchist statements somehow render him not a part of the liberal movement. J.B. Say, like Molinari, was clearly both a libertarian and a classical liberal. We might make similar observations about Herbert Spencer. Spencer, of course, famously wrote an anarchist essay on the right to ignore the state. Was Spencer therefore not a liberal? That would be news to most of the liberals of Spencer’s time. Spencer was one of the radicals, and as such, was a libertarian. But he was hardly outside the liberal movement. As with every other intellectual movement, there were some who were more moderate than others. The breadth and radicalism of some corners of the classical liberal movement should now make it all the more clear how incoherent it would be to apply a term like 'conservative' to describe this group. To apply the term 'conservative' to theorists like Spencer, Say, or Molinari should strike us as laughable. Because of this, Raico has even gone so far as to use the terms 'classical liberal' and 'libertarian' as near synonyms. This is fitting given how even the more moderate classical liberals of the past—such as Adam Smith—would be considered free-market extremists by today’s political standards. In this sense, the term libertarian can indeed serve as a substitute for classical liberal. Why Surrender the Term to the Left? Even with 'libertarian' as a serviceable substitute for 'liberalism,' properly understood, that’s not a good enough reason to simply let the Left have it. Yes, handing over the term 'liberal' to be the exclusive property of the democratic socialists may seem no big deal to people who rarely read about the past as it was before living memory. But, it is a serious problem for people who actually try to think systematically about the origins of modern political and intellectual movements. It doesn’t work to describe the Lockeans of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as 'liberals' on one page, and to then describe people with the same beliefs as something else entirely a few paragraphs later—simply because that second group of people happened to live in the twentieth century. This is a formula for creating what Raico calls 'conceptual mayhem' in which the term 'liberalism' means both the ideology of Hillary Clinton and the Ideology of Thomas Jefferson. If we use the word this way, then it has no useful meaning at all. This is how we ended up with the term 'classical liberal' in the first place. Recognizing that there is no suitable substitute term for the ideology of laissez-faire, some commentators attempted to deal with this mayhem. 'Classical liberalism' is an awkward phrase, but is used out of necessity. The added adjective 'classical'—which is essentially a synonym of 'traditional'— is used as a makeshift solution to the abuse of the term 'liberal' in recent decades. That’s why we have it. The whole reason this even became necessary, of course, is because social democrats stole the term to describe their own ideology back in the first half of the twentieth century. As Raico shows, this was done deliberately because liberalism was extremely popular at the time, and it made a lot of sense to poach the word and apply it to the Left’s unliberal ideologies. Raico writes: In a famous passage [Joseph Schumpeter] ironically states that it was a kind of compliment, if an unintended one, when the enemies of the system of free enterprise confiscated the name liberal for what was basically the opposite of what liberalism had stood for from the start. Nowadays, you can find writers who express astonishment that free market economists still sometimes insist on calling themselves liberals rather than conservatives. Some might say why argue over a name, why not just call your position anything at all and go on from there to argue the case for it? Stephen Holmes, a political scientist from Chicago, has called the dispute over the term 'liberal' a matter of bragging rights; the right to brag 'I’m the real liberal in the liberal tradition and you’re not.' On the other hand, he insists that he’s in the real liberal tradition and thinks it’s worth arguing about. Raico notes here that scholars on the Left—that is, the social democrats—aren’t willing to give the term back to the laissez-faire party, and think it’s worth fighting to retain control of the term. On the other hand, many free-market people—who generally seem to lack the savvy and drive of their enemies on the Left—can’t be bothered with fighting for proper terminology. Instead, I often hear from free-market activists that we should just adopt another term. Perhaps 'voluntarist' or 'individualist.' Both terms, of course, conceptually sever the link between modern laissez-faire liberals and their 400-year history. That’s part of the Left’s plan. The Left wants use to believe that modern social democrats like John Maynard Keynes are the real liberals and the inheritors of the the tradition of 'liberty' pushed by the revered American revolutionaries. This is completely false, of course, but by controlling the word 'liberal,' the left can also distance the true party of freedom from its own historical patrimony. Moreover, if a new term for the laissez-party actually becomes popular, the Left will just try to expropriate that term, too. This already happened with the term 'individualist' as Raico notes: some of the English old-fashioned liberals like Auberon Herbert and the extreme followers of Herbert Spencer started saying 'let’s call ourselves something else, let’s call ourselves individualists.' Then, John Dewey started saying 'well, you know, there was an old individualism that is now obsolete.' Dewey then went on to say that his leftwing ideology was the real individualism. Indeed, surrendering to the Left on definitions and terminology just encourages the Left to keep poaching popular words. Basically, every time a self-described 'conservative' uses the term 'liberal' to describe a Leftist social democrat, he is basically saying 'yes, I agree to discuss everything using the terms and definitions dictated by the Left.' We have already made a big concession by using the modifier 'classical' at all. Alas, we are forced into it because the social democrats who now call themselves 'liberals' have long controlled the media and academia, and those groups have tremendous influence in the public’s use of words. Words Have Meanings But, if the real liberals, the real party of laissez-faire, simply abandons the term, it will become next to impossible to construct a coherent historical narrative about the party of freedom and free markets. That’s what the Left wants, of course, but we don’t have to go along with it. Raico concludes: I submit that there is no intellectually honest reason to bestow the term liberal on those nowadays who favor a never-ending list of government funded programs. These programs, we are told, are necessary to deal with every real or imagined ill of society and favor a constantly expanding state apparatus to wage war on the traditional ways and values of civil society. The people who support this are the people who are called liberal nowadays. The 'new' liberalism of Hobhouse and Hobson is indistinguishable from the position, for instance, of Eduard Bernstein, the founder of the vision of socialism in Germany. This has today become socialism altogether in the modern world, just as the position of American liberal intellectuals is indistinguishable from that of people who call themselves social democrats in Europe. ... The working definition of liberalism that I will adopt is this: it is the ideology that holds that civil society—understood as a sum order of society, the sum of the social order minus the state—by and large runs itself within the bounds of a principle of private property. This is liberalism as I’ll be discussing it here. Raico is right. We might still have to add on the word 'classical' on occasion to help along those with a weaker grasp of history. But 'liberal' remains the only truly accurate and consistent term for the ideology of freedom and free markets.

Stop Moving Clocks Back And Forth And Go With Standard Time – OpE...	Daylight saving time returns at 2 a.m. on Sunday. Unless Congress stops the madness of springing forward and falling back every year, it will end Nov. 2, when standard time resumes. Twenty states have proposed or enacted legislation to implement daylight saving time permanently. But those laws cannot go into effect until Congress amends or repeals the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which established the current twice-yearly clock change regime. We’ve been here before. The United States adopted year-round daylight saving time during the two global wars of the 20th century and again starting on Jan. 6, 1974. Both policies were justified as a means of saving not time, but energy. When the U.S. Department of Energy finally studied the issue in 2008—a four-week extension of daylight saving time mandated by an amendment to the 1966 Uniform Time Act—the energy savings were found to be trivial: 0nly about a 0.03 percent reduction in national energy consumption. Subsequent research, including a 2010 study by environmental economists Matthew Kotchen of Yale and Laura Grant, then with the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates daylight saving time actually 'increases electricity demand.' Significantly, 1974’s permanent experiment with daylight saving time ended after just eight months. Though intended to last two years, it was canceled in response to strong opposition from parents who objected to sending their children to school in the dark during late fall and early winter. According to Time magazine, 'Eight children in Florida were involved in pre-dawn car accidents in the wake of the time change, leading a TV commentator to coin the phrase ‘daylight disaster time.’' Daylight saving time has other serious dark sides. Springing clocks forward one hour in March causes worrisome physical and mental health effects, including spikes in heart attacks, strokes and automobile accidents. Sleep deprivation makes people groggy, less focused and less productive on the job until they adjust to the time change. Those adjustments take longer at older ages. The adverse health consequences of daylight saving time explain why the American Medical Association and many sleep specialists and physiologists recommend staying on standard time throughout the calendar year. Standard time aligns the human body more closely with the sun. Sunlight optimally sets our body clocks (circadian rhythms). The Uniform Time Act of 1966 permits individual states to adopt standard time year-round without congressional action. But only Hawaii, parts of Arizona (areas beyond the borders of the Navajo Nation, which comprises 27,000 square miles of that state plus portions of Utah and New Mexico) and the outlying U.S. territories do not observe daylight saving time. So Arizona operates under two different time regimes from March to November: DST for those living on the reservation and standard time for everyone else. The number of hours the sun is shining has nothing to do with where the hands of the clock point. The season, and the arc distance from the equator to your location on the globe, determine the length of the day. The benefits to after-work golfers and others who like longer sunlit evenings hardly justify the substantial costs of the twice-yearly time changes the rest of us are forced to bear. If people want to shop or play golf after work, they can leave their offices earlier in the afternoon when the day already is longer at northern latitudes. In the late 19th century, the railroads adopted the convention of 'standard time,' which is now in effect for a ridiculously brief four months every year. Standard time and geographically defined time zones helped shippers and passengers easily and more accurately plan departures and arrivals. Daylight saving time abruptly shifts most Americans one time zone to the east. Why? Daylight saving time does not 'save' anything. We’ve tried permanent daylight saving time nationwide before. Repeating the same policy mistake and expecting a different outcome is one definition of insanity. Permanent standard time is the best way of resolving the current debate.

End The DC Hold ‘Em Game – OpEd	In its first hearing, the Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) cited 'hundreds of billions of taxpayers’ dollars wasted on improper payments and fraud.' The DOGE revelations include $20 billion at the Environmental Protection Agency, money the EPA bosses 'knew they were wasting.' With April 15 looming, taxpayers should be aware of one reason such colossal waste occurs: the government gets their money before they do. As Robert Higgs (Crisis and Leviathan) explains, this is a relatively new development. Before World War II, individuals who owed federal tax on their income paid during the following year in quarterly installments. As Higgs explains, 'Wars have always been the most important occasions for the introduction of new forms of taxation.' A gigantic global war imposed huge revenue demands, so the government devised a plan to withhold tax from workers’ paychecks. One of the architects of this system was economist Milton Friedman, who admitted that he helped 'develop machinery that would make possible a government that I would come to criticize severely as too large, too intrusive, too destructive of freedom.' Withholding was supposedly a wartime measure, but the government conveniently kept it in place. Higgs cites the observation of Charlotte Twight in Dependent on D.C. that 'withholding is the paramount administrative mechanism that since 1943 has enabled the federal government to collect, without significant protest, sufficient private resources to fund a vastly expanded welfare state.' As DOGE now reveals, the welfare state is also an expanded, wasteful state. Politicians and government bureaucrats appear to believe they have a prior claim to what American workers earn. As a matter of right, everything a worker earns belongs to the worker. The so-called 'take-home pay' is what remains after the government grabs the worker’s money first. Workers should get everything they earn and pay their income taxes in quarterly installments, just as freelance writers and other self-employed Americans do now. Writing quarterly checks to the government will raise consciousness of how much the government is taking. Thanks to DOGE, the people are learning how much of their money the government is wasting. Judging by their shrill complaints, government bureaucrats seem to think there’s something wrong with accountability. Musk’s demand for them to show five accomplishments from the previous week really set them off. Imagine if that email had shown up with John Beale, once the highest-paid employee at the Environmental Protection Agency. In his long career, Beale never produced anything of value. With degrees in political science, administration, and law, Beale boasted little if any scientific expertise for his job as a 'senior policy adviser' in the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. In 1994, Beale told his bosses he was a secret agent for the CIA, but nobody at the EPA bothered to check. While claiming to be in London, India, and Pakistan, Beale was actually performing no work of any kind. He pulled off the CIA ruse for nearly 20 years, bilking taxpayers of nearly $1 million, and even got retention bonuses after he retired. For details, see the hearings shown on C-SPAN. This all went down at the EPA, whose bosses knew they were wasting $20 billion. Taxpayers can be forgiven for thinking the Department of Justice should look into it. As DOGE reveals fathomless waste and fraud, President Trump should push for the elimination of tax withholding at first opportunity. The Internal Revenue Service—bloated by $80 billion under Biden’s 'Inflation Reduction Act,' should not get taxpayers’ money before the workers who earned it. That will restrain government power and help prevent waste, fraud and abuse from happening in the first place.

Is This What Winning Looks Like? – OpEd	If this is winning, it is less fun than I had hoped. The confirmation hearings for Jay Bhattacharya as secretary of the National Institutes of Health just ended. They were short, just two hours from soup to nuts. Nothing played out like I had expected. And yet, now that I think about it, it played out exactly as I should have expected. Jay’s erudition, humility, and sincerity carried the day. His vast knowledge of medicine, science, and economics is worn casually, but it is unmistakable. It’s inconceivable that political actors could possibly match it. That is known and obvious. My main interest in watching was in hope of something approaching a real debate over Covid policy, 2020-2023 (and, in some ways, continuing in new iterations). After all, that is why he was in this seat. The previous administration specifically targeted him, calling him a 'fringe epidemiologist' and sought to censor his opinions. As time went on and the historical trajectory flipped, this quiet academic who stood up for principle when it mattered has found himself picked to head the world’s most powerful scientific agency. One might suppose – if society and politics work as one might intuitively think they should – that there would now be a big discussion and debate on lockdowns, with both sides allowed to speak. Maybe this would be the reckoning we’ve all long awaited. Instead, there was no discussion and no debate at all. The Democratic side of the aisle did not bring it up once. Three Republicans did and briefly. Jay reiterated what he has said for years and what was stated in the Great Barrington Declaration. His position is clear. The role of science is to advise people based on evidence. It is not to use force to interfere with people’s freedoms. Public health agencies should never have pushed school, business, and church closures, nor forced human separation and masks, and so on. He said this clearly, inclusive of vaccine mandates. 'Science should be an engine for knowledge and freedom, not something that stands on top of society and says you must do this or else.' 'It shouldn’t be pushing Covid vaccines.' 'The proper role of scientists in a pandemic is to answer basic questions that policy makers have about what the right policy should be.' 'The role of scientists shouldn’t be to say you can’t send your kids to school for two years.' 'If science is a force for freedom and knowledge, it will have universal support.' There was zero pushback from the other side. They might as well have had their fingers in their ears. There was a change of subject, almost a desperate one. No one took issue with a word he said on this subject. Instead, the only subject from the Democratic side was pressing to make sure that the money keeps flowing out of the NIH to the research centers in their states. Are we supposed to believe that the new orthodoxy is that the Covid response was a disaster? No one said that but Jay, Rand Paul, and two other Republicans. From the other side, there was not even a breath of contradiction. At the same time, there were no apologies, no admissions of stupidity, no granting that mistakes were made. Instead, we got silence on the whole topic that even the New York Times now admits is the single most important topic of our times. After all, the Covid response did in fact set the world on fire. It is a main cause of the utter collapse in the prestige of experts in many sectors, if not all sectors. It’s a central reason why people don’t trust their doctors, why the media is in such disrepute, why the politicians are met with such incredulity. It’s the major contributing factor for ill-health, illiteracy, depression, substance abuse, economic dislocation, job insecurity, and cultural despair. And yet, we seem to be at a stalemate. The proponents of the response – or those who simply chose to look the other way – don’t want the subject to come up ever again. It is an affected amnesia. The people who were demonized all along and now turn out to be right want to debate but cannot find any sparring partners. We won the match but the bell never rang. The purpose of the bell is to prevent an ambush from behind, which is precisely why this studied silence is so alarming. What happens when a new virus comes along, real, manufactured, or imagined? We have no real statements saying that there will not be a repeat. The existing policy is still what it was: lockdown until vaccination. To be sure, with Jay and RFK and others now in the driver’s seat, this is less likely to go down the same way. And yet if you look at the handling of the Bird flu, you see the same strategies being deployed in ways that have affected prices and the food supply. Authorities want every bird slaughtered if one tests positive. They feed tax dollars to pharmaceutical companies to develop and distribute livestock vaccines. There has been no change in the policy concerning PCR testing and what that implies for the animals. Meanwhile, just before inauguration, the HHS, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of the Interior cooperated in pushing out the first-ever One Health policy for the US, working directly with the WHO, which the US has supposedly left. In other words, there is no real change in the policy or the orthodoxy. One reason for that is precisely because of the absence of real public discussion and debate. If such a debate did occur, and if our leaders would at least be open and honest about this calamity (even if they still defend it), we might finally make progress toward putting the world back together again. As it stands, there are too many unanswered questions, too much pent-up anger, too much uncertainty about precisely how governments plan to manage pandemics, whether they affect humans or livestock. It simply will not do to pretend that none of this happened and hope it goes away once people are tired of the subject, forget, and push back the trauma into the recesses of the public mind. This is all too dishonest for a civilized people. Jay wanted that debate. His interrogators did not. Again, this is not the way winning should feel. Brownstone Institute’s 10-part history could not have come at a better time. We need more than the right people in high-profile positions. We need a completely new paradigm, which cannot really take hold until that reckoning finally does occur. That begins with frankness and an end to the silence. Below is an AI-generated reconstruction of Jay’s opening statement. Reconstructed Opening Statement by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, March 5, 2025 Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Hearing Chairman Cassidy, Ranking Member Sanders, and distinguished members of this committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today as President Trump’s nominee to lead the National Institutes of Health. It is an honor to be considered for this role at an institution that has long been the crown jewel of American biomedical science—a place with a storied history of supporting breakthroughs that have saved countless lives and deepened our understanding of human health. But today, that legacy is at a crossroads. American health is in decline. During the Covid-19 pandemic, life expectancy in the United States plunged, and it has yet to recover. Hundreds of millions of our fellow citizens—adults and children alike—are grappling with a crisis of chronic diseases: obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s. These conditions are robbing us of our vitality and our future. At the same time, public trust in science and medicine has eroded, shaken by a series of missteps and a growing perception that our institutions prioritize conformity over truth. The NIH, as the world’s preeminent health research agency, must rise to meet these challenges. But it cannot do so effectively under the shadow of its recent past. Over the last few years, top NIH officials oversaw a culture of coverup, obfuscation, and intolerance for ideas that diverged from their own. We’ve seen this in the dismissal of legitimate scientific debate during the pandemic, and we’ve seen it in scandals like the fraudulent Alzheimer’s research that undermined confidence in NIH-funded science. This must change. If confirmed, I pledge to restore the NIH to its foundational mission: funding the most innovative, cutting-edge research to deliver transformative advances in human health—not just incremental steps, but bold leaps forward. My plan is to ensure that NIH invests in science that is replicable, reproducible, and generalizable—science we can trust. Too much of modern biomedical research fails this basic test, and we owe the American people better. Central to this vision is a commitment to free speech and scientific dissent. Dissent is not a threat to science—it is the very essence of science. For too long, the NIH has stifled disagreement, sidelining early-career scientists and others who dared to question the orthodoxy. I will establish a culture of respect where all ideas can be expressed and debated openly, because that is how we uncover truth. This is not just a principle; it is a necessity if we are to rebuild the public’s faith in our work. I also share Secretary Kennedy’s urgency in confronting the chronic disease crisis. American health is going backwards, and the NIH must lead the way forward by investigating the root causes of these conditions and developing solutions that prevent and reverse them. This will require rigorous oversight of research that could pose risks—such as studies with pandemic potential—while ensuring the vast majority of NIH work continues to advance the public good. The NIH’s nearly $48 billion budget is a sacred trust, supporting over 300,000 researchers worldwide. If confirmed, I will steward those resources with care, prioritizing innovation over bureaucracy and ensuring that every dollar serves the mission of making Americans healthier. Together with this administration, we can return the NIH to its gold standard—delivering discoveries that improve lives, save lives, and, yes, make America healthy again.

Artificial Intelligence And The Fate Of The Human Imagination: A ...	The incursion of artificial intelligence (AI) into the domains of literature and the arts poses profound existential and epistemological questions. It unsettles our deepest assumptions about creativity, consciousness, and the very nature of human expression. As machines increasingly encroach upon the spaces once considered the sanctuaries of human uniqueness, the creative landscape experiences both an expansion and an erosion. AI serves as both muse and menace, liberating and shackling, augmenting and obfuscating the intricate web of the human psyche. This article offers a psychoanalytic and philosophical meditation on the ramifications of AI's presence in literature and the arts, dissecting its promises and perils. The Machine as the New Muse: The Expansion of the Creative Process From a Freudian perspective, creativity emerges from the dynamic interplay between the unconscious and conscious mind. It is a sublimation of drives, an elaborate dance between the id, ego, and superego. AI, by introducing an externalized mechanism of creativity, extends this dialectic beyond the individual, offering an additional layer to the creative psyche. Instead of serving as a passive tool, AI functions as a collaborator—suggesting, modifying, and even generating aesthetic products. The subconscious mind, once constrained by the individual's linguistic and cognitive limits, finds in AI an endless associative engine, capable of producing variations upon variations of thought. Philosophically, AI engenders a new form of authorship. If the Derridean notion of différance suggests that meaning is always deferred, existing in an endless play of signifiers, then AI's capacity to endlessly iterate creative works becomes the ultimate realization of this concept. The human artist is no longer a singular origin of meaning but rather a navigator amidst an ocean of algorithmic possibilities. In this sense, AI does not replace creativity; it amplifies it, extending the horizon of what can be imagined and constructed. The Aesthetic Singularity: AI and the Death of the Artist Yet, as AI expands creative possibilities, it also challenges the ontological status of the artist. The Romantic ideal of the solitary genius—haunted, inspired, forging the new from the abyss of the self—stands in stark contrast to the mechanized, iterative processes of AI. If AI can generate poetry, paintings, and novels with an efficiency that surpasses human labor, does this herald the obsolescence of the human artist? Lacanian psychoanalysis suggests that subjectivity is formed through lack—the recognition that one is incomplete, forever seeking an unattainable fullness. Human creativity, therefore, is the expression of this lack, a striving for wholeness through symbolic representation. AI, however, lacks this constitutive void. It neither desires nor suffers, and thus, while it can generate art, it cannot create in the psychoanalytic sense. Its productions are simulations, however intricate, lacking the libidinal investment that renders human art a confrontation with the Real. This is where the existential crisis of AI-generated art unfolds. If art is to be defined as the manifestation of inner turmoil, existential questioning, and the ineffable yearnings of being, then AI's role in the arts becomes a simulacrum of true creativity—an echo without an original voice. The aesthetic singularity AI promises thus threatens to render the concept of authorship meaningless. If machines can create without agency, then authorship itself becomes an illusion, dissolved into the collective unconscious of the algorithm. The Commodification of Creativity: From Catharsis to Consumption AI does not merely alter how art is created but also how it is consumed. Late capitalism thrives on efficiency and productivity, and AI fits seamlessly into this framework. Algorithmic art does not need rest, inspiration, or existential crisis; it operates on demand, tailored to market preferences. The distinction between high art and mass production collapses under the weight of infinite customization. AI-generated literature and paintings become products in the purest sense, stripped of the inefficiencies of the human creative struggle. Walter Benjamin's critique of mechanical reproduction warned of the loss of the 'aura'—the unique presence of an artwork in time and space. AI extends this logic to its extreme. When a painting can be replicated or generated infinitely, when a poem can be adjusted in real-time based on audience reception, what remains of the sacred aura of artistic expression? Furthermore, the psychoanalytic function of art as catharsis is undermined. Traditional artistic labor involves confrontation with the unconscious, a journey through repression and revelation. AI-generated works, devoid of psychic investment, risk becoming mere commodities—slick, polished, and ultimately hollow. The therapeutic potential of literature and the arts is diluted when the process of artistic struggle is replaced by instant generativity. The Promise of Transhumanist Art: A Hybrid Future? Despite its threats, AI also presents new forms of artistic experience that may redefine human creativity rather than destroy it. Transhumanist philosophers envision a future where human cognition is augmented by artificial intelligence, leading to an entirely new category of artistic expression. In this vision, AI does not replace human creativity but enhances it—offering artists novel tools to navigate the liminal spaces of imagination. AI-generated art, rather than an autonomous force, may function as a prosthetic extension of the artist's mind. Just as the invention of photography transformed visual representation without eradicating painting, AI might serve as a new mode of aesthetic evolution. The human-AI collaboration could birth forms of literature and art that are unimaginable within the constraints of the human cognitive apparatus alone. However, this hybrid future demands vigilance. The risk remains that AI's ability to predict and optimize artistic trends might result in a hyper-rationalization of creativity. If algorithms dictate aesthetic decisions based on engagement metrics and popularity, art may increasingly serve as a means of control rather than a vehicle for radical expression. Conclusion: The End or Evolution of Art? AI's intrusion into literature and the arts is not merely a technological shift but a philosophical and psychoanalytic rupture. It raises the fundamental question of whether creativity is a uniquely human trait or if it can be outsourced to an intelligence devoid of human consciousness. AI's potential to expand artistic possibilities is undeniable, but so is its capacity to trivialize and commodify creativity. From a psychoanalytic perspective, AI lacks the unconscious depths that fuel human artistic production. Its outputs, however refined, remain spectral—approximations of creativity rather than its true expression. Philosophically, AI challenges the concept of authorship, placing artistic agency in a liminal state between human intention and machine execution. Perhaps, then, the real challenge is not whether AI can create art but whether humans will allow themselves to be eclipsed by their own creations. If AI is to be integrated into the arts, it must not be as a mere producer of aesthetic commodities but as a means to deepen the human encounter with the unknown. The fate of literature and the arts in the age of AI will ultimately depend on whether we harness artificial intelligence to elevate human creativity or surrender to the seductive ease of mechanized imagination.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufrCcQg_Pp1zJ	2025-03-06T17:06:59-08:00	
EU Edges Closer To €150 Billion Defense Package Despite Hungary’s...	By Alexandra Brzozowski and Magnus Lund Nielsen and Nicoletta Ionta and Owen Morgan and Thomas Moller-Nielsen (EurActiv) -- EU leaders endorsed a landmark €150 billion defence spending plan at their highly-anticipated emergency summit on Thursday, while Hungary's Viktor Orbán refused to back a statement of support for Ukraine. All 27 EU countries agreed to consider 'as a matter of urgency' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's plan to issue €150 billion in fresh loans to boost defence spending, paving the way for the Commission to put a concrete proposal on the table by the next summit in two weeks' time. However, a statement of support for Ukraine was supported by only 26 countries, with Orbán – an ally of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin – remaining in obdurate opposition, as most leaders had anticipated. It is not the first time in recent history that EU leaders have adopted a separate statement without Hungarian backing. But their doing so on Thursday shows clear intent that a 'coalition of the willing' will find avenues to send more financial and military aid to Ukraine as the United States withdraws. Hungary could not agree to the statement that all other EU leaders 'firmly supported', which affirmed that 'there can be no negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine' and that any peace deal must 'respect Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Slovakia, led by the pro-Russian Robert Fico, was persuaded to support the Ukraine text by the last-minute inclusion of wording on exploring 'workable solutions' to its ongoing gas supply dispute with Kyiv – though the concession was significantly watered down in the summit's final hours. 'Money where our mouth is' Von der Leyen, who took leaders through the contours of her ReArm Europe plan first announced on Tuesday, confirmed she would table a legal text that elaborates on her menu of five defence funding options in time for the next summit. Those five options, which attracted varying support on Thursday, include: the €150 billion in loans, activating a national 'escape clause' in the bloc's fiscal rules, incentivising the use of cohesion funding for defence spending, a bigger role for the European Investment Bank, and mobilising private capital through completing the Savings and Investment Union. Not on the table, yet, is joint borrowing – or the issuance of so-called Eurobonds – despite French President Emmanuel Macron saying after the summit he was 'ready to look' at the idea. Germany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz confirmed that Germany would like the spending plans to go even further, by creating a long-term exemption of defence investment from EU fiscal rules. European Council President António Costa, who convened the emergency summit, called for 'flexibility' in the application of the fiscal rules, but stopped short of backing the German proposal for a full revamp. 'We are putting our money where our mouth is,' Costa said. Hungary's 'isolation' is not 'division' On Ukraine, meanwhile, the 26 European leaders agreed to examine proposals by the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas for a significanly increased aid package to be sent to Ukraine this year – which had fallen off the draft text only days prior. Macron said that the EU is 'entering a phase of discussions' that means he will soon be 'ready to talk to President Putin... once we've agreed with both President Zelenskyy and our partners that the time is right.' Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – who secured a minor victory with the late inclusion of language that 'welcomes all efforts' towards a 'comprehensive, just and lasting' peace, including those of Trump – ruled out deploying Italian troops to Ukraine in a peacekeeping force. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who joined the leaders for a working lunch, lauded a 'very productive day' in Brussels and confirmed he would travel to Saudi Arabia next week, where his team would attend talks with the United States. 'We are not alone - and we feel it,' he had told reporters on his arrival earlier on Thursday. Despite Hungary's opposition, there was general insistence that the EU's message of support for Kyiv was not weakened. Hungary had 'isolated itself', said Costa – which does not mean 'division'. 'Anytime you bring 27 countries around the table, everybody has their own nuance,' Thomas Byrne, Ireland's European minister, told reporters. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged her fellow leaders to 'conclude that it is really good that there are 26 countries in the EU that – with everything that is happening around us and with the challenges in Ukraine – stand firm in our support.' 'We can be proud of the old continent today,' she added.

Macron’s Offer: France And The Delusions Of Nuclear Deterrence – ...	The singular antics of US President Donald Trump, notably towards supposed allies, has stirred the pot regarding national security in various capitals. From Canberra to Brussels, there is concern that such assumed, if unverifiable notions as extended nuclear deterrence from Washington are valid anymore. America First interests certainly bring that into question, as well it should. If the imperium is in self-introspective retreat, this is to the good. But the internationalists beg to differ, wishing to see the United States as imperial guarantor. In Europe, the fear at the retreat of Washington’s nuclear umbrella, and the inflation of the Russian threat, has caused flutters of panic. On February 20, 2025, Friedrich Merz, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union and the incoming German chancellor, floated the idea that other states consider shouldering Europe’s security burden. 'We need to have discussions with both the British and the French – the two European nuclear powers – about whether nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security from the UK and France, would apply to us.' Merz has also explicitly urged European states to accept the proposition that 'Donald Trump will no longer unconditionally honour NATO’s mutual defence commitment', making it incumbent on them to 'make every effort to at least be able to defend the European continent on its own.' On March 1, French President Emmanuel Macron showed signs of interest. In an interview with Portuguese TV RTP, he expressed willingness to 'to open this discussion … if it allows to build a European force.' There had 'always been a European dimension to France’s vital interests within its nuclear doctrine.' On March 5, in an address to the nation, Macron openly identified Russia as a 'threat to France and Europe'. Accordingly, he had decided 'to open the strategic debate on the protection of our allies on the European continent by our (nuclear) deterrent.' The future of Europe did not 'have to be decided in Washington or Moscow.' The matter of France’s European dimension has certainly been confirmed by remarks made by previous presidents, including Charles de Gaulle, who, in 1964, stated that an attack on a country such as Germany by the then Soviet Union would be seen as a threat to France. Domestically, Macron’s offer did not go down well in certain quarters. It certainly did not impress Marie Le Pen of the far-right National Rally. 'The French nuclear deterrent must remain a French nuclear deterrent,' she declared in comments made on a visit to the Farm Show in Paris. 'It must not be shared, let alone delegated.' This was a misunderstanding, came the response from Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu. The deterrent 'is French and will remain French – from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.' A number of countries meeting at the European Union emergency security summit in Brussels showed interest in Macron’s offer, with some caution. Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk suggested that 'we must seriously consider this proposal.' Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nausėda thought the idea 'very interesting' as 'a nuclear umbrella would serve as really very serious deterrence towards Russia.' Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa was not inclined to commit to a stationing of French nuclear weapons on Latvian territory: it was 'too soon' to raise the issue. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, on the other hand, found the debate 'premature', as 'our security is guaranteed by close cooperation with the United States'. He certainly has a point, given that the United States still, at present, maintains an extensive nuclear arsenal on European soil. The trouble with deterrence chatter is that it remains hostage to delusion. Strategists talk in extravagant terms about the genuine prospect that nuclear weapons can make any one state safer, leading to some calculus of tolerable use. Thus we find the following comment from Benoît Grémare of the Université Jean Moulin Lyon 3: '[T]he fact remains that without US support, the balance of power appears largely unfavourable to France, which has a total of 290 nuclear warheads compared to at least 1,600 deployed warheads and nearly 2,800 stockpiled warheads on the Russian side.' While Grémare acknowledges that France’s thermonuclear arsenal, along with the M51 strategic sea-to-land ballistic missile, would be able to eliminate major Russian cities, Russia would only need a mere '200 seconds too atomise Paris' if its Satan II thermonuclear weapons were used. 'This potential for reciprocity must be kept in mind amid the mutual bet of nuclear deterrence.' Logic here gives way to the presumption that such weapons, rather than suggesting impotence, promise formidable utility. This theoretical, and absurd proposition, renders the unthinkable possible: that Russia just might use nuclear weapons against European countries. Any such contention must fail for the fundamental point that nuclear weapons should, quite simply, never be used. Instead, they should be disbanded and banned altogether, in line with the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Unfortunately, the French offer of replacing the US nuclear umbrella in Europe perpetrates similar deadly sins about deterrence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufpoDu3lKMwSE	2025-03-06T16:57:05-08:00	
Cambodia: World’s ‘Largest Online Black Market’ Loses Banking Lic...	By Jack Adamović Davies Huione Pay, the banking arm of what’s been called the world’s 'largest ever illicit online marketplace,' has been stripped of its banking license, the National Bank of Cambodia confirmed to RFA this week. The company is part of the wider Huione Group of Cambodia, a conglomerate which operates several 'Huione' products, including marketplaces, banking and finance apps. One of these, a Telegram marketplace, has been identified as a notorious place for crime tied to up to $24 billion in illicit transactions. Huione Pay’s license was withdrawn owing to its noncompliance with 'existing regulations and recommendations that may have been made by the regulators,' a National Bank of Cambodia spokesperson told RFA by email on Thursday. The spokesperson did not say when the license was withdrawn or what repercussions the company might face if they continue to operate. Huione did not respond to RFA’s requests for comment before publication. It has previously denied criminal activity– when Huione was identified by the cryptocurrency compliance firm Elliptic to have facilitated millions of dollars in criminal payments, it issued a statement insisting that it was a mere 'information publishing and guarantee trading platform' bearing no responsibility for the goods and services others used it to trade. However, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, or UNODC, Huione’s Telegram marketplace has become one of the main arteries of illicit commerce in Southeast Asia, a region grappling with an epidemic of human trafficking and internet fraud. The UNODC’s regional representative, Benedikt Hofmann, welcomed the termination of Huione Pay’s license. The withdrawal 'will send an important signal, especially given the high profile of Huione and its outsize role for the region’s criminal ecosystem,' he told RFA. Hofmann cautioned, however, that this latest development would not be a cure-all for the region’s crime epidemic – nor would it necessarily mean the end of Huione. 'Huione is in many ways the tip of the iceberg and we will see users shifting to other, similar providers which have emerged in the region,' he added. Much of the money that was being moved through Huione Pay came from illicit activities linked to cyberscamming, the UNODC found. For more than half a decade the region in which Huione operates has been dotted with compounds housing what the U.N. says are hundreds of thousands of enslaved workers forced to perpetrate a type of cyberscam commonly known as 'pig butchering'. The practice is estimated to swindle billions of dollars from its victims around the world every year. Elliptic, the cryptocurrency compliance firm, traced billions of dollars flowing from Huione Guarantee, the Telegram marketplace, to Huione Pay. This was 'likely so that these criminally-derived funds could be cashed out,' firm founder Tom Robinson told RFA. 'I think this will be a blow to Huione Guarantee,' Robinson added. 'We have direct evidence of Huione Pay laundering money from scam victims around the world, including the elderly and vulnerable. They are willing facilitators of pig butchering and other fraud, so any regulatory action against them should be welcomed.' The loss of Huione Pay’s license, which has not been previously reported, does not seem to have curtailed the company’s activities, however. As recently as Thursday the company’s official Telegram channel, linked to on its website, was offering loans to customers. A post on February 27th promoted the launch of a Huione-branded Visa card. Visa did not respond to requests for comment by press time. News of Huione Pay’s license being withdrawn was greeted as overdue by a former employee who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal. They told RFA it was openly acknowledged within the company that there were two sets of accounts maintained. 'They cook the books,' the former employee said. While the company handled billions of dollars, 'close to none' of those transactions were made available to the compliance department, which was relegated to the role of advisors, ' whose advice were never taken seriously,' the former employee said. One of Huione Pay’s three directors is Hun To, a cousin of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet. Official censure of a company so close to the inner circle of Cambodia’s ruling family is unusual. But Jacob Sims, an expert on transnational crime, told RFA that the withdrawal of Huione’s banking license should not be read as a herald of reform. 'It all ultimately amounts to a brand switch,' Sims said. 'It’s basically an easy thing for the regime to point to and say, ‘Look, we’re cracking down on this’ without doing really anything but consolidating Huione’s available brands.' For Sims, there’s one way the Cambodian government could show it was serious about cracking down on the crime wave Huione has been surfing: 'Arrest all the people involved in Huione.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufv6XzDSqmF9W	2025-03-06T16:53:45-08:00	
US Envoy To Travel To Saudi Arabia For Talks With Ukrainians	A top Trump administration official said Thursday he would travel to Saudi Arabia to meet with Ukrainian representatives for talks about a ceasefire to pause Russia’s invasion. 'We’re now in discussions to coordinate a meeting with the Ukrainians in Riyadh, or even potentially Jeddah,' said Steve Witkoff, who serves as U.S. President Donald Trump’s special Middle East envoy. He added: 'The idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well.' He said Trump felt Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made amends after the two leaders’ confrontation in the White House last Friday. 'He felt that Zelenskyy’s letter was a very positive first step. There was an apology. There was an acknowledgement that the United States has done so much for the country of Ukraine, and a sense of gratitude,' Witkoff said. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, was in Brussels with European leaders for emergency talks. 'We will arm ourselves faster, smarter and more efficiently than Russia,' said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who holds the European Union's rotating presidency. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen advanced a plan to loosen budget rules so countries that are willing can spend much more on defense, alongside commitments to encourage the 27 member countries to invest a total of about $863 billion in defense over the next four years. 'We are very thankful that we are not alone and these are not just words,' Zelenskyy said. 'We feel it. It’s very important.' French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of talks that EU members would 'take decisive steps forward,' while he expressed concerns about shifts in U.S. support for Ukraine under Trump. 'The future of Europe does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow,' Macron said. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said Thursday that France is sharing intelligence with Ukraine, a move that followed the United States saying it was cutting off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that the United States had, for the moment, ended sharing its intelligence with Kyiv, although the move could be short-lived after Zelenskyy said the exchanges with Trump in the Oval Office last week had been 'regrettable' and that Ukraine was ready for peace talks with Russia. Trump earlier in the week ordered the U.S. to suspend military aid to Kyiv’s fighters. Since the start of the war in 2022, the United States has provided Ukraine with significant intelligence, including critical information its military needs for targeting Russian forces. Reaching a peace deal could prove difficult. Ukraine has long demanded a restoration of its internationally recognized 2014 borders before Moscow unilaterally seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Overall, Russia now holds about a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including much of eastern Ukraine, and has vowed to not return any of it to the Kyiv government.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufl4NbGCTJmfg	2025-03-06T16:50:46-08:00	
Trump Bullish But America Divided – OpEd	By Dr. Amal Mudallali President Donald Trump declared on Tuesday that 'America is back' at the start of his first speech to a joint session of Congress in his second term. He proclaimed: 'America’s momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back,' before adding that the American dream is 'unstoppable.' But a look at the headlines of the last few days shows a different America and a different world than the one the president boasted about. The country is split down the middle about his policies and that was visually obvious during the speech to Congress. The Department of Government Efficiency and its leader Elon Musk are under attack by Democrats and government employees who have lost their jobs. The opposition, Congress and the courts are battling the president in what some have dubbed a constitutional crisis over the president’s authority. The relationship between the US and its neighbors is tense due to the president’s tariffs against Canada and Mexico, while China is threatening a trade war. There are fears over the long-term damage being to America’s relations with its neighbors and to global trade. The relationship with America’s allies in Europe, America’s closest allies and NATO partners, is rife with tension over the war in Ukraine, how best to end it and how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In his speech, the president presented a different picture on all these issues and events on the ground show that his strategy is winning so far. The president invited Musk to his congressional speech and praised him for the accomplishments of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been tasked with overhauling the federal government. Musk and his team have been making drastic cuts to federal agencies, leading to job cuts, the elimination of agencies like the US Agency for International Development and funding freezes, fueling protests and an outcry by Democrats. Several of the federal employees who have lost their jobs were in the gallery as guests of the Democrats. The president said Musk is 'working very hard. He didn’t need this' and was not apologetic about the work of the department. While the president boasted about his success in securing the border, his tariff battle with America’s neighbors is capturing the headlines. The tariffs have caused a crisis in America’s relationship with Canada and Mexico and are threatening to upend global trade, while affecting the livelihoods of everyday Americans. Experts are warning that the tariffs could lead to greater inflation and affect the president’s domestic and economic agendas, while causing recessions in Canada and Mexico. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the crisis with the two neighbors may be resolved this week and Trump will 'probably' announce a deal that will reduce the tariffs, following lengthy phone calls between their representatives and the commerce secretary. The dispute between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his European allies also seems on its way to being resolved. The president softened his tone after he received an 'important letter' and expression of regret by Zelensky over the Oval Office argument with the American president and Vice President J.D. Vance. The letter expressed Ukraine’s willingness to come 'to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer,' President Trump said as he read from it. Trump also quoted the Ukrainian president assuring him that he was ready to sign the 'agreement on minerals and security.' The US president did not back down from his intention to 'reclaim' the Panama Canal or shy away from a new expansionist foreign policy. As proof that Trump’s strategy seems to be working, it emerged that a consortium of companies including American investment firm BlackRock was set to buy shares from the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings that would give it control of the ports at either end of the canal. This would give Trump, who raised the alarm about potential Chinese interference with shipping operations in the strategic canal, a victory. Greenland is also still in the sights of the American president. After telling Greenland, 'we strongly support your right to determine your own future,' he said: 'One way or the other, we’re going to get it,' citing its vitality to American and international security. But the response from Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede was categoric. 'We are not for sale and cannot be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,' he wrote after the speech. Trump did not say much about the Middle East, except to speak of the Abraham Accords that were agreed in his first term, which he described as 'one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations.' He said a 'lot of things are happening in the Middle East … a rough neighborhood, actually.' But his administration seems to have already rejected the plan for rebuilding Gaza that was approved by the Arab summit in Cairo this week. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told The Times of Israel that Trump 'stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas.' He added that the Arab plan 'does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.' But he kept the door open for more talks 'to bring peace and prosperity to the region.' Does Trump’s agenda have the backing of the American people, whether domestically or on foreign policy? He spoke to a divided country. The Congress chamber looked like a split screen, with Republicans standing up and cheering and Democrats sitting down and protesting with signs like 'it’s a lie,' 'resist' and 'Musk steals.' But the Democrats seemed more like students protesting in the streets than a political party that has a strategy or a roadmap on how to oppose Trump’s agenda. The president said more Americans now believe that the country is going in the right direction. At least one poll supported this statement, with 47 percent of Americans believing this, up 10 points from December, as Newsweek reported. The Democrats are not seen as a credible opposition with a strategy, while the president is on a winning streak and he is 'just getting started,' as he said in his speech.

Pakistan’s Eroding Strategic Flexibility: The Heavy Price Of Its ...	Pakistan stands at a decisive juncture in its history. Once recognised as a regional power with immense potential, the nation now grapples with a troubling decline in strategic flexibility. This is largely attributed to short-sighted policies that have prioritised military strength over other national priorities. The consequences of these decisions are increasingly apparent, jeopardising Pakistan's political cohesion and economic development. A unified, resilient political landscape is essential for enhancing Pakistan's strategic flexibility. However, the military's outsized influence over civilian governance has fragmented the political system, hindering the establishment of robust democratic institutions. Political parties struggle to formulate stable, long-term strategies amidst this environment. In recent years, Pakistan has faced numerous political crises, many escalating into violent confrontations, widespread protests, and growing distrust between the state and its citizens. While some political tension is inevitable in any democracy, Pakistan's habitual reliance on coercive measures to resolve disputes has perpetuated a damaging cycle. Historically, the state has employed force - through military interventions, police actions, and other coercive means - to manage political crises. Such actions frequently exacerbate the very issues they aim to resolve, leading to heightened polarisation, public unrest, and enduring instability. Although force may provide temporary suppression of dissent or a veneer of order, it fails to address the root causes of political conflict and often widens the divide between the government and the people. Pakistan finds itself trapped in a damaging cycle, political repression stifles progress and fuels instability, undermining economic recovery. The military's overwhelming influence over civilian leadership has created an environment that frequently suppresses dissent, restricting the free exchange of ideas and stifling democratic growth. This political repression, ostensibly aimed at preserving control, has ultimately resulted in greater harm by cultivating instability that obstructs Pakistan's development across multiple fronts. This predicament generates a paradox - while Pakistan projects military strength globally, its internal cohesion remains fragile. Ongoing military interference has prevented civilian leaders from adequately addressing critical internal challenges like poverty, corruption, and unemployment, all of which are essential for national stability. Consequently, these unresolved issues undermine Pakistan's ability to formulate flexible, pragmatic policies that can adapt to evolving global dynamics. The consequences of political repression extend far beyond the economic sphere, profoundly impacting the daily lives of average Pakistanis in ways often overlooked by those in power. Economic hardships like rising unemployment and inflation disproportionately burden the poor and marginalised, who must endure a political system that fails to prioritise their welfare. The lack of political cohesion and accountability contributes to the neglect or underfunding of vital public services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. This perpetuates a cycle of inequality where the struggling become increasingly disenfranchised, depriving future generations of opportunities for upward mobility. The prospects of the Pakistani populace are, in many ways, compromised by a ruling elite that prioritises control over genuine progress. To break free from Pakistan's detrimental political cycle, the country must undertake comprehensive reforms that prioritise democratic values, political inclusivity, and expanded freedoms. The political landscape requires decentralisation, allowing for the inclusion of a wider array of voices and ideologies. Such an approach would not only enhance political cohesion but also promote national unity. This transformative process should begin by empowering civilian institutions and ensuring the military's role remains strictly within constitutional boundaries, enabling elected leaders to guide the nation's future. Political reform would further contribute to increased transparency and accountability - critical components for restoring public trust in the system. Without a strong political framework that holds leaders accountable, Pakistan's future trajectory will remain uncertain. For citizens to actively engage in the political system's development, they must have faith in its integrity. The time has come for Pakistan to move away from relying on coercive measures as the primary response to challenges. By cultivating a culture of dialogue and negotiation, the country can lay the groundwork for a more inclusive, peaceful, and stable future. This does not imply abandoning the state's obligation to maintain law and order, but rather a reconsideration of conflict resolution strategies, favoring peaceful solutions over violent or coercive actions. Both the state and citizens have essential roles to play in supporting this new social contract emphasising dialogue and peaceful conflict resolution. Pakistan possesses the capability to reclaim its strategic flexibility and influence, but it must first recognise that genuine security and sustainable growth stem from comprehensive solutions, not solely military strength. By reevaluating its policies and developing a more integrated national strategy, Pakistan can forge a path toward a future characterised by resilience, cooperation, and innovation in addressing both internal and external challenges. The urgency for action is paramount. This article was published at The Friday Times	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_Jufp8pADN3HjuL	2025-03-06T16:40:37-08:00	
UN Experts Condemn Israeli Move To Reopen ‘Gates Of Hell’ And Uni...	By Ephrem Kossaify More than 20 UN independent human rights experts have denounced the decision by the Israeli government to block all humanitarian aid to Gaza and resume a total siege of the territory. They warned that this breaks the terms of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas, breaks international law and puts the prospects for peace in jeopardy. In a joint statement on Thursday, the experts condemned Israel’s decision on Sunday to suspend deliveries of all goods to Gaza, including critical, life-saving aid. It follows an announcement by the Israeli war Cabinet that it was prepared to withdraw from the ceasefire agreement, with some ministers openly calling for reopening the 'gates of hell' in the war-battered enclave. 'This action constitutes a gross violation of international law,' the experts said. 'As an occupying power, Israel is legally obligated to ensure the provision of sufficient food, medical supplies, and other forms of aid. 'By blocking such essential services, including those vital to sexual and reproductive health and disability support, Israel is weaponizing humanitarian assistance.' Such actions represent 'serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law,' they added, and might amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute. The independent experts who put their names to the statement included Francesca Albanese, the special rapporteur on human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and Michael Fakhri, the special rapporteur on the right to food. Special rapporteurs are part of what is known as the special procedures of the UN Human Rights Council. They are independent experts who work on a voluntary basis, are not members of UN staff and are not paid for their work. They also criticized Israel’s general approach to the ceasefire agreement, which initially was hailed as a pathway to peace. Instead of fostering a cessation of hostilities, however, the agreement has been marked by continued violence and destruction. At least 100 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since it took effect on Jan. 19. The total death toll in the territory since the war began in October 2023 now stands at 48,400, as Israeli forces persist with airstrikes and ground assaults. 'The harsh conditions of the ceasefire, marked by limited aid and scarce resources, have only exacerbated the suffering of Gaza’s population,' the experts wrote. 'The decision to reimpose a total siege on Gaza — where 80 percent of farmland and civilian infrastructure has already been destroyed — will undoubtedly worsen the humanitarian crisis.' While some states and regional organizations have attempted to justify Israel’s actions as a response to alleged ceasefire violations by Hamas, the experts noted that repeated violations of the agreement by Israel have largely gone unreported. They called for the mediators of the ceasefire deal, Egypt, Qatar and the US, to intervene to help preserve the agreement in accordance with international obligations. They also stressed that Israel’s actions should be viewed within the context of the ongoing illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, a situation the International Court of Justice has demanded came an end. The experts concluded by issuing a strong call for global action: 'Nations must recall their obligations under international law and act to halt this brutal assault on the Palestinian people. The international community cannot allow lawlessness and injustice to prevail.' As the world watches the devastating effects of the latest Israeli decision, the experts warned that fragile hopes for peace in the region continue to fade, and the humanitarian disaster in Gaza is far from over. The initial phase of the ceasefire expired on Sunday without Israel and Hamas reaching an agreement on an extension or a way forward for the deal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufpPXNBU0l5ht	2025-03-06T16:33:16-08:00	
The Fractured Shield: Can Europe Secure Itself If America Walks A...	The battlefields of Ukraine are not just testing Kyiv’s resilience; they are exposing the fragility of the Western security order. For decades, Europe has outsourced its defense to American power, relying on Washington’s nuclear umbrella, intelligence networks, and military supremacy. But what happens when that umbrella folds? A Future Without Washington’s Security Guarantee In Washington, where political tides shift with electoral cycles, murmurs of disengagement are growing louder. A second Trump presidency could usher in an era of isolationism that European leaders have long feared. Proposals to withdraw from the United Nations, freeze military aid to Ukraine, or even exit NATO are no longer speculative—each has been openly debated in America’s political mainstream. The implications are stark. If the United States retracts its security commitments, can Europe hold the line against an emboldened Russia? Can NATO survive as a European-led entity? And most urgently, should Ukraine brace for a Western-brokered 'peace' that cements Russian territorial gains while locking Kyiv into economic dependence on its allies? The Numbers Don’t Lie: Can Europe Defend Ukraine Alone? The cold calculus of war tells a sobering story. The United States has delivered over '$75 billion' in military assistance to Ukraine since 2022—more than double what all European nations combined have provided. The Pentagon alone has supplied 'over 2,000 armoured vehicles, 300,000 rounds of artillery, and advanced missile systems' that have kept Ukrainian defences operational. By contrast, Europe, despite its vocal solidarity, has struggled to match America’s firepower. The European Union’s much-vaunted '€50 billion aid package' pales in comparison to Washington’s largesse. Germany’s pledge to boost its military spending to '2% of GDP' remains unfulfilled, and even France—long an advocate for European 'strategic autonomy'—lacks the industrial capacity to replace American weapons in the short term. The UK, despite being one of Ukraine’s staunchest backers, faces significant constraints in its defense production capabilities. The question is not whether Europe wants to support Ukraine—it is whether it 'can'. And right now, the numbers suggest it 'cannot'. The Fragile Chessboard: A War or a Truce on America’s Terms? The military aid dilemma is just one part of a broader geopolitical shift. Behind closed doors, the Biden administration is already exploring the contours of a potential peace deal—one that may not align with Ukraine’s ambitions. At the heart of the negotiations is an unspoken trade-off: Ukraine’s war effort is bleeding Western arms stockpiles dry, but Kyiv also possesses a wealth of 'rare earth minerals' critical to American and European industries. Ukraine holds some of the largest untapped reserves of 'lithium, titanium, and nickel'—all essential for military hardware and clean energy technology. A potential deal would see Kyiv securing long-term American economic support in exchange for prioritizing U.S. and European access to these critical resources. But at what cost? A settlement could pressure Ukraine into territorial concessions, effectively rewarding Russia’s aggression while transforming Ukraine into a resource colony for the West. If Ukraine refuses, the alternative is equally stark: fighting a war without the assurance of continuous Western aid. Can NATO Survive an American Exit? The biggest strategic question looming over Europe is whether NATO can endure without U.S. leadership. Washington currently accounts for nearly '70% of NATO’s defense spending', and its military bases in Germany, Poland, and the Baltics serve as deterrents against Russian expansionism. If an American withdrawal from NATO materializes, European nations will need to rapidly build a credible defense infrastructure—a task that will require at least '€500 billion in immediate military investments' just to replace U.S. capabilities. European unity, however, is fragile. 'Macron’s vision of an independent European defense force' clashes with Poland’s insistence on a 'U.S.-centric security structure'. The cracks within the EU’s security apparatus could widen under the pressure of war. Meanwhile, the UK's post-Brexit security strategy remains in flux. While London has remained a reliable partner to Kyiv, its long-term commitment to European defense in the absence of American leadership remains uncertain. Can the UK, alongside France and Germany, lead a reconfigured NATO without Washington’s firepower? For Ukraine, this means one thing: 'Time is running out'. The New World Order: A Future Without Washington’s Hegemony If America disengages, the ramifications extend far beyond Europe. A retreat from Ukraine would embolden China to accelerate its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific, raising the likelihood of a 'Taiwan confrontation'. Meanwhile, Moscow, sensing Western vulnerability, could set its sights on 'Moldova or the Baltics'—testing NATO’s willingness to defend its smallest members. A weakened NATO could also shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where 'Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia' are vying for regional dominance. Without American leadership, Europe would struggle to navigate the diplomatic fallout from a reconfigured global order in which 'Beijing and Moscow dictate the terms of engagement'. In an increasingly multipolar world, European leaders must ask themselves: Is it time to break free from America’s security apparatus and chart an 'independent defense strategy'? Or will the West’s failure to secure Ukraine mark the 'unravelling of the post-World War II order'? The Economic Fallout: What a Disengaged America Means for Markets Beyond security concerns, the economic ramifications of a U.S. pullback from global leadership would be profound. A fractured transatlantic alliance would 'undermine investor confidence', drive 'capital flight from European markets', and create supply chain disruptions—particularly in the energy and defense sectors. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England would need to 'reassess financial stability measures' in anticipation of geopolitical turbulence. Meanwhile, China and Russia could use the opportunity to expand their influence over 'emerging markets, energy networks, and digital infrastructure', further challenging Western economic supremacy. A U.S. retreat from NATO would also raise questions about the future of the 'petrodollar system', as Gulf states reconsider their reliance on American security guarantees. If Saudi Arabia and the UAE shift towards a 'multipolar trade strategy', it could significantly impact global commodity markets, driving 'higher inflation and currency volatility'. The Defining Crossroads The war in Ukraine has transcended the realm of a single nation's struggle for sovereignty; it has become a litmus test for the resilience of the transatlantic alliance—an order painstakingly constructed from the wreckage of the last great conflict. The fractures of the present war now threaten to unmake the very foundations of Western security. Should Washington waver in its commitments, Europe must brace for the fallout. The question is not merely one of willingness, but of capability. Is the continent prepared to shoulder the burden of its own defense in the face of an emboldened Russia? The answer remains deeply uncertain. A fundamental truth looms large: Europe’s security is inextricably tied to Ukraine’s fate. And Ukraine’s survival hinges on America’s resolve. The decision, however, is not Europe’s to make. It rests in Washington’s hands. **And the world waits, watching.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JufmJsIeHWW_qR	2025-03-06T16:30:12-08:00	
Supreme Court Case For First Catholic Charter School Begins Oral ...	By Kate Quiñones A Catholic charter school is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to approve the nation’s first publicly funded religious charter school in a case that could reshape school choice and religious freedom in the U.S. In an opening brief filed on Wednesday, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School — a Catholic charter school managed by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa and Eastern Oklahoma — maintained that it is religious discrimination for the state to withhold generally available funding solely because the school is religious. The Oklahoma Supreme Court previously ordered Oklahoma’s charter school board to rescind the contract with St. Isidore in June, citing the First Amendment’s prohibition of laws that would establish a state religion. Shortly after, both St. Isidore and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board filed separate petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court in October 2024. In the opening briefs, St. Isidore and the school board maintained that if the state is going to offer general funding for private charter organizations, it cannot deny that funding to a charter school on the basis of religion. 'The First Amendment protects St. Isidore from discriminatory state laws that would bar it from participating in that program or receiving funding solely because the school it has designed is religious,' read the brief filed by the Notre Dame Law School’s Lindsay and Matt Moroun Religious Liberty Clinic, a teaching law practice that trains Notre Dame law students. The attorneys pointed out that Oklahoma designed the program 'to foster educational diversity through privately designed and operated charter schools … but Oklahoma denies that opportunity to religious entities solely because they are religious.' In a similar vein, the charter school board argued on Wednesday that the Oklahoma Supreme Court decision was a 'distortion of the First Amendment' that 'would have devastating effects on religious organizations,' according to the opening brief filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit that defends First Amendment rights. 'Faith-based groups often provide vital public services in which they partner with the government or are subject to government regulation,' the brief read. 'Yet under the decision below, many of these organizations would be deemed state actors disqualified from providing broad-ranging social services — including foster care, adoption services, medical care, homeless shelters, and other aid to disadvantaged communities.' Isidore was initially approved to be a charter school by the state board in 2023, but Oklahoma’s Republican Attorney General Gentner Drummond filed a lawsuit against the board, arguing the establishment violated the state’s religious liberty protections. Drummond opposed the charter school’s petitions to the Supreme Court last year, maintaining that having a Catholic charter school is a 'clear-cut First Amendment violation,' according to a Dec. 9 press release. Nicole Stelle Garnett, John P. Murphy Foundation professor of law at Notre Dame, said St. Isidore is asking the Supreme Court to uphold its 'basic right against religious discrimination.' 'States routinely partner with faith-based organizations to serve the public — whether by providing education, shelter, food, health care, you name it,' Garnett said. 'The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the government may not offer support to private groups like these and then deny that opportunity to organizations based on their religion.' Oklahoma ranked 49th in education in the U.S. in 2024, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, with 84% of its eighth graders testing 'not proficient' in math and 76% of its fourth graders 'not proficient' in reading. Michael Scaperlanda, chancellor of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and chairman of St. Isidore's Board, noted that the archdiocese wanted to improve educational access for Oklahomans. 'Too many children in Oklahoma — particularly in remote and rural communities — don’t have robust learning opportunities or access to schools that may serve their children’s individual needs,' Scaperlanda said in a March 6 statement. 'We want to help fill that gap by offering an excellent, Catholic education to all interested families across the state, regardless of their zip code, their income, or any other circumstance.' 'All children deserve to thrive in an environment that fits them, and we hope to help make that a reality,' Scaperlanda added. There are more than 30 privately operated charter schools in Oklahoma. John Meiser, director of Notre Dame Law School’s Religious Liberty Clinic, lauded Oklahoma’s endeavor to 'foster educational pluralism' and 'create a diversity of learning options for all children' but noted that this must be open to all. 'That is a great endeavor. But bedrock constitutional law is clear: Oklahoma cannot invite any and all educators to participate in it except those who happen to be religious,' Meiser said. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on April 30, with a decision expected this summer.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdOsJvge_JuftsYplBO5J-7	2025-03-06T16:23:47-08:00	
Thaksin’s Apology For Southern Thai Massacre Could Boost Peace Ta...	By Mariyam Ahmad and Nontarat Phaicharoen Former Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra’s recent apology about a 2004 massacre that took place under his watch and his new role as adviser to ASEAN chair Malaysia could potentially influence peace talks in Thailand’s southern border provinces, security analysts said. Peace negotiations between Bangkok and Malay Muslim separatist rebels have shown no signs of resuming in the more than six months since Thaksin’s daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, became Thailand’s prime minister. Meanwhile, the post of chief Thai peace negotiator has been left vacant for months, amid sporadic insurgency-related violence in the Thai Deep South. Thaksin, who returned to Thailand in August 2023 after years of self-imposed exile and later received a royal pardon, visited the southern border region on Feb. 23 as the new adviser to Anwar Ibrahim, the prime minister of neighboring Malaysia, the 2025 chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. During his visit Thaksin apologized for incidents that occurred under his administration. He was responding to a question about the Tak Bai massacre, one of the most infamous incidents in the long-running insurgency. The former prime minister said he had good intentions and cared for everyone before a military coup forced him from office in 2006. 'But mistakes can happen in governance. If I made any mistakes that were unsatisfactory, I apologize so that we can turn back and solve problems together. I don’t want small misunderstandings to remain,' he said, without specifically mentioning the massacre. The incident occurred on Oct. 25, 2004, when security forces violently dispersed protesters from in front of the police station in Tak Bai, a district of Narathiwat province. Eighty-five people were killed. Most of the victims gagged to death in the backs of military trucks, where they were bound and stacked up like logs. The 20-year statute of limitations passed last year without any charges being filed. Phumtham Wechayachai, Thailand’s deputy prime minister and defense minister, praised Thaksin’s visit, calling it a sign that progress should be visible this year. 'I think we will have a better direction and next year we will find a way to end this. As the person responsible for the southern region, we should be able to find a solution,' Phumtham told reporters on Feb. 27. 'I confirm that the dialogue process still exists, but I cannot specify the plans in the immediate future. I would like this Ramadan month to prove that there must be no incidents and violence must stop,' said Phumtham, who serves as deputy prime minister under Prime Minister Paetongtarn. Since MPs elected Paetongtarn as PM to succeed Srettha Thavisin in August 2024, little has been done to foster peace in the border region – which she visited in January – while no formal talks have been held, analysts and activists noted. Among those is Pornpen Khongkachonkiet, director of the Cross Cultural Foundation. 'Even though it’s a democratic government, in practice it doesn’t play a role in controlling security agencies. Doing nothing is like neglecting duty, such as not appointing a head of the peace dialogue panel,' she told BenarNews. 'Meanwhile, the violence has increased significantly. Since the statute of limitations expired for the Tak Bai case, expectations have risen, but when they do nothing, it’s like neglecting an important duty.' Another analyst said Thaksin’s apology was needed. 'Thaksin has previously made statements like this, but this time it could be considered the clearest and most official,' Panitan Wattanayagorn, a security analyst and former chairman of the government’s security advisory committee, told BenarNews. 'Apologizing is better than saying nothing at all, because significant events related to the southern border situation occurred while he was prime minister. Not saying anything might be more damaging,' he said. The year 2004 was the one during which the insurgency reignited. The Deep South, made up of provinces and districts that lie along Thailand’s border with Malaysia, is where members of the predominantly ethnic Malay Muslim population have long pressed for greater autonomy. The Deep South Watch monitoring center reported over 22,000 violent incidents occurred between 2004 and 2024, resulting in over 7,500 deaths and 14,000 injuries. Between 2005 and 2024, the Thai government has spent about 500 billion baht (U.S. $14.7 billion) addressing southern border problems. Peace talks began in 2013 but have frequently stalled because of government changes. Important vacancy unfilled Going forward, the Paetongtarn administration needs to improve the National Security Council (NSC) role in peace talks, Panitan said. Chatchai Bangchuad, had served as lead negotiator in Deep South peace talks with Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) rebel leaders but his promotion to NSC security council chief last October means the lead negotiator position is open. 'The government must urgently enhance the NSC’s capabilities, as they have been inadequate so far. They might begin by adding both domestic and international advisers to formulate a winning strategy,' he said. 'The dialogue can be postponed, but it’s necessary to exchange new information, control the situation in the area and successfully bring people to the table.' Meanwhile, some analysts and human rights advocates said Thaksin’s apology lacked sufficient weight given the severity of past incidents. 'It seemed like he was saying that officers might make mistakes. He may have wanted to be cautious about being blamed for past problems, but he apologized only for minor frictions,' Srisompob Jitpiromsri, director of Deep South Watch, told BenarNews. 'In reality, the feelings of people in the area regarding the Krue Se and Tak Bai incidents, where many people died with high levels of violence, at minimum Thaksin should take responsibility for this part and express it with stronger words,' he said. Analysts said Anwar’s appointment of Thaksin could potentially assist Malaysia’s involvement in addressing the southern conflict, particularly given Kuala Lumpur’s role as facilitator of peace talks between the Thai government and BRN. 'The appointment of Thaksin as adviser to the ASEAN chair might help bring Brunei and Indonesia into participating in the peace process,' Panitan, the analyst, said. 'However, cooperation between the government and opposition on this issue should also exist.' In addition, Srisompob said, Thaksin could have some power. 'After this, Thaksin might use his special relationship with Anwar to solve problems through back channels, addressing issues that can’t be resolved through open processes.' Anwar, meanwhile, told Malaysian PMs last week that Thaksin’s appointment could buoy efforts to resolve the conflict in Thailand’s southern border region. 'It helps even though there were some controversies being raised. He recently went to southern Thailand to apologize for the Tak Bai incident and gave assurance that he will cooperate with Malaysia to find peace,' Anwar said. Jon Preechawong in Bangkok and Farhana Farush in Kuala Lumpur contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeI5vp5sYp-nrdgM6TlnK19	2025-03-04T17:08:19-08:00	
Rising Arctic Temperatures Threaten Russian Cities And Military F...	Temperatures in the Russian North are rising three times as fast as in other parts of the country, a development with enormous but as of yet not fully appreciated geoeconomic and geopolitical consequences. These changes are increasing the ability of other countries to transit the Northern Sea Route (NSR) without relying on Russian icebreakers. Critically, rising temperatures are thawing the permafrost underlying the whole region, in turn undermining and destroying the integrity of local infrastructure, including pipelines and airfields. Rising temperatures are also further isolating population centers and military bases, making it far more difficult for Moscow to exploit natural resources and sustain Russian dominance of the NSR and the country’s claims in the Arctic (see EDM, November 15, 2022, February 22, 2023; The Barents Observer, May 18, 2022; To Be Precise, September 22, 2023; TASS; RIA Novosti, September 11, 2024; The Moscow Times, September 12, 2024). While Moscow celebrates what it has achieved—and often even what it has not—the situation in the North is a quickly escalating problem for the Russian government (Window on Eurasia, January 10). Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has forced Moscow to cut back and even cancel plans to build railways and highways in the Russian North (see EDM, February 22, 2023). At present, the region severely lacks sufficient road and rail infrastructure. Communities living in the North have instead traditionally relied on 'ice roads,' which are formed when rivers freeze, for delivery of supplies and to transport ores of various kinds. Ice roads, however, can no longer be relied on because the surface of many waterways is not remaining frozen long enough or becoming thick enough to carry heavy trucks (see EDM, March 12, 2024; Nakanune, January 28, February 20; The Barents Observer, February 25). This issue is exacerbated by what some scholars are now calling the 'Atlantification' of the Arctic. This refers to the influx of warm water from the Atlantic Ocean into the Arctic Ocean, which is itself caused by the increasing amount of sea ice melting in the Arctic from Scandinavia to the Bering Strait (Igor V. Polyakov et al., 'Atlantification advances into the Amerasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean,' Science Advances. Vol 11, No. 8 (2025); The Barents Observer, February 25). This trend affects not only the ocean and global weather patterns but also the life of population centers and military bases in northern Russia’s littoral regions. In a growing number of places in the region, the only reliable means of transport is by air. This, however, is a serious limiting factor given the carrying capacity of planes, closing of airports in the region, and inadequate roads and rail lines connecting to them. As Sergey Sulyma, a Russia historian who specializes in transportation issues, points out, Russian officials like to brag that jet planes have reduced the time it takes to get from Moscow to Chukotka, located in the extreme northeast of the Russian Federation, to only eight hours (REX Information Agency, February 10). This claim omits the fact that it takes days or even weeks for passengers and cargo to travel to and from the airport in Chukotka because of the absence of year-round roads (REX Information Agency, February 10). These delays mean that the region is not reliably supplied with goods, which has unsurprisingly led to a slow but steady emigration out of Chukotka (see EDM, July 6, 2021; Nakanune, January 28, February 20). This trend, broadly mirrored across the Russian North, makes it almost impossible to maintain the development of natural resources, the maintenance of NSR-related search and rescue institutions or guidance facilities, or the support of military facilities Moscow needs to project power further into the Arctic. Insufficient highways and rail lines represent only one example of the failure of the Russian government to support regional infrastructure in the North. Another problem involves pipelines. The shifting ground with the melting of permafrost has caused pipelines to fail, spilling their contents and even leading to their abandonment on occasion, as continuous repairs are too expensive. This means oil and gas recovered in the Russian North often does not reach the central areas of Russia where they can be used or exported. In turn, population centers and military bases in the Russian North do not receive a steady supply of the petroleum products they need. Russian officials have long been worried by this fact and in 2017 prepared a 900-page report detailing just how dire the situation had become (Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment of the Russian Federation via Web Archive, 2018; The Barents Observer, October 2, 2018; Window on Eurasia, October 2, 2018). There is no reason to think that the situation has improved since then, and every reason to believe that it has gotten worse as the topic appears to have become politically sensitive in Moscow. The impact of global warming on the Arctic Ocean and Russian littoral is especially great with regard to Russian military facilities in the region. Putin has an expansive plan to develop the Arctic seabed and has made claims to portions of the Arctic that are contested by other Arctic states. These claims remain under consideration at the United Nations vis-a-vis its Law of the Sea-mandated process (Window on Eurasia, August 25, 2022, December 27, 2023). Putin’s efforts to develop Russia’s military bases in the North in accordance with his Arctic aspirations have been largely constrained. This is due to the high costs and difficulties of transporting supplies to such facilities, on top of the problems which Russia is experiencing in shipbuilding for its Arctic Fleet (Window on Eurasia, January 19, 2022). Moscow has, as a result, cut back and sought cheaper means of projecting power by building low-cost drone bases and potentially exploring options to purchase ships from elsewhere (see EDM, July 6, 2021, April 18, 2024; , October 15, 2023, October 26, 2024). As Russia’s Arctic territory continues to warm, the combination of its impact on the ocean and the littoral will only intensify. With less ice on the Arctic Ocean, more ships from other countries will likely make use of the NSR or regions adjoining it, creating a situation in which Moscow will feel even more threatened and prepare to be in a position to respond militarily (Window on Eurasia, August 6, 2024). With higher temperatures on land in the Russian Far North, however, Moscow will find it increasingly difficult to implement such a policy, given the unlikelihood of having either the necessary population or military bases in the region. Moscow will thus likely be inclined to adopt a more aggressive approach to any new international presence in the region, potentially by employing forces further from the Arctic itself (see EDM, May 30, 2024). Such a shift in Russian strategy and tactics will require corresponding shifts by others as the Arctic heats up—both literally and figuratively.

Pakistan’s Path Forward Requires More Than Economic Recovery – An...	By Saima Nawaz Pakistan’s 2024 witnessed economic uncertainties, political instability, social unrest and the resurgence of terrorism, marking a grim period. These challenges were not isolated incidents, but manifestations of a broader systemic failure that has persisted for decades. The inability to address these issues comprehensively has left the country in a state of crisis, demanding a transformational change in governance and planning. The February 2024 election was one of the most rigid and contested elections in Pakistan’s history, resulting in a fragile coalition government led by the Pakistan Muslim League with the support of the Pakistan People’s Party. The election deepened polarisation and raised questions about the legitimacy of key institutions such as the election commission, the judiciary and the central authority. 2024 saw a significant increase in terrorist activities along the border, especially with Afghanistan, exacerbating national security concerns. Pakistan’s abysmally low ranking in political stability deterred investment, hampered governance and undermined the long-term prospects of the nation. But the completion of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement and the signing of a new US$7 billion Extended Fund Facility for three years provided much-needed economic support. Additional support through rollovers of deposits from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates stabilised the external account. These developments were accompanied by significant macroeconomic improvements. The policy rate fell from 22 per cent to 12 per cent, inflation dropped from 29.7 per cent in December 2023 to 4.1 per cent by December 2024 and remittances surged by 32.8 per cent. This helped the current account post a provisional US$1.2 billion surplus for the second half of 2025. The stock market reflected renewed confidence, with unprecedented gains signalling optimism among investors. Despite macroeconomic stabilisation, GDP growth in July–September 2024 was 0.9 per cent, driven primarily by agriculture. The industrial sector — which holds the key to export-driven growth — continued to struggle with negative growth, a worrying sign for a country striving to build export surpluses. Pakistan will hardly manage 3 per cent GDP growth in 2025. Rising poverty and persistent unemployment further compounded the socioeconomic challenges. Pakistan’s tax base remained critically narrow and fiscal deficits are raising concerns about debt sustainability. Public debt-to-GDP ratios remained high, with increasing reliance on external borrowing to meet fiscal obligations. Despite efforts to improve investor confidence, actual foreign direct investment inflows in 2024 fell short of projections. The Federal Board of Revenue also failed to meet its tax collection targets despite imposing heavy taxes. Pakistan continues to lag in adopting modern technology-driven economic solutions. Internet access remained slow and inconsistent, hindering e-business and innovation, while public sector inefficiencies continued to plague governance. As 2025 begins, Pakistan faces a critical juncture. Pakistan launched the Uraan Pakistan five-year plan to redefine the country’s economic trajectory, but its success hinges on a fundamental shift in how challenges are addressed. The Vision 2025 and Vision 2047 initiatives had been presented with similar ambitions but lacked effective government assessment and follow-up. Uraan Pakistan is following the same pattern, not incorporating lessons from past failures, risking the repetition of unfulfilled promises rather than ensuring implementation. Pakistan needs a new direction — a systems-based framework that addresses the interconnectedness of its challenges and charts a path towards sustainable progress. A systems-based model views Pakistan’s challenges as interconnected elements of a larger ecosystem. Each stakeholder — the parliament, the establishment, the judiciary, the media, civil society, academia and the public — represents a critical node in this system. Any dysfunction in one node inevitably disrupts the entire system, as was evident in 2024. Parliament’s inability to legislate effectively created policy gridlock, while judicial overreach undermined executive authority. Media sensationalism fuelled social unrest and bureaucratic inefficiency stalled reforms. Economic transformation must be predicated upon systemic reform. Pakistan needs to transition from a fragmented and crisis-driven model to an integrated ecosystem that prioritises innovation, inclusivity and sustainability. Regulatory simplification is essential to make it easier for businesses to operate, while the tax base must be broadened to reduce fiscal deficits and directed towards digital infrastructure and human capital development. Industrial revitalisation is critical — targeted incentives and technological improvements can drive export-led growth and integrate Pakistan into global value chains. The Uraan plan must be recalibrated to reflect these priorities. Digital transformation should be at the forefront, with investments in high-speed internet and digital infrastructure that enable e-commerce and innovation. Education reforms are equally vital and research and development should be incentivised to foster innovation. Political stability is the linchpin of systemic reform. A national dialogue involving all political parties and civil society is essential to build consensus on critical reforms. Transparent electoral processes are needed, and governance must focus on long-term objectives that transcend party lines. Transparency and accountability must begin at the top, with the prime minister and cabinet leading by example. 2025 must not be another year of inertia. It must be the year Pakistan breaks free from the cycles of crisis that have defined its past. This is not an easy path, but it is the only path forward. The systemic approach is not just about solving problems — it is about creating a framework where problems are less likely to arise in the first place. It is about shifting from reactive governance to proactive, integrated planning. Pakistan has the potential to emerge stronger, but this requires bold decisions, unwavering commitment and a shared vision for the future.

Regional Dynamics: The Evolving Iran-Armenia Relationship Amid Ge...	Introduction In today's rapidly changing geopolitical landscape, Armenia and Iran are seeking to strengthen their connections regarding economic, political, and security matters. And despite the United States signing a Strategic Partnership Charter with Armenia in January to enhance cooperation in energy, defense, security, and diplomacy, Tehran asserts that U.S.-Armenia relations will not impact its relationship with Armenia. Iran is in a significantly different position today compared to just a few months ago. Following the collapse of the Assad regime last December and the uncertainty surrounding its proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon, Iran may need to realign its regional priorities. Historically Iran and Armenia have had a very healthy and cordial relationship. Iran and Armenia’s relationship can be seen as a mutually beneficial economic collaboration built around investments, trade agreements, and infrastructure projects. Iran today remains Armenia’s third largest trading partner, and an estimated 30% of Armenia’s international trade runs through Iran. During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War, Iran tried to broker a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, hoping to establish itself as a regional negotiator. Now with Iran’s future in the Middle East appearing more uncertain, it may begin to play a greater role with its neighbor to the north. One area where Iran might increase its focus is the Zangezur Corridor, a proposed transport route running through southern Armenia designed to connect Azerbaijan with its exclave, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Here, Armenia and Iran have found common ground in their opposition to Azerbaijan’s proposed corridor. At the same time, recent diplomatic meetings between Iran and Armenia, signalling each other’s willingness to work across a multitude of issues, coupled with Iran’s increased economic activity with the Eurasian region, indicate a potential pivot towards deeper cooperation that could reshape the region. A Brief History Armenia and Iran share a rich history spanning over 2,500 years. We can find the first mention of the word 'Armenia' from the Persian king Darius during the 4th century BC. Up until the early 19th century, Yerevan was part of the Qajari (Persian)Empire. In Yerevan, the Blue Mosque, the residence of the viceroy of the Shah is preserved to this day as a religious and cultural center. In the 1990s the Armenian government renovated the Blue Mosque for services for Armenia’s Iranian Muslim community. In Iran, there remains a strong Armenian diaspora of around 60-80,000 people, while the Armenian Apostolic Church operates its three dioceses in Atrpatrkan, Tehran, and Isfahan. Since the beginning of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1992, Iran and Armenia have strived to maintain a strong relationship. The two countries have shown a strong history of working together on issues surrounding energy, transport, environmental protection, inter-regional, scientist-education, and cultural spheres. February Meetings On Saturday, February 22, the head of Iran’s Trade Promotion Organization (TPO) Mohammad Ali Dehaqan Devi met with Armenian Deputy Economy Minister EdgarZakaryan and Armenia’s Ambassador Grigor Hovhannisyanin Tehran. They emphasized Iran and Armenia's strong relationship while highlighting the need to increase trade relationships between the two countries. Iranian officials stressed their country’s interest in strengthening trade relations with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEA). Zakaryan highlighted the significant potential for economic collaboration between the two neighboring countries, stressing the importance of this in achieving their trading objectives, saying 'Armenia is prepared to collaborate with Iran across various sectors to strengthen mutual trade relations,'. Just two days later on February 24 Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi and Armenian Foreign Minister Arat Mirzyoan were present in Geneva to attend a high-level meeting of the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Disarmament Conference. While in Geneva, they held a bilateral meeting to discuss relations between their two countries. Here they reaffirmed their desire to strengthen bilateral ties concerning trade and economic growth. Araghchi emphasized the need to protect state sovereignty in the South Caucus region and for continued cooperation and coordination in security and stability. Mirzoyan, on his side, emphasized Armenia's commitment to strengthening ties with Iran across various sectors, including economic, trade, cultural, and transportation areas. Araghchi reaffirmed Tehran’s readiness to support peace efforts between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 'We strive for peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan and are ready to support this process. EAEU On February 28 Mehr News Agency, a semi-official news agency of the government of Iran, reported that the Iranian parliament has approved the agreement to create a free trade zone between Iran and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). This comes just two months after Iran was granted observer status in the EAEU. Iranian Minister of Industry, Mines, and Trade, Mohammed Atabk said, 'The free trade agreement with Eurasia allows us to export 87% of our goods to the Eurasian Economic Union member states at zero tariffs and import goods from these countries at zero tariffs. The total population of the Eurasian Economic Union member states is 240 million people, so it is a huge market that can be used,'. The free trade agreement between the Eurasian Economic Union and Iran should take effect by April or early May. The EAEU is a regional, political, and economic union made up of the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Russian Federation. The EAEU provides for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor, while pursuing a unified policy across various sectors, including transport, industry, agriculture, energy, and foreign trade. Iran's exports to the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) rose by 22 percent, amounting to $1.631 billion, in the first ten months of the current Iranian calendar year (from March 20, 2024, to January 19, 2025). Economic analysts have suggested that the Iran-EAEU Free Trade Agreement could exceed $10 billion annually within a few years. In addition to trade, the agreement may promote joint ventures, knowledge sharing, and technology transfer in sectors like energy, transportation, and manufacturing. The Iran-EAEU Free Trade Agreement is a significant step forward, emphasizing regional economic cooperation in an increasingly interconnected global economy. As it nears implementation, the agreement is expected to reshape economic ties between Iran and the Eurasian region. Nagorno Karabakh and the Zangezur Corridor During the initial days of the Nagorno-Kabrabkah conflict, Iran had sought to create a peace plan between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In a televised address Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei spoke about Azerbaijani territorial recognition yet made clear that the rights and security of Armenians 'must be ensured'. Armenia and Azerbaijan eventually came to a settlement brokered via the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) Minsk Group. Armenia claims it did not explicitly reject Iran’s attempts at brokering peace but instead preferred going through the OSCE Minks Group. During the 2020 Karabakh War, Azerbaijani media accused Iran of supporting Armenia with arms and fuel. Recently, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has criticized Iran for fuel transfers to the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Azerbaijan’s suspicion of Iran was only further enforced when in July 2024, it was reported that Iran and Armenia had signed a secret arms deal worth $500 million, which includes drone and air defense missiles, among other various military equipment. Following Azerbaijan’s victory in the Karabakh War, a trilateral ceasefire agreement alongside Russia was signed that included provisions for the opening of transportation routes. This provision, article 9 stated, 'All economic and transport connections in the region shall be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia shall guarantee the security of transport connections between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to arrange unobstructed movement of persons, vehicles and cargo in both directions.' Azerbaijan strongly believes that Article 9 gives it the right to open the Zangezur Corridor. Armenia, however, is firmly against this belief, claiming that it does not view the Zangezur Corridor as a route or a corridor. Armenia’s opposition to the corridor is founded on its concerns over national security, sovereignty, and historical grievances. Yet, Armenia has found a partner in Iran in its opposition to the corridor. Motivated by worries that the initiative could diminish its status as a key regional transit center and weaken its strategic influence in the South Caucasus, Iran is strongly against the creation of the Zangezur Corridor. Iran’s Opposition to the Zangezur Corridor Friendly Relations with Armenia: Iran has historically maintained friendly relations with Armenia and supports Armenia’s sovereignty. Reduced Energy Demand: A pipeline built along the Zangezur pipeline would carry more oil and gas to southern Europe and reduce European demand for Iranian hydrocarbons. Challenges in Sanction Negotiations: A weakened Iran could complicate the country’s efforts to negotiate relief from international sanctions. Transit Role for Azerbaijani Citizens: Iran acts as a transit country for Azerbaijani citizens traveling to Nakhchivan, providing Tehran with leverage over Azerbaijan. Pan-Turkish Aspirations: Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has said the corridor could be used to unite the Turkish world, with an estimated 16% of Iran’s population being ethnically Azerbaijani, there are fears that the Zangezur Corridor could led to demands for greater autonomy or even create separatist movements within Iran. Post-Assad Era: As Iran’s supply lines to the Levant face increasing threats, the Zangezur Corridor could further isolate Iran and significantly diminish its influence in the South Caucasus. Opportunities for Further Cooperation USAID: In February, the Trump administration announced plans to cut 90% of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) 's foreign aid contracts, slashing global assistance by $60 billion. Armenia had received $110 million of the $250 million initially pledged to it by USAID for 2024 before the funding freezes were implemented. Critics of Trump's decision to dismantle USAID caution that this opens the door for Russia to expand its influence in Central and Eastern Europe, however, it also presents an opportunity for Iran to deepen its ties with Armenia. With a less active US presence in the region, Iran is hoping to capitalize on strengthening its relationship with Armenia and the Eurasia region. Continued Economic Cooperation: In 2023, bilateral trade grew by 43%, accompanied by the implementation of five major infrastructure projects, including the expansion of the North-South Highway, modernization of border crossings, and development of energy infrastructure. In 2024, a $15 million investment in Yerevan established a joint technology park, focusing on IT and biotechnology cooperation. That same year the Iranian Trade Center in Yerevan was launched, providing essential services such as financial transactions, logistics, legal advice, and customs support. This ongoing trade and investment between Iran and Armenia will ensure that both countries continue to gain from their partnership Persian Gulf-Black Sea Corridor: To countermeasure Turkiye and the Zangezur Corridor, India, Iran, and Armenia have proposed working together to create a Persian Gulf-Black Sea Transit Corridor (PBTC). Initially proposed by Iran in 2016, the PBTC aims to link Europe with India through Armenian territory and Iranian ports, effectively bypassing traditional routes like the Suez Canal. This initiative seeks to streamline cargo transit, enhance infrastructure, and simplify shipping procedures. The project also hopes to compete with Türkiye’s Development Road, which connects Europe and Türkiye via the Great Faw Port in Iraq, cutting 15 days of transit time by circumventing the Suez Canal. By establishing a connection between Armenia and India and China, the PBTC looks to offer an alternative to Türkiye’s Development Road and the Suez Canal, which would unlock new trade and investment opportunities for both Armenia and Iran. Conclusion Armenia and Iran are connected through a shared history, culture, and geography, making Armenia one of the few countries that truly aligns with Iran's economic and geopolitical interests. The partnership between Armenia and Iran reflects a strategic alignment shaped by shared geopolitical interests and historical ties. This partnership, driven by mutual strategic, economic, and security objectives, seeks to counter Türkiye and Azerbaijan's increasing influence in the region while enhancing trade and investment between them. With Iran’s ouster from Syria last December, and the uncertainty of its influence over the rest of the Middle East, Iran may begin to place a greater focus on Armenia and the Eurasian region. Recent diplomatic meetings have emphasized the importance of enhancing trade with the EAEU, as Iran seeks to increase its economic activity in the region and gain greater access to European markets. Iran is expecting the Iran-EAEU Free Trade Agreement to significantly boost trade and promote regional economic cooperation. By strengthening trade with the EAEU and boosting ties with Armenia, Iran could help offset some of its losses in the Middle East, while counterbalancing Türkiye’s rising influence over the region. Additionally, although the Persian Gulf-Black Sea Corridor is still just a proposal, its implementation could significantly benefit the economies and the global presence of both Iran and Armenia. In a constantly shifting geopolitical environment, Iran can find reassurance in its partnership with Armenia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeI5vp5sYp-nvw6FR-a0AHP	2025-03-04T17:04:26-08:00
