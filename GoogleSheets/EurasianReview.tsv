Putin’s Courts Playing Central Role In Keeping Russians Under His...	Repression in the Russian Federation under President Vladimir Putin is usually thought of as being enforced by the Federal Security Service (FSB) and other security agencies. Putin, however, has made the Russian court system a key part of his repressive apparatus. He has transformed what had been, at least occasionally, the last line of defense of Russians’ constitutional rights into Kremlin agencies whose primary function is to suppress those rights and keep Russians from protesting. Putin has succeeded to the point that he now feels free to gloat about it, praising the Russian judiciary on February 20 for preventing Russians from protesting (URA.news, February 20). He has done so in part by reinforcing Soviet-era practices and increasingly restricting rights through trial by jury and many kinds of appeals that Russian citizens gained after 1991. In part, the Kremlin leader has introduced new practices, including having defendants tried far from home, especially, but far from exclusively, in the case of non-ethnically Russian protesters. This ensures that there are fewer demonstrations in support of such defendants and that non-Russian protestors will face judges more inclined to convict them (Novaya Gazeta Europe, February 17). That Putin has had to continue to make efforts in this direction, however, demonstrates that some judges in the Russian judicial system are prepared to uphold the law and that their existence may give some hope for some improvement in the post-Putin era. In a speech on February 20, reviewing the actions of the Russian judiciary over the past year, Putin explicitly linked the actions of judges to peace and stability in his country. If Russians see that the courts are just, he argued, they will see their government as just and not listen to those who call on them to protest (URA.news, February 20). The Kremlin leader said that this is what is now happening. There is good reason to conclude, however, that Putin is overstating his case and that despite his efforts, Russians now view the courts less as dispensers of justice as the 1993 Russian Constitution promised but as agents of Russian state power who, just as was the case in Soviet times, can be counted on to find almost everyone the government charges with a crime guilty and impose draconian sentences. The courts are helping to instill fear, and it is that rather than anything else that keeps people off the streets. To achieve what he has so far, Putin has increasingly restored Soviet-era practices that Russia was moving away from in the 1990s. For example, he has restricted the ability of Russians to choose to have jury trials, quite obviously because Russian juries acquit as many as 25 percent of those charged, while Russian judges currently find far fewer than one percent of those on trial not guilty (Yesli byt’ tochnym, May 23, 2024; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, January 26). He has restricted appeals and has limited the ability of defense lawyers to offer extenuating evidence or seek appeals for their clients (IQ Media, April 18, 2016; Window on Eurasia, January 29). Putin has dramatically increased the number of trials held behind closed doors to a level not seen since Stalin’s time (Mediazona, April 27, 2023). He has moved more cases from the civil courts to military ones, thus increasing the likelihood of conviction and more draconian punishments (URA.news, February 20). He has failed to appoint enough judges—today, there are 20 percent fewer of them than authorized—and has thus encouraged trials to be handled in a rushed and rubber-stamp fashion that benefits prosecutors (Akcenty, February 1). Far more than his Soviet predecessors, Putin has increasingly had criminals tried not in their home areas or where the crimes were committed but far away to limit the ability of their supporters to come and demonstrate on their behalf. Protesters in Ingushetia and, more recently, in Bashkortostan are exhibit A for this practice (Fortanga, April 13, 2021). The greatest innovation of Putin’s courts has been to adopt a system often used in other countries—court and even judge 'shopping.' In the United States, for example, lawyers often seek to bring suits in jurisdictions or before specific judges they believe will be more likely to rule in their favor. Such selection, even by prosecutors, however, is generally impossible in criminal cases. In Putin’s Russia, in contrast, as a new study from Novaya Gazeta Europe that examined thousands of such cases finds, it is instead prosecutors who are identifying jurisdictions and even specific judges who can be counted on to take positions the Kremlin approves of that the state and sending those charged with political crimes to be judged there rather than anywhere else. That study found that there are now jurisdictions and even judges who are viewed as specialists in these crimes, given that they have heard so many cases and because they have a record of handing down sentences that the Kremlin approves of (Novaya Gazeta Europe, February 17). Despite the restoration of Soviet-era practices and the introduction of this new one, Putin has not achieved all he wants in the judiciary. There is a great variety of sentences Russian judges hand down in the cases of those charged with the same crime, including politically sensitive offenses (Yesli byt’ tochnym, October 27, 2023). For example, Russian jurists differ widely in rulings about vacating charges if the accused agrees to serve in Ukraine, and they vary in the fines they levy for those who engage in anti-war protests (Sever.Realii, March 15, 2023; Verska, March 1, 2024; see EDM, August 7, 2024). Almost certainly, given his celebration of what he has achieved via the courts so far, Putin can be counted on to try to ensure that Russian courts will play an ever more prominent role in that direction in the future. The enormous size of the Russian judiciary and the Russian Federation, however, likely means that he will not fully achieve his goal of complete subordination and homogenization of that branch of the Russian government. For him, that will be a disappointment or even a defeat, but for the future of justice in Russia after he passes from the scene, such diversity in judicial responses is a hopeful sign that that country will ultimately be able to recover from Putin’s repression.

Eyes In The Sky, Firepower On Demand: The Indian Army’s Growing D...	The Indian Army is undergoing a significant transformation in its approach to modern warfare, with an increasing emphasis on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). The evolving battlefield dynamics, as evidenced by recent conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine and Armenia-Azerbaijan wars, have demonstrated the crucial role of drones in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), precision strikes, and logistical operations. In response, the Indian Army is expanding its UAV fleet and integrating indigenous drone technology to enhance operational effectiveness and maintain a strategic edge. Enhancing Surveillance and Strike Capabilities With persistent security challenges along India’s borders with China and Pakistan, UAVs play a critical role in maintaining continuous surveillance and executing precision strikes when necessary. The Indian Army is actively acquiring long-range, high-endurance drones capable of operating beyond 1,000 km and flying at altitudes exceeding 30,000 feet. These UAVs are designed to provide real-time intelligence, minimize risks to soldiers, and enable rapid response to emerging threats. The need for such advanced drone technology has been highlighted by increasing cross-border infiltrations and evolving hybrid warfare tactics. Currently, the Indian Army operates a fleet of approximately 50 medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) drones, including the Heron Mark-I and Mark-II, along with Searcher-II drones, primarily used for surveillance and reconnaissance. In contrast, China has over 2,000 UAVs, including combat drones like the Cai Hong-4 (CH-4), CH-5, and Hongdu GJ-11 ‘Sharp Sword’. To bridge this capability gap, India is investing in advanced UAVs with greater operational endurance and strike capabilities. Indigenous Drone Development and Private Sector Involvement As part of India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, the Indian Army is prioritizing the development of domestically manufactured drones to reduce dependence on foreign technology. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed UAVs such as the Rustom series, but ongoing efforts are focused on enhancing their capabilities to meet operational requirements. The Archer-NG, an upcoming weaponized MALE drone, is expected to feature an operational altitude of 30,000 feet, a 1,000 km range, and the ability to carry 300 kg of payload, including anti-tank guided missiles and smart anti-airfield weapons. Additionally, the Indian private sector is playing an increasingly vital role in drone development. IG Drones, a domestic drone technology firm, secured a contract to supply Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) and First-Person View (FPV) drones to the Army. These indigenously manufactured drones, built without Chinese components, are designed for operations in high-altitude and urban environments, offering tactical reconnaissance and logistics support in challenging terrains. Him-Drone Trials and High-Altitude Warfare Recognizing the need for drones capable of operating in extreme conditions, the Indian Army conducted the Him-Drone trials in September 2024 at Wari-La, Ladakh, located at an altitude of 15,200 feet. This event, held in collaboration with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), tested various drone platforms for high-altitude operations. The five categories of drones evaluated included surveillance drones for real-time intelligence gathering, loitering munitions designed to strike enemy targets with precision, kamikaze drones programmed to self-destruct upon impact, logistics drones for transporting supplies across difficult terrains, and electronic warfare drones for disrupting enemy communication and radar systems. The success of these trials paves the way for the Army to procure high-altitude drones tailored to countering threats along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Security Challenges and Countermeasures The increased deployment of UAVs also brings cybersecurity and operational risks, particularly concerning drones with foreign components. Reports of drone hijacking incidents near the Pakistan border have prompted the Indian Army to enforce stricter certification requirements for drone manufacturers. A Technical Evaluation Committee has been established under the Northern Command and Army Design Bureau (ADB) to ensure that drones deployed for military use do not contain critical components of Chinese origin, safeguarding national security. Furthermore, the upcoming induction of MQ-9B Predator drones, under a ₹32,350 crore contract with the United States, marks a significant boost in India’s strategic drone capabilities. These long-endurance UAVs, armed with Hellfire missiles and precision-guided bombs, will enhance India’s ability to conduct surgical strikes and deep reconnaissance missions. Future of Drone Warfare in the Indian Army The Indian Army’s emphasis on UAVs and RPA systems signifies a broader shift towards network-centric warfare. The expansion of drone capabilities, along with the Make in India initiative, aims to establish India as a leading defense technology hub. With increasing investment in AI-driven drone operations, swarm drone technology, and autonomous strike capabilities, India is positioning itself to be at the forefront of modern warfare. As drone warfare continues to shape military strategies worldwide, India’s proactive approach to UAV modernization ensures that the Army remains prepared to counter emerging threats effectively. The integration of indigenous drone technology, combined with strategic collaborations, is set to revolutionize the battlefield, making unmanned aerial systems a core component of India’s defense strategy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr5e517TJbm2Z	2025-03-01T17:55:58-08:00	
China Tackles Trump’s Trade War And Global Headwinds – Analysis	China’s political calendar is again focusing on one of the most anticipated events of the year, the Two Sessions. To be held from March 5, these annual meetings of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) are a chance to see where the country is heading strategically. With Beijing encountering more and more difficult international relations, this year’s sessions will focus on both domestic and international issues, especially against the background of the protectionist trade policy and erratic diplomacy of U.S. President Donald Trump. What China does at the Two Sessions will not only define its own economic growth but also influence the world economy as a whole. The main event of the Two Sessions will be the Government Work Report delivered by Premier Li Qiang. This report will present the main objectives, economic goals, and policy objectives for the next year. Since 2025 marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan in China, much attention will be paid to how effective Beijing has been in achieving its objectives in the previous plan and what adjustments it will make in drawing up its next development plan. The discussions and reports that will be made available during the sessions will help to reveal the general vision of the leadership towards the 15th Five-Year Plan, which will define the future of the country’s economy and technology for several years. China’s economic performance remains central to these deliberations. The country is still expected to account for 21 percent of global growth in the next five years. As the world’s biggest trading partner and an innovative power, its policies are significant for the whole world. But the new economic confrontationalism from Washington—the restriction on Chinese technology firms, the increase of tariffs on electric vehicles, and the pressure on allies to reduce economic links with Beijing—has left China with no choice but to readjust its strategy to maintain its momentum despite these headwinds. Among the subjects to be discussed, China’s strategy of technological self-reliance will be one of the most important. At least twice in the past year, President Xi Jinping has stressed that the country needs to become a technological powerhouse to ensure its long-term economic success. The United States and its allies have restricted semiconductor exports and advanced technology transfer, so Beijing has increased its efforts to develop its own capabilities. Policy measures related to the improvement of the country’s AI, chip manufacturing, and other high-tech industries are likely to be revealed during the Two Sessions. The government is also expected to introduce new incentives and regulatory frameworks to support private-sector players in these areas, reinforcing their role in driving China’s technological transformation. In recent months, Xi has personally engaged with major business leaders, including Alibaba’s Jack Ma, Huawei’s Ren Zhengfei, and Xiaomi’s Lei Jun, to assure them of the government’s commitment to fostering an environment that enables private enterprises to thrive. These efforts are part of a larger effort to revitalize confidence in China’s economic model as foreign investment is coming under more scrutiny due to geopolitical tensions. New policy measures that will improve market access, decrease bureaucratic delays, and ensure equal treatment are likely to be revealed during the Two Sessions in an attempt to counter the negative impact of Trump’s increasing trade restrictions. Beyond domestic economic policies, the leadership will also address mounting fiscal challenges. The real estate sector, which used to be an engine of growth, has been in a slump for the past few years. Beijing has already been making serious efforts to stabilize the market through the implementation of various stimulus measures, but more policies may be announced to boost this sector. Similarly, the issue of local government debt will be on the main agenda. Since many provincial and municipal governments have financial challenges, the central government will have to find new ways of addressing the debt levels as it continues with the infrastructure spending. Another important area of focus will be the expansion of the domestic market. Having assessed the world’s slow growth and trade risks, Chinese leaders understand the need to accelerate internal demand growth as a shield against the external shocks. The Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) in December underscored this priority, calling for aggressive measures to encourage consumer spending, which could include tax cuts, subsidies, or other measures that increase income and consumer confidence. The success of these measures will be closely watched, as China seeks to move from an export-led growth model to one based on domestic consumption. In the political sphere, China is prepared for the continued deterioration of relations with the United States. The return of Trump to the White House has already instigated a new round in the trade war, with his administration imposing new tariffs and compelling its allies to distance themselves from Beijing and its financial projects, including the Belt and Road Initiative. The recent action of Panama severing ties with the BRI at the behest of the United States reveals this larger geopolitical contest. China will now try to find new trade partners and diversify its economic relations to reduce the risks that come with Washington’s hostile posture. As the world’s second-largest economy, China’s policy choices carry global significance. Many developing nations are looking toward Beijing for leadership in the fight against Washington’s protectionism and the promotion of a new, fairer world economic order. Against this background, the Two Sessions are not only a domestic policy-setting event but also a message to the international community that China is ready to lead in ensuring economic stability, innovation, and cooperation. The challenge for China lies in sustaining robust growth while managing an increasingly hostile global environment. The decisions made during the Two Sessions will determine the direction of the country for the next few years; whether it will keep rising as one of the world’s economic powers or whether it will experience some setbacks due to pressures from the outside environment.

Bangladesh Students’ Party To Be Neither Pro-India Nor Pro-Pakist...	The Jatiya Nagorik Party (National Citizens' Party) that was launched on February 28 at a massive rally in Dhaka, aims to establish a 'Second Republic' cleansed of 'fascism'. The students of Bangladesh, who led the mass movement that overthrew Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule in August last year, formed a political party of their own with a massive rally in Dhaka on February 28. Named Jatiya Nagorik Party (JNP) or the National Citizens' Party (NCP), the new outfit pledged to build a 'Second Republic' devoid of any trace of 'fascism' and marked by equalitarianism, inclusivity, and non-exploitation. To emphasise inclusivity, the rally began with recitations from the Quran, Gita, the Buddhist Tripitaka, and the Bible. Equally surprisingly, the Bangladesh national anthem, Amar Shonar Bangla (Our Golden Bengal) composed by Rabindranath Tagore was sung despite a call by the Jamaat-e-Islami to replace it. Through recitations from the scriptures of various religions and singing Tagore's Amar Shonar Bangla, the JNP hopes to refute the charge that it is a front for the Jamaat-e-Islami. The JNP envisages a Bangladesh radically different from the First Republic founded by the Awami League leader and founder of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Utterance of his name or his title Bangabandhu (Friend of Bengal) or his slogan 'Joy Bangla' (Victory to Bengal) is taboo for the JNP. In fact, it has been taboo in Bangladesh at the insistence of the student movement. In August 2024, the Bangladesh judiciary had endorsed the Interim Government's plea that 'Joy Bangla' should cease to be the official slogan of the country. With the result, nobody raised the slogan 'Joy Bangla' at Friday's rally. Instead, the Urdu language 'Inquilab Zindabad' (Victory to Revolution) rent the air. Neither pro-India nor pro-Pakistan Nahid Islam, convener of the party, declared at the rally that 'Bangladesh's political landscape will not accommodate pro-India or pro-Pakistan influences.' He emphasized that the party aims to rebuild the State with a focus on national interests and the well-being of Bangladeshi citizens alone. 'We want to talk about the future. We want to move beyond the past and discuss the possibilities of Bangladesh,' Nahid said. JNP Manifesto The JNP released its manifesto at the rally. Here are excerpts - 'The July 2024 Mass uprising has marked the beginning of our struggle to establish a second republic. To achieve this, we must eliminate all possibilities of restoring constitutional autocracy through the adoption of a new democratic constitution.' 'One of our primary goals is to draft a new constitution through an elected constituent assembly. Our second republic will ensure a strong national defence system to protect the nation's interests. Rebuilding broken political, social, economic, and cultural institutions and preserving their democratic nature will be our political priority. Only through these efforts can we emerge as a fully democratic state.' 'We strive to cultivate a political culture where unity prevails over division, justice replaces vengeance, and merit and competence triumph over dynastic politics at all levels of society and the state. There will be no place for corruption and nepotism in our politics.' 'In our second republic, the voices of the marginalised and disadvantaged communities will be brought into the mainstream. In our republic, the common people—and only the common people—will be the supreme source of power. The robust protection of all their democratic and fundamental rights will be the core principle of our politics.' 'We aim to build a pluralistic and prosperous society by preserving the nation's ethnic, social, gender, religious, and cultural values and diversity.) Our republic will ensure strong protections against poverty, inequality, and the abuse of power.' 'No segment of Bangladesh's population will be excluded or criminalised in our second republic. Instead, every citizen will be given equal importance, and their safety and security will be guaranteed.' 'Economically, we aim to establish a self-sufficient, equitable, and sustainable national economy through the proper integration of agriculture, services, and production sectors. Our economy will be sensitive to life, nature, and the environment.' 'Wealth will not be concentrated in the hands of a select few; instead, the equitable redistribution of resources will be the core principle of our economic policies. We will take firm steps to regulate corporate syndicates and vested interests, safeguarding consumer and public welfare.' ' We will position Bangladesh as a strong regional power through economic advancement, fostering regional cooperation and international partnerships. We will build a modern and sustainable economy prioritising science and technology and fostering an innovation-driven culture.' 'We strongly believe that the July 2024 mass uprising was not just a victory against a fascist regime but also a pledge to shape our future. Let us unite, hand in hand, to build a Bangladesh where every citizen's voice is heard—where the struggle for justice and human rights will be at the heart of politics—where equality and human dignity will form the foundation of the state.' 'Our country, our rights, our future—the second republic is not an unattainable dream. It is our solemn commitment!' Call for All-Party Approach JNP's Chief Organizer (Northern Region) Sarjis Alam said: 'If we want to organize Bangladesh properly, all political parties must unite. Then, the future Bangladesh will be a Bangladesh of unity. Hasina has destroyed all institutions of this country. All political parties must unite to restore these institutions.' 'We must collectively ensure justice for the murderer Hasina. We should not go to police stations to seek the release of any criminals.' 'If the major political parties do not allow smaller parties to move forward, another autocracy may be established. We should learn this lesson from the murderer Hasina.' 'Let us come together, hand in hand, to build a Bangladesh where the voice of every citizen will resonate, where the struggle for justice and human rights will be at the core of politics, and where equality and human dignity will form the foundation of the state,' Sarjis said. Leaders from various political parties, including Ganosamhati Andolon, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, the 12-party alliance, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, Hefazat-e-Islam, the Labour Party, Jatiya Oikya Front, and the Nationalist Democratic Movement, attended the rally. Interestingly, the Ambassador of Pakistan, Syed Ahmed Maroof, was present but not the Indian envoy. 10-Member Leadership Announced The party's top ten leaders have been announced. Former information adviser Nahid Islam is the Convener, while Akhter Hossen is Member Secretary. Samanta Shermeen and Ariful Islam Adeeb have been chosen as Senior Joint Conveners, while Tasnim Jara and Nahida Sarwar (Nova) will be Senior Joint Member Secretaries. Nasiruddin Patwary has been appointed chief coordinator, with Abdul Hannan Masud as joint coordinator. Additionally, Sarjis Alam will be the chief organizer for the northern region, while Hasnat Abdullah will be chief organiser of the southern region. Outside Support The JNP has the full backing of the Interim Government led by Prof.Muhammad Yunus who stated this in his interview to the British paper Financial Times. He said that the students had the right to form a party and pursue their goals, because they led the movement against autocracy. The Jamaat-i-Islami is also a backer of the JNP because it needs an alliance to win seats in parliament. Like the JNP, the Jamaat too is virulently against the Awami League, Sheikh Mujib and Sheikh Hasina. Hasina had banned it. The Jamaat had to wait until Yunus formed a government to get the ban lifted. Both JNP and Jamaat are not for immediate elections as they feel that the country's structure and values should be reformed first before holding elections. And both want the Awami League and its legacy, to be removed root and branch first before holding elections. However, the JNP and the Jamaat will clash on the question of Sharia, women rights etc., because Bangladeshi students stand for women's equal participation in all spheres of public activity including sports, while the Jamaat dubs all modernity as haram and has taken to disruption and attacks on modern women. The other point of divergence between the JNP and the Jamaat is over relations with India. The JNP is realistic enough not to antagonise neighbouring India beyond a point. But the Jamaat is resolutely opposed to India on both religious and political grounds. It is anti-secular and pro-Pakistani to the core and envisages a day when Bangladesh and Pakistan become one again. The Bangladesh National Party (BNP) is in a class of its own. It is secular even as it has had an alliance with the Jamaat in the past. Like the Jamaat, it has been very anti-Awami League. But like the Awami League, the BNP is a moderate party which believes in the electoral process. The BNP is not in favour of a ban on the Awami League, unlike the JNP or the Jamaat. The BNP has had a difficult relationship with India because it identified India with the Awami League, Sheikh Mujib and Sheikh Hasina, its rivals for decades. But the BNP has had periods of good relations with India when India had fallen out with Hasina sometime in the 1990s. The BNP is now cultivating the Hindu minority in Bangladesh as the latter is now leaderless given the fact that its protector, the Awami League, has been suppressed and marginalised. The BNP wants early elections and vigorously disputes the prevailing theory that a new system should be put in place before elections are held. For the BNP, this is putting the cart before the horse, as only an elected parliament can draft an acceptable constitution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvrxF0AU-gMurN	2025-03-01T17:53:30-08:00	
Indonesia’s Strategic Diplomacy: Balancing Global Powers In 2025 ...	Strategically situated in Southeast Asia, Indonesia has long pursued a non-aligned and impartial foreign policy. Amid rising geopolitical tensions among the United States, Russia, and China, Indonesia continues to manage its international relationships pragmatically. By leveraging economic and security cooperation while safeguarding its national interests and sovereignty, Indonesia effectively balances its global activities. Looking ahead to 2025, Indonesia should refine its approach by enhancing economic diversification, maintaining security independence, and exercising diplomatic neutrality to successfully navigate shifting geopolitical dynamics. The cornerstone of Indonesia's foreign policy is the 'Bebas-Aktif' (Independent and Active) doctrine, established during the early years of independence. This doctrine emphasizes autonomy in international affairs and active participation in promoting global peace. In contemporary terms, it translates into a foreign policy that resists alignment with major power blocs, allowing Indonesia to pursue various partnerships that serve its national interests. By adhering to this principle, Indonesia avoids excessive reliance on any single global power and maintains its strategic flexibility in international relations. As a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesia plays a significant role among regional and global participants. It employs ASEAN-centric policies to balance external influences, ensuring that relationships with international actors do not undermine local harmony. This approach strengthens ASEAN's centrality in regional governance and promotes collective resilience against external pressures. Indonesia's membership in ASEAN provides a platform for collaboration and conflict mediation without risking subjugation to foreign powers. Continued economic growth is crucial for Indonesia's foreign policy. The country promotes foreign investment and strengthens trade agreements to drive domestic economic development. While seeking security alliances with various nations to enhance its military capabilities, Indonesia remains dedicated to protecting its sovereignty. This multifaceted approach enables Indonesia to successfully navigate the dynamic geopolitical landscape. Economic development remains a priority, and the ability to attract investments while maintaining sovereignty is essential for its foreign policy goals. Indonesia has significantly benefited from its financial and security ties with the U.S. The U.S. is a critical trading partner and investor, with bilateral trade projected to exceed $32 billion by 2025. Defense relationships have been strengthened through joint exercises and training programs, exemplified by the annual 'Garuda Shield' activities, which enhance Indonesia's military capabilities and interoperability with U.S. forces. However, Indonesia is cautious about becoming overly reliant on American military assistance and strives to maintain its strategic autonomy. This delicate balance allows Indonesia to benefit from U.S. engagement without becoming entangled in the U.S.-China competition. Indonesia and the United States share common interests in promoting democracy, human rights, and regional stability. However, Indonesia is careful to maintain its non-aligned status by ensuring that it fosters relations with the U.S. through an independent foreign policy. By 2025, Indonesia should focus on enhancing economic and security cooperation while proactively diversifying trade to reduce overdependence on any single partner. Indonesia's defense and military cooperation with Russia has historical roots in arms procurement and technology transfer. Despite the challenges posed by Western sanctions, Indonesia continues to seek security cooperation with Russia in 2025. These sanctions have complicated arms transactions, prompting Indonesia to diversify its military partnerships and explore alternative defense technologies. Amid these constraints, Indonesia must carefully balance its military initiatives to ensure the continuity of its security modernization program. Economically, Russia is interested in Indonesia's electricity and infrastructure development. However, its financial engagement is limited compared to Indonesia's relationships with larger partners like China and the U.S. As a result, Russia's financial presence in Indonesia is relatively modest, making this relationship secondary. Indonesia maintains a neutral diplomatic stance on global conflicts involving Russia, including the Ukraine crisis, carefully balancing its position to avoid alienating Western allies. In 2025, Indonesia should focus on economic diversification and technological protection partnerships, steering clear of alignment on contentious geopolitical issues. China's position as Indonesia's largest trading partner and investor highlights the importance of their bilateral relationship. By 2025, Indonesia will finalize its membership in the BRICS organization, signifying a strategic alignment with emerging economies. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has further strengthened economic ties, leading to significant investments in Indonesian infrastructure projects. While these financial engagements bring advantages, they also raise concerns about dependency and sovereignty. Maritime issues present significant challenges. Chinese coast guard incursions into Indonesia's exclusive economic zone around the Natuna Islands have strained bilateral relations. In response, Indonesia has increased military patrols and implemented diplomatic measures to assert its sovereignty. This situation highlights the difficulty of balancing economic cooperation with China and addressing security concerns. While there is a Chinese cultural influence in Indonesia, the country remains cautious about maintaining domestic politics and societal harmony. As a result, Indonesia must navigate its relationship with China carefully. Managing relationships with major powers presents several challenges for Indonesia. Geopolitical pressures stemming from U.S.-China tensions require careful navigation of its non-alignment to avoid being drawn into great power rivalries. The growing strategic competition between these powers in the Indo-Pacific further complicates Indonesia's foreign relations. Additionally, economic dependence on China poses risks, leading Indonesia to seek diversification of its trade and investment sources. While China is Indonesia's largest trading partner, excessive reliance on Chinese investment poses a risk to Indonesia's economic sovereignty. Security issues, particularly in the South China Sea, necessitate a careful balance between security cooperation and the preservation of national sovereignty. Indonesia should focus on enhancing its military capabilities without provoking conflicts with regional stakeholders. Domestic politics and public opinion also influence the coverage instructions for remote areas, requiring the government to align its global engagement with national sentiment. Additionally, political debates surrounding influential family members may further affect Indonesia's foreign policy responsibilities in the long term. Indonesia's pragmatic and adaptable approach to remote area insurance is crucial for maintaining sovereignty and advancing national interests amid global power competitions. By effectively combining economic cooperation, security partnerships, and diplomatic neutrality, Indonesia positions itself as a strong and influential player on the world stage. By enhancing exchange diversification, maintaining a managed safety approach, and leveraging its regional relationships through ASEAN, Indonesia can effectively navigate intense power competition. In 2025 and beyond, the country must bolster its diplomatic engagements, deepen military modernization, and strengthen economic resilience to assert its national interests and maintain strategic autonomy in an increasingly complex global landscape. By staying committed to its independence, Indonesia can effectively manage power dynamics while promoting long-term stability and prosperity.

Pride, Horror, And Concern: What Ukrainians Think About The Trump...	By Serhiy Stetsenko (RFE/RL) -- The heated White House exchange between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Vice President JD Vance has touched many Ukrainians in many different ways. Some felt a surge of pride in their wartime leader, while others tempered that pride with growing unease over the future of U.S.-Ukrainian relations -- and what that could mean for their country's three-year war against Russia. 'Raising Your Voice In The Oval Office' For Andriy Veselovskiy, the former Ukrainian ambassador to the European Union, however, the dominant emotion was sheer horror. 'I'm sorry I agreed to do this broadcast with you, because I'm in a very bad mood after what I saw,' Veselovskiy told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service on February 28. 'Raising your voice in the Oval Office at the vice president and the president and interrupting both of them is not a style that can help Ukraine's interests.' Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump on February 28 ended in acrimony after a tense exchange of words in the Oval Office. Shortly afterwards, Zelenskyy left and Trump said the Ukrainian leader was disrespectful and could 'come back when he is ready for peace.' Before the meeting broke up, Trump said that Ukraine would have to make compromises and that Kyiv should be more appreciative of U.S. assistance in the country's war against Russia. Zelenskyy pushed for U.S. security commitments and said that there should be 'no compromises with a killer,' a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Oleksiy Honcharenko, a parliamentary deputy for the center-right European Solidarity Party, shared Veselovskiy's sense of horror, saying it was the 'end of relations with Trump.' Those opinions were echoed on the streets of Ukraine. A woman in Rivne, a city in western Ukraine, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that the widely broadcast White House meeting left a 'super negative' impression of Ukraine, 'because we are a country at war and we need aid from the U.S.' Ukraine's diplomacy, she added, 'should have been professional.' Pride In Their President But for other Ukrainians, however, they felt only pride watching their president's exchange in the White House. 'Honestly, I don't know what the consequences will be for Ukraine, but I am sure that we have shown our strength,' another woman told RFE/RL in Rivne. 'Our president showed that we are strong, we will not bend, and we have our own opinion.' Natalia Serhiyenko, a pensioner in Kyiv, told the Associated Press that 'Zelenskyy fought like a lion.' 'They had a heated meeting, a very heated conversation,' she said, but Zelenskyy 'was defending Ukraine’s interests.' Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region that borders Russia, also praised Zelenskyy, telling AP that the Ukrainian president stuck to his guns that there could be no peace deal without security assurances for Ukraine. 'Our leader, despite the pressure, stands firm in defending the interests of Ukraine and Ukrainians,' Syniehubov said. 'We need only a just peace with security guarantees.' As well as pride, for some Ukrainians there was a sense of anger at how they thought Zelenskyy had been treated. 'We are striving for democracy, and we are met with total disrespect toward our warriors, our soldiers, and the people of our country,' Artem Vasyliev, originally from Russian-occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, told Reuters. How Can Relations Be Fixed? Trump, according to Vasyliev, 'doesn’t understand that people are dying, that cities are being destroyed, people are suffering, mothers, children, soldiers.' Whether their reaction was one of pride or horror, most Ukrainians had one common concern: how to repair Ukraine's strained relationship with its most important wartime ally. 'We have to consistently strengthen our ties with Europe and focus on Europe and on ourselves,' a woman told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service from Dnipro, a city in central Ukraine. Former ambassador to the EU Veselovskiy said that Zelenskyy's response should have been more restrained and now doubts that the Ukrainian president will be able to get into the White House at all. Oleksandr Merezhko, a parliamentary deputy from Zelenskyy's Servant of the People party, told RFE/RL that, despite any difficulties, Ukraine had to work with Trump because the stakes were so high. 'We have to reduce the tensions,' Merezhko said. 'There are some connections -- congressmen and senators who have influence on Trump.... We need to immediately get in touch with these people.' Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote in a post on Telegram that he hoped that 'Ukraine does not lose the support of the United States, which is extremely important to us.' 'Today is not the time for emotions, from either side. We need to find common ground,' Klitschko wrote.

Trump’s Slush Fund – OpEd	By Vincent Cook In his February 3 Executive Order, President Trump directed his minions to begin planning for establishment of a 'Sovereign Wealth Fund' that he originally touted in a speech to the Economic Club of New York last September. The fund would be on the order of $2 trillion, investing in things like manufacturing hubs, defense, and medical research. The order states: 'It is the policy of the United States to maximize the stewardship of our national wealth for the sole benefit of American citizens. To this end, it is in the interest of the American people that the Federal Government establish a sovereign wealth fund to promote fiscal sustainability, lessen the burden of taxes on American families and small businesses, establish economic security for future generations, and promote United States economic and strategic leadership internationally.' This order reflects a new anti-capitalist economic orientation of the Republican Party, embracing fallacies that government can somehow be made efficient, that tariffs can perform miracles like saving the fiat dollar from destruction, and that selecting the right executive personnel is a substitute for rule of law. Republicans have evidently forgotten the eternal economic truth that planning not driven by free markets doesn’t work; government shouldn’t be trying to pick winners and losers in the business world. Whatever claim Republicans had to being pro-liberty, pro-Constitution, pro-free market, etc. is gone now. To be sure, it is undeniably true that America is not on a path towards fiscal sustainability and future economic security, and it is losing its economic and strategic leadership in the international arena. However, one does not 'maximize the stewardship' of American wealth by forcing the American people to hand it over to presidential appointees. The fact that numerous other states possess such collectivized investment arrangements (a talking point that Trump repeatedly stresses) is not a valid excuse for America to commit a similar blunder. In a passage from A Critique of Interventionism, making the case that government-controlled enterprises can’t escape the inefficiencies of bureaucratic management, Ludwig von Mises explained how responsible stewardship of capital goods is, in fact, maximized by private ownership of the means of production in conjunction with an unhampered market: The entrepreneur operates on his own responsibility. If he does not produce at lowest costs of capital and labor what consumers believe they need most urgently, he suffers losses. But losses finally lead to a transfer of his wealth, and thus his power of control over means of production, to more capable hands. In a capitalistic economy the means of production are always on the way to the most capable manager, that is, to one who is able to use these means most economically to the satisfaction of consumer needs. A public enterprise, however, is managed by men who do not face the consequences of their success or failure. Mises went on to note how even introducing an element of profit-seeking into government enterprises doesn’t replicate the benefits of a capitalistic economy: Even a profit-seeking public enterprise could not be unbureaucratic. Attempts have been made to eliminate bureaucratism through profit-sharing by managers. But since they could not be expected to bear the eventual losses, they are tempted to become reckless, which then is to be avoided by limiting the manager’s authority through directives from higher officials, boards, committees, and 'expert' opinions. Thus again, more regulation and bureaucratization are created. But usually public enterprises are expected to strive for more than profitability. This is why they are owned and operated by government. Deumer, too, demands of the nationalized banking system that it be guided by national rather than private considerations, that it should invest its funds not where the return is highest, but where they serve the national interest. It is important to note here that Mises neither denied that a principal-agent problem might exist in a private firm nor denied that private firms might have their own issues with bureaucratism; rather, he was affirming that market-based, profit-and-loss accounting is the primary cure for such problems and that government interference with markets and with private ownership is the primary obstacle to profit-and-loss governance of private businesses. Mises perceptively points out how profit-sharing doesn’t curb reckless behavior by managers who have no skin in the game, and how political considerations often override considerations of profitability when government has a large stake in the business. Investors must retain an active role in looking after their own investments and be unhampered by government restrictions and controls for profitability to be a useful feedback mechanism. A myth popular among some non-Austrian economists is that investing can be reduced to an automated, mathematical exercise in diversification and statistical measurement of cyclical risks (e.g., the capital asset pricing model), which, in turn, gives some superficial plausibility to the assumption that handing trillions of dollars over to managers of 'sovereign wealth funds' can be a harmless exercise when organized in the manner of a passive index mutual fund. However, several searing experiences in recent decades such as Enron systematically fleecing equity investors with misleading financial statements or a massive bank credit expansion featuring an unusual concentration in subprime housing mortgages due to regulatory arbitrage remind us that investing can never be safely put on autopilot. American citizens are better off picking their own stewards who serve at their pleasure, rather than blindly trusting governmental stewards they can’t even fire and phony government pretenses of insuring the uninsurable. The wisdom of Mises’s position is further reinforced by the revealing statements made by Trump regarding his political motivations for the fund. Trump stated that the fund might be used to buy TikTok, presumably for the 'strategic' reason that its current ownership is Chinese. It’s bad enough that TikTok would then be managed like the US Postal Service (presumably with all the efficiency and customer service that the USPS is infamous for), but what assurance would there be that the American government’s abuse of TikTok user data or its politicized manipulation of messaging on the platform would be any less malevolent than what is currently practiced by the Chinese Communists? More generally, what is to prevent the fund from becoming a means for funding graft, political machines, and ever more intrusive forms of social engineering on a colossal scale? If one wants to get serious about improving the stewardship of wealth in America and empowering its citizens to have their interests prevail, that wealth should be transferred back into the possession of its rightful owners. Wealth also needs to be liberated from the sort of tax and regulatory regime that favors concentration of stewardship in the hands of Davosian-oriented stakeholders like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street and the funneling of funds into lower-yielding investments. It would also help a great deal if the pursuit of future economic security were to become an individual responsibility again, not reliant upon the unsustainable entitlement obligations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and on the unsustainable inflation of the quantity of fiat dollars by the Federal Reserve. It is the capital-consuming nature of the welfare state and its fiat dollar-financing mechanism that has been steadily eroding America’s economic security and fiscal sustainability and forfeiting America’s leadership on international economic and strategic matters.

The US Government’s Terrible Bird Flu Scheme – OpEd	The unfolding bird flu narrative serves as a chilling echo of the COVID-19 pandemic, starkly illustrating a playbook dusted off and redeployed,' wrote Joseph Mercola in the concluding paragraphs of his Friday article at mecola.com detailing the outrageous actions the United States government has been taking and is planning to take in the name of countering bird flu. Mercola would know. He is a doctor whose insightful comments are followed by many people seeking guidance on how to live healthier. He was one of the rare medical professionals who stood up against the coronavirus fearmongering and crackdown early on by both criticizing the push to inject experimental coronavirus 'vaccine' shots into as many people as possible and educating people about actual coronavirus risk and what they could do for themselves to prevent or reduce harm from coronavirus. This was when the standard line trumpeted by government and media and declared to be 'the science' said that, aside from the experimental shots along with mask and social distancing quackery, prevention and early treatment options did not exist. People were told to put their full faith in the supposedly 'safe and effective' shots and, only after they became very sick, hospitals that often followed protocols that seemed more in line with conveyor belts of death than remediation. The US government has spent over a billion dollars on the killing of 150 million chickens and other birds since 2022 — including over 40 million killed in just December and January — in the supposed effort to counter bird flu, wrote Mercola. This mass slaughter has proceeded little noticed by the public except for its effect in scarcity and increased prices for eggs. The costs are plain to see. But, what are the gains from these US government actions? Mercola argues that any gains are phantom. The killings have, he wrote, caused more problems by both preventing the development of natural immunity among fowl that promises to answer any bird flu threat and increasing the risk of one of the consequences the government claims to be seeking to prevent — bird flu harming people. As with the coronavirus crackdown before, the US government’s bird flu scheme is built upon finding 'cases' of the disease through use of PCR tests with a high rate of false positives. Also as with the coronavirus crackdown, the US government is pushing development and use of experimental 'vaccines' — first for birds and then for people — to save the day. Moderna, a company whose name became well known during the long period of badgering people to take supposedly 'safe and effective' coronavirus shots, comes up in Mercola’s telling of the pharmaceutical actions the US government is pursuing: Bird flu shots are now front and center. In addition to the USDA’s conditional license for Zoetis’ bird flu vaccine for chickens, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agreed to give Moderna $590 million to develop an mRNA vaccine for H5N1 in humans — even though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said bird flu is a low risk to people. Hopefully, the US government will exit from supporting these 'vaccines.' Such a change in course is suggested to be likely by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. last week placing a temporary halt on US government support for a pharmaceutical company’s development of a new coronavirus 'vaccine' pill. But, while Kennedy oversees the Department of Health and Human Services that is involved in development of bird flu 'vaccine' for humans, the 'vaccine' for birds and the mass slaughter of birds is overseen by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) of which Brooke Rollins is the new secretary. Will Secretaries Kennedy and Rollins, both newly in charge of their government departments in February, take action to save chickens and the American people from more outrageous harm arising from the US government’s bird flu scheme ramped up during the previous presidential administration? We have already had more than enough of this terrible coronavirus crackdown sequel.

Trump Takes On The ‘Collective West’ – OpEd	The dramatic scene in the Oval Office on Friday evening signals that President Donald Trump is decoupling the US from the ‘forever war’ in Ukraine that his predecessor Joe Biden left behind. The war is poised to end with a whimper, but its ‘butterfly effect’ on our incredibly complex, deeply interconnected world will define European and international security for decades to come. The western media which is hostile toward Trump, have seized the opportunity to caricature him as an impulsive figure in a role reversal with Zelenskyy. In reality, though, Trump has been literally driven to this point by the Biden administration. The highly charged emotional reaction by the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen commiserating with President Zelensky speaks for itself: 'Your dignity honours the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President.' Trump’s refusal to give Von der Leyen an appointment may partly explain her fury as a woman scorned. Truly, the ‘Collective West’ find themselves at a crossroads and do not know which road to take. Without US air cover and satellite inputs, western troop deployment in Ukraine will be impossible. Even French Emmanuel Macron would agree that his troops will be put through a meat grinder. Both Von der Leyen and Macron had a whale of a time as cheerleaders of Biden’s war but any further adventures in Ukraine will be suicidal, to put it mildly. Ukraine’s military will collapse if Trump freezes support. None of the European powers will risk a collision with Russia. Trump knows by now that the western narrative of Biden’s war is a load of bullshit peppered with falsehoods and outright lies, and that the war erupted only out of the diabolic western plot to poke the bear, which got provoked finally and hit out. The CIA’s coup in Kiev in February 2014 was a watershed event paving the way for a NATO presence on Ukrainian soil. Indeed, terrible things happened, which have been shoved under the carpet — for instance, then German foreign minister (current president) Frank-Walter Steinmeier’s dubious links with the neo-Nazi Ukrainian groups who acted as storm troopers in the 2014 coup. Just think of the grotesqueness of it — a German social democrat patronising neo-Nazi groups! Most certainly, Trump knows that the US deep state had set in motion an agenda to destabilise the Russian Federation and dismember it as the unfinished business no sooner than the Soviet Union was dissolved. The Chechen War has no other explanation. In fact, Putin has accused accused US agents of directly aiding the insurgents. Again, the Bill Clinton administration floated the idea of NATO expansion as early as in 1994. It came out of the blue but was obviously a work in progress since the disbandment of the Soviet Union. By the mid-nineties, even Boris Yeltsin understood that he was played nicely. The return of Evgeny Primakov to the Kremlin and Yeltsin’s overture to Beijing were the surest signs of a course correction. Those familiar with Soviet history had known all along that Ukraine would be the theatre where the US would try to seal the fate of Russia. If further confirmation was needed, it came with the CIA’s colour revolution in Ukraine in 2003 where the election was rigged (as is happening in Romania today) and carried to a third round till the proxy emerged victorious and surely, Viktor Yushchenko brought the NATO membership issue to the table. At the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, George W. Bush insisted that the alliance formally offered membership to Ukraine! Today, Britain’s MI6 calls the shots in Kiev. Zelenskyy admitted recently that much of the money given by Biden simply ‘disappeared’. Sordid tales of massive kickbacks and corruption are galore. Biden ignored them. The Biden family’s involvement in Ukraine’s cesspools is widely known. Contrary to his pledge earlier not to do so, Biden felt constrained finally to grant a presidential pardon to son Hunter Biden so that he wouldn’t end up in jail. Suffice to say, Zelenskyy’s ‘strategic defiance’ stems out of his quiet confidence that western leaders — starting with Boris Johnson and Biden — who have been fellow travellers in the gravy train during the past three years of the war are beholden to him till eternity. The axis between Zelensky and his European Union supporters is cajoling Trump, pressuring him and flattering him in turn to get him on board the bandwagon so that the war rolls on for another four years. Last week alone, the presidents of France and Poland and the British prime minister descended on the White House on after another seeking assurance that the war in Ukraine will continue. But Trump has refused to oblige. Zelenskyy and his European backers want a ‘forever war’ in the western border lands of Eurasia, the traditional invasion route to Russia. And last week he again ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine. He also pointed to the ongoing talks on 'major economic development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia.' Trump repeated last week that the war could be ended 'within weeks' and warned of the risk of escalation into a 'third world war.' Basically, he realises that this is an unwinnable war, and is apprehensive that a prolonged war may transform into a quagmire sinking his presidency and derailing the grand bargain he hopes to strike with the two other superpowers, Russia and China, to create synergy for his ambitious MAGA project. Trump has chalked up 2026, the Quarter Millennial of the United States Declaration of Independence, for hosting the leaders of Russia and China on American soil to celebrate the high noon of his quest for world peace. The European political elites weaned on the liberal-globalist ‘rules-based order’ cannot understand Trump’s deep-rooted convictions and his abhorrence of war. The big question now is wether the unprecedented fracas in the White House yesterday could backfire on Zelenskyy, since Washington has significant leverage vis-a-vis Kiev and given the latter’s heavy dependence on the US for some of the critical elements of its defence. Following the Oval Office argument, Zelenskyy has issued a lengthy statement admitting that it is 'crucial' for Ukraine to have Trump’s support. A patch-up cannot be ruled out but the transatlantic system has received a big jolt, as the overwhelming majority of European countries have voiced support for Zelenskyy. In fact, there hasn’t been a solitary voice censuring Zelenskyy. Britain kept mum. Keir Starmer, UK prime minister is hosting a meeting of European leaders on Sunday which Zelenskyy is due to attend. It is unlikely that Europeans will push the envelope further In this dismal scenario, the best hope is that Zelenskyy’s ouster, which seems probable, will not be a violent bloody event, considering the power rivalries within the regime in Kiev. At any rate, his replacement may not be a terrible thing to happen since it would necessitate holding the long overdue election and lead to the emergence of a legitimate leadership in Kiev, which has now become a dire necessity for what Trump would call ‘common sense’ to prevail.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr6kUytPUlTdM	2025-03-01T17:41:07-08:00	
Ukraine’s Diplomatic Crossroads: The Need For Strategic Rethinkin...	The international security landscape is about to witness an unexpected turnaround and a stark realization of the realities on the war front. Undoubtedly, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has put to test the battle readiness of the involved parties and the extent of diplomacy that could potentially alter the situation for better or worse. The horrendous situation on the battlefield in Ukraine represents a strategic failure of the West, conveniently ignored due to self-serving agendas. However, it is time to revisit the origins of this conflict and leverage the lessons learned to formulate a robust playbook for future international security management. As President Trump stated in numerous forums, the Russian invasion of Ukraine could have been avoided if the West had analyzed the underlying issues and taken timely action to prevent any aggressive maneuvers by Russia. However, even after the invasion, numerous opportunities for negotiation arose but were subsequently ignored by the West. On several occasions, President Zelenskyy was reportedly pressured by Western powers to forgo negotiations and continue the war to reclaim territories from Russia. Additionally, the prevailing notion that President Putin cannot be trusted without a security guarantee from the West, backed by the United States, further complicated the negotiations. Despite continuous support from the West, this perception and lack of cohesive strategy led to strategic decay without recourse. It is a well-documented fact that Russia invaded Ukraine, labeling its actions as a 'special military operation.' This operation, according to Russian claims, aims to demilitarize and 'denazify' Ukraine, ostensibly to protect Russian-speaking populations in the Luhansk and Donbas regions, while preventing Ukraine from becoming a NATO member for security reasons. Conversely, the West seized this opportunity to punish Russia through Ukraine, rallying behind the slogan 'as long as it takes' but failing to anticipate the desired outcome. Regrettably, Ukraine now finds itself in a diplomatic stalemate due to ideological differences among the stakeholders. While the United States is striving to end the war in Ukraine, President Zelenskyy, influenced by the West, continues to object, asserting that President Putin cannot be trusted and demanding a security guarantee. This perception is likely to further deteriorate the situation, rendering Ukraine untenable and potentially jeopardizing military assistance from the United States. In light of this situation, Ukraine must assert its independence and critically analyze its needs during negotiations while engaging in mutual dialogue with United States leadership. Ukraine should prioritize its national security and interests over European security as a secondary objective in future negotiations. The West must recognize that Ukraine should not be utilized as a means to obscure its own vulnerabilities. It is essential that Western nations do not depend on Ukraine to fulfill their security objectives. Instead, they should address their own strategic weaknesses directly and develop independent security strategies. Furthermore, leveraging Ukraine to achieve broader geopolitical aims not only undermines Ukraine's sovereignty but also risks prolonging the conflict and worsening the humanitarian crisis.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr5PJf0VOjsVH	2025-03-01T17:37:46-08:00	
Robert Reich: 10 More Reasons For Modest Optimism – OpEd	Since I offered you 10 reasons for modest optimism last week, discontent with the Trump-Musk regime has surged even further. America appears to be waking up. Here’s the latest evidence — 10 more reasons for modest optimism. 1. Trump’s approval ratings continue to plummet. The chief reason Trump was elected was to reduce the high costs of living — especially food, housing, health care, and gas. A new Pew poll shows these costs remain uppermost in Americans’ minds. Sixty-three percent identify inflation as an overriding problem, and 67 percent say the same about the affordability of health care. That same poll shows the public turning on Trump. The percent of those disapproving of Trump’s handling of the economy has risen to 53 percent (versus 45 percent who approve). Disapproval of his actions as president has risen to the same 53 percent versus 45 percent approval, which shows how essential economic performance is to the public’s assessment of presidents these days. The Pew poll also shows 57 percent of the public believes that Trump 'has exceeded his presidential authority.' By making the world’s richest person his hatchet man, Trump has made more vivid the role of money in politics. Hence, a record-high 72 percent now say a major problem is 'the role of money in politics.' Other polls show similar results. In the Post-Ipsos poll, significantly more Americans strongly disapprove of Trump (39 percent) than strongly approve of him (27 percent). Reuters, Quinnipiac University, CNN, and Gallup polls show Trump’s approval ratings plummeting (ranging from 44 percent to 47 percent). In all of these polls, more Americans now disapprove of Trump than approve of him. 2. DOGE is running amusk. DOGE looks more and more like a giant hoax. This week, reporters found that nearly 40 percent of the contracts DOGE claims to have canceled aren’t expected to save the government any money, according to the administration’s own data. As a result, on Tuesday DOGE deleted all of the five biggest 'savings' on its so-called 'wall of receipts.' The scale of its errors — and the misunderstandings and poor quality control that appear to underlie them — has raised questions about the effort’s broader work, which has led to mass firings and cutbacks across the federal government. DOGE has also had to reverse its firings. On Tuesday, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Douglas A. Collins celebrated cuts to 875 contracts that he claimed would save nearly $2 billion. But when veterans learned that those contracts covered medical services, recruited doctors, and funded cancer programs as well as burial services for veterans, the outcry was so loud that on Wednesday the VA rescinded the ordered cuts. After hundreds of nuclear weapons workers were abruptly fired, the Trump administration is scrambling to rehire them. After hundreds of scientists at the Food and Drug Administration were fired, they’re being asked to return. On Wednesday, Musk acknowledged that DOGE 'accidentally canceled' efforts by the U.S. Agency for International Development to prevent the spread of Ebola. But Musk insisted the initiative was quickly restored. Wrong. Current and former USAID officials say Ebola prevention efforts have been largely halted since Musk and his DOGE allies moved last month to gut the global-assistance agency and freeze its outgoing payments. The teams and contractors that would be deployed to fight an Ebola outbreak have been dismantled, they added. DOGE staff are resigning. On Tuesday, 21 federal civil service tech workers resignedfrom DOGE, writing in a joint resignation letter that they were quitting rather than help Musk 'dismantle critical public services.' The staffers all worked for what was known as the U.S. Digital Service before it was absorbed by DOGE. Their ranks include data scientists, product managers, and engineers. According to the Associated Press, 'all previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service.' Finally, Musk’s conflicts of interest are bursting into the open, and it isn’t a pretty sight. The FAA is close to canceling a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon to overhaul a communications system integral to its air traffic control system — and awarding the contract to Musk’s Starlink instead. Why? A team of employees from SpaceX, Starlink’s parent company, has been working inside the FAA in recent days. And Musk himself has been criticizing Verizon’s platform on his social media company, X. Senior FAA officials have refused to sign paperwork authorizing the switch to Starlink, so Musk’s team is now seeking help to secure the deal from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau. Could Musk’s financial motive be any clearer? 3. Tesla is in deep sh*t. Americans outraged by Musk’s outsized role in the Trump regime are targeting Musk’s Tesla. Many Tesla owners are feeling buyer’s remorse — their cars are vandalized or they become publicly shamed by strangers upset with the car company’s CEO. Others are putting anti-Musk bumper stickers on their cars. A video from musician Sheryl Crow that received over 20 million views on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook features the singer waving goodbye to her Tesla Model S, as Andrea Bocelli’s 'Time to Say Goodbye' plays in the background. 'There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with,' Crow wrote in the caption. 'So long Tesla.' Last weekend, thousands demonstrated outside of Tesla dealerships from Philadelphia to Seattle to register their outrage with Musk’s political power. The #TeslaTakedown campaign page on Action Network has listed 46 upcoming events at Tesla dealerships and charging stations around the country over the next week. Another organizing platform, Mobilize, includes another 32 events. Union pension funds are getting involved. Randi Weingarten, president of the giant American Federation of Teachers, has called on the CEOs of the nation’s six largest asset management firms to review Tesla’s current valuation. 'This is about safeguarding workers’ retirements,' she said in a statement. 'Just this week we saw Tesla stock continue to sink faster than a Cybertruck in quicksand as European sales fell off a cliff. So, we knew we needed to act.' 4. The oligarchy has never been more exposed. An important aspect of the era we’re in is that a record share of the nation’s wealth is in the hands of a small group of people who are now revealing themselves to be remarkably selfish, shameless, and insensitive to the needs of America. This is a further reason for modest optimism because as the oligarchy exposes itself for what it is, the dangers it poses to average people become more apparent — and the odds increase of a fierce public backlash to it. On Wednesday, at the same time Elon Musk (the world’s richest person) was lecturing Trump’s Cabinet about the importance of decimating the federal workforce, Jeff Bezos (America’s second-richest) was telling staffers at The Washington Post that henceforth the Post’s opinions would focus on defending 'personal liberties and free markets' and opposing viewpoints would not be published. The Post’s opinion editor, David Shipley, promptly resigned, as he should. When oligarchs talk of 'personal liberties and free markets' they mean their own liberties to become even richer and more powerful, as the rest of America slides into worsening economic insecurity and fear. When the oligarchs speak of 'freedom,' what they actually seek is freedom from accountability. All this is becoming more apparent than ever. 5. People are rising against corporate power. For all these reasons, a backlash is beginning. Popular rage that this country is now run by an oligarchy, a small group of billionaires and corporate elites, is surging. Today’s 'economic blackout' has enlisted millions of Americans who have stopped buying and thereby demonstrated our power. Meanwhile, protests are breaking out against big predatory corporations. On the eastern shore of Maryland, a bright red Republican area, 20,000 have signed a petition demanding an investigation of Delmarva Power, a subsidiary of utility giant Exelon, for overcharging them. That’s almost 5 percent of Delmarva’s entire customer base. The same anger is mounting in New York City at Con Edison. And in St. Joseph, Missouri, at Evergy. When House Republicans were in their home districts last week, they were deluged with angry questions about corporate power, Elon Musk, and big money. A few Senate Republicans even explained to their constituents that they voted to confirm Robert Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services because he’s 'hated' by Big Pharma. Meanwhile, Bernie is back. While not running for president again, 83-year-old Bernie Sanders this week launched his 'National Tour to Fight Oligarchy' — to overflow crowds in deep-red Nebraska and Iowa. Bernie is showing that even in red America, opposition to oligarchy and Trump is becoming the dominant view of a large swath of the public. Record-breaking crowds are also appearing for other notable progressives. A record-sized group showed up to Representative Jim McGovern’s town hall. The same thing happened in Massachusetts with Senator Elizabeth Warren. 6. As Trump and Musk trade Social Security and Medicaid for big tax cuts for the rich, Americans will go ballistic. The budget plan passed by the House this week — at Trump’s urging — gives billionaire oligarchs and giant corporations the lion’s share of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. To offset the $4.5 trillion, the plan includes severe spending cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and Social Security. Seventy-two million Americans rely on Medicaid, half of them children. Forty-two million Americans receive food stamps — many who aren’t paid enough to put food on the table. Federal workers at the Social Security Administration learned Wednesday that a plan was already underway to cut 50 percent of staff, as well as 1,200 field office locations. The move is likely to affect tens of thousands of employees across the country and millions who rely on the agency for monthly checks that keep them afloat. Such deep cuts to SSA, already at historically low staffing, will cause significant degradation of services, very likely including checks missed and individuals dying before their claims can be processed. Why do I include this outrage in my list of reasons for modest optimism? Because if nothing else awakens the slumbering giant of the American people, the Trump-Musk attacks on Medicaid and Social Security to pay for another giant tax cut for the rich will. Polls show unequivocally that Americans across party lines reject tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich. In fact, more than two-thirds — 67 percent — of Americans support higher taxes on billionaires. 7. Democracies are joining together, minus Trump’s America. Since it’s become clear that America has begun allying itself with Russia, the movement of the world’s other major democracies to join forces has been gaining momentum. On February 17, eight European leaders and the heads of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union met. On Wednesday, France’s Emmanuel Macron spoke with the leaders of 19 countries, including Canada, either in person or over videoconferencing. Leaders from Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and Sweden also joined the conversation. Britain’s PM Keir Starmer is shifting the center of UK foreign policy from the United States to Europe. All of this bodes well for a united front of democracies against authoritarian dictatorships — even though, tragically, Trump’s America is on the wrong side. 8. Negative economic consequences of the Trump-Musk blunderbuss are beginning to appear. The economy is starting to show signs of strain as the Trump-Musk moves to shrink federal spending, lay off government workers, and impose tariffs on America’s largest trading partners shake businesses and ricochet across states and cities. Trump’s moves to halt foreign aid and freeze some federal funding have already taken a toll on domestic farmers who export billions of dollars of products as part of American foreign aid programs. Billions of dollars of climate and infrastructure investments that were underway during the Biden administration are now in limbo. Apollo Global Management, an investment firm, estimates that DOGE job cuts could rise to 300,000. When government contractors are included, total layoffs could be closer to 1 million. Economic indicators are showing signs of mounting stress, with much of the anxiety focused on Trump’s tariffs. On Thursday, he said tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on March 4 and he would impose an additional 10 percent tariff on China. A survey of consumer sentiment published by the Conference Board on Tuesday recorded its largest monthly decline in confidence since 2021 in February. The drop was attributed to growing pessimism about employment prospects and future business conditions, with concerns about trade and tariffs reaching levels last seen during the 2019 trade wars in Mr. Trump’s first term. This week’s University of Michigan survey of American consumers shows that they expect prices will rise at a 3.5 percent yearly rate over the next decade — the highestrate of consumers’ inflation fears since 1995. A measure of corporate activity from S&P Global published last week showed business expansion slowing in the United States in February as a result of 'uncertainty and instability surrounding new government policies' such as federal spending cuts and tariff-related developments. The National Association of Homebuilders said in its latest report that builder confidence had fallen to a five-month low because of concerns about tariffs, elevated mortgage rates, and high housing costs. Morgan Stanley economists estimate that tariffs will raise inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, by as much as 0.6 percentage points and depress real consumer spending by as much as 2 percentage points. The overall hit to inflation-adjusted economic growth could be as high as 1.1 percentage points. I include these gloomy economic statistics as a modest reason for optimism because they, too, signal the looming end of public support for Musk and Trump. 9. Elections are looking brighter. Add up all of this and elections are looking brighter — and we don’t have to wait until 2026. This is a major election year. If you count all the seats up for election this year at the local, state, and federal levels, there are 100,000 seats open across 45 states. Governors, mayors, city councils, state representatives, judges, school boards — these positions up and down the entire ballot in 2025 — are a vital line of defense against the Trump-Vance-Musk regime. Wisconsin voters will fill the deciding seat on their state’s Supreme Court. This election will have huge implications for the labor rights and voting rights of everyday Wisconsinites. Musk is filling the coffers of the Republican candidate right now, but Wisconsinites won’t let Musk’s big money determine their future. If you live in New York City and don’t like the Trump administration meddling in the federal corruption charges against current Mayor Eric Adams, you have the power to choose a new mayor. The great states of New Jersey and Virginia will elect their next governors — and control of their state houses. On the federal level, Florida will hold two special elections for the U.S. House of Representatives, and New York will hold another later this year. These could affect the balance of power in the House. The sea change is already beginning. On Wednesday, Democrat Eugene Vindman won his House race against the Republican and former army Green Beret Derrick Anderson in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District — a key victory for Democrats as they seek to regain a majority in the lower chamber. In his first term, Trump fired Vindman and his brother, Alexander, who both held senior roles on Trump’s National Security Council, after they raised concerns about Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter. As a member of Congress, Vindman will now help fellow Democratic lawmakers serve as a check on the power of Trump. 10. Adding it all up. Connect the dots: Trump’s ratings continue to plummet. Musk’s DOGE is off the rails and becoming a late-night joke. Consumers are taking out their anger on Tesla. America’s oligarchs are openly defiant and behaving shamelessly. Bernie and other progressive voices are attracting record-breaking crowds. Trump and Musk are attacking Medicaid and Social Security to pay for a giant tax cut for the wealthy. The world’s leading democracies are joining together against dictatorial regimes, including Trump’s America. Economic indicators are trending downward. And elections look brighter. What does this add up to? America is waking up, and it doesn’t like what it’s seeing in Trump and Musk. I don’t want to sound overly optimistic. We have a huge amount of work to do. My purpose in giving you these additional reasons for modest optimism is for you to have a sense of possibility. All is not lost. We are not doomed. The Trump-Vance-Musk regime is filled with incompetence and riddled with treachery. If all of us maintain our courage and resolve, and do what’s necessary, we will prevail.

Trump Gives Zelenskyy Bum’s Rush And Flushes The European Ploy To...	After his mauling from President Trump live on TV and then being booted out of the White House, Ukraine’s Zelensky immediately phoned European leaders. That reaction shows that the Ukrainian actor-turned-president had flown to Washington from Kiev not to merely sign a supposed minerals deal with the U.S., but to inveigle Trump into a trap to escalate the proxy war in Ukraine against Russia. No doubt there is consternation and alarm among the Europeans that their agenda for prolonging the war against Russia is in disarray. Worst still, a furious Trump may now cut Ukraine loose and leave it completely at the mercy of Russia. European leaders are huddling in London on Sunday for an emergency meeting convened by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Zelensky is to attend and be showered with European expressions of support and billions more of taxpayer money. Incredibly, they still champion the impudent conman as a 'Churchillian hero'. The fallout in the Oval Office on Friday was a sordid spectacle. Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, tore into Zelensky under the full glare of TV cameras for daring to make more demands for U.S. security guarantees as part of a deal giving American companies access to Ukraine’s alleged mineral wealth, including oil, gas and rare earth metals. The meeting started cordially, but Trump refrained from giving specific 'security guarantees' to Ukraine. Zelensky’s sniveling insistence on getting explicit U.S. commitments for military support following any peace deal with Russia triggered Trump and his officials to rebuke the Ukrainian leader for wrangling in public and not being respectful. After their fireside fireworks, an incensed Trump gave Zelensky the bum’s rush. No minerals deal was signed and Zelensky left Washington empty handed. That’s not the end of it either. Trump later told reporters that Zelensky is not welcome back until he is ready to make the peace with Russia. Trump was astute to the attempted rumble. He told reporters on the White House lawn following the slap-down of Zelensky: 'We want peace. We’re not looking for somebody to sign up a strong power and then not make a peace deal because they feel emboldened. That’s what I saw happening. He wants to fight, fight, fight. I am not looking to get into anything protracted.' Zelensky’s immediate phone calls to French President Emmanuel Macron and the NATO chief Mark Rutte after the White House fiasco is the big reveal here. Days before Zelensky’s visit to the White House on Friday, European leaders had lobbied Trump for U.S. security guarantees as part of any peace deal with Russia. Macron met Trump on Monday. On Thursday, it was Starmer’s turn to ingratiate with Trump. The EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas was also in Washington. Significantly, her meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was abruptly called off 'due to scheduling issues.' The main objective for Macron and Starmer was to extract a commitment from Trump for a military 'backstop' in Ukraine to beef up their proposal to deploy French and British troops under the guise of 'peacekeepers'. The British wanted American 'air cover' for their troops, according to the BBC. Both Macron and Starmer were palmed away with vague nothings despite the bonhomie and compliments, and a British sweetener from King Charles to invite Trump on a royal visit. Trump’s diplomatic overture to Russian President Vladimir Putin, beginning with a phone call on February 12 followed by a high-level meeting of U.S. and Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia on February 18, has sent shockwaves across the European NATO members. They feel aggrieved that Trump is going to make a peace deal with Putin without them. The Europeans are still beholden to the propaganda narrative of the previous Biden administration about 'defending democracy and sovereignty in Ukraine from Russian aggression.' Trump wants out of the extravagant mess in Ukraine. He recognizes that the conflict was always a proxy war with an ulterior agenda to defeat Russia. Hundreds of billions of dollars and euros have been wasted fueling a futile proxy war that, as it turns out, Russia is decisively winning. Marco Rubio, the U.S. top diplomat, disclosed in an interview to CNN after the Oval Office spat, that a European foreign minister had told him that 'their plan' was to keep the war in Ukraine going for another year in the hope that it would eventually 'weaken Russia' and make Moscow 'beg for peace.' The callousness of the Europeans and their Russophobic obsession are grotesque. The three-year conflict in Ukraine has cost up to one million military deaths, millions of refugees across Europe, and broken economies, not to mention the danger of it turning into World War Three. Sneakily, the Europeans are covering their desire for continuing the proxy war with a belated apparent concern for making peace and backing Trump’s diplomacy. Macron and Starmer ostensibly commend Trump (after initially being in a flap over this call with Putin) and they talk about 'finding a path to a lasting peace.' However, their seeming offer of deploying French and British soldiers as 'peacekeepers' is a Trojan Horse that has nothing to do with keeping the peace. For its part, Moscow has categorically stated that any NATO troops in Ukraine will not be acceptable and will be attacked as combatants. That is why Macron, Starmer and other European leaders were so insistent on trying to get Trump to give 'security guarantees'. The so-called American military 'backstop' would be a way to escalate the proxy war against Russia. Zelensky was in Washington on a mission to beguile Trump into giving a security guarantee while dangling the bait of a lucrative minerals deal. It was reported that the Trump White House wanted to cancel the meeting for Friday before Zelensky departed from Ukraine on Thursday. But Macron intervened and implored Trump to go ahead with the reception. Zelensky, having got used to being indulged with endless blank checks, thought he could wheedle more out of Trump than just a mining deal. He was expected to extract the direct U.S. military involvement that the European Russophobic leaders want. In that way, the proxy war would escalate and those riding the war-racket gravy train would continue to extort the world’s biggest security crisis. Fortunately, Trump gave Zelensky the bum’s rush and flushed out the European ploy. The irony is that Trump had earlier in the week lavished praise on Macron and Starmer, exalting France for being America’s 'oldest ally' and Britain for its 'special relationship'. Trump might want to radically revise those cliched notions.

‘Right-Wing’ Agenda: The Last Hope For The European Economy – OpE...	The right-wing agenda seems to have finally taken hold in Europe, which can't help but offer a fragile hope of economic recovery after decades of left-wing populist destruction. A new model of economic policy aimed at dismantling the 'welfare state' with its bloated spending, enormous taxes, countless bureaucracies, and unbearable burden of regulating everything and everyone will be - should be - the main goal of the new governments in the major European powers. Not long ago, I saw a great meme in which a cartoon was signed on behalf of a European bureaucrat: 'If you're an entrepreneur and you want to invent, invest and scale something, don't play catch-up with us, because you've already lost - we've already regulated and redistributed everything before you've invented, invested or scaled anything... What is the welfare state in Europe built on? First of all, on cheap natural resources and production from developing countries such as Russia, China and South-East Asia. When global economic diversification became possible, the next problem arose. Once you remove physical production from your country, which maximizes economic growth and wealth creation, and start growing through consumer leverage, services, subsidized technology, government planned redistribution, exorbitant taxes, stifling regulation, huge social subsidies, fan subsidies, and other unproductive expenditures, you are bound to run the risks of inflation, weak currencies, and global political instability that loosen your supposed 'universal' economy. It must always be remembered that the growth of unsecured credit and government spending is the path to collapse: political, economic, socio-cultural. The welfare of people in a country cannot be universal. Equality is a biological absurdity and anthropological dystopia, which in 100 percent of cases leads to withering or catastrophe. This does not mean that there is no need to maximize the welfare of as many people as possible. But that maximization should be based on promoting productivity, not on credit subsidies from the government. The government has simply taken that money from other, more productive and entrepreneurial citizens through regulations and taxes and given it to the 'notionally poor', nurturing social dependency rather than reducing transaction costs and tax burdens. This is exactly what we have in Europe today, from the huge migration problem to the problems of aging and entrepreneurial depression. 'Take everything and divide it' - these are the words of the hero of the story by the Russian classic of literature Mikhail Bulgakov, who wrote about post-revolutionary life in Russia in the early 20th century. These words can be used as the motto of the left-liberal European establishment, which has been in power for the last 20 years. With the development of left-social populism, a policy of false inclusiveness has been imposed in Europe for many years, in reality expressed in unbridled public spending and subsidies to migrants, dependents and minorities of all kinds. Europe has simply forgotten what it means to create wealth through real capitalist competition, free markets, productive efficiency and horizontal exchange. Instead of creating wealth and cultivating human well-being through the growth of private production and the stimulation of business and labor, European authorities have chosen to focus on a refined strategy of the 'sedentary bandit': a policy of confiscation, seizure, and redistribution from the most enterprising and productive - hence rich and wealth-creating - to the less enterprising and productive, hence poor, who do not add value and create a meaningful economic multiplier. The right of the 'strong' has been replaced by the right of the 'weak'. But it is this vicious new paradigm that allows Palestinians from Gaza to slaughter Jews by the hundreds at night, it is this paradigm that allows Europe to bend under the oppression of migrants from disadvantaged regions, it is the right of the weak that allows minorities of all kinds to actually engage in reverse discrimination, it is the right of the weak that imposes quotas on minorities in corporate management, it is the right of the weak that gives birth to hypertrophied social benefits and a whole social class living on subsidies, As a result, we witnessed a tremendous deindustrialization in the Western world, particularly in Europe, the disintegration of the manufacturing sector and its transfer to third countries. But what was the replacement? That's right - bingo! - inflated consumer credit (take out a loan and buy a third TV even if you are a beggar on subsidies, because you have a guaranteed income from the state!), high taxes on surviving businesses, bureaucratic regulatory restrictions and exorbitant growth in government spending. No sane person would ever invest in such a crazy business model, such a lame duck. This is actually confirmed by the investment activity in European economies - it is at a very low level. This economic model is upside down. It focuses on social spending, willfully ignoring the fact that social welfare is a consequence of productivity growth, which is only possible if there are appropriate incentives for business, capital and entrepreneurship. It is business - free, willing and able to maximize profits - that is the source of wealth. If the state - political power and bureaucracy - stifles business, but at the same time increases consumer credit leverage and social subsidies that are not backed by productivity - the name is political populism and elementary cheating, and I would say political crime. This is real dark Marxism. This is exactly what the European authorities have been doing for the last two decades. 'We badly need a more loyal and business-friendly policy,' said Klaus Geissdoerfer. Mr. Geissdoerfer is CEO of EBM-Papst, one of the world's largest industrial fan manufacturers from Germany and leader in its industry. Golden words! Let's restate them with the same meaning: we need less bureaucracy, less taxes, less government spending, less corruption, less government. We need a cheap but efficient state. We need a referee, not a player as referee! Geissdoerfer has repeatedly submitted various petitions to the government and self-regulatory organizations, Other representatives of his industry and the German engineering industry as a whole have supported him. The essence of these petitions is that hypertrophied bureaucracy in Germany hinders the development not only of old big business, but first of all venture projects, start-ups, young entrepreneurs and innovation in general. This seriously hinders the development and penetration of technology. This state of affairs is a natural consequence of the economic policies of the notorious 'welfare state', where the bureaucracy and rent-seeking political entrepreneurs run up deficits by sucking up the budget and making huge social expenditures through exorbitant taxes and a growing mandate to redistribute wealth. They will never want to give it up voluntarily, they will try to neatly change the institutions and social contract 'appendices' to suit themselves. Well then, we shouldn't be surprised by Javier Millay with his chainsaw to destroy 'big government', Trump with his 'hell's angel' for the American bureaucracy in the person of Ilon Musk, the rightward lurch in Europe with the increasing popularity of right-wing parties: the pendulum has swung the other way, thank God. EBM-Papst earns $2.6 billion a year, but management says the company is 'suffering in Germany' as its domestic revenue has been steadily falling due to exorbitant taxes and regulatory burdens. Specifically, last year's drop was 4.1%. 'We have a lot of talented people and we have good companies in Germany, but we don't have the opportunity to develop intensively and on a large scale because of the government's policies, because the government just sucks all the juice out of the business,' Geissdoerfer states. Here's a blatant example of the inefficiency of European bureaucracy. Reducing energy consumption to combat climate change under the 2023 law requires employees of German companies, somehow involved in industrial sectors, to make similar reports on what the company is doing to comply with the new law. Welcome to ESG and the Green Agenda, one of the greatest scams of the left-populist political establishment, cloaked in socialist welfare slogans in their quest to maintain and expand control of the budget as a source of personal rent. 'Now, instead of actually caring about the environment, our employees are forced to fill out paperwork and report every day, dealing with documentation instead of producing energy-saving equipment,' says Geissdoerfer, noting the significant drop in KPIs and business performance due to the burden of reporting to regulators. What is the investment attractiveness of such a business? Let's turn to another case study. The Mecanindus-Vogelsang Group, a steel company that produces precision parts for mechanical engineering, particularly for the automotive industry, pays twice as much per kilowatt-hour for energy in Germany as it does at its facilities in the United States - New Jersey, Maine-Sterling and Kentucky. The company's CEO, Mr. Ulrich Flatke, states that this is a huge 'competitive setback' for businesses in Europe and a reduction in productivity, which naturally affects the welfare of European workers. The reasons for this are obvious. These are all consequences of left-Keynesian German government policies that have led to Germany's heavy reliance on cheap energy from Russia and cheap manufacturing outsourcing to China. When China and Russia grew into cyclopean autocracies, German business was in dire straits. The German economy is in a dramatic recession, contracting for two years in a steady recessive vector. At the end of 2024, it grew by just 0.3% compared to pre-pandemic 2019. Over the same period, the US economy grew by 11.4% and China grew by 25.8%. One after another, German industrial giants are laying off staff, cutting production, capex and investment programs in an attempt to shift capacity to more business-friendly regions. Mr. Geissdoerfer notes that the investment focus of EBM Papst, headquartered in Mulfingen, has now shifted to other markets - South Asia and the United States - where the company is relocating production, particularly in Connecticut and Tennessee. In addition to the incomparably smaller government - bureaucratic, regulatory and tax - overhang, which promises to get even smaller with the Republican Party in power, the company is protecting itself from import duties that President Trump's administration promises to impose. 'To avoid a complete collapse of the economy and social policy from de-industrialization, we need competitive energy prices and lower taxes,' says Mr. Flatke of the Mecanindus-Vogelsang Group. But for this to happen, we need to reject the populist-left agenda and turn to realpolitik and pragmatism in pursuing our own national interests. I would call this 'country individualism', in the manner of libertarian individualist attitudes. According to Marcel Fratscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, a deep pessimism dominates the investment climate among companies and citizens. No one is investing, no one is inventing, the venture capital and technology startup industries are in a depressed passive state. Public spending, which is a resource for enriching the European deep-state - the bureaucracy and the left-populist establishment - is reaching exorbitant levels, all of which is funding already struggling businesses. In order to make up for the potential loss of personal income due to stagnant business, European governments are increasing government spending and credit leverage that is not backed by productivity. This is a real crime, as it is the generation of tomorrow that will pay the price if this Keynesian-socialist bacchanalia is not stopped urgently today. Eurostat claims that social security payments amount to between 200% and 400% of GDP in European economies. Unfunded government spending is simply enormous and this naturally forms a gigantic inflationary overhang that simply makes citizens poorer by the day. Let's take a look at France, another flagship of the European economy. Giant social and other unproductive spending as dominant economic policies have caused a significant slowdown in economic growth over the past 10 years, generated high budget deficits, and increased social tensions. Hyper-loyal migration policies have only exacerbated these externalities, leading to taxpayer fatigue and creating a subsidy-dependent social group of dependents and potential extremists. We must remember very simple political economy rules. Any increase in government spending is done in the name of national security or social welfare. Spending is done in the here and now, which means more debt and deficits. To balance the budget and avoid default, the government raises taxes and regulatory restrictions to expropriate money from successful economic actors, As the economy grows at the expense of struggling businesses, government spending grows, but the problem is that when the economy starts to tank, spending grows even more, because the government needs to offset potential social discontent. As a result, the budget deficit and debt grows even faster, which means taxes grow, because it is business and the productive part of the population that has to pay for this bureaucratic leftist madness. The words of the French President Mr. Macron that the credit overhang in Europe is insufficient and it can be expanded to boost economic growth are perplexing, This can be directly called untrue if we evaluate all the unsecured liabilities of the EU countries. But these are natural and legitimate words of a political rent-seeking entrepreneur whose main resource for enrichment is the budget and access to redistribution of national wealth, where opportunities for corruption appear, and who is ready to increase the unsecured credit overhang to any size. And after us, a flood - that is the meaning of Mr. Macron's words. But all bacchanalia comes to an end. To slightly paraphrase Friedrich von Hayek, the party of unbridled budget sucking and unsecured borrowing will end, then the morning will come, and with it a brutal hangover, and then we will have to endure a long, long time to get back to normal. That most notorious 'welfare state' in Europe was financed by business and enterprising taxpayers. It was at their expense that the political establishment was able to boast proudly that a fair welfare society was supposedly built in Europe. But now, in times of global Hyper Shift - the erosion of socio-political and economic processes around the world - we can see what in reality was hiding behind the screen of European stability: bureaucratic hegemony, the budget rents of the political establishment and irresponsible conformist international policies. The burgeoning right-wing agenda and the crisis of the European left 'deep state' should put an end to this decline and put Europe back on the path to prosperity and true freedom of citizens from Leviathan. At least, judging by the electoral mood, there is now hope for that.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr5oDu3lKMwSE	2025-03-01T17:26:28-08:00	
Norway Rethinks €1.7 Trillion Sovereign Fund To Boost Support For...	By Jacob Wulff Wold (EurActiv) -- Norway is considering tapping its sovereign wealth fund to dramatically increase its support for Ukraine amid signs that US military backing is waning. Europe is in crisis mode after a bitter clash between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House, and the Trump administration is reportedly considering cutting off all military supplies to Ukraine. Norway is sitting on €1.7 trillion in the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, including an estimated €109 billion in war-related profits from increased gas prices in 2022 and 2023. The Nordic country has so far spent €3.35 billion on support to Ukraine - an amount described on Thursday as 'pathetic' and 'reprehensible' by the editors of major Swedish and Danish newspapers, whose countries, according to the same data, have contributed €5.41 billion and €8.05 billion respectively. 'Norway is one of the few countries that has large amounts of money readily available, and we must therefore multiply our support for Ukraine immediately,' Liberal Party leader Guri Melby said on Saturday. Norway's support should be increased 'significantly' and 'fast', Norway's former Conservative prime minister, Erna Solberg, said in a statement. 'The government can safely assume there is will in Parliament to give more,' she added. The Liberal Party and the Socialist Left Party called for an emergency parliamentary session, but Euractiv understands they are now waiting for the government's proposal instead. Norway should spend 3% of GDP on defence, currently at around 2%, by 2030, Sylvi Listhaug, leader of the conservative Progress Party, Norway's second-largest in recent polls, said today. The leader of the Greens, who are currently polling at 2.7%, reiterated their proposal that Norway should pledge €85.5 billion to Ukraine. 'We will present a proposal to increase Ukraine support for parliament soon,' said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, who will also attend tomorrow's meeting of European leaders in London. Time to tap the bank? Since 2001, Norway has carefully followed a budgetary rule of spending no more than 4% and then 3% of its sovereign wealth fund each year. The rule was introduced by Jens Stoltenberg's first cabinet with broad cross-party support. Known as a former NATO secretary general, Stoltenberg is now Norway's finance minister, just as the rule comes under scrutiny. The idea of using the fund more actively to support Ukraine and European defence spending is gaining ground in Norway. One idea is to convert some €300 billion of the fund's €450 billion in liquid bonds into European defence bonds, on the condition that the money is used exclusively to build Europe's defence. On Friday, Solberg said Norway must increase its use of 'oil money' to improve the country's defence. High-ranking members of her party previously called for stricter rules on how the money can be spent. 'Peace is more important than shortsightedness and inflation,' she said. But Stoltenberg warned against tampering with the budget rule. 'It is a dangerous idea to break the budgetary rule to give more money to Ukraine,' he said on 7 February. Numbers? Even without breaking the rule, Norway has deep pockets. 'We currently have a proposal in the Storting to increase support by 100 billion Norwegian kroner this year,' Sveinung Rotevatn, deputy chair and responsible for financial policy in the Liberal Party, told Euractiv. For 2025, this would increase support for Ukraine from €3 billion to €11.5 billion. Norway's Foreign Ministry declined to comment further on how much it wants to increase aid, referring instead to Støre's statement. 'It has become unequivocally clear that all of Europe must shift gears in our support and policy towards Ukraine and to ensure security in Europe,' said Rotevatn. 'All other policies we pursue assume that we are a free and independent country and that we have a functioning international world order,' said Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr_6XzDSqmF9W	2025-03-01T17:24:33-08:00	
Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy Meets With UK Prime Minister Starme...	Ukraine's Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelenskyy began his working visit to the United Kingdom with a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. 'I want to thank you and the people of the United Kingdom for the tremendous support you have provided since the very beginning of this war. In Ukraine, we are very happy to have such strategic partners,' the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expressed gratitude for the organization of the upcoming meeting of European leaders in London, scheduled for Sunday. The future of Europe and transatlantic unity is being shaped right now. Russia’s war in Ukraine, the direct threats to all of Europe, and the search for pathways to peace are the key topics of today’s bilateral talks as well as tomorrow’s broader meeting with partners. The Ukrainian President and the British Prime Minister also shared details of their recent visits to the United States. The leaders held extensive discussions on coordination with partners, the implementation of a joint action plan, and concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine’s position and bring the war to an end with a lasting and just peace. A peace that will not allow Russia to use the ceasefire to rearm and attack again. That is why Ukraine, Europe, and the United States must be at the table for any potential peace negotiations. A separate focus was placed on robust security guarantees and the role the United Kingdom is ready to play in them. The leaders reaffirmed a shared vision of what confidence in the future should look like for all. Keir Starmer reiterated that the United Kingdom will stand with Ukraine for as long as necessary. He emphasized that this was the reason why so many people in London took to the streets today to express their support in this way. 'They came out to demonstrate just how strongly they support you, how strongly they support Ukraine. And also our unwavering determination to stand with you and achieve what we both seek – a lasting peace for Ukraine, built on sovereignty and security for Ukraine. This is crucial for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the United Kingdom,' the British Prime Minister said. Additionally, in the presence of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Keir Starmer, Ukraine’s Minister of Finance Sergii Marchenko (online) and UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves signed a loan agreement between Ukraine as the borrower and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the lender. In October last year, the EU and G7 countries jointly decided to provide loans totaling up to €45 billion to support Ukraine’s urgent budgetary, military, and reconstruction needs. The United Kingdom plans to contribute up to £2.258 billion, which can be used for purchasing defense materials for Ukraine. The loan is provided for a period of 30 years and will be repaid using revenues generated from frozen Russian assets.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr14NbGCTJmfg	2025-03-01T17:18:10-08:00	
Mending Of Damaged Georgian-EU Relations Meets Mutual Interests –...	Relations between the EU and Georgia continue to deteriorate. The parties actually admit that the relationship has fallen to its lowest point, and blame each other. The Baltic states have even imposed sanctions and visa bans on Georgia’s top officials. Although, the leadership of Georgia refrains to respond with mirror measures. Georgia’s ruling party, Georgian Dream (GD), which has retained the power for a fourth term in the disputed by the West parliamentary election in 2024, accuses euro-bureaucracy for the deterioration of relations. GD argues that the EU circles are trying to drag Georgia into a conflict with Russia and prepare the ground for a change of power in the country. The concerns of Tbilisi in this respect are not groundless. Remaining one of the main irritants in relations between Georgia and the European Union (EU), the Russian factor is perceived in Tbilisi and Brussels somewhat differently. This difference represents a problem that is unlikely to be addressed under the conditions of the continuing war in Ukraine, and the global confrontation between the West and Russia. The EU’s discontent of GD policy within the country and in relations with Russia predetermined the most recent strict-worded resolution of the European Parliament about Georgia, and harsh resolution of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe(PACE) which encouraged the Georgian delegation to suspend work in PACE. Actually, these European bodies expressed the open non-recognition of the results of parliamentary and presidential elections in Georgia in 2024. These and other punitive measures by the EU, including suspending several programs of cooperation and funding, create a new and very serious barrier in relations, that naturally plays into Moscow’s hands. The EU organizations are concerned over GD's excessively cautious approach to Russia. This approach implies preference for a 'survival policy' over a 'value-based, and the line of a 'sovereign democracy' in relations with the western partners, which the DG has been pursuing in recent years. It is not surprising that Moscow openly supports this policy. In its efforts to regain influence in Georgia, Moscow has applied a range of hybrid warfare tools against Georgia. They range from confessional to economic factors. It seems that the West is not yet in a position to confront them with effective counter-measures, despite the millions spent for this purpose. A transparent audit of the effectiveness of these Western-sponsored programs whose recipients were Georgia’s pro-Western media and non-governmental organizations has probably not been carried out. It is enough to list at least a few factors of this hybrid war, to understand the degree of the threat. The Russian military presence in Georgia's secessionist regions - Abkhazia and South Ossetia, hovering like a sword of Damocles over the country, and Georgia's continuing and alarmingly high economic dependence on Russia. They are powerful leverages of Russian influence. According to various estimations, too many Georgian businesses are closely associated with the Russian market, generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue and the welfare of at least 700,000 Georgian households heavily depends on Georgia’s relations with Russia. This factor, inter alia, has a significant influence on the electoral behavior of Georgian citizens. During the 2024 parliamentary election, the GD's slogan 'War or Peace'[implying war with Russia] was more popular than the opposition's slogan 'Russia or Europe.' It would not be an exaggeration to say that the actual Georgian 'deep state' is divided into the conditionally 'pro-European' and 'pro-Russian' camps, despite the absence of diplomatic relations with Russia after the 2008 war, and Georgia’s official exit from all Russian-dominated post-Soviet structures. The abovementioned tools maintain Russia's permanent hold on Georgia, not to mention the backstage connections between the influential groups of both countries. The full picture of Russian influence in Georgia remains largely unexplored, despite numerous works on the issue. That said, the EU must consider a full set of factors and the peculiarities of the Georgian national context in its efforts to counter Russian influence and simultaneously mend its worsening relations with Georgia. Breaking the vicious circle in bilateral relations is in the best interest of both sides, if look at the rapidly changing geopolitical circumstances. The EU has a choice between a tough and pragmatic approach to its Georgia policy based on recent events in Georgia and GD actions. The perception of political processes in Georgia as 'half empty or half full' may lead to misreading the actual situation in the country. The demand for a new parliamentary election emanating from certain EU institutions, may not be the best solution, if reckon with a genuine situation in the country. A new election is not a demand of the majority of Georgian electors. Besides, the holding of a new election may lead to new and prolonged political turbulence. It’s easy to guess who will benefit. Furthermore, there is still no convincing proofs of massive fraud in the 2024 poll. The EU's strict stance towards Georgia, including various punitive measures, could urge GD to take protective measures, which may include increase of its multi-vectoral strategy at the cost of the pro-European path. The probability of breeding anti-European sentiments in a substantial portion of Georgian society with long-term consequences, should also be considered. Georgia's transit potential and unique niche in the geopolitical plan for EU enlargement also should not be written off. Georgia is an important link in the transit of energy carriers to Europe, after the closure of the routes through Russia, and also an important link in the mega-project 'Middle Corridor' in which the EU is going to become one of the investors. Georgia is also part of the EU’s promising projects to gradually pull it out of Russia’s clutches. All this requires at least political stability in the country. Thus, its expedient if in the nearest future the EU finally decide and publicly declare its unambiguous attitude regarding the recognition or non-recognition of the results of Georgia's parliamentary election 2024. The EU may be better off embarking on proactive engagement instead of punitive measures. This may include joint measures for searching ways to reduce Russian economic leverage in Georgia, how to make DCFTA more workable and EU financial injections into the industries, that are most dependent on Russia. A comprehensive analysis of effectiveness and efficiency of the EU-funded programs for fighting Russia's 'soft power' in Georgia is long overdue. The past frustration probably should not prevent the EU to reattempt its mediation to defuse a political conflict in Georgia, and not allow Russia to capitalize on it. Given the current complex geopolitical circumstances and high stakes, hardly it would be wise for the EU to stay in an 'autopilot mode' when it comes to its policy in Georgia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr24_aSKIgKZ2	2025-03-01T17:15:20-08:00	
Ho Hum At Sea: Anti-China Hysteria Down Under – OpEd	The conduct of live-fire exercises by the People’s Liberation Army Navy Surface Force (the Chinese 'communists', as they are called by the analytically strained) has recently caused much murmur and consternation in Australia. It’s the season for federal elections, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, thinks he’s in with more than a fighting chance. Whether that chance is deserved or not is another matter. The exercise, conducted in international waters by a cruiser, frigate and replenishment ship, involved what is said to have been poor notice given to Australian authorities on February 21. But the matter has rapidly burgeoned into something else: that what the Chinese task fleet did was mischievously remarkable, exceptional and snooty to convention and protocols. It is on that score that incontinent demagogy has taken hold. Media outlets have done little to soften the barbs. A report by ABC News, for instance, notes that Airservices Australia was 'only aware of the exercises 40 minutes after China’s navy opened a ‘window’ for live-fire exercises from 9.30am.' The first pickup of the exercises came from a Virgin Australia pilot, who had flown within 250 nautical miles of the operation zone and warned of the drills. Airservices Australia was immediately contacted, with the deputy CEO of the agency, Peter Curran, bemused about whether 'it was a potential hoax or real.' Defence Chief Admiral David Johnston told Senate estimates that he would have preferred more notice for the exercises – 24-48 hours was desirable – but it was clear that Coalition Senator and shadow home affairs minister James Paterson wanted more. Paterson had thought it 'remarkable that Australia was relying on civilian aircraft for early warning about military exercises by a formidable foreign task group in our region.' To a certain extent, the needlessly irate minister got what he wanted, with the badgered Admiral conceding that the Chinese navy’s conduct had been 'irresponsible' and 'disruptive'. Wu Qian, spokesperson for the China National Ministry for Defence, offered a different reading: 'During the period, China organised live-fire training of naval guns toward the sea on the basis of repeatedly issuing prior safety notices'. Its actions were 'in full compliance with international law and international practice, with no impact on aviation flight safety'. That said, 49 flights were diverted on February 21. Much was also made about what were the constituent elements of the fleet. As if it mattered one jot, the Defence Force chief was pressed on whether a Chinese nuclear-powered submarine had made up the task force. 'I don’t know whether there is a submarine with them, it is possible, task groups occasionally do deploy with submarines but not always,' came the reply. 'I can’t be definitive whether that’s the case.' The carnival of fear was very much in town, with opposition politicians keen to blow air into the balloon of the China threat across the press circuit. The shadow defence minister Andrew Hastie warned listeners on Sydney radio station 2GB of 'the biggest peacetime military buildup since 1945', Beijing’s projection of power with its blue-water navy, the conduct of two live-fire exercises and the Chinese taskforce operating within Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone off Tasmania. Apparently, all of this showed the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, to be 'weak' for daring to accept that the conduct complained of was legal under international law. 'Now that may be technically right, but that misses the deeper subtext, and that is China is now in our backyard, and they’ve demonstrated that we don’t have the will to insist on our national interest and mutual respect.' There are few voices of sensible restraint in Australia’s arid landscape of strategic thinking, but one could be found. Former principal warfare officer of the Royal Australian Navy, Jennifer Parker, commendably remarked that this hardly warranted the title of 'a crisis'. To regard it as such 'with over-the-top indignation diminishes our capacity to tackle real crises as the region deteriorates.' Australia might, at the very least, consider modernising a surface fleet that was 'the smallest and oldest we’ve had since 1950.' Allegations that Beijing should not be operating in Australia’s exclusive economic zone, let alone conduct live-fire exercises in international waters, served to give it 'a propaganda win to challenge our necessary deployments to North-East Asia and the South China Sea – routes that carry two-thirds of our maritime trade.' The cockeyed priorities of the Australian defence establishment lie elsewhere: fantasy, second hand US nuclear-powered submarines that may, or may never make their way to Australia; mushy hopes of a jointly designed nuclear powered submarine specific to the AUKUS pact that risks sinking off the design sheet; and the subordination of Australian land, naval and spatial assets to the United States imperium. Such is the standard of political debate that something as unremarkable as this latest sea incident has become a throbbing issue that supposedly shows the Albanese government as insufficiently belligerent. Yet there was no issue arising, other than a statement of presence by China’s growing navy, something it was perfectly entitled to do.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr4nDZ7Hbdbvs	2025-03-01T17:12:01-08:00	
Walking The Tightrope Of Faith In A World Adrift – OpEd	In the quiet moments of prayer, when the noise of the world fades and the heart turns inward, many of us confront the same haunting question: Is this worth it? The question lingers in the ache of lost friendships, the sting of mockery, and the weight of loneliness that settles like a shadow. To be a young Catholic today is to feel suspended between two worlds, neither of which seems to fully understand you. You are 'too much' for a culture that dismisses sacrifice as backwardness, yet 'not enough' for those who wear faith like a badge of superiority rather than a mantle of love. This is the tightrope we walk—a path that feels precarious, isolating, but also mysteriously sacred. For those of us clinging to the Church’s teachings on chastity, modesty, the sanctity of life, or the Real Presence, the world does not merely disagree with us; it often recoils. To embrace biblical femininity in an age that conflates liberation with rejection of tradition is to invite labels like 'brainwashed' or 'submissive.' To wear a veil at Mass, a silent act of reverence, becomes a spectacle in a world uncomfortable with visible piety. To speak of saving sex for marriage is met with incredulity, as if we have sworn off oxygen. The underlying message is clear: Your values are a threat. Yet the greater wound often comes from within. We watch as friends and family drift from the faith, their once-vibrant belief diluted by the currents of relativism. We encounter fellow Catholics who treat tradition like a buffet, cherry-picking teachings that suit their politics or lifestyle. Online forums dissect our every stance: Why do you veil? Is not that oppressive? Why take issue with cohabitation? Do you not know mercy? The subtext is a quiet accusation: You are making this harder for the rest of us. And so the tightrope narrows. We are torn between grieving those who leave and resisting the urge to shout, 'Come back — this is where life is!' Loneliness compounds these struggles. It is in the empty chair at Sunday Mass where a friend once sat. It is in the family gathering where your convictions are met with eye rolls. It is in the ache of scrolling through social media, bombarded by posts celebrating choices that unravel the very fabric of human dignity. The isolation is not just emotional; it is existential. To hold fast to the truth in a world that worships autonomy is to become a living sign of contradiction. And contradictions make people uneasy. But here, in the stillness, God whispers a reminder: This is not your home. The saints knew this. They walked the same tightrope, their lives a testament to the cost of discipleship. St Maria Goretti, a girl of twelve, chose death over sin. St Thomas More, a statesman, lost his head rather than betray his conscience. Maximilian Kolbe stepped forward to die in place of a stranger. They, too, were called extremists. They, too, were alone in their darkest hours. Yet their stories echo across centuries because they understood: The Cross is not a failure. It is the portal to resurrection. This is the paradox of our faith. The tighter we cling to Christ, the more the world resists us — but the more deeply we encounter Him. In the sacraments, He nourishes us. In the Eucharist, He becomes our sustenance. In confession, He lifts the weight we cannot carry. These are not abstract rituals; they are lifelines. When friends vanish, He remains. When the culture ridicules, He whispers, I endured this too. And we are not as alone as we feel. For every post ridiculing tradition, there are quiet rebellions of love unfolding elsewhere: A college student praying a rosary outside an abortion clinic. A young couple attending Natural Family Planning classes, undeterred by sneers. A teenager is setting up an altar in her dorm room. These stories rarely go viral, but they are written into the fabric of the church. We are part of a hidden communion — saints in the making, scattered like embers in the dark, each of us glowing faintly but collectively holding back the night. The world’s rejection, then, is not proof of our irrelevance but of our purpose. Jesus warned, 'If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world…the world hates you' (John 15:19). Our alienation is a badge of fidelity. Every time we choose the narrow road, we echo the martyrs. Every time we kneel to veil, we join the generations of women who embodied the Church as Bride. Every 'no' to sin is a 'yes' to the God who carved us from His own heart. This does not mean the tension disappears. The tension remains. We will still cry when a loved one leaves the church. We will still wince at the jokes. We will still wonder in weak moments if compromise might be easier. But ease is not the metric of a life well lived. The Cross was not easy. The Garden of Gethsemane was not easy. What sustains us is not the absence of struggle but the presence of meaning. When loneliness grips you, remember: You are part of a story larger than yourself. You are surrounded by a 'cloud of witnesses' (Hebrews 12:1) — saints, ancestors, and ordinary believers who refused to let the world dim their light. You are united to a global body, praying in languages you do not speak, in parishes you will never visit, yet bound by the same creed. Most of all, you are loved by a God who did not spare His own Son to claim you. So keep going. Stay close to the Eucharist, where Heaven touches Earth. Cling to the rosary, your armour against despair. Forgive those who do not understand. Love those who leave. Trust that every small 'yes' to Truth plants a seed — in others, in the culture, in your own soul. The road is hard, but it is not bleak. We walk it with the One who called Himself the Way. And at the end of this narrow path, a promise awaits: 'What no eye has seen, nor ear heard… God has prepared for those who love Him' (1 Corinthians 2:9). Heaven is your home. And every step you take — shaky, weary, but resolute — brings you closer.

The Unfinished Ceasefire: Why The Global Community Must Compel Is...	In international politics, ceasefires and peace agreements are delicate and fragile lines that can collapse with the slightest violation or neglect. These agreements not only signal a willingness to maintain peace but also serve as crucial safeguards against escalating conflicts and future wars. Within the complex crises of the Middle East, Israel—one of the persistent parties in these conflicts—has repeatedly demonstrated a disregard for these fragile boundaries. By continuously violating ceasefires and delaying troop withdrawals, Israel undermines the peace process, posing a significant threat to global efforts to establish stability in the region. Such repeated breaches escalate tensions and deepen crises. In this context, the international community cannot remain limited to verbal condemnations; it must take serious and decisive measures to ensure that Israel not only commits to ceasefires in words but also enforces them in practice. This is an opportunity for the global community to reaffirm that peace agreements must be upheld and that no one should be allowed to violate them without consequence. After prolonged mediation efforts, a ceasefire was finally established in Gaza and Lebanon. However, these ceasefires remain fragile and unstable. To transform them into lasting peace, all parties must fully respect and adhere to their commitments. Only through the faithful implementation of these agreements can a sustainable future of peace and stability in the region be envisioned. Otherwise, the ceasefire will remain ineffective, and the peace process will fail from the outset. A firm and enforceable ceasefire is the most critical prerequisite for ensuring stability and preventing further escalation. Israel has a long history of violating ceasefires and peace agreements in the Middle East. From the armistice agreements of the 1948 and 1967 wars to recent ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon, Israel has consistently ignored its commitments to withdrawing troops and honoring truce terms. For instance, after the 2006 Lebanon War, despite a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, Israeli forces repeatedly violated Lebanese airspace and conducted military incursions. A similar pattern has been observed in Gaza, where, despite ceasefires in 2009, 2012, and 2014, Israel continued bombing civilian areas and conducting military operations while claiming adherence to the agreements. These persistent violations have not only derailed the peace process but have also fueled mistrust and intensified conflicts. Today, the situation remains unchanged. In Gaza, despite international mediation and declared ceasefires, Israel continues to delay the withdrawal of its forces from occupied territories. In Lebanon, the Israeli military still breaches Lebanese airspace and postpones its troop withdrawals. Additionally, Israel has opened a new front of tensions in the West Bank through military assaults and expanding illegal settlements, blatantly violating past agreements and international resolutions. These actions reaffirm that ceasefire agreements can only be effective if all parties respect them. Otherwise, as history has shown, ceasefires and peace accords will continue to be violated. If Israel persists with this approach, the peace process will collapse, and existing crises will only deepen. The international community, particularly European and Arab nations, must take a firm and coordinated stance to ensure Israel adheres to its ceasefire commitments. History has shown that Israel’s repeated violations of ceasefires disrupt the peace process and escalate conflicts. No party can afford to remain indifferent. Regional powers, including key Arab and European nations, as well as the United States, must exert diplomatic and economic pressure on Israel to comply with its obligations. Only through a unified and resolute response can Israel be compelled to uphold ceasefires and withdraw from occupied territories. Without such international pressure, ceasefires will remain unstable, and regional peace will continue to be at risk. Ultimately, enforcing ceasefires is not solely the responsibility of the conflicting parties but also a fundamental duty of the global community and international observers. While the Palestinians have consistently upheld their commitments, it is now the responsibility of the global community to pressure Israel into genuine compliance, transforming ceasefires into lasting peace. Only by ensuring that Israel respects its ceasefire agreements can a full-scale crisis be averted and the path toward lasting peace be secured. This responsibility falls upon those who claim to lead the world in the pursuit of peace and security. 'This is the moment to move from words to action—because history never forgives missed opportunities.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcneZTPEoRvr5PXNBU0l5ht	2025-03-01T17:06:49-08:00	
UNICEF Rings Alarm Over Child Abuse Crisis In Pacific	By Sera Sefeti Pacific island children are experiencing 'alarming' violence and abuse, amongst the highest rates in the world, amid a lack of government-funded services, religious and cultural barriers and growing drug use. Seventeen nations meet this week with civil society groups and stakeholders in the Fijian capital Suva for the inaugural Children’s Wellbeing Summit, as reports of human rights abuses escalate. More than half the population of the Pacific islands region is under the age of 24 but a lack of accurate and comprehensive data was highlighted at the summit as an impediment to understanding the enormity of the situation. UNICEF Pacific’s representative Jonathan Veitch emphasised the severity of the crisis at the summit, co-hosted with the region’s Pacific Islands Forum inter-governmental body. 'The levels of violence, abuse, and neglect of Pacific children are among the highest in the world,' Vietch said. 'The statistics we have been discussing over the last few days are alarming.' 'Despite the beauty and richness of the Pacific region, our girls and boys face significant challenges that threaten their well-being,' he added, calling for greater regional collaboration and resource-sharing to strengthen child protection systems. 'It is not only the right thing to do but also the smart thing to do. The impact of child protection on a country’s economic and social development is significant.' UNICEF’s ‘When Numbers Demand Action’ report released last October estimated one-in-three, or 6 million, women in Oceania had experienced contact sexual violence before the age of 18. Papua New Guinea has the region’s largest population, with an estimated 12 million people. PNG’s National Office for Youth and Family Services acting director Jerry Wap echoed UNICEF’s alarm, citing government neglect of support services and law enforcement. 'Over the years, there has been a lot of violence against women, children, and young girls,' Wap told BenarNews. 'It’s unacceptable and goes against our culture and traditions.' 'PNG is a big country, but we only have 5,000 police officers. That is not enough to protect our people. On top of that, we have tribal warsand increasing alcohol and drug abuse,' he said, adding his office has only one protection officer in some provinces. Wap said the lack of reliable statistics was a major challenge in addressing the issue and data from government departments, churches and NGOs needed to be collated to get a 'true picture.' PNG conducted a Census last year, the results of which are highly anticipated after the last credible one was in 2001, but it has been criticized for failing to meet many basic international benchmarks. 'It is very important to have a national database,' he said. 'The government needs to invest in this area.' With a growing young population, the need for action and to place children at the heart of the Pacific’s regional priorities is seen as ever more urgent. Acting PIF Secretary-General Desna Solofa told the summit children should be central to the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. 'We must invest in their future by providing them with the opportunities, support, and safe environment they need so they reach their full potential,' she said. The United Nations Human Rights Council’s four-yearly review of summit host Fiji in January highlighted a litany of issues. A U.N. report found Fiji was failing to fully implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child, highlighted a 'prevalence' of child abuse and neglect, and recommended actions to end child marriage, prostitution and labor. One of the summit’s most striking presentations was by senior economist Simon Halvey, from consultancy Cornerstone, outlining the financial cost to Fiji. A Cornerstone report for UNICEF found violence against children in Fiji alone costs an estimated FJD459.8 million (US$198 million) annually, equivalent to 4.2% of the country’s GDP. Halvey said that prevention was not only a societal obligation but a financially sound investment. 'I was blown away by that presentation. It made me realize the economic benefits of investing in child welfare,' Kiribati’s Minister for Women Ruth Cross Kwansing told BenarNews. She acknowledged her nation has work to do, particularly in breaking the cycle of violence perpetuated by males. 'In Kiribati, we have a saying that translates to ‘our children are our hearts.’ Once our parents, especially fathers, start to understand the effects that abuse has on our children, they will realize the difference between tough love and discipline,' she said. The shortcomings of faith communities in providing safe spaces for children was also acknowledged by the Pacific Council of Churches. 'The power, trust, and responsibility of faith communities have been abused by some leaders,' said PCC general secretary James Bhagwan. 'There have been instances where we have failed. In fact, we have been responsible.' Bhagwan said the Convention on the Rights of the Child was important, but Western rights-based, legal frameworks can be difficult to navigate in the Pacific. 'It can be very technical and heavy on the head,' he said. 'A holistic approach means we like to use the head, the heart, and the hands; that means using human rights (the head), spiritual faith (the heart), and traditional culture, indigenous knowledge, and wisdom (the hands).'

Perspectives, Challenges Of Ukraine’s Next Election – Analysis	By Tatiana Vorozhko The issue of Ukraine’s next presidential election has emerged as a possible element in the peace deal between Russia and Ukraine that the United States is negotiating. Ukrainian leaders and elections experts argue, however, that holding elections anytime soon would endanger lives and Ukraine’s sovereignty. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected in April 2019, and the next presidential election was scheduled for March or April 2024. However, martial law has been in effect since Russia invaded the country in February 2022, and Ukrainian law prohibits presidential elections when martial law is in effect. U.S. President Donald Trump has lambasted Zelenskyy for not holding a presidential election. In a Feb. 19 post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said of Zelenskyy, 'He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden ‘like a fiddle.’ A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.' Some members of the U.S. Congress and conservative commentators echoed Trump’s demand that Ukraine hold elections to prove its democratic credentials. 'Zelenskyy should hold elections. They are basically under martial law. That’s not good when you claim to be defending democracy. They need to practice it,' Republican Senator Josh Hawley told VOA. Republican Representative Victoria Spartz told VOA that Ukraine should hold 'transparent elections, and that not doing so allows Russia to say, ‘You have an illegitimate president signing these contracts and deals.’' Russia has questioned the legitimacy of Ukraine’s president and government since 2014, well before Zelenskyy was elected to office. During his televised question-and-answer event on Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested he couldn’t negotiate with Zelenskyy until his legitimacy is confirmed through elections. 'If someone goes to the elections, gains legitimacy there, we will talk with anyone, including Zelenskyy,' he said. Zelenskyy said during a Feb. 23 press conference that he would step down as president if it meant 'peace for Ukraine' but pushed back on the calls for holding elections. 'How can we call an election in which half of the country’s population won’t be able to vote?' he said. 'How can we vote when today, [Ukraine was] attacked with 267 drones?' His major political rivals, former President Petro Poroshenko, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, have also rejected the call for holding elections. According to a February poll, 63% of Ukrainians also reject it. Many challenges Ukrainian election experts say there are many challenges to holding free and fair elections under wartime conditions. It would violate international principles of electoral law, according to Yevhenii Radchenko, a former deputy chair of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine. 'Elections must be universal, equal and free. During active hostilities, it is unrealistic to guarantee the safety of any of the participants, and due to massive Russian strikes, a significant part of the electoral infrastructure has been destroyed,' she said. Radchenko, who joined Ukraine’s armed forces, texted VOA from the trenches at the Donetsk front. On Feb. 27, OPORA, a leading Ukrainian nongovernmental organization involved in public oversight and advocacy in the field of elections, issued a statement signed by several other Ukrainian NGOs titled, 'Statement of Ukrainian Non-Governmental Organizations on the Impossibility of Holding Democratic Elections without the Sustainable Peace.' ‘Armed forces or elections’ After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Ukrainian parliament, as required by the country’s constitution, introduced martial law, which prohibits elections. OPORA chairperson Olga Aivazovska said the purpose of martial law is to preserve the state and mobilize society for defense. 'We have to choose either the armed forces or elections,' she told VOA. Aivazovska noted that Ukraine held elections between 2014 and 2022, when the conflict with Russia was ongoing in eastern Ukraine, but before Russia launched air raids on Ukrainian territory. 'Even if a ceasefire is established, there are no guarantees that Russia would not violate it as it did many times between 2014 and 2022,' she said. 'It can carry out a massive shelling of the Ukrainian territory on election day. It can organize terrorist attacks at the polling stations, killing voters, election workers and observers, or at the minimum, disrupt the process.' Aivazovska said it would be easy to contest an election as illegitimate if only 5% to 10% of the population votes. 'If Ukraine begins the election process without a guarantee of its completion, it means that we are simply giving this tool away to Russia for abuse and manipulation,' she said. Radchenko said that about 14 million citizens — out of a population of 41 million — would not be able to vote, given that the war has dislocated millions of Ukrainians, and nearly a million Ukrainian men and women are serving in the armed forces. According to Aivazovska, it is also unclear how people in areas occupied by Russia, 'where people are subjected to torture, kidnapping and other crimes,' will be able to cast their vote freely, even after lifting martial law. Most of the 7 million Ukrainian citizens who fled the war abroad will also not be able to vote, unless their host countries heavily invest in organizing the process. 'In 2004, the record number of Ukrainians living abroad voted at the polling stations in Ukrainian embassies and consulates — 103,000 citizens worldwide. There are simply no resources available to organize voting for 7 million people,' Aivazovska said. Let Ukraine decide Most of the members of the U.S. Congress interviewed by VOA said Ukraine should be free to decide when to hold its elections. Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick said the United States and other democracies will encourage Ukraine to hold elections when it can do it safely and fairly, but not when 'Ukrainians are still under invasion by an evil communist dictatorship.' Democratic Representative Eugene Vindman, who was born in Kyiv in 1975, told VOA, 'When 20% of the territory is occupied, when millions of Ukrainians are out of the country, it’s hard to imagine democratic elections representing the majority of the people being held.' Vindman expressed confidence that Ukrainian society will hold elections as soon as it achieves a stable peace. Republican Senator Kevin Cramer said the example of the United States holding elections during World War II is inapplicable because the U.S. didn’t have to fight on its territory. Vindman noted that European countries also suspended elections for the duration of that war. Democratic Representative Seth Magaziner suggested that a strong statement from Trump supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia’s invasion would make it easier for Ukrainians to 'develop a timeline for elections.' Republican Representative Don Bacon pointed out that Russia is in no position to demand elections from Ukraine. 'They haven’t had free elections in 25 years. Putin’s murdered all his rivals. They've been thrown off the buildings. They’ve been poisoned. They’ve been killed in GULAGs,' he told VOA in an email. Katya Andrusz, spokesperson for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told VOA that at the request of Ukrainian authorities, her office has begun work to ensure that when all the prerequisites are in place, Ukraine can hold elections 'in line with international standards and the commitments Ukraine has made as an OSCE country for holding democratic elections.' 'ODIHR is working with Ukraine in many areas, and we very much appreciate and respect the country’s democratic strength amidst all the ongoing challenges,' she said.

China And Angola: From The Pioneering ‘Angolan Model’ To A ‘New’ ...	By Sumie Yoshikawa China has made large loans to African countries with rich natural resources, especially Angola in southwest Africa. China provided 258 loans totaling US$45 billion to Angola, of which US$25.9 billion was invested in the energy sector from 2000 to 2022.1 Chinese loans to Angola amount to more than a quarter of the total loans to all African countries and make China the largest lender to Angola. In return, China has acquired African, and particularly Angolan, natural resources to meet China’s high domestic energy demands. Since the end of its civil war in 2002, Angola has achieved rapid economic growth by building infrastructure and accelerating oil development and its exports with the help of Chinese loans. Angola became the largest African exporter of petroleum to China. Angola has paid the majority of its debt to China in the form of extracted oil. This contractual arrangement, known as the 'Angolan model,' has attracted international attention and criticism.2 Lucy Corkin has argued that despite the importance of the trading of oil for the Sino-Angolan relationship, the arrangement does not bode well for the relationship’s sustainability. Both China and Angola see each other as necessary strategic allies for the foreseeable future, but this may obscure what is an uneasy 'marriage of convenience.'3 Ian Taylor et al. believe the 'marriage of convenience' is experiencing a period of rocky introspection to such an extent as to challenge the notion that China has decisive political sway over Angola.4 The beneficial impact of China’s large loans, however, is limited. The loans enriched only a small segment of Angola’s elite circle and badly worsened corruption. The majority of Angola’s people remained impoverished. The drop in global oil prices since 2014 has left Angola in serious economic distress. Moreover, Angola’s oil production has peaked, and shipments have begun to decline. The 'Angolan model' of collateralizing oil for loans has become increas- ingly difficult to sustain. Angolan President João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, who took over in 2017, has taken new initiatives during the economic recession and cracked down on the previous administration and its corruption, seeking to restructure external relations. I will consider why and how China invested heavily in Angola’s oil sector, and how the relationship between China and Angola has changed under the new Angolan administration. The 'Angolan Model' and Petroleum A brief review of China-Angola relations and Chinese investments in the latter’s oil sector since the end of the Angolan Civil War is useful. In 1975, Angola gained independence from Portugal when the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) seized control of the capital Luanda and its oil resources and declared independence. Angola then descended into a full-scale civil war between three insurgent organizations: the MPLA, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), each based on different ethnic groups. China initially supported UNITA, which controlled diamond reserves in the inner region. Due to the complex international context of the Cold War, it was not until 1983 that China and Angola established diplomatic relations. With the end of the Cold War, intergovernmental cooperation between China and Angola finally began in the 1990s. After becoming a net importer of oil in 1993, China became interested in importing oil from resource-rich African countries. In the 2000s, China’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) began to expand into African countries in full swing. China’s 'going out' strategy encouraged these moves. The Chinese government actively encouraged Chinese enterprises to expand their investment overseas. This strategy contrasted with the 'bringing in' strategy of introducing foreign capital into China, implemented since the reform and opening-up of the 1980s The Chinese government fully implemented the 'going out' strategy after 2000. In Africa, China’s major SOEs targeted mainly two areas: natural resources and infrastructure construction. China has invested heavily in Angola since the end of the civil war in 2002. Initially, Angola sought national reconstruction funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, negotiations between Angola and the IMF stalled due to the lack of transparency in Angola’s finances, especially the balance of payments of the National Oil Corporation, which had supported Angola’s postwar economy. China intervened and lent a hand. In 2004, the Angolan government signed a US$2 billion loan agreement with China, which triggered a massive increase in oil production and the start of Angola’s rapid economic growth. The Angolan government turned to relying on China.5 China provided huge loans to Angola by collateralizing oil. The international community named the contractual arrangement the 'Angolan model.' China agreed on a resource for infrastructure (RFI) deal in which Angola would supply natural resources in exchange for China building infrastructure in Angola. With the formalization of the mining relationship, China received international criticism for 'neocolonialism.'6 Using the Angola case as a model, China has spread RFI deals to other African countries and beyond.7 China’s loans to Angola continued to increase, reaching a cumulative amount exceeding $40 billion. In addition to infrastructure construction related to the oil industry, China has built railroads, ports, and housing by providing loans for these projects. In an important sense China has been deeply involved in nation-building in Angola, but with a significant downside: the Chinese government’s 'going out' strategy pumps large loans into African countries that are at high risk of corruption. At the same time, the oil imported from Angola helps to sustain rapid economic growth in China. Chinese SOEs in Angola’s Oil Sector Let us look at Chinese involvement, including loans, in Angola’s oil industry. Both the Chinese side and the Angolan side of the loan process have lacked transparency, leading to the emergence of several problems. China’s involvement in the Angolan oil sector was built on a cooperative relationship with Sonangol, a major state-owned enterprise with its headquarters in the capital city of Luanda. The three major Chinese oil companies—China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China Petroeum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec), and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC)—do not operate independently, and their involvement in Angola has been based solely on their relationship with the Sonangol.8 China and Angola first established two joint venture companies, China Sonangol International Holding (CSIH) and China Sonangol International (CSI). In 2004, CSIH and CSI established Sonangol Sinopec International (SSI). In general, the two countries have agreed that the Export-Import Bank of China will provide loans to Angola and that the loans will be jointly administered by the Angolan Ministry of Finance and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.9 A Chinese state oil company, usually Sinopec, will extract Angola’s petroleum in collaboration with Sonangol.10 In addition to the process of public inflows, there is reportedly a 'shadow' financing structure between China and Angola. The China International Fund (CIF) is famous in the oil sector. It is managed by the Queensway 88 group, ostensibly a private Hong Kong-based firm. A US Congressional report claims the CIF is linked to both the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of State Security in China.11 The Gabinete de Reconstrução Nacional (GRN), Angola Reconstruction Agency, has managed loans from the CIF. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who ruled Angola from 1979 to 2017, created GRN in 2005 to facilitate rapid infrastructure reconstruction before national elections. The CIF and GRN institutions are accountable only to the President.12 Both have been operating without the accountability demanded by Western standards, with extremely opaque management and accounting flows and a lack of international observation. One of the biggest proponents of China’s increased involvement in Angola’s oil sector has been dos Santos, widely criticized as a dictator who created one of the most corrupt regimes in Africa. Dos Santos had used Sonangol for fund- raising since 1979. The company reportedly functions for the benefit of dos Santos, his 4 family and friends.13 Many of the key members of the MPLA and Sonangol’s board of directors are connected by blood and friendship to form an exclusive social circle. This group was often called Futunguistas, after the name of one of dos Santos’s presidential palaces. They monopolizing the wealth of Angola’s economic growth. The Chinese SOEs that conducted business in Angola developed personal relationships with the Futunguistas. Contracts between Chinese companies and Angolan elites were not transparent, and corruption was widespread. Much of the profits went to families and associates of dos Santos. In 2015, Chinese authorities arrested Sam Pa, CEO of the CIF, which had promoted business in Angola, on corruption charges related to Sinopec’s oil license bid in Angola. CIF was reportedly complicit in corrupt dealings with the Angolan side in numerous projects in Angola.14 While some of the elite groups had acquired enormous wealth, the Angolan people have remained in chronic poverty and have not been able to benefit from the oil sales. Corruption and social injustice exacerbated civil unrest and led to protests against both Angolan authorities and Chinese companies. The dos Santos administration, however, restricted the activities of media organizations and journalists, silencing criticism of China’s growing role in Angola, serious corruption, labor exploitation, job competition, and other related problems. China developed a special relationship with some of Angola’s elites in the oil sector, allowing money to flow into the country in a manner that remained opaque to the outside world. Problems with China’s Investment in Angola In 2017, dos Santos stepped down after 38 years as President and was replaced by new President Lourenço. At the time of the change of government, Angola was experiencing serious economic hardship, a major cause being the huge loans from China and the burden of repayment. First, the 'Angolan Model' of Chinese loans based on oil has become unsustainable due to the drop in global oil prices and decline in Angolan oil production. The model was initially promising. After China made huge loans to African countries, these African economies began experiencing high growth due to the resource boom. Angola’s economy, in particular, experienced high growth based on the oil business. However, international oil prices started to plummet in 2014, and the Angolan economy fell into chaos. Although the repayment terms of some of the Chinese loans are unknown, many are reportedly linked to the price of oil. The drop in the price of oil means more oil is needed to repay the debt. Angola had to export more oil to China, its largest creditor, than it had before. After expanding its foreign currency borrowing, Angola’s cash flow rapidly deteriorated, and in 2016 it began asking for assistance from the IMF. Angola discussed the condition of accepting reforms to restore its public finances in exchange for receiving financial assistance from the IMF. Furthermore, during the same period, production peaked in most of Angola’s onshore oil fields. Since then, the amount of oil extracted gradually declined. Angola owed China more than $40 billion and was running out of the chief means of repaying the debt. This created incentives for Lourenço to reduce economic reliance on the oil industry and to diversify the Angolan economy. The second problem was the poor governance that had become prevalent in the previous dos Santos administration, exacerbated by the corruption fueled by Chinese loans. Dos Santos and some of his aides who managed Chinese loans and projects had amassed enormous wealth, while the majority of Angolans remained poor. The Lourenço administration launched an anti-corruption campaign immediately after taking office. The campaign was aimed at eradicating the corrupt practices that had ballooned during the dos Santos era. In a symbolic incident, Isabel dos Santos, the former President’s eldest daughter, was removed from her position as CEO of Sonangol. Ministers and state officials close to the former president were also removed due to corruption.15 With ample resources, Angola could have had a much higher average standard of living had the dos Santos regime been interested in spreading the wealth beyond his family and cronies. China shares in the blame. Luanda Leaks, which revealed the corrupt methods by which dos Santos allegedly amassed his $2 billion fortune, also mentions the involvement of Chinese SOEs in a complex web of corruption.16 Chinese SOEs have developed personal relationships with Angolan bureaucrats, but many of the bureaucrats have lost their jobs on corruption charges. At the same time, the Chinese government undertook its own anti-corruption campaign. Chinese SOEs operating in Angola are clearly worse off with the departure of the dos Santos government. Third, Chinese investments did not fulfill the expectations of improving Angola’s technological capacity and infrastructure. Chinese- funded infrastructure projects in Angola were undertaken by Chinese companies, which brought in large numbers of workers from mainland China. Angolan workers were largely excluded. When they were hired, it was mainly simple labor on Chinese projects under Chinese supervisors. In addition, many of the roads, houses, and buildings constructed by Chinese companies were of remarkably low quality. The hospital built in Luanda was abandoned soon after its completion due to fears that it would collapse.17 Faced with numerous problems, the Lourenço administration has been trying to change the country’s strategy. It criticized the investment agreements with China signed by the previous administration and canceled a few. The new administration arrested key figures from the previous administration and promoted anti-corruption measures. It initiated reforms to improve the business environment because Angola needed to attract new private investments to develop its non-oil sector industries. The new administration is trying to rebuild its relations between China and Western countries, strengthening international partnerships. Lourenço has particularly emphasized relations with China and other developed countries such as the U.S., France, Italy, and Japan as strategic partner countries. He has supported a policy of further strengthening cooperation with foreign partners and diversifying Angola’s economy.18 The new Angolan government has concluded that the 'Angolan Model' of loans and oil exports is already unsustainable, and that continuing to rely on it is a threat to the country’s economic stability. Prospects for the China-Angola Relationship To assess the prospects of the relationship, let us first summarize China’s involvement in Angola’s oil market. Most of Angola’s onshore oil fields have matured and the amount of oil extracted has been declining, which means Angola’s further oil production would be conducted in deepwater and ultra-deepwater fields. Chinese SOEs, however, do not have the technical capabilities to drill deepwater oil wells on their own and are forced to partner with experienced major Western oil companies.19 In their current operations in Angola, Chinese companies are still dependent on Western companies with technology. Chinese SOEs do not enjoy a monopoly in the Angolan oil industry, but are merely cooperating with Sonangol and participating in the complex structure of the Angolan oil domain, which involves many major Western companies. Furthermore, China is increasingly looking to the Middle East and Russia for its oil imports. Angola’s oil supplies to China are on the decline. In 2006, Angola overtook Saudi Arabia, albeit temporarily, to become the number one supplier of oil to China. Afterward, Angola supplied as much oil to China as did Saudi Arabia. In recent years, however, China has increased its purchases from Russia and Iraq. This is partly due to China’s growing interest in Russia and the Middle East, as exemplified by China’s support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the one hand, and its efforts to mediate relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the other hand. Although Angola remains one of China’s top suppliers of oil, Angola’s shipments to the latter have been declining partly because of the renegotiation of the Lourenço government’s debt with China. Worse still, China’s robust demand for oil will face limits. China has been shifting its industrial structure from resource intensive construction and manufacturing to services and consumption. Coupled with the stagnant Chinese economy, China presents many uncertainties as a major market for a supplier such as Angola. Beijing is also becoming more cautious about large loans in Africa and is reducing its investments. Now that China’s ravenous pursuit of resources has subsided, there is no sign of another resource boom similar to the millennium years. African economies will return to a low-growth trend without boosts coming from China. As Sino-African relations expanded rapidly in the 2000s, the 'Angolan model' of repaying Chinese loans with natural resources spread elsewhere on the African continent with similar arrangements. Such loans have come under severe international criticism. Under the Chinese 'going out' policy, irrational economic activities such as China’s cavalierly signing expensive deals with resource-rich African countries in the 2000s have decreased. Many of the loans that China has granted to African countries have become non-performing loans, and the Chinese government expects to force the repayment of these debts. It is possible that the achievement of Beijing’s true objectives in investing in Africa do not require African countries to repay their loans. If so, China may see advantages in continuing to invest heavily in countries such as Angola. However, managing and operating these far-flung assets will saddle China with new and heavy burdens as well as drawing China deeper into Africa’s problems in the future. What does the future hold for China-Angola relations? Chinese loans have been channeled through the state-controlled oil industry in Angola and the political elite of the former President dos Santos. While the projects paid for by the loans seemed necessary and appeared efficient in the short term, they were not politi- cally, economically, or environmentally sustainable in the long term for Angola. The Angolan side hopes to develop its relationship with China from its previous focus on loans to a new paradigm of diversified private investments. This new trend does not mean that the Angolan government is trying to drive China away. Angola is seeking to develop non-oil industries and has been vocal about attracting private investments. As Angola pursues this strategy, China’s role will not necessarily decrease and may increase. Countries that are critically dependent on selling off their natural resources often suffer from fundamental weaknesses in governance. They find it difficult to break away from their dependence sales of non-renewable resources to raise revenue. There are, however, inspiring exceptions. Malaysia, for example, was able to channel income from natural resources to investments in manufacturing. The chances of the Lourenço administration achieving a simi- lar success will be improved if it can be more transparent in the management of its resource sectors, force the bureaucracy to implement the planned economic diversification, prevent corruption, and make the management of its natural resources more efficient. In 2018, Angola signed the 'One Belt, One Road (OBOR)' memorandum in Beijing. The OBOR has expanded beyond traditional infra- structure development. It now includes the Digital Silk Road and the Health Silk Road. China is increasingly targeting high-value markets in African countries, including technology, telecommunications, and green energy. The relationship between China and Angola has been changing with the COVID-19 pandemic,the growth of Angola’s debt burden to China, and the decline of Chinese loans to African countries. Although the relationship between the two countries remains oil-centric, it has been shifting to other areas of investment such as telecommunications technology. Chinese technology giants such as Huawei are helping create the infrastructure needed to develop the Digital Silk Road in Africa. In March 2022, Huawei and Angolan telecom service provider Unitel signed an agreement that will see the former provide a range of green energy solutions to the latter’s operations.20 While oil remains paramount for China and Angola, cooperation between the two countries is gradually expanding into broader areas beyond energy and infrastructure. Economic diversification could be part of a broader reshaping of the relationship that would contribute to more equitable prosperity as well as stable economic development in Angola.

China’s Flyers Flout Aviation Rules With Flares And Flybys – Anal...	By Zachary Abuza It happened again. A Chinese pilot flew his aircraft dangerously close to a foreign aircraft, something that is happening with increased frequency. In the latest incident, on Feb. 19, a Chinese naval helicopter flew within 9 meters (yards) of a small low-flying Philippine plane above the Scarborough Shoal. The Cessna Caravan turboprop plane belongs to the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. Scarborough Shoal, situated 120 miles from Luzon, is well within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone. The previous week, a Chinese J-16 jet fighter made an 'unsafe and unprofessional interaction,' releasing at least four flares, 30 meters in front of a Royal Australian Air Force P–8A Poseidon anti-submarineaircraft that was flying near the Paracel Islands. China claims the Australian aircraft 'intentionally intruded' into Chinese airspace. A Chinese official described the response as 'completely reasonable, legal and beyond reproach,' and 'a legitimate defense of national sovereignty and security.' In violation of international law, China has drawn straight baselines around the Paracel and Spratly Islands; something that only archipelagic states are allowed to do under the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea. Countries routinely challenge these excessive maritime claims through naval and aerial freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs). We have seen a pattern of aggressive behavior from Chinese pilots. An October 2023 report by the U.S. Department of Defense documented some 180 unsafe aerial encounters by Chinese pilots in the previous two years, and over 100 additional encounters with the aircraft of U.S. allies and partners. That tally was more than all such incidents in the previous decade combined. Creating unsafe situations Most U.S. Navy aircraft are now equipped with external cameras to document dangerous Chinese encounters. One should recount that the April 2001 EP3 incident that caused the emergency landing and a hostage-like situation for the 24 member U.S. Navy crew, was caused by a Chinese pilot who was unaware of the concept of propellers. The J-8II pilot was killed in the crash. While Chinese pilots are famously aggressive and routinely fly at unsafe and unprofessional close quarters over the South China Sea, the dropping of flares was unseen until around 2022. While using flares to signal an unresponsive airplane at a safe distance is lawful and a signal of escalatory actions, how the Chinese pilots are employing them now is dangerous, unprofessional, and dramatically escalates the potential for the loss of life. On Oct. 5, 2023, a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance helicopter conducting patrols in support of a UN Security Council-authorized sanctions monitoring against North Korea in the Yellow Sea experienced 'multiple passes' at five meters (yards). Three weeks later, a pair of PLA-Navy J-11 fighters made multiple passes at a Canadian helicopter that was conducting routine patrols as the HMCS Ottawa was conducting a FONOP near the Paracel Islands. The Chinese pilots ejected flares during the second flyby, forcing the Canadian pilot to take evasive action. In May 2024, PLA-Air Force pilots deployed flares in front of an Australian MH-60-R helicopter that was flying in international waters in support of UNSC-authorized sanctions monitoring against North Korea. The helicopter had to take evasive actions to avoid the flares. The following month, a Dutch helicopter flying above its destroyer, also in support of the U.N. sanctions monitoring in international waters in the Yellow Sea, was approached by two Chinese jets and a helicopter, which 'created a potentially unsafe situation.' Flares present risks There are major risks from using flares. The first is proximity: If a Chinese pilot is close enough to deploy flares in a way that could cause damage, his plane is already flying at an unsafe distance. Most of the flares used are pyrotechnic magnesium, i.e. a dense mass of inflamed metal that burns at very high temperatures – to perform as decoys for heat-seeking missiles. These flares pose multiple risks to planes that could lead to the loss of human life. For planes such as a P-8, they can be sucked into a jet engine intake. For propeller driven planes, such as a P-3 or smaller surveillance craft, a direct hit on the engine could irreparably damage the propeller. Though the four-engine P-3s and P-8s are both able to fly on one engine, it’s still a risk. There is a greater threat to the helicopter rotors. Though it is unlikely they could get through the rotor blades and into the filtered intake, it’s not impossible. Moreover, the skin of many military helicopters is made of magnesium alloys and is itself highly flammable. Many surveillance and anti-submarine helicopters fly with open doors, and the last thing the crew wants is a flare, ejected out of a plane at an angle, getting inside an aircraft. Another concern is an escalatory threat. To some sensors on aircraft, the flares can appear as missiles. This is in an already tense operating environment, when an aircraft’s counter-measures are being controlled automatically in response to its sensors. Pilots’ perverse incentive structure There is no need to use flares in this way, but someone, somewhere, in the PLA decided that this is tactically a good idea – and a natural escalatory step from the 'thumping' tactics that their pilots routinely conduct. The use of flares is tied to the aggression that we have long seen from Chinese pilots. In their system, aggressive and unprofessional flying is not only not discouraged, but is actually encouraged. While there’s no evidence that there’s a PLA-AF directive that requires pilots to make unsafe encounters, it is clearly what is considered 'commanders intent' to defend China’s 'historical waters and airspace.' In Chinese military doctrine, this is referred to as 'using the enemy to train the troops.' According to the U.S. Department of Defense’s Center for the Study of the PLA-AF, there is not a single incident that they can point to where a Chinese pilot has faced disciplinary action for aggressive flying. In short, behavior that would cost a U.S. pilot his or her wings is encouraged by the PLA leadership. The Chinese Navy and Air Force will continue their coercive and risky operational behavior in the East and South China Seas as they seek to enforce Beijing’s excessive maritime claims, impinging on the sovereign rights of other states or making illegal assertions in international waters and airspace. A flotilla of PLA-N ships has been sailing some 150 nautical miles east of Sydney, Australia. While such passages are lawful, China’s unprofessional and aggressive tactics are meant to raise the costs to deter other states from flying or sailing where international law permits. The law for me, not for thee. Zachary Abuza is a professor at the National War College in Washington and an adjunct at Georgetown University.

Mongolia Keeps Mining For Growth Amid Economic Encertainty – Anal...	By Tuvshintugs Batdelger and Nomun Enkhbold Following Mongolia’s 2024 election, a new government faces the challenge of sustaining economic growth amid rising global uncertainty. Strong export performance and fiscal expansion fuel optimism, but structural challenges may test the country’s resilience. The Mongolian economy is continuing its recovery from COVID-19-related slowdown. Economic growth was 4.9 per cent in 2024, which is significantly lower than the 7.4 per cent growth in 2023 and the average growth rate of 6.4 per cent over the past 18 years. The industrial sector grew by 5 per cent, with the mining sector expanding by 5.7 per cent. But the agricultural sector, which accounted for around 10 per cent of GDP, contracted by 25 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024. This decline is attributed to severe winter and spring weather conditions, known as the ‘Dzud’, which led to the loss of 8.1 million animals — 12.5 per cent of total livestock. Total exports increased moderately by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year, reaching US$15.8 billion, while imports rose sharply by 25.5 per cent to reach US$11.6 billion, both marking historical highs. Export growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in copper exports. The volume of copper exports reached a record 1.7 million tons, up 11.1 per cent from the previous year, while the average border price of copper increased by US$236 per ton, boosting the value of copper exportsby 26 per cent. Though coal export volume grew by over 20 per cent to a historic high of 83.7 million tons in 2024, the price of coal fell by US$25.4 per ton, leading to a 2.3 per cent decline in the value of coal exports. Economic growth in 2024 was fuelled by significant expansion on the demand side. With relatively favourable conditions for commodity exports and a positive outlook of the near future, the state budget revenue and grants increased by 28.7 per cent from 2023, reaching a historic high of 31.4 trillion Mongolian togrog (US$9.1 billion). Budget expenditure expanded by 34.9 per cent, reaching another historic high of 30.4 trillion Mongolian togrog (US$8.8 billion). Private consumption and investment also rose by 27.8 per cent and 26.8 per cent respectively in the first three quarters of 2024. Inflation remained within the central bank’s target range, averaging 6.6 per cent in 2024. This was despite ongoing uncertainties in the external environment, capacity constraints in energy, transport and logistics sectors, significant demand-side expansion and negative supply shocks in animal husbandry. The labour force participation rate continued its steady rise, reaching 63 per cent in the third quarter of 2024, while the unemployment rate rose to 6.1 per cent. The rise in exports also improved the country’s foreign exchange reserves, which registered a record high of US$5.5 billion. This milestone is especially significant considering the Bank of Mongolia made payments of around US$1.1 billion in foreign debt. The togrog remained relatively stable against the US dollar throughout 2024. The government’s debt management strategy for 2023–25 stipulates that new foreign securities will be issued solely for the purpose of refinancing existing debt. Following implementation, as well as abovementioned positive changes in the economy, the government’s sovereign bond spread reached the lowest in history — 2.3 per cent — in 2024. As a result, credit rating agencies S&P Global and Fitch Ratings upgraded the country’s credit rating to B+ and B2 respectively, marking the highest rating in the past decade. Mongolia saw the formation of its first 126-member parliament following the 2024 parliamentary election. The election — based on a mixed electoral system — led to five parties winning seats, with 78 members elected from constituencies and 48 from party lists. Notably, 25 per cent were women — the highest level of female participation in recent generations. Though the Mongolian People’s Party won the majority of seats, it formed a coalition governmentwith the Democratic Party and the HUN Party, giving it a 94 per cent supermajority. The current coalition government is aiming to implement 14 mega-projects in the next four years, having endorsed linking the railway border connection with China — which should boost coal export revenue by 2.8 times — and uranium mining in collaboration with the French ‘Orano’ group. The new parliament finally adopted the Law on the Sovereign Wealth Fund after many years of deliberation. The fund is composed of three sub-funds, designed to accumulate wealth, finance large state investments and support social measures. Budget discussions were notably intense, resulting in the adoption of a zero-deficit budget for 2025. But the Fiscal Stability Law, which has been in effect since 2013, was amended to remove the upper limit on the overall budget deficit, replacing it with a lower limit on the primary balance surplus. The long-term impact of this change has not been fully assessed, nor has its potential to ensure fiscal stability. Looking ahead to 2025, factors such as disruptions in petroleum supply from Russia, a slowdown in Chinese economy, expanding budget spending, spiralling wage increase, surges in electricity and heat prices and the continued impact of the Dzud will continue to put pressure on inflation and economic growth.

The Great AI Shift: The Rise Of ‘Services As Software’ – Analysis	By Nisha Holla Human effort has traditionally driven the adoption of technology services—programmers coding algorithms and business logic into executable programmes, analysts managing data, system integrators deploying and maintaining infrastructure, and consultants optimising enterprise workflows. However, with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), a fundamental shift is underway: human-led services are becoming AI-led software. Instead of hiring large teams of human specialists, businesses will increasingly incorporate AI-powered tools and platforms that automate complex tasks once thought impervious to automation and digitalisation. The AI-driven shift is compelling enterprises to reimagine fundamental work at an unprecedented pace. It raises several critical questions about what happens to human labour when AI replaces labour-intensive services, how AI-driven automation will redefine the relationship between enterprises and the software they adopt, and what new opportunities will emerge in a paradigm where enterprise-grade AI takes centre stage. From SaaS to 'Services as Software' The traditional Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model disrupted enterprise Information Technology (IT) by replacing expensive, on-premise software solutions with cloud-based applications. Databases were maintained by the SaaS providers remotely, and the per-seat license model evolved rapidly to annuity payments and the rise of Annualised Recurring Revenue (ARR). SaaS has dominated the technology world for the better part of two decades. Today, AI is pushing the envelope by turning services built to be used by humans as ‘self-serve’ utilities into automatically-running software solutions that execute autonomously—a paradigm shift the venture capital world, in particular, has termed ‘Services as Software’ The shift is already conspicuous across industries. AI tools like Harvey AI are transforming the legal and compliance sector by analysing case law and generating legal briefs, essentially replacing human research assistants. The customer support ecosystem that once required large human teams in call centres now handles significant query volumes daily with AI chatbots and virtual agents. Tools like OpenAI's Code Interpreter catalyse industries operating on data analysis and business intelligence by incorporating AI-driven analytics that replace manual data wrangling. Unlike traditional SaaS, which assists human workers, these AI-driven tools replace labour-intensive processes entirely and generate outcomes with minimal human interventions. ‘Services as Software’ therefore eliminates the human + SaaS unit that serves outcomes and replaces this unit with a full-stack AI-led automation that delivers the same outcomes. Convergence of a technological leap and urgent business requirements Several tailwinds have converged globally to accelerate this shift: AI's rapid advancement: The step-function accomplishments of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI have made it possible for software to organise, reason, and execute tasks once exclusive to human effort. The democratisation of AI: Open-source AI models and Application Programming Interface (API)-based infrastructure solutions are making cutting-edge automation accessible to businesses of all sizes. Previously, this level of technology access was only available to mega-cap enterprises. Perplexity's launch of Deep Research, which offers near-enterprise calibre AI services at retail prices, is already challenging the AI industry's subscription and paywall formats by driving costs down even further. Enterprise cost pressures: Businesses are actively adopting AI-driven tools to reduce operational expenses and vastly improve efficiency, particularly in high-cost service functions that usually incorporate a significant human labour component. Talent churn and generational shifts: In particular, as the US Baby Boomer generation (born between 1946 and 1964) retires and the architects of today's systems leave the workforce, and as cross-border technical talent flows are challenged in a new regime of de-globalisation, enterprises are starting to use emerging AI capabilities to rebalance their human workforce requirements. As a result of these aforementioned factors, there has been a global surge in AI-first companies building products and trained models that automate significant components of services-based businesses, and replace traditional approaches to work entirely. Case studies: AI replacing labour-intensive services Customer service and the end of call centres: For decades, outsourcing customer support to human agents dominated the customer service industry. Today, AI-powered voice assistants and chatbots are disrupting the space. Bank of America's Erica AI handles over 2 million customer interactions daily, surpassing 2 billion interactions since its launch in 2018, dramatically reducing reliance on human agents. Airlines and e-commerce companies are increasingly using AI chatbots to resolve queries without human intervention. As generative AI conversational agents improve, which they are at an unprecedented pace, entire call centres could be replaced with AI-driven agents, making routine customer service a fully automated function with higher-order management entailing human effort. Software development and AI copiloting: Software engineering was once thought impervious to automation, but AI-powered agents are rapidly proving this wrong. These tools today perform complex coding tasks. Examples include GitHub Copilot—which helps developers code faster and reduce manual effort, and Cognition AI's Devin—an AI software engineer capable of building and debugging applications on demand. It is unlikely that developers will be replaced entirely; however, AI will dramatically reduce the need for extensive engineering teams, instead transforming software development into a more automated workflow. Legal and financial analysis: These services traditionally relied on high-cost white-collar professionals but are now disrupted by AI agent-driven automation. Law firms are utilising AI legal assistants for research and contract drafting tasks hitherto reserved for junior associates. AI-powered financial models can now analyse company balance sheets, detect fraud, and even generate investment analysis reports, all at a fraction of the time and cost of human professionals. As AI continues to learn, these white-collar jobs with high hourly costs will increasingly become automated. The AI-driven shift brings into question the traditional notion of availing an ‘expert service’. Software development,legal, and financial services are all coveted industries where workers are considered ‘experts’ delivering specialised services. The human role will undergo tremendous redefinition and will require calibrated re-skilling. The new enterprise stack: AI benches and agents running sprints Historically, enterprises purchased software systems that human professionals then produced their work on top of, with these professionals being the primary drivers of work. These software systems became ‘Systems of Record’ (SOR), with enterprise knowledge and memory encapsulated within them, and business continuity preserved via their persistence. With AI now capable of directly engaging with these SORs, human work is becoming secondary, and this shift is fundamentally re-engineering how businesses consume technology. Businesses won't simply replace SaaS with AI-powered tools; they will build the company's processes and systems around these new systems. Instead of hiring marketing agencies, companies will use AI to generate dynamic marketing and advertising campaigns. Businesses will rely on AI-driven quality assurance and control instead of outsourcing software testing, Quality Assurance, and Quality Control. Instead of manual IT support, enterprises will deploy AI-driven monitoring and cybersecurity agents. AI agents will run Human Resource processes and travel bookings. Every business computer will host dedicated AI agents to monitor human productivity and run real-time coordination of enterprise resources, and calendars. The human role in an AI-First future of the enterprise Despite AI's rapid rise and the potential churn in enterprise workflows, processes, and onboarding of labour, human contribution will continue to remain essential in several key areas: AI oversight and governance will remain a human domain. AI systems must be monitored for ethical concerns, regulatory compliance, and bias correction. Humans will have to ensure responsible AI implementation. Creativity and strategic thinking remain human domains. AI can generate insights, but human leaders and collaborators will drive innovation, interpret business contexts, and make strategic decisions. Humans and AI will collaborate in specialised fields. Doctors will use AI for patient monitoring and diagnosis but will continue to oversee patient care. Lawyers will leverage AI for research but still handle litigation. Scientists will incorporate AI into research discovery, hypothesis generation, data analysis, and simulation but define research objectives and experimental paths. Customer experience and relationship management encompass complex problem-solving and trust-building. AI cannot replace these functions but can handle transactional interactions and customer attention acquisition, while escalations will still require humans. Human supervision is necessary for AI training and maintenance, including debugging, updating, and refining data to prevent outdated and incorrect outputs. AI will reshape roles instead of replacing human expertise entirely, just as prior technologies like desktop computing, cloud, mobile, and app-led SaaS did. Human-AI collaboration will become the new normal. The next phase of AI-led automation The shift from labour-intensive services to AI-driven software is already underway with profound implications. AI will not just assist service-based industries, but also replace traditional workflows with automated alternatives. However, rather than eliminating human roles, AI will redefine them, and possibly adjunct them. The most successful businesses will combine AI's efficiency with human judgement, creativity, and oversight. As AI becomes the core of enterprise technology, businesses that embrace automation will gain a significant competitive edge. The question is no longer if services will become software but how quickly industries will adapt—and what new opportunities will emerge. The companies that lead this transformation will define the next era of global technology—one in which AI and human expertise work in tandem to push the boundaries of innovation.

Europe Comes To Washington To Boost Transatlantic Relations – Ana...	By Luke Coffey This week has been eventful in Washington regarding America’s European policy, with several leaders visiting to hold high-level meetings. The week started with France’s President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to the White House, where he met with President Donald Trump, followed by Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky. In addition, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas was also in town for meetings. These high-level visits underscore the importance of transatlantic relations and the critical role of the US in shaping Europe’s security and political landscape. At the top of the agenda for every meeting was Ukraine and the broader question of what the US and Europe need to do to achieve lasting peace in the country. The discussions this week follow a set of high-profile American visits to Europe two weeks ago. The frequency and intensity of these engagements suggest that, despite skepticism in some quarters, the Trump administration is committed to maintaining strong relations with key European allies — even though he might take a more unconventional approach. There are several critical observations to make about the meetings this week, which provide insight into how the Trump administration intends to work with its European partners moving forward. Firstly, it is evident that Trump prefers to engage directly with European nation-states rather than deal with Brussels-based institutions such as the EU. His preference for bilateral relationships over multilateral structures is well known, and this week’s meetings reinforced that tendency. Trump gravitates toward America’s oldest and closest allies, such as the UK and France, rather than embracing the EU as a whole. By all accounts, Macron had a very productive and cordial White House visit. The body language and chemistry between the two leaders suggested mutual respect, something that has not always been evident in Trump’s dealings with his European counterparts. Macron, despite ideological differences with Trump, has made a concerted effort to maintain open lines of communication with the US administration, and it appears this strategy is paying off. Unlike Macron, Starmer does not have a longstanding personal connection with Trump. However, he is quickly establishing a working relationship with the White House. Despite ideological differences, both leaders recognize the importance of Anglo-American cooperation, particularly in matters of defense and security. Starmer and Macron came to Washington with concrete proposals for the future security of Ukraine, rather than simply expecting the US to shoulder the burden. Reports indicate that both countries have agreed in principle to the possibility of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine if the situation demands it. Additionally, both have committed to increasing their defense spending, a move that will likely encourage smaller European nations to follow suit. Secondly, if individual European nations had a good week with Trump, the EU as an institution did not fare as well. Trump’s disdain for the EU is no secret. He was a vocal supporter of Brexit in 2016 and has long accused the EU of implementing trade policies that undermine American businesses. This situation has been made worse by some EU leaders who have publicly criticized Trump in the past — comments that the president often takes personally. Trump’s comments this week were particularly sharp, as he suggested that the EU was created to undermine the US. This assertion ignores the historical reality of European integration, which was largely driven by the need for economic and political stability after the Second World War, and was very much an American-led project in its early days. Nevertheless, Trump’s comments reflect his deeply held skepticism toward the European project. This skepticism is not limited to Trump himself but is shared by several of his cabinet members. A clear example of this was the diplomatic snub of the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas. Secretary of State Marco Rubio declined to meet with Kallas, citing a 'scheduling conflict.' Given the urgency of the war in Ukraine and the EU’s significant role in supporting Kyiv, this move was extraordinary. To cap off a tough week for the EU, Trump announced the possibility of a 25 percent tariff on all goods imported from the EU. This decision, framed as an effort to address perceived trade imbalances, further signals a potential trade war between Washington and Brussels at a time when transatlantic unity is crucial for confronting shared geopolitical challenges, particularly in Ukraine. Finally, it is clear that Ukraine emerged as a big winner this week. Beyond securing continued European military and financial commitments, Zelensky signed an economic and mineral-sharing agreement with Trump after weeks of tough negotiations. Trump acknowledged that Zelensky was a challenging negotiator, and media reports suggest the talks were far from straightforward. However, Trump’s business-oriented approach to diplomacy means he likely respects leaders who negotiate hard. For Zelensky, this agreement is a crucial win. It ensures long-term US-Ukraine economic engagement and brings American businesses into Ukraine in a significant way. By securing American commercial interests in Ukraine, Zelensky has indirectly bolstered his country’s security. Trump himself admitted that the presence of American businesses on the ground would act as a deterrent against future Russian aggression, reinforcing Ukraine’s position even in the absence of a formal US security guarantee. While Trump has been reluctant to extend a direct military commitment to Ukraine, he recognizes that economic ties can serve as a stabilizing force. The meetings and policy outcomes of this week serve as a reminder that Europe remains a central pillar of US foreign policy. This is regardless of the White House’s ideological preferences. The deep cultural, economic, and security ties between North America and Europe cannot be ignored. Even though the Trump administration takes a transactional and sometimes confrontational approach, the fundamental importance of the transatlantic alliance remains intact. This is good for America and good for Europe. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Is Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Indirectly Deepening Chinese Soft Po...	By Gwendolyn Yap In 2024, the Chinese gaming industry achieved record sales of US$44.8 billion domestically and US$2.55 billion internationally, marking its highest earnings since official data tracking began in 2003.[1] As the second-largest gaming market globally, behind the United States, companies in China have produced internationally acclaimed, award-winning games[2] in recent years, such as Genshin Impact (2020)[3] and Black Myth: Wukong (2024).[4] Both narrative-driven role-playing games have been widely praised for their incorporation of Chinese cultural elements, which has played a key role in popularising Chinese culture on the global stage and bolstering China’s growing soft power. Yet, there remains one significant area of the Chinese gaming industry that, despite its rising popularity, is often overlooked in discussions of China’s soft power: the Chinese e-sports industry. Recording a profit of US$3.8 billion in 2024,[5] the Chinese e-sports industry has been rapidly expanding its international influence through games like League of Legends (LoL) (2009) and Mobile Legends: Bang Bang(MLBB) (2016). LoL, originally published by American developer Riot Games in 2009 and acquired by Chinese company Tencent in 2011, is widely regarded as the world’s most popular e-sport, attracting over 100 million viewers for its 2019 world championship.[6] Specifically in Southeast Asia, however, MLBB has taken the spotlight, outpacing LoL’s mobile counterpart, Wild Rift (2020)[7] to become the region’s dominant e-sport. Released by Chinese company MOONTON in 2016, MLBB has consistently ranked among the top two games in Southeast Asia. In 2019, it earned US$502.5 million, with 61 per cent of its revenue coming from the region.[8] Despite a temporary dip in 2020 following the release of Genshin Impact, MLBB reclaimed the top spot by 2022[9] and remained a leading performer in 2024, ranking first in Southeast Asia for revenue and second in downloads, according to the 'State of Mobile Games in APAC 2024' report by SensorTower.[10] As of April 2024, the game has earned US$1.8 billion globally, with 47 per cent of revenue and 67 per cent of its total downloads coming from Southeast Asia. This report implies two things: (1) MLBB maintains a strong player base to drive high revenue; and (2) it continually attracts new Southeast Asian players, proving strong regional interest. Given this, the question arises: how has MLBB been able to maintain its relevance and appeal in Southeast Asia? Although MLBB was recognised as a key enterprise for national cultural export in 2021 and 2022, this article contends that its direct impact on China’s cultural influence has been minimal. Rather, in line with President Xi Jinping’s Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI), which emphasises strengthening people-to-people exchanges and cooperation, it appears that MLBB’s parent company, MOONTON, has leveraged the game’s popularity to conduct Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects in Southeast Asia. These efforts represent a new avenue for the distribution of Chinese soft power in the region. WHAT IS MLBB? MLBB is a mobile game in the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) genre. Available for download on iOS and Android devices, it is a round-based game that typically lasts between 10 to 30 minutes. Players are split into two teams of five, with the goal of securing the opposing team’s tower to gain victory. Like other MOBA games such as Dota 2 (2013) and LoL (2009), MLBB is heavily dependent on strategy and teamwork. However, unlike Dota 2 and LoL, which require a desktop set-up for efficient gameplay, MLBBstands out by being strictly mobile-only.[11] Despite this unique platform, MOONTON has been sued twice—once in 2017 and another in 2022—by Riot Games, the parent company of LoL. Riot Games, owned by Chinese rival Tencent, claimed that MOONTON had infringed on LoL’s intellectual property by plagiarising elements from the game. In 2024, the two companies reached a global settlement.[12] These legal disputes, however, did not hinder MLBB’s popularity, which has only grown since its release. In 2017, the first official MLBB e-sports tournament, Mobile Legends Southeast Asia Cup, was held featuring teams from Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.[13] The event became an annual fixture, expanding to include other Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos by 2019. In 2024, with the inclusion of teams from the Middle East and Africa, the tournament was renamed MLBB Mid-Season Cup, aiming to be 'more globalised and inclusive than ever'.[14] As a result, the tournament transitioned from a regional to an international event, alongside the annual MLBB World Championship.[15] Furthermore, since 2019, MLBB has been a regular e-sports medal event in the Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games), aligning MLBB’s prestige with that of traditional sports.[16] WHY IS MLBB SO POPULAR IN SOUTHEAST ASIA? Based on conversations with existing MLBB players, online forum discussions, and insights from regional video game journalists,[17] four possible reasons driving MLBB’s popularity in Southeast Asia have been identified: (1) instant gratification; (2) accessible infrastructure; (3) localised content and (4) community. By assessing these four possible reasons, this section will showcase how the technical aspects of the game align with the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI) proposed by President Xi Jinping in his 2023 address. In the address, President Xi stated how 'modernisation [can be achieved] [by countries through] consider[ing] its national conditions and unique features'.[18] By tailoring MLBB to Southeast Asian culture and infrastructure, the game aids in positioning China as a leader capable of providing accessible technology to developing regions, thereby boosting its soft power. Instant Gratification MLBB stands out with its shorter gameplay duration, as each round lasts only 10 to 30 minutes, compared to games such as LoL or Dota2, which can take up to an hour. This allows players to experience the instant gratification of a win or loss within a short period. As the outcome of each round varies depending on the players involved, this provides just enough fulfilment to encourage users to come back for more. Additionally, the brief gameplay duration makes it easy for individuals to fit a game into their daily routines, such as during lunch breaks or commutes. MLBB’s appeal is also bolstered by the proliferation of gig economy jobs in Southeast Asia in recent years.[19] Mediated by digital platforms, these jobs—such as delivery work, ride-hailing, and freelancers—often come with fragmented leisure time between assignments. As such, MLBB’s short gameplay offers an efficient way for individuals in these roles to pass the time. Through its user-centric design, MLBB showcases how Chinese developers adapt their games to cater to diverse markets, especially one as diverse as Southeast Asia. Accessible Infrastructure MLBB also sets itself apart from other MOBAs by being available on mobile devices, offering portability that allows players to enjoy the game with friends anywhere, without being bound to a desktop computer. This accessibility caters to a wider audience, especially those who may not have the resources to invest in a desktop computer or console. Wong Si Jia, a senior writer at Geek Culture, a Singapore-based tech journalism company, noted that specifically in Southeast Asia, 'countries like Indonesia [and the] Philippines have a high mobile gaming percentage because they have lower spending power than say, Singapore, where PC and console are the main modes of play'. Indeed, the 'State of Mobile Games in APAC 2024'[20] report reveals that Indonesia leads in mobile game downloads, with 835 million downloads between January and April, followed by the Philippines (368 million) and Vietnam (352 million), in second and third place respectively. Aside from its accessibility on mobile devices, MLBB has a compact application size of under 400MB,[21] making it easy for Southeast Asian players to download. This is especially crucial in a region where telecommunication infrastructure remains uneven despite rapid development.[22] In contrast, Genshin Impact demands nearly 3GB of storage, excluding in-game downloads. Reportedly, MOONTON intentionally kept MLBB’s initial application size at 100MB to bridge 'differences in mobile hardware quality across regions' ('「尊重」全球各地区手机硬件的差异').[23] This optimisation not only reduces the time it takes for players to start playing but also the financial cost of maintaining the game on their devices. The attention to the varied telecommunication infrastructure across Southeast Asia, coupled with the earlier point on user-centric design, showcases how the game attempts to bridge technological and economic gaps within the region, further bolstering the GCI initiative. Localised Content MLBB is popular in Southeast Asia also because MOONTON releases content specifically tailored to the region. For instance, they released characters inspired by Southeast Asian history and folklore, such as Lapu-Lapu in 2017,[24] a hero based on the Chief of Mactan Island, who is regarded as the first Filipino hero. In 2019, MOONTON added Badang,[25] a hero inspired by the legendary strongman from the Malay Annals. By introducing these culturally relevant characters, MOONTON strengthens players’ connection to the game, deepening their engagement with MLBB. Beyond in-game characters, MOONTON has also worked to ensure that MLBB tournaments are relevant to the countries where they are held. Lucas Mao, Managing Director of Global Esports at MOONTON, revealed that the company 'customise(s) a strategy for every country in the region, with emphasis placed on understanding local culture and the local community'.[26] To this end, MOONTON has collaborated with local suppliers to facilitate tournaments, departing from the more standardised approach where companies coordinate equipment and software across countries to ensure consistent quality. Reports indicate that MOONTON even holds prayer ceremonies in Cambodia and Indonesia to respect local customs before event set-ups.[27] By choosing localised implementation, Mao highlights that the content produced is more relevant to local fans, aligning with GCI’s aim in fostering 'cross-region dialogue' ('创造跨赛区对话') and increasing engagement with Southeast Asian audiences. Community Since the early 2000s, the MOBA genre, which emphasises teamwork and strategy, has enjoyed popularity in Southeast Asia, with early games such as LoL and Defence of the Ancients (DotA, the precursor to Dota 2) becoming mainstays in the region. In 2022, Chinese company Tencent released the MOBA game Honor of Kings, which has since become MLBB’s direct competitor in the mobile game market. It was even named Best Game of 2024 in Southeast Asia by Google Play.[28]Although Honor of Kings did not reach MLBB’s record-breaking success, its popularity reflects the region’s strong preference for social gaming experiences. In fact, a 2019 study by GameStart found that 60 per cent of Southeast Asian gamers prefer to play with friends.[29] This strong inclination towards community gaming likely contributes to MLBB’s popularity, since the game relies heavily on teamwork for victory. Additionally, the game’s appeal is further intensified by the sense of community built around its tournaments. Due to MOONTON’s localisation efforts, each Southeast Asian country now hosts its own leagues, allowing teams to compete both locally and regionally. This setup enables players to engage with others in their local community while facilitating connections with players across borders. Beyond the matches, fans also reportedly participate in cultural displays, rap battles, singing, and dancing at these events, creating a sense of belonging unique to MLBB tournaments, and cultivates community spirit, unlike other e-sports.[30] MOONTON CEO Yuan Jing remarked that by building a relatable community, players may come to view the game as 'an integral part of their lives' ('生活中不可或缺的一部分').[31] E-sport competitions through MLBB thus become an avenue in which China’s GCI strategy of advocating for people-to-people exchange and cooperation becomes a reality. HAS MLBB BOOSTED CHINESE SOFT POWER IN THE REGION? Joseph Nye’s concept of soft power underscores the strategic role of cultural exports in enhancing a nation’s influence. For China, its burgeoning gaming industry—designated as a key cultural export in national policy—becomes a leverage in reshaping global perceptions and fostering stronger ties with regions like Southeast Asia.[32] While it is true that MLBB was designated alongside Genshin Impact as a key enterprise for national cultural export in 2021 and 2022,[33] it is worth noting that the game itself does not appear to have a strong impact on China’s cultural influence. This can be attributed to two primary factors: the game’s lack of cultural orientation and its incoherent art style. First, MLBB is fully fantasy-inspired and does not place a strong emphasis on culture. As each game lasts only for a short window, there is not much room for players to become deeply invested in character storylines, let alone experience cultural exposure. Second, the lack of cohesiveness in MLBB’s character art style makes it less conducive to cultural assimilation. The game utilises splash art and illustrations from different artists, ranging styles from chibi— ‘cute,’ childlike characters—to Western comic art styles. As a result, the characters do not look like they belong to the same game, which limits the cultural influence any character could have. Additionally, in a separate survey I conducted on the perspectives of Singaporean, Malaysian and Indonesian players regarding Genshin Impact, the Chinese soft power influence of the game was found to be minimal at best.[34] For context, Genshin Impact is a game that incorporates cultural constructs in its world-building to engage players, but its impact within Southeast Asia has been limited. Given this, it stands to reason that MLBB, which does not focus on cultural engagement to the same extent, would have an even lesser soft power impact on residents there. That said, one could argue that if iconic Japanese games such as Final Fantasy and Super Mario have become symbols of Japanese culture despite lacking direct references to Japan, then MLBB, given its popularity and absence of overt cultural references to China, might similarly achieve comparable soft power success. However, I contend that the effectiveness of Japanese soft power cannot be directly paralleled with Chinese soft power. Japanese soft power is distinctively rooted in a socio-historical condition of being 'culturally odourless,' a term coined by Koichi Iwabuchi to describe the intentional omission of 'Japaneseness' in Japan’s cultural exports, including Super Mario. This 'odourless' approach, which intentionally downplays cultural markers, paradoxically reinforces 'Japaneseness' in its products, making it a central element of Japanese soft power.[35] In contrast, Chinese games often foreground traditional Chinese cultural elements to evoke a sense of 'Chineseness.' Without these cultural references, the game would likely lack a meaningful cultural impact. This approach aligns with China’s broader strategy of promoting a 'national style,' which prioritises the incorporation of 'traditional Chinese culture' to project an 'authentic and unique Chinese national identity'.[36] This is evident in an earlier study of Genshin Impact, which showed that the game’s portrayal of the region Liyue (modelled after China) is closely tied to traditional Chinese cultural elements. However, respondents in the study did not strongly associate the rest of the game’s aesthetics with China, with some even mistaking it for a Japanese game.[37] A further challenge lies in navigating perceptions that Chinese cultural exports are associated with overt nationalism rather than universal appeal, leading to a need for nuanced designs that balances cultural specificity with global accessibility. Against this background, if Genshin Impact relies heavily on cultural indicators to promote Chinese soft power, the absence of such references in MLBB makes it unlikely to replicate the success of games such as Super Mario and Final Fantasy. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) SOFT DIPLOMACY Rather than directly advancing Chinese soft power through the gameplay itself, it appears that MLBB’s parent company, MOONTON, has positioned itself as a cultural and social ambassador for China by leveraging on MLBB’s popularity to carry out Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects in Southeast Asia. Like the technical aspects of MLBB which made it popular within the region, these CSR projects align with the GCI proposed by President Xi in emphasising values such as equality, mutual learning, dialogue, and inclusiveness in interactions with other countries.[38] By engaging with local communities, MOONTON’s CSR efforts are instrumental in implementing grassroots diplomacy to foster regional goodwill, representing a new form of Chinese soft diplomacy in the region. Launched in 2022, ‘MOONTON Cares’, the company’s CSR arm, aims to 'empower local communities and create a more sustainable future for all by bringing positive sociological, humanitarian, and environmental change'.[39] Notable projects in 2024 include providing relief to victims of Typhoon Yagi in Myanmar[40] and distributing notebooks in collaboration with the Philippines’ Department of Education.[41]Additionally, MOONTON has supported the establishment of e-sports academies and other support programmes in rural areas. For instance, 14 schools in West Java and Central Java received enhanced internet connectivity and resources for e-sports-related extra-curricular activities.[42] MOONTON has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National University Laguna in the Philippines to implement e-sports and gaming journalism programmes for students.[43] Through these projects, MOONTON positions itself—and by extension, China—as a responsible and empathetic actor in the region. This approach reinforces a narrative of mutual benefit, aligning with China’s broader diplomatic strategy. As Southeast Asia grows its e-sports scene, MOONTON’s strategic partnerships with Southeast Asian governments such as with the Philippine Ministry of Education illustrate how e-sports are becoming an avenue for cultural exchange and soft power. This is also indicated in growing interest among Malaysian officials. In May 2024, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Rural and Regional Development of Malaysia, YAB Dato’ Seri Dr Zahid bin Hamidi, sent off the Malaysian MLBB team to Saudi Arabia for the Mid-Season Cup 2024. At the press conference, Dr Zahid backed the growth of e-sports in Malaysia and requested the Malaysian MLBB players to 'make Malaysia famous'.[44] Additionally, in September 2024, Malaysian Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim congratulated the Malaysian MLBB team, the Selangor Red Giants, for winning the Mid-Season Cup 2024.[45] The public endorsements from senior Malaysian officials underscore the significance of MLBB as a cultural bridge between China and Malaysia, enhancing bilateral ties through a shared commitment towards growing the e-sports industry. Dorcas Gan, in her article on Southeast Asian e-sports, affirmed the growing interest among government officials, noting that 'gaming, as manifested in its competitive form of e-sports, is increasingly becoming a national affair [in Southeast Asia], especially as it has the potential to boost a nation’s image'.[46] Indeed, in recent years, e-sports tournaments have gained international prestige, comparable to physical sporting events. MLBB’s inclusion in the Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) since 2019 exemplifies this recognition, facilitating partnerships between government agencies and the game. For example, the Philippine government recently supported the MLBB tournament, Unity League, held in early 2024.[47] Similarly, Malaysia has just concluded the final tournament of the 2024 season, the M6 World Championship, in late November, in collaboration with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, and featured a prize pool of US$1 million.[48] As such, MOONTON’s ongoing contributions in this area not only strengthen China’s image as a leading player in the global gaming industry but also promote Chinese-Southeast Asian collaboration. CONCLUSION By assessing the various factors behind MLBB’s popularity in Southeast Asia, this article has demonstrated the extent to which the game and its parent company, MOONTON, have contributed to Chinese soft power in the region. While MLBB’s gameplay itself plays a limited role in advancing Chinese soft power, MOONTON has strategically leveraged the game’s success to launch CSR projects and promote greater collaboration between China and Southeast Asia at both business and state levels. These efforts have indirectly enhanced China’s cultural image in the process. Looking ahead, the sustained popularity of MLBB in Southeast Asia, combined with MOONTON’s ongoing support for the region’s e-sports industry, signals a promising future for Chinese-Southeast Asia partnerships in the gaming sector.

Egalitarian Interventionists: Why Politicians Love ‘Equality’ – O...	By Joshua Mawhorter It is difficult to find a seemingly more unobjectionable term that 'equality' is the modern West and America. Equality is often understood to be an unqualified good and part of the American creed: 'all men are created equal.' The main reasons politicians love 'equality' are because it is supposedly unquestionable in its obvious justice, slippery in definition, and unachievable. Consider the shifting definitions. 'Equality' can mean equality before the law or rule of law—as Thomas Jefferson and others used it—which actually is an limitedly achievable and just ideal, but then the same word can be used to designate egalitarianism (sometimes distinguished by degrees: 'equity,' 'equality of outcome,' 'equality of opportunity'). Rule of law or equality before the law (sometimes even called 'equality of opportunity,' which is actually different from rule of law) is incompatible with egalitarianism. Rule of law means that the law and legal system—though imperfect in providing justice—seek legal impartiality and judge people according to the same standard, not unduly favoring or disfavoring certain individuals. Admittedly, this ideal is never reached by imperfect and limited humans, but it is just and achievable by degree. Egalitarianism—whether called 'equity,' 'equality,' 'equality of outcome,' or even 'equality of opportunity'—is the opposite of rule of law or impartial equality before the law. Egalitarianism necessitates treating unequal people unequally with the hopes of reaching a more equal result. Choosing egalitarian equalism—enforced by the state—results in inequality before the lawand legalizes a caste system against people based on their belonging or not belonging to certain groups which are thought to have or lack certain amounts of power/privilege (see the Intersectionality Wheel of Privilege and Power). When it comes to 'equality,' we have to ask a few questions to assess it correctly: What is it? Can it be achieved? Is it just? Rothbard lays out an explanation that takes the definition of 'equality' seriously and its consequences, There is one and only one way, then, in which any two people can really be 'equal' in the fullest sense: they must be identical in all of their attributes. This means, of course, that equality of all men—the egalitarian ideal—can only be achieved if all men are precisely uniform, precisely identical with respect to all of their attributes. The egalitarian world would necessarily be a world of horror fiction—a world of faceless and identical creatures, devoid of all individuality, variety, or special creativity. Human Nature and Egalitarianism Humans always and necessarily exist in a world of scarcity, change, temporality, finitude, diversity, subjective valuation, judgment, action, and choice. Rothbard writes that, '[mankind] is uniquely characterized by a high degree of variety, diversity, differentiation; in short, inequality.' Given those realities, there is no reason to expect any two—let alone more—diverse human beings to ever be equal or be made equal, either in exact 'results' or 'opportunities.' Technically, equality is a spatial and mathematical term of measurement. Even if we skip the problem of unique, diverse, humans with varied subjective preferences being calculated by numerical terms of measurement, so-called equality between humans cannot exist in a world of change, diverse space, time, action, and choice. Only non-acting, non-choosing, non-human quantities, existing in a state of static equilibrium, could possibly even get near 'equality.' Why Politicians Love 'Equality' Generously admitting the convergence of some sloppy definitional thinking, not considering the consequences, and a desire to do what is right regarding people in some cases, I believe that politicians and many others love 'equality' because it is seemingly unquestionable and eternally unachievable. In fact, it might be better said that political elites actually love 'inequality' because its continued, stubborn existence allows them to blame others for their moral failures by not being equal. Were it possible—though it is not even theoretically possible—interventionists and political elites would be disappointed if 'equality' was ever reached. They would be out of a job! The supposed obviousness of the justice of 'equality' (egalitarianism) shields it from scrutiny. This allows political elites—who always like to be 'more equal than others' themselves—to violate the rule of law, intervene constantly in the economy, create castes, enrich themselves, and treat people unequally. Whenever inequality is present, it is supposed to be sufficient justification for the fact that some ethical injustice has taken place and intervention is necessary to correct it. Equality and inequality are also supposed to be measurable statistically, which then implies that every statistical disparity represents an injustice that requires redress (especially by the political state). Thus, the elite obsession with data and statistics—every difference is an opportunity. Conveniently for the egalitarian interventionist, Sowell reminds us, 'Statistical disparities extend into every aspect of human life' in Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality? (p. 19). These statistical disparities—for whatever reasons they exist—are irresistible to interventionists. These differences give opportunity for the use of power. Hoppe explains, 'the egalitarian doctrine achieved this status not because it is true, but because it provides the perfect intellectual cover for the drive toward totalitarian social control by a ruling elite.' And Rothbard reminds us that 'ideologues and researchers…dream up and discover new groups that need egalitarianizing.' There are some that see through this and recognize that empowering egalitarian interventionists does not achieve equality, but it does accrue power to these interventionists. This was the disillusionment of former communist Michael Bakunin, I am not a communist, because communism concentrates and swallows up in itself for the benefit of the State all the forces of society, because it inevitably leads to the concentration of property in the hands of the State, whereas I want the abolition of the State.... (cited by E. H. Carr, Michael Bakunin, p. 356, emphasisadded) Historically, this has led to perpetual revolution to achieve egalitarianism, always further empowering the state. Every difference is supposed to justify a revolutionary overthrow of society, always empowering collectivism. For example, Mao’s China was described the following way in The Messiah and the Mandarins: Mao Tsetung and the Ironies of Power (p. 187), 'Revolution was the proper occupation of the masses, Mao believed, for only through perpetual revolution could he realize his vision of an egalitarian collective society.' The quest for egalitarianism did not make people more equal—though perhaps closer to equal misery—but it did empower the state and lead to millions of deaths. The continual existence of inequality allows for an envious power elite to gain greater power by convincing people that they are on an altruistic quest for justice, defined in terms of 'equality.' Though no two unique individuals are or ever will be equal, especially in a voluntary society, this situation necessitates 'the permanent imposition of a power elite armed with devastating coercive power.' Ironically, in order to make us all 'equal' requires a 'powerful ruling elite to wield the formidable weapons of coercion and even terror' to achieve it. Further, if individuals—A and B—are unequal, the supposed way to 'correct' this is for A to give money to C (state elites), for C to keep quite a bit (making C unequal), then giving some to B. We are also supposed to trust that if we just give these 'compassionate' and 'wise' individuals enough power—making them vastly unequal to us in power, decision-making, and wealth—that social equality will be the result. The English philosopher, quoted by Rothbard on this topic, said, ...the Procrustean ideal has, as it is bound to have, the most powerful attraction for those already playing or hoping in the future to play prominent or rewarding parts in the machinery of enforcement. Further, Rothbard also quoted the Marxist-Leninist sociologist Frank Parkin, noting that he missed the obvious implications of his own statement, Egalitarianism seems to require a political system in which the state [a group of power elites] is able to hold in check those social and occupational groups which, by virtue of their skills or education or personal attributes, might otherwise attempt to stake claims to a disproportionate share of society’s rewards. The most effective way of holding such groups in check is by denying the right to organize politically, or, in other ways, to undermine social equality. This presumably is the reasoning underlying the Marxist-Leninist case for a political order based upon the dictatorship of the proletariat. (Class Inequality and Political Order, p. 183) Egalitarianism versus Rule of Law Equality before the law or rule of law is incompatible with egalitarianism. A society must pick one because it cannot have both. The US is in a constant and contradictory toggle between these two ideals. Appealing to so-called 'equality of opportunity' (if different than rule of law) will not help and, in fact, shares the foundation with egalitarianism—a government elite must create legal castes and treat people with legal partiality to guarantee an 'equal starting-point' (an impossibility for any unique individuals). Politicians, progressives, and other interventionists love 'equality' and 'inequality' because—wherever they find differences in the unique, diverse, varied experience of individuals and/or groups ('classes')—this allegedly provides the opportunity and necessity for intervention, especially by the state, in the name of 'justice.' This so-called 'justice' does the exact opposite of what it claims to oppose—creating castes by legally privileging and/or disadvantaging individuals based on shared classifications. People admit that the goal is worthy and quibble over 'equality of opportunity' versus 'equality of results.' The goal is also never achieved, therefore, following the previous interventions for 'equality' that inevitably failed, the next rounds of interventions are justified. Egalitarianism—often shielding itself under the slippery term 'equality'—cannot be achieved and is not just. The 'government'—really a euphemism and political class of egalitarian interventions—gets to pose as the neutral, compassionate, unbiased referee-rearranger, armed with the right to measure disparities, determine which ones are important, then treat citizens with legal partiality in order to allegedly make us 'equal.'

Pentagon Says Gender Dysphoria Incompatible With Military, Servic...	Service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria will soon be processed for separation by their respective services, according to a new policy memorandum from the Defense Department's Office of Personnel and Readiness. In a Feb. 26, 2025 policy memorandum titled 'Additional Guidance on Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,' the department detailed, among other things, how affected service members will be separated from the military, the use of pronouns, using sex for determining both adherence to standards as well as use of shared military facilities, and cessation of department funding for medical care related to gender dysphoria. 'It is the policy of the United States government to establish high standards for service member readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,' the policy memorandum reads. 'This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria or who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria.' Service members affected by the policy may apply for and be considered for a waiver on a case-by-case basis if there is a compelling government interest in retaining the service member who directly supports warfighting. If they don't obtain a waiver, service members with gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service and must be processed for separation. Those service members may elect to separate from service voluntarily and will be eligible for voluntary separation pay if they choose that route. Those same service members will also not have to repay any bonuses received, even if they have a remaining service obligation. Service members who choose to be separated involuntarily will be eligible for involuntary separation pay, which is less than voluntary separation pay. Those service members may be required to pay back any bonuses they received. As an example, an E-5 service member with 10 years of service would collect $101,628 in voluntary separation pay, while that same service member would collect $50,814 in involuntary separation pay. Additionally, impacted service members with more than 18 years of service but less than 20 years of service are eligible for early retirement. All service members affected by the policy will be separated with an honorable characterization of service, except where their record otherwise warrants a lower characterization. Additionally, service secretaries will waive remaining military service obligations for those separated under this policy. The policy directs the identification of affected service members within 30 days. Once identified, separation procedures will begin within 30 days. In an executive order in January, President Donald J. Trump made it the policy of the federal government to recognize only two sexes, male and female. That memorandum said that within the federal government, 'sex' will refer to an individual's 'immutable biological classification as either male or female.' In addition to guidance related to the separation of service members with gender dysphoria, the latest guidance also includes direction on terms of address related to sex, the use of sex as a factor in adherence to standards and use of facilities, and departmental funding of medical procedures related to gender dysphoria. Going forward, the policy memorandum says, Defense Department funding will no longer be used to pay for medical procedures associated with facilitating sex reassignment surgery, genital reconstruction surgery as a treatment for gender dysphoria or newly initiated cross-sex hormone therapy. Within the department and military services, service members will use terms of address for one another that reflect their sex, including common customs and courtesies among service members. 'In keeping with good order and discipline, salutations (e.g., addressing a senior officer as 'Sir' or 'Ma'am') must also reflect an individual's sex,' the policy memorandum states. When it comes to fitness standards, grooming standards, or use of facilities, for instance, the new guidance also requires that sex will be the only determining factor. 'Where a standard, requirement, or policy depends on whether the individual is a male or female (e.g., medical fitness for duty, physical fitness and body fat standards; berthing, bathroom, and shower facilities; and uniform and grooming standards), all persons will be subject to the standard, requirement, or policy associated with their sex,' the policy memorandum reads. In addition to affecting existing service members, the policy memorandum also states applicants for military service and individuals in the delayed entry program who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are also disqualified for military service.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TYXPHda3dwWx	2025-02-28T17:05:53-08:00	
Operation Warp Speed: The Good, The Bad, And The Deadly – OpEd	I have been a strong supporter of Donald Trump since the first Super Tuesday primary in February 2016, when he trounced the competition in races held in the heart of the ‘Bible Belt.’ Those results convinced me that if any Republican had a prayer (excuse the pun) of winning the White House, he was the only game in town. One of the key elements of the Trump administration’s response to the Covid pandemic was Operation Warp Speed (OWS). A unique feature of OWS was that it was used, respectively, by Trump’s supporters and detractors to laud or denigrate the initiative, depending almost solely on political party affiliation. This bifurcation even extended to the healthcare establishment, a clear indication that medical science had been eclipsed by political science. In so doing, the physician’s creed, 'First, do no harm' was shredded. The impact on patient outcomes, not surprisingly, was devastating. In an attempt to move the discussion away from political slogans and bumper stickers, and towards a more nuanced assessment, I will examine six major OWS initiatives: Ventilators Masks Disinfectants Hospital Beds for NYC and Los Angeles Repurposed Therapeutics: Hydroxychloroquine mRNA Vaccine Development, Production, and Distribution Ventilators In preparing for airborne pandemics, it had been the consensus for several years that the number of ventilators available would be woefully inadequate. To meet this challenge, Trump pulled every emergency lever at his disposal in order to direct the nation’s manufacturing capabilities towards producing the number of ventilators required. This effort succeeded to the degree that the metrics for ventilator production were quickly exceeded, and a more than sufficient number was produced and distributed. Clearly, this was a logistical triumph…but there’s the rub. It was determined early on that almost all patients with Covid-induced respiratory failure who were placed on a ventilator succumbed. You’d think that someone in authority would have made the observation that ventilators caused harm whenever used, and use of this modality would have ceased. Well, if you thought that, you’d be mistaken. Ventilators were used for months after it was clear that they caused harm. So where does responsibility for this debacle reside? Was it with OWS for supplying too many ventilators or with the healthcare providers who, under cover of perverse incentives, continued to use them? Masks As with ventilators, there was great concern that supplies of masks would be inadequate. Given the fact that more than 100 years of public health policy and practice had demonstrated that mask use outside of healthcare settings was a useless exercise, pulling the trigger on OWS should never have been done. However, when it came to Covid, deliberately fanning the flames of fear overcame sound public health policy, and the trigger was pulled. Sadly, all of the predicted collateral damage that universal masking could cause came to pass (as has been well-documented elsewhere), with none of the purported benefits. An additional adverse consequence that has not been mentioned is to the environment. Between the masks and the plastic straws, I’m surprised there are any sea turtles left! Once again, where does responsibility for this debacle reside? Is it with OWS for supplying a huge number of masks or with the public health agencies that continued to push, and, in many cases, mandated a useless modality that could and did cause harm? Disinfectants In contrast to masks, there was evidence that use of disinfectants in viral pandemics was of value. In the reasonable belief that this benefit would extend to SARS Covid-2, OWS went into action. However, it was very quickly determined that in the case of this particular virus, disinfectant use was of little to no value. So what’s the harm in overproduction and overuse of disinfectants? I can envision three potential harms: Toxicity from absorption of disinfectant chemicals through the skin (via direct contact) or into the lungs (via vapor), especially in children, is concerning. Reduction in the usual contact with environmental organisms that helps to maintain a healthy immune system could cause severe illness from normally non-virulent pathogens. Resources could have been diverted to modalities of proven benefit. For almost 5 years, I have touted the addition of UV lighting to HVAC systems at indoor public venues as a means of mitigating this virus, other airborne organisms that are ubiquitous in the environment, and future airborne pandemics. What a lost opportunity! For a third time, where does responsibility for this potential debacle reside? Is it with OWS for oversupplying disinfectants or with the public health authorities for not calling a halt as soon as it was recognized that these products were not needed in the quantities ordered? Hospital Beds for NYC and Los Angeles Talk about a major missed opportunity for OWS to provide benefit! Soon after lockdowns were put in place, the governors of New York (Andrew Cuomo) and California (Gavin Newsom) were in a panic, believing that there would be critical shortages of hospital beds in NYC and Los Angeles. In response to this need, OWS was implemented. The number of beds delivered and the speed of delivery exceeded the seemingly impossible demands of both governors. Tragically, these beds were barely utilized. In the case of NYC, elderly patients were sent to nursing homes while still shedding virus, instead of to the hospital beds that OWS had made available. It has been estimated that 12-15,000 excess deaths ensued from this practice, although it could be more, given the roadblocks that were erected to hide the data. To think that this ghoul (Cuomo) will likely run for NYC Mayor, and could actually win, is beyond disturbing! Repurposed Therapeutics: Hydroxychloroquine In contrast to the missed opportunity for an OWS win for patients with hospital beds, there was a deliberate takedown of a likely effective therapeutic when it came to repurposing and mass distribution of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Where have we heard the expression ‘takedown’ used before? Through off-label prescribing, HCQ was empirically found to be effective in treating Covid, if used within 4 days of the onset of symptoms. Somehow, Trump became aware of this medication and was a driving force in getting it approved under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Once that happened, OWS kicked in to ramp up production and distribution. Tragically, this effort was short-lived. The attacks on the safety and effectiveness of HCQ came rapidly, driven by more sinister motives. Safety concerns revolved around the development of prolonged QT interval on EKG, which could potentially cause sudden death, and non-specific toxicity. The fact is, for approximately 50 years, HCQ was routinely used as prophylaxis in people traveling to countries where there was an increased risk of malaria. The drug would be started two weeks prior to travel, and it would be continued until two weeks after returning home. Despite the fact that billions of doses of the drug were prescribed over the decades and EKGs were never routinely done, even in people with known heart disease, cardiac problems were never reported. Further, in treating Covid, the HCQ dose was less than that prescribed for malaria prophylaxis, and for a much shorter duration (~5 days). However, studies were done using much higher HCQ doses, which, not unexpectedly, produced toxic side effects. The effectiveness of HCQ was challenged by doing studies in the wrong patient populations, most prominently in patients who were already sick enough to be hospitalized. In an act of statistical sleight-of-hand, a large study was done looking at patients treated between 1 and 7 days after the onset of symptoms. The pooled results showed no benefit. However, when the data were reexamined by an enterprising statistician, it was discovered that patients treated beginning on the 1stor 2nd day after symptom onset obtained considerable benefit, and patients treated beginning on the 3rd or 4th day after symptom onset had lesser, but definite benefit. It was only after treatment was started after the 4th day that HCQ was ineffective. Why would the public health establishment deliberately exaggerate the risks and ineffectiveness of HCQ? Here’s where the more sinister motives come into play. It was because the goal was to obtain EUA for the mRNA vaccine that was being developed. Since EUA can only be used if there is no other therapeutic, HCQ had to be discredited. The fact that Trump had touted it was used to good effect. Besides, the profits to be derived by the pharmaceutical companies from an mRNA vaccine were huge, while HCQ was a generic that would generate little revenue. In addition, liability for these companies, as with all vaccines, would be zero. Come to think of it, wasn’t the definition of a vaccine changed in order to label mRNA shots as a vaccine? Talk about a perfect storm of evil! mRNA Vaccine Development, Production, and Distribution Here, I take a somewhat contrarian view, in that I don’t believe that mRNA vaccine development can be credited to OWS, although I do believe that production and distribution were OWS initiatives. My contrarian view regarding mRNA development stems from the fact that clandestine gain-of-function research had been going on for years, where viruses were being manipulated for infectivity and virulence at the same time as counteracting vaccines were being developed. I’m not aware of any information regarding the timeline for these processes to unfold, and it occurred before OWS was conceived. On the other hand, mass production and distribution of the vaccine clearly fell under the OWS umbrella. Given the logistics of producing and worldwide distribution of billions of doses of a product with strict refrigeration requirements was heroic. I recall stating back in the fall of 2021 that this effort was comparable to D-Day preparations. I still believe that that is a valid comparison. However, in what will likely turn out to be the worst case of unintended consequences in history, this logistical miracle has succeeded in poisoning the planet at a rate that has never been seen before…and we won’t know the full impact for several more years! In this instance, some of the culpability can be placed on OWS, in that the evidence of extensive batch contamination that is now irrefutable can be attributed to the emphasis on speed over safety in the production process. However, even if the product had been 100% pure, it wouldn’t have mitigated the damage. The product itself was not safe! More definitive evidence of harm is already starting to emerge, as I predicted in my most recent Brownstone Journal post on February 18, 2025: 'Hope for the Healthcare System.' More evidence of harm will be forthcoming. Putting all of this together, OWS, as a logistical exercise, was a spectacular success and a shining example of how the administrative support infrastructure is capable of performing at a high level when properly led. Trump deserves credit for providing that leadership. Unfortunately, with the exception of the hospital beds, and distribution of HCQ, the projects for which OWS were tasked were fatally flawed. Responsibility for those failures rests solely with the public health establishment. While I’m well aware (largely through the excellent investigative reporting done by Brownstone Journal writers) that the Dept of Defense (DOD) took control of the Covid response within a couple of weeks of the lockdowns in March 2020, it does not get the public health establishment off the hook. When confronted with an agenda that was contrary to professional, ethical, and evidence-based standards, these public health officials had a duty to push back, and in the absence of DOD reversal, they should have resigned and gone public with their concerns. Watching Dr Robert Redfield, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention go on his ‘apology tour’ strikes me as being 1,500 days late, and $16 trillion short (the amount of wealth that was transferred to the top 1% as a result of these disastrous policies); not to mention the millions of people whose health was permanently damaged or whose lives were lost. Are there OWS actions that can reverse this disaster? The Trump agenda post-inauguration has certainly been moving at warp speed. Hopefully, it will extend to the healthcare establishment.

Rubio’s Rise: Can He Steer Trump’s Foreign Policy Vision? – OpEd	Marco Rubio first appeared on a prominent stage as a candidate for the presidency in 2016. During that election cycle, criticism of him unfolded actively on social media. The label 'Little Marco' was applied, echoing Trump’s taunt, alongside a comparison to a 'community organizer' for the Republican Party. Opinions held that Rubio’s career, built from youth much like Obama’s, lacked what many would deem a real job outside politics. Some viewed Rubio’s ascent as orchestrated by the Republican National Committee, filling a demand for Hispanic representation within the party. Perspectives dismissed him as a political lightweight, dubbed a 'Zero,' a creation of party engineering rather than merit. Over time, Rubio proved that early perception was overstated. As a senator, Rubio developed political experience and demonstrated that he was not just a figurehead or a convenient representative for the Hispanic community. He became an active and effective legislator, particularly focused on foreign policy. His record of co-sponsoring legislation aimed at condemning aggressor nations such as Russia, Iran, and China showcased his commitment to defending U.S. interests on the global stage. Rubio’s stance on China was notably assertive. He co-introduced the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, S.3176, on January 9, 2020, which became law on December 23, 2021, as Public Law No: 117-78. This legislation aimed to block goods made with forced labor in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region from entering the U.S. His consistent warnings about China’s geopolitical threat, economic expansion, and Wall Street’s role in amplifying Chinese influence over U.S. markets clarified his view: China was not a benign partner but an adversary challenging American dominance. On Iran, Rubio maintained a firm line. He co-sponsored the bipartisan MAHSA Act, S.2626, introduced on August 1, 2023, named after Mahsa Amini, whose death in Iranian police custody sparked global outrage. The bill sought sanctions on Iranian officials for human rights abuses and passed the Senate in October 2023, though it awaits enactment. Rubio also pressed for stricter enforcement of existing sanctions, especially amid reports of Iran acquiring materials from China to boost its missile capabilities. Russia has been another key focus of Rubio’s work. He backed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, H.R.3364, signed into law on August 2, 2017, as Public Law No: 115-44, targeting Iran, North Korea, and Russia for actions undermining U.S. security. Rubio was outspoken in supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty and opposing Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, recognizing the Kremlin’s expansionism as a direct challenge to Western security and U.S. leadership. His IMPAIR Russia Act, S.3733, introduced on March 2, 2022, aimed to impose sanctions after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Though it didn’t pass independently, its measures shaped broader sanctions efforts. Likewise, S.4937, introduced on September 22, 2022, barred U.S. recognition of Russian sovereignty over Ukrainian territory, reinforcing Kyiv’s integrity; it stayed in committee but influenced Senate views. Rubio co-sponsored the Ukraine Security Partnership Act, S.3522, introduced by Senator Jim Risch on February 3, 2022, offering military and economic aid to Ukraine before Russia’s full-scale invasion. It fed into larger aid packages, signed into law on April 21, 2022, as part of Public Law No: 117-128. Trump’s decision to appoint Rubio as Secretary of State came as a surprise to many. Yet, his nomination received overwhelming bipartisan support—unlike many of Trump’s other appointments. Rubio’s record and experience made him a reassuring figure for both allies and those concerned about the direction of U.S. foreign policy. His confirmation reflected recognition of his competence and knowledge in foreign affairs, even by those who had once dismissed him as inexperienced. Despite his strong credentials, Rubio now faces the complex reality of serving in the Trump administration. The 'America First' approach often clashes with Rubio’s established foreign policy views. The administration’s leniency toward authoritarian regimes like Russia and its disregard for traditional alliances places Rubio in difficult positions, where his personal convictions frequently conflict with the directives coming from the Oval Office. The Russia-Ukraine war is a prime example of this tension. Despite Rubio’s consistent support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, as Secretary of State, he has been forced to echo the administration’s calls for both Russia and Ukraine to make concessions. This stance, aligned with Trump’s preference for ending the war quickly, risks legitimizing Russia’s territorial ambitions. Observers noted Rubio’s visible discomfort during meetings with Russian officials, signaling his internal struggle with policies that contradict his core principles. Also, Rubio appeared visibly distressed during an unusual and intensely heated exchange between Zelenskyy, Trump, and JD Vance at the press conference. The strain became even more evident when the administration instructed the U.S. representative at the United Nations to align with nations like North Korea and Belarus in opposing a resolution supporting Ukraine. Rubio, who had spent years condemning Russia’s aggression, now finds himself standing by policies that undermine his previous positions. Rubio also faces challenges from the administration’s combative approach toward America’s allies. Trump’s trade wars and punitive tariffs on traditional partners like Canada likely appear counterproductive from Rubio’s perspective. As someone who understands the strategic importance of alliances, he likely views alienating Canada as a strategic error that weakens U.S. influence and undermines collective efforts to confront global threats. Regarding European nations, there is no doubt that they must contribute more to common defense. However, the U.S. should demand this without humiliating its partners. We are all representatives of Western civilization, and no treaty with Russia or China can replace these alliances in the foreseeable future. Rubio’s legislative work has consistently reflected this understanding. Rubio co-sponsored S.J.Res.4 on January 17, 2019, requiring Senate approval for NATO withdrawal, enacted on December 19, 2023, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, Public Law No: 118-31, affirming his NATO stance amid Trump-era doubts. Rubio’s journey from a young senator to Secretary of State reflects his personal growth and political evolution. However, surviving within the Trump administration will require balancing political loyalty with personal integrity. Rubio’s future depends on how he navigates these challenges. Will he adapt to Trump’s policies, setting aside his previous beliefs to remain in line with the administration? Or will he choose to voice his concerns, risking political consequences—even resignation—if the conflict between his convictions and Trump’s agenda becomes irreconcilable? It will be interesting to see whether he quietly conforms, prioritizing political survival, or takes a stand, demonstrating that some principles outweigh career ambitions. The hope is that Rubio’s core principles will fuse with Trump’s bold style to form a 'good cop-bad cop' partnership that restores America’s greatness on the global stage and reinforces Western civilization.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TUlIQVIBAOiw	2025-02-28T16:57:46-08:00	
Four Takeaways From The Disaster In The Oval Office – Analysis	By Steve Gutterman (RFE/RL) -- It could hardly have gone worse. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s White House visit had a lot of potential. It could have produced a mineral-resources deal that would have roped Ukraine and the United States together, at least on paper, and given U.S. President Donald Trump more incentive to support Kyiv in its defense against the Russian onslaught. It could have brought some clarity on what kind of security guarantees, if any, Washington is prepared to offer Kyiv in the event of a cease-fire or peace deal with Russia. And if nothing else, Zelenskyy and Trump could have buried the hatchet after a remarkable exchange of criticism last week. Instead, the hatchet came out again, sharper than ever. Zelenskyy departed the White House early – the minerals deal left without signature and a joint press conference canceled -- after being berated by Trump and Vice President JD Vance in what was by many accounts an unprecedentedly acrimonious meeting before journalists in the Oval Office. The remarkable exchange did not just raise doubts about the fate of the natural-resources pact. It added to already towering uncertainty over the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine and over the prospects for any kind of a deal that would halt or end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Here are four takeaways from the disastrous meeting. The Damage Could Be Severe The minerals deal that Trump and Zelenskyy were due to sign was only a framework agreement, and analysts said that at this point, its value would be mainly symbolic: A chance for both presidents to claim diplomatic victories and a way for the Trump administration to justify past and possibly future aid to Ukraine after raising questions about whether it should continue. Trump had hailed the draft deal as an important step on what remains a faint path toward peace in Ukraine. So, whether it eventually gets signed, and when, will say a lot about the chances that Kyiv and Washington can work together on a potential cease-fire or peace deal with Russia. Beyond the agreement on minerals, though, the bigger question is whether the United States will turn sharply away from Ukraine – cutting off or curtailing the military aid that is still ongoing, for example, or moving further ahead with efforts to agree with Russia on a cease-fire or peace plan for Ukraine while abandoning Kyiv. The Split Could Last Long -- Or Possibly Not The contentious meeting in the Oval Office marked a stomach-churning descent on a rollercoaster of relations between Trump and Zelenskyy, which have been fraught since shortly after the latter’s election in 2019. But it may not be the end of the ride. It occurred just when it seemed like the damage done by their earlier exchange of criticism, in which Trump called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and Zelenskyy suggested Trump has succumbed to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s propaganda, had been repaired. Asked on the eve of Zelenskyy’s visit about his 'dictator' accusation, Trump replied: 'Did I say that? I can't believe I said that.' And for Zelenskyy, the desire to secure further U.S. aid and the hope for security arrangements underpinned by U.S. power are unlikely to go away regardless of the bad blood generated by the acrimonious White House visit. So, despite the way the jaw-dropping spectacle played out, there’s a chance -- however small -- that the wounds could be patched up. The U.S.-Europe Rift Could Widen Ties between the United States and most of the European Union have been tense since Trump returned to office for a second term on January 20, with stark differences over policies toward Ukraine and Russia as well as over an array of other matters, from trade to liberal values. The unease was underscored when Vance lit into Europe in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on February 14, saying its own internal processes posed a greater threat to its welfare than Russia, China, or any other outside actor did. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer preceded Zelenskyy with visits to the White House this week, seeking to narrow the gulf –- particularly on the issue of what to do about Russian aggression and the war in Ukraine. Had Zelenskyy’s meeting gone well, it could have brought greater U.S.-European unity as well. But the opposite may occur following the Oval Office dispute, which brought transatlantic tension rushing back as many European leaders voiced solidarity with Ukraine. In a post on X in Ukrainian, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen urged Zelenskyy, 'Be strong, be brave, be fearless,' and assured him he 'will never be alone,' adding: 'We will continue to work with You for a just and lasting peace.' A Blow To The Chances For A 'Just Peace' When Zelenskyy and European leaders speak of a 'just and lasting peace,' they mean a peace that does not favor Russia and weaken Ukraine, leaving it under Moscow’s thumb or vulnerable to future Russian attacks. When he phoned Putin on February 12 and sent top officials to meet with their Russian counterparts in Riyadh six days later, upending the Biden administration’s efforts to isolate Moscow over its invasion, Trump ignited fears in Kyiv and Brussels that a lopsided peace deal might be forced on Ukraine. Had it gone well, Zelenskyy’s meeting with Trump could have helped dispel those concerns -- the Ukrainian president said it was important that Trump was meeting with him before meeting with Putin. But it didn’t go well at all, and now those concerns are likely to grow stronger again.

The Result Of Inaction: Ignoring The People Led To This – OpEd	Emboldened by the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President, far-right groups are rising around the world. These voices present a major threat, not just to the democracy they claim to revere, but also to social cohesion, minority groups, and the natural world. Intolerance and tribalism are their common currency—social poisons that foster division, fuel hate, and ignite violence. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, Germany was reunified, and the Soviet Union began to unravel. It was a moment of jubilation in Germany and throughout the West. Democratic governments, which had been rapidly growing after World War II, seemed to have reached their final triumph with German unification. In the following years, democracy was embraced by much of Eastern Europe, Nelson Mandela was released from prison, and apartheid was dismantled in South Africa after more than 40 years. It was a remarkable time—one filled with tremendous optimism, a belief that the world had finally turned its back on repressive methods and that real change was possible; that a new era was beginning. Thirty-five years on, that feeling of hope has been well and truly extinguished; the ideal of democracy is in peril, and a suffocating shadow is spreading across the world. The global rules-based order is under attack, extremism and authoritarianism seem to be on the rise, and societies in many Western countries are perhaps more divided and polarized than ever before. Extremism and inequality The appeal of the far right is the result of a number of interconnected factors. Inequality is a major ingredient—wealth and income inequality, but also unequal access to good-quality housing, education, healthcare, and opportunities, as well as cultural activities like concerts, exhibitions, theatre, etc. Up until the late 1980s and early 1990s, levels of wealth and income inequality were comparatively low, but by the mid-2000s, disparities had grown substantially. In 2016, Oxfam reported that 'runaway inequality has created a world where 62 people own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world’s population—a figure that has fallen from 388 just five years ago.' But instead of working-class groups uniting in calls for social justice, the primary consequence, as French economist Thomas Piketty observed, was (and continues to be) ‘the rise of various forms of xenophobic ‘populism’ and identity-based politics.’ Inevitably, inequality has moved in only one direction: it is now even more extreme. Poverty is growing in many countries, while the number of billionaires increases year on year. According to Oxfam, ‘Global billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion in 2024, three times faster than the year before, equivalent to roughly $5.7 billion a day. Meanwhile, according to the World Bank, the number of people still living in poverty—around 3.5 billion—has barely changed since 1990.’ In fact, the number is increasing.' For the 99.9%, inequality is part of the economic instability under which they live, and economic uncertainty is another major factor in the appeal of far-right groups. After the 2008 financial crash (the impact of which is still being felt), support for far-right groups grew. This is consistent with the fallout from previous financial crises. Research examining around 100 such events since 1870 found that 'far-right parties are the biggest beneficiaries of financial crashes… after a crisis, the share of the vote going to right-wing parties increases by more than 30 percent.' Now we come to immigration—more accurately, the politicization of immigration. This is perhaps the single biggest factor driving people into the arms of far-right political parties and figures. It stems from a narrow sense of individual and national identity, fueling negative attitudes toward multiculturalism—particularly, but not exclusively, in relation to people from Muslim countries. These fearful attitudes are eagerly exploited and inflamed by ambitious right-wing politicians, with the aid of conservative mainstream media and propaganda spread via social media. Immigrants, asylum seekers, refugees, and economic migrants have become scapegoats for economic hardship, unemployment, stagnant wages, and the breakdown of public services. Far-right parties amplify these substantial social issues and, instead of highlighting the systemic failures (Neo-liberal policies) and political mismanagement, including the mishandled impact of globalization, they point the finger at foreigners. Blame and distrust of ‘the other’ for a nation’s ills is not only unjustified and perverse, but it also allows far-right protectionism and flag-waving tribalism to flourish. Migrants are condemned and accused of failing to integrate, of importing foreign ways of life, and of weakening—rather than enriching—the adopted country’s culture. Social division and hate are the intertwined aims of the far right, and increasingly, of panicked centre-right political parties desperate for voters. In addition to attacking foreigners, LGBTQ+ people are increasingly scapegoated by far-right politicians pushing a conservative agenda. The result is a rise in hate speech and an ‘unprecedented surge in violence against LGBTQ+ people in 2024 across Europe.’ A recent report shows that this victimization is a growing issue in Europe and Central Asia, where ‘governments are using anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric to justify restrictions on free speech, civil society, and fair elections.’ This is how widespread suppression begins and fascism takes hold—first, silence so-called ‘minority groups’; then, expand control based on spurious security and social concerns to include everyone It’s not too late These are unquestionably transitional times as we move from a crumbling way of life into ‘the new.’ While they are undeniably dangerous and filled with uncertainty, they also present tremendous opportunities. The choice of how we move forward is ours: unite and prosper, or remain divided and endure increasing adversity. Humanity is confronted with a series of extremely challenging, interconnected crises, with the environmental catastrophe being by far the most severe. If the global trend toward extremism continues, the bold actions needed to tackle the pressing issues of our time—particularly climate change and ecological collapse—will not be taken, allowing these crises to worsen. In large part, it is the failure of progressive forces worldwide to address systemic failings over decades that has allowed the far right to gain traction and spread its poison. The economic crash of 2008/09 played a role in the rise of the far right and the narrowing of perspectives within the center-right. However, like all such events, the crash presented an opportunity to reimagine the socio-economic system along more just and sustainable lines. Instead, the corrupt greed of bankers was rewarded with bailouts, while the people were punished through austerity and wage cuts. For fifty years or more, the division between those advocating for evolutionary change (think of the Arab Spring, the Occupy movement, or the global environmental movement) and those determined to maintain the unjust status quo has been clear. Demands for peace, economic justice, climate action, and more have been consistently ignored. As a result, year after year, the chasm between these two groups has widened; attitudes have darkened, and as governments have become more extreme, suppression has been legitimized. Had there been a more open, creative response to the energies of the time, the march toward the far right—currently taking place in opposition to the natural order of things—would not have happened, and we would be living in a completely different world. Even now, at the eleventh hour, that opportunity still exists; resistance is entrenched, making the task harder and the need for men and women of goodwill to unite more urgent than ever: the future of our societies and the planet depend on it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TdEgazzIRWOq	2025-02-28T16:46:00-08:00	
What Does German Election Mean For Ukraine?	By Ekaterina Venkina (Eurasianet) -- The incoming conservative-led government in Germany will face daunting challenges as it confronts a rapidly changing security environment in Europe while trying to protect Ukrainian sovereignty. On the one hand, there is 'an autocratic, perhaps even totalitarian aggressor' in the Kremlin, and on the other, 'an unpredictable actor within the system of checks and balances' in the White House, Timm Beichelt, a professor at the European University Viadrina, told Eurasianet. The 'aggressor versus friend' dichotomy has disappeared, and an unprecedented shift in Germany’s trans-Atlantic relations is occurring, Beichelt added. This is the situation now facing Friedrich Merz, Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting. After winning the federal election February 23, his center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) now must engage in difficult talks on forming a government with the likely coalition partner being the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Only after a government is in place will Merz be able to address the security conundrum. Merz has made it clear that his immediate foreign policy priority is strengthening European defense capabilities as quickly as possible 'so that we can really achieve independence from the US step by step.' He has previously toyed with the idea of a new European defense alliance, hinting at the possibility of persuading France to extend its nuclear umbrella over Germany. On February 23, he went so far as to ask whether, at a NATO summit in June, 'we will still be talking about NATO in its current form' or whether 'we will have to establish an independent European defense capability much more quickly.' 'It is a completely different constellation now,' Beichelt said. 'So, it might be time for the German government to look at [the Treaty on European Union] and somehow spell out to what extent this could actually be an operational mechanism' to bolster European defense capabilities. According to Zsuzsanna Végh, a program officer at the German Marshall Fund, Merz’s government will strive to act as 'a driving force behind strengthening the defense agenda within the EU.' This transformation, she added, will take time. In the meantime, what to do about Ukraine? As Merz tries to form a stable German government, the Trump administration is trying to cut a Ukraine deal with Russia that could place Europe in a precarious security position. By all appearances, the White House is willing to agree to a ceasefire agreement that is highly beneficial to Russia. After talks with Trump in Washington, French President Emmanuel Macron said a truce could come within weeks. 'The United States is moving forward without Europe right now because it sees the EU as a minor player on the field,' Végh said. There is not much Merz can do presently to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities. In December 2024, he promised to supply long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine if he became chancellor. The question is whether he will now go ahead with these deliveries, in a symbolic gesture to demonstrate Berlin’s leadership on the Ukrainian agenda as Kyiv has entered the fourth year of war. Végh believed that circumstances have become much more complex and that 'the context itself is changing rapidly.' Members of the Free Democrats (FDP), a centrist party that did not make it into parliament, have called on Merz to act immediately. But as early as December, he indicated that Berlin would not act 'unilaterally' on the missile-supply issue, but only in close consultation with Washington and European allies. 'The move would also have to be approved and decided by the new coalition government between the CDU, its sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the SPD,' Végh added. The negotiations to form a government promise to be complicated, but a grand coalition will likely not mean a significant shift on Germany’s Ukraine stance. Leading Social Democratic Party politicians, including Lars Klingbeil and Boris Pistorius, have been stoutly pro-Ukraine. Pistorius, the outgoing defense minister, has been an outspoken critic of Russia, and earlier in February said it was 'regrettable' that the Trump administration 'has made public concessions to [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin before [ceasefire] negotiations have even begun.' One of the key issues on the table is the reform of Germany’s constitutionally enshrined debt brake. Defense spending is becoming increasingly important given the security gap Germany and Europe face as the Trump administration’s rapprochement with Russia grows. 'The goal is not to remove the debt brake altogether, but to create room for fiscal maneuver,' said Nils Diederich, a German Social Democratic Party politician and political scientist. The conservative bloc, the Social Democrats, and the Greens will not have the two-thirds majority in the new parliament to push through the reform. And the Left Party would only support an increase in defense spending if it were linked to social improvements. These potential difficulties in getting the changes through, whether in this or the next parliament, make the question of Germany’s ability to fund its growing defense ambitions while balancing this with support for Ukraine all the more challenging. Meanwhile, amid mounting financial strains, a growing rift with the US, and difficulties on the Ukrainian front, experts believe Berlin’s Central Asia policy under Merz’s leadership will remain on the back burner. Beichelt does not expect a drastic departure from the regional course set by the outgoing government. 'I don’t see any reason why Germany should withdraw from the Z5+1 format it has established with all five Central Asian states. It is a useful framework,' he said. Beichelt believes the format contributes to the German government’s view that multilateralism is the way forward. 'The fact that Trump is now turning to bilateralism is an encouragement for Berlin to invest even more in multilateral formats,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TfNkVyX-PEsM	2025-02-28T16:41:45-08:00	
With US Support In Question, Ukraine Leans On Europe	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- Donald Trump's reluctance to grant any security commitments to Ukraine as a part of a deal to gain access to its mineral wealth has prompted Kyiv to contemplate pushing European countries to provide a ‘net of guarantees’, several Ukrainian officials told Euractiv. Kyiv’s main goal would be a European presence in Ukraine – a peacekeeping force backed by the US - to provide deterrence against Russia. Though Washington has said it would not commit to specific security guarantees, Ukrainian officials expect the US to support Kyiv’s efforts to seek support elsewhere, including from Europe. On the side of so-called ‘soft guarantees’, Kyiv hopes that foreign companies wanting to invest in the country – especially Americans and those from heavyweight European countries – would lobby their governments to protect them from Russian attacks. With much of the country’s mineral wealth located in areas under Russian occupation, they could also serve as a bargaining chip with Western countries interested in mining those resources. EU fast track A roadmap with an accelerated timeline for Ukraine's EU accession could serve as another soft assurance for Kyiv. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this week said Ukraine could become a member even earlier than a previously floated target date of 2030 if the country continues speedy reforms. 'A change of procedure could open the way for a change to reduce the vetoes in the accession process and allow proceeding faster on merit, rather than waiting for vetoing countries like Hungary,' an EU official told Euractiv. Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos, who has repeatedly spoken out in favour of bringing Ukraine in as soon as possible, has previously floated the idea of moving towards qualified majority voting for a large part of the accession process. 'Hard guarantees' As part of so-called ‘hard guarantees’, Kyiv wants to focus on ramping up its own armed forces, future NATO membership and European peacekeepers. Ukraine repeatedly said it would not accept limits or a 'significant reduction in Ukraine’s army' in the future, restrictions on the acquisition and development of weapons, or abstaining from defence industry cooperation with Western countries. Ukraine’s request for a European peacekeeping force will be the hardest to negotiate as most questions about size and rules of engagement remain unanswered. Ukrainian officials say European peacekeepers could, instead of directly monitoring the frontline, be stationed in key parts of the country protecting sea ports or critical infrastructure. A Ukrainian DMZ? While the discussion centres mostly on 'boots on the ground,' Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha stressed that 'securing Ukraine's sky and sea is equally, if not more, important.' 'Land, sky, and sea must all be in focus,' he added. The idea resembles the calls for a ‘no fly’-zone from the early stages of Russia’s war. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv earlier this week he hoped a UK-organised defence summit on Sunday and an extraordinary EU summit next week in Brussels could clarify what Europe could practically provide. A comparison cited by Ukrainian military officials is the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that demarcates North Korea from South Korea. Whether European countries are prepared to commit the necessary resources to such an engagement – the US has had troops stationed in South Korea for more than 70 years – is another question.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TbJZ3tATHmkc	2025-02-28T16:37:30-08:00	
North Korean Hackers Behind Largest Ever Financial Theft	By Jamin Anderson The largest known financial heist in history has been perpetrated by a North Korean state-backed hacker group, according to experts. The heist against Dubai-based Bybit – which claims to be the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume – took place on Feb. 21, during which $1.5 billion was stolen. Several crypto security research firms have now attributed the attack to Lazarus Group, a well-known hacking group that has been involved in other high profile attacks dating back over a decade, including thefts from banks across the world and a hack of Sony Entertainment in 2014. Lazarus, which works under North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau, now primarily targets virtual asset exchanges and financial institutions, using the stolen funds to develop missiles and as a means of raising foreign currency for the North Korean regime. The cyber attacks have prompted a series of indictments, sanctions and warnings from the United States, South Korea and other countries. North Korea has never acknowledged a connection to Lazarus. Various factors, including an analysis of how the stolen assets were being laundered, points to North Korea, according to Elliptic, a U.K.-based cryptocurrency security research firm. That assessment was backed by the FBI, which referred to the hack as 'TraderTraitor' in a public service announcement on Wednesday. The stolen $1.5 billion is approximately $160 million more than the total amount stolen by North Korea in cryptocurrency hacks last year, according to research firm TRM Labs. Laundering efforts The FBI asked that exchanges and other entities block transactions from a list of blockchain addresses that TraderTraitor actors have been using to launder the stolen cryptocurrency. A blockchain is an online public ledger where cryptocurrency transactions are recorded. ByBit has offered a financial reward to anyone who reports an attempt to launder the assets. 'We are taking a stand to ensure that every transaction is visible and every hacker is held accountable,' he said. 'Our multi-pronged offensive is a clear message: if you steal, you will be found, and justice will be swift.' Investigators can now quickly track crypto transactions, according to Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at cryptocurrency analysis and security company Chainalysis. Chainalysis has so far helped freeze over $40 million of the stolen funds, while Elliptic has assisted in freezing $243,000, both firms said. 'Industry-wide improvements in compliance make it harder for bad actors to cash out,' Fierman told Radio Free Asia. 'What’s remarkable about crypto is that the eyes of the ecosystem are on the funds as they move through the blockchain,' he said. 'This level of visibility wouldn’t be possible in traditional financial markets.' Even so, the hackers have been able to launder more than $400 million through various digital assets, according to Ari Redbord of TRM Labs. The laundering process includes transfers through intermediary wallets, conversion into different cryptocurrencies and the use of decentralized exchanges, he told RFA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TTQiPXg-0Q6P	2025-02-28T16:32:13-08:00	
Commemorating USAID – OpEd	On February 5, the story of the most successful U.S. foreign policy project of all time officially ended with a terse message on the USAID website. The United States Agency for International Development was established in November 1961 by John F. Kennedy as part of restructuring U.S. foreign aid programs in the context of the confrontation with the Soviet Union. Remarkably, USAID was the first U.S. organization provided long-term social and economic support to other countries, and some programs have been in operation for decades. The agency's average annual budget - more than $50 billion - was larger than the GDP of 90 countries around the world. This made USAID the world's leading official aid agency, both in relative and absolute monetary terms. Approximately 1% of the U.S. federal budget was allocated to fund the programs of this organization. To date, more than 100 countries around the world received humanitarian aid from USAID. In 2023 alone, the agency disbursed more than $72 billion, more than 16 of which were sent to Ukraine. Jordan, Afghanistan, Syria, Ethiopia, Jordan, Ethiopia, and Somalia have also received significant payments. USAID provided considerable development assistance to Ukraine, where, according to various sources, there were between 40 and 115 programs with about 11,000 employees and a total budget of about 2.5 percent of the country's GDP. The agency's activities were varied: USAID ensured much of the country's energy and food security, supported democracy, human rights, legal, anti-corruption, social, medical, and educational projects, and promoted media development in Ukraine. Despite all its social and public importance around the world, the agency has been heavily criticized. In fact, the biggest and most vicious blow to the organization was delivered by Elon Musk as part of Donald Trump's fight against Democratic influence. Musk, who was appointed to head the Office of Government Efficiency, made USAID one of his main targets, accusing the agency of inefficient spending and working in close collaboration with the CIA. Both allegations are difficult to prove or deny without evidence. However, misuse of funds in such a large organization with a serious budget is unfortunately not surprising and certainly has its place. But in light of the overall performance of the agency, it would make more sense to conduct a serious audit of the company's operations and identify mismanaged spending than to shut down the organization entirely. Washington also promotes its own agenda with humanitarian aid. Some would call this a conspiracy theory, but it's naive to believe that foreign policy is not controlled by intelligence agencies. By suspending the agency, Trump is not only depriving Ukraine of aid, but also the most vulnerable poorest countries in Africa and the Middle East. Trump isn't the first to try to rationalize government spending. In 1982, the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, initiated the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, better known as the Grace Commission. The goal of the commission was to analyze the efficiency of government spending and find ways to reduce the budget deficit. More than 2,000 volunteers from the private sector, including top executives from major U.S. corporations, were part of the commission. They examined 2,000 federal programs and focused on eliminating inefficiencies and duplication, adopting private sector management techniques, reducing bureaucracy and simplifying processes, and increasing transparency and accountability. However, the results of the Commission's work were disappointing: out of 2,478 recommendations, the vast majority were not implemented. In particular, the state was not ready for such large-scale reforms. Officials were concerned about the excessive focus on privatization of state functions. As a consequence, current efforts to reduce government spending, which has been on the rise around the world, could have an impact on key aspects of U.S. domestic and foreign policy According to the commissioners' plan, if all the recommendations were implemented (which, according to some economists and officials, seemed unrealistic), it was planned to save 1.9 trillion dollars by the year 2000, while Musk, without much thought, declared his ability to reduce budget expenditures by 2 trillion dollars. In addition to blatant populism, Musk's statements reveal overt lobbying for big business. Unfortunately, the political challenges of 2025 did not allow USAID to operate in the same way. Undoubtedly, the United States will not abandon such a large and effective soft power tool. However, the concept and principles of its work, as well as the scale of its assistance, will certainly be reviewed. It has already been announced that the agency's activities will be taken over by the US Department of State. Due to Trump's desire for isolationism, and in an effort to increse his own power, hundreds of millions of people around the world are at risk of being deprived of support, which will affect the state of their civil rights and freedoms, the volume and quality of consumer baskets, as well as access to information. Born out of the reforms of the 1960s, USAID fell victim to similar reforms in 2025. Unable to withstand the pressures of the political environment, the agency faded into oblivion, ending an era of foreign policy prosperity that lasted more than 60 years.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TdybhY9v9IG4	2025-02-28T16:26:59-08:00	
Lebanon PM Demands ‘Full Israeli Withdrawal’	By Najia Houssari Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam on Friday called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the country, and promised residents of border villages a safe return home and reconstruction of their properties. Salam was speaking during a visit to the border area amid a partial Israel withdrawal. However, Israeli troops continue to occupy five strategic hills in the region, blocking the road connecting the border areas. Salam said on Friday that the Lebanese army 'is carrying out its responsibilities to the fullest, reinforcing its deployment with determination and resolve to uphold stability in the south and ensure the safe return of our people to their villages and homes.' He said that 'the army is the entity in charge of defending Lebanon and accordingly, it should preserve the country’s security, protect its people, and safeguard its sovereignty and the unity and security of its territory.' After his government won a confidence vote in parliament this week, Salam visited the army’s barracks in Tyre and Marjayoun, as well as Khiam and Nabatieh. Ministers and Maj. Gen. Hassan Aoude, the acting army commander, accompanied the prime minister. The visit came hours after Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz claimed in a statement that 'Israel has received a green light from the US to stay in the buffer zone in southern Lebanon.' He said that 'our forces will stay indefinitely in the buffer zone, south of Lebanon.' The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the Israeli defense minister’s claims, saying that 'the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon clearly stipulates that Israel must withdraw from the south, including the five strategic points.' Salam was taken to the Benoit Barakat Barracks in Tyre by military helicopter. The Lebanese PM and his delegation held a meeting at the sector’s headquarters with Brig. Gen. Edgar Lawandos, commander of the southern Litani sector in the Lebanese army. Salam said that the government 'is committed to supporting the Lebanese army, by expanding its manpower, upgrading its equipment and training, and improving service conditions, to enhance its defensive capabilities.' He also condemned 'any attack on UNIFIL,' in light of the Feb. 15 violence on the Beirut Airport road. Protesters — angered by the denial of landing clearance for an Iranian plane — attacked a UNIFIL convoy heading to the airport, injuring the deputy commander and his escort, who were both taken to the hospital. Salam said that 'firm action' will be taken to arrest and hold those responsible to account. 'We are taking all necessary measures to ensure it does not recur,' he said. Salam commended UNIFIL’s role as a peacekeeping force in Lebanon and the south since 1978, with 'many of its members sacrificing their lives to fulfill its mission.' He praised UNIFIL’s 'close cooperation with the army and Lebanese authorities to implement UN Resolution 1701, to enhance the security and stability of Lebanon and the south.' On Thursday, the Government Commissioner at the Military Court, Judge Fadi Akiki, charged 20 people, including four detainees and two minors, with involvement in the attack on the UNIFIL convoy. The charges included 'attempted murder of the convoy’s members by burning the vehicle, assaulting the security forces and forming a group to undermine the authority and steal money worth $29,000 that was in the wallet of the UNIFIL deputy commander who was leaving Lebanon and returning to his country at the end of his mission.' Following his visit to the military barracks, Salam met with a delegation from the border town of Dhayra. Residents staged a protest outside the barracks to voice their suffering to the prime minister over the Israeli forces’ incursions into their lands, especially the destroyed southern neighborhood. Salam promised the delegation that ministers will work to ensure 'a safe return to your homes as soon as possible, and a commitment to the reconstruction process for the residents to return with dignity.' He said: 'Before receiving the confidence vote, the government started to mobilize all Arab and international support to force the enemy to withdraw from our lands and the so-called five points; There is no real and sustainable stability without Israel’s complete withdrawal.' From Khiam, where he surveyed the Israeli destruction, Salam said: 'We will only accept the complete withdrawal of the enemy from Lebanon, as Israel has repeatedly violated our sovereignty and land.' In Nabatieh, several protesters criticized the prime minister for failing to thank 'the resistance and only expressing gratitude to the army in the south.' Another protester questioned 'the possibility of reclaiming the occupied hills through dialogue.' Salam’s visit to the south coincided with further Israeli airspace violations over Lebanon, as Hezbollah held funerals for 130 people, including party fighters and civilians killed in Israeli airstrikes during the recent war. Trucks carried dozens of coffins along the road to the towns of Aitaroun and Aita Al-Shaab on Friday. Israeli forces stationed at border positions, meanwhile, carried out intensive patrol operations toward the outskirts of Aitaroun ahead of the funerals. Israeli violations also extended to the Bekaa, with aircraft flying at low altitude over Baalbek and northern Bekaa. On Thursday, airstrikes targeted a Hezbollah official and another person in a pickup truck in the city of Hermel, killing both. Later, Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said that one of the victims was 'Mohammed Mahdi Ali Shahin, a Hezbollah operative responsible for acquiring combat equipment along the Syrian-Lebanese border since the Israel-Lebanon agreements came into effect.' He added: 'Shahin was one of the key members of Hezbollah’s geographical unit overseeing Lebanon’s Bekaa region, which has recently been focused on transferring combat equipment from Syria to Lebanon.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TYL5m2tuYvIU	2025-02-28T16:17:17-08:00	
Pope Francis Ventilated After ‘Sudden Worsening’ Of Respiratory C...	By Hannah Brockhaus Pope Francis began noninvasive ventilation on Friday after experiencing a respiratory crisis that led to a 'sudden worsening' of his condition, the Vatican said. According to a Feb. 28 medical bulletin from the Holy See, after a morning spent in prayer, receiving the Eucharist, and doing respiratory physiotherapy, Pope Francis experienced in the early afternoon 'an isolated crisis of bronchospasm' — a tightening of the muscles that line the airways in the lungs, causing wheezing and coughing. The incident led to 'an episode of vomiting with inhalation' aggravating his breathing, the Holy See said. After his airways were suctioned, the pope was put on a noninvasive mechanical ventilator 'with a good response on gas exchange,' the communication said, adding that Pope Francis remained 'alert and oriented' and cooperative throughout the procedures. Friday marked two weeks in the hospital for the 88-year-old Pope Francis, who is suffering from double pneumonia, bronchitis, and other chronic respiratory conditions. In the two weeks since Pope Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital on Feb. 14, doctors have continuously refrained from giving a prognosis, emphasizing that the situation is 'complex.' The Holy See Press Office had said on Thursday that the pope’s health was 'improving' under oxygen and respiratory physiotherapy treatment. He continues to do work from the hospital.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TcaXxAyuUs_h	2025-02-28T16:15:09-08:00	
Iran Open To Talks But Won’t Bow To Pressure, Says Pezeshkian	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reaffirmed the country's willingness to engage in negotiations but stressed that Iran would not yield to pressure from global powers or enter talks under coercion. 'We should not be afraid of sanctions,' Pezeshkian said on Thursday, referring to US President Donald Trump's National Security Presidential Memorandum 2, which aimed to cut Iran’s crude exports to zero. 'Some argue that there is no choice but to negotiate with them [the United States]. We have not refused negotiations, but we are not supposed to capitulate to bullies,' he added. Speaking at a meeting with directors of state bodies in southwestern Tehran Province, Pezeshkian criticized nations that claim to uphold human rights while carrying out military attacks that kill civilians. 'They tell us not to possess missiles and munitions so that they can bomb us whenever they want, leaving us unable to defend ourselves,' he said. The president reiterated that Iran does not seek conflict and aims to coexist peacefully with other Muslim nations in the region. 'Iran has not created tensions in the region. Israel is directly responsible. It is the Zionist regime that commits acts of aggression everywhere and fears no consequences due to US support,' Pezeshkian said. He also condemned the United States for imposing harsher sanctions while simultaneously calling for dialogue. 'They have tightened all sanctions and now claim they want talks. First, prove that you are genuine about dialogue, and then we can talk,' he said. Pezeshkian urged national unity to tackle economic challenges and work towards the goals outlined by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. He also emphasized boosting economic ties with neighboring countries to reduce reliance on sanction-evasion tactics. 'We do not need to circumvent sanctions, since we can strengthen our economy through cooperation with neighbors and expansion of regional trade,' he said. 'All we need is to simplify border trade regulations so that producers and economic players can easily export and import goods,' Pezeshkian added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDmXn2Ht-TY-a1IJ0ETa2	2025-02-28T16:12:34-08:00	
Strengthening Pacific Security: US Shiprider Agreements – Analysi...	By Ray Joseph Shiprider Agreements and the US Coast Guard (FPRI) -- Early last year, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) cutter Harriet Lane, with Vanuatu maritime law enforcement officials on board, conducted an expeditionary patrol that moved through Vanuatu’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The United States and Vanuatu have a shiprider agreement. The USCG conducted a dozen joint vessel boardings with its Vanuatu law enforcement counterparts. During the vessel inspections, the Vanuatu officials found 'violations in half of the dozen foreign fishing vessels they boarded, including fish catches in their coolers that were not recorded in their logs, lack of proper records for crew transfers between ships and captains fishing under licenses not issued to them.' One Vanuatu official lauded the patrol as 'significant and beneficial.' This patrol is part of a US strategy that utilizes shiprider agreements to accomplish US and partner countries’ security objectives in the Pacific. Shiprider agreements allow larger maritime countries to partner with smaller countries to enforce maritime laws, combat IUU fishing, enhance security, and reinforce sovereignty. The United States currently has agreements with twelve Pacific Island countries, with the most recent deal signed in May 2023 between Papua New Guinea and the United States. The United States and several Pacific Island countries also expanded the range of pre-existing shiprider agreements, including Samoa, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The United States should continue to expand shiprider agreements in terms of breadth and frequency of use, ensuring it has access to the region, denying China access, and providing value to partner Pacific Island countries. Maritime Security and Tailored Shiprider Agreements Benefits Shiprider agreements bring value to Pacific Island nations by leveraging US capabilities that would otherwise be unavailable. Some of those capabilities include domain awareness, enforcing maritime laws in vast hard-to-reach EEZs, combating increasingly sophisticated IUU fishing operations, conducting humanitarian and disaster aid missions, and providing general security. IUU fishing significantly impacts regional economies, with losses ranging from $10 billion to $23.5 billionannually. A recent Congressional Research Service report states, 'Over half of the world’s tuna is harvested in the Pacific,' highlighting the region’s importance. It is difficult for smaller nations to combat IUU fishing without outside resources due to the vast swath of ocean territory. The United States and, specifically, the US Coast Guard have the tools necessary to ease some of that burden. The United States finds value in regularly enforcing maritime laws, promoting territorial sovereignty, and solidifying bilateral relationships by being a good Pacific neighbor and ensuring it has an increased presence in the region. The United States also demonstrates that it is capable and should be the partner of choice when countries weigh cooperating with either the United States or China. Each Pacific Island country has a diverse set of objectives and a different degree of tolerance for US involvement. The United States uses multiple variants of agreements to meet the needs of each country. Recent Variants The United States recently signed new and expanded pre-existing agreements that allow more flexibility. One example is the more flexible and expansive agreement between the United States and Samoa. The updated agreement allows the US Coast Guard to board and inspect vessels in Samoa’s EEZ at Samoa’s request. A recent addition to the US shiprider program is Papua New Guinea (PNG). In May 2023, Papua New Guinea and the United States signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA), which included a shiprider provision. There have been at least three joint patrols since the signing of the 2023 DCA. The three patrols, conducted by three different USCG cutters, included two PNG law enforcement officials on each patrol. The focus of the patrols was countering illicit maritime activities. According to a US Embassy press release, the onboard PNG officials 'decided which vessels to board, and what action to take when violations were found.' This version of a shiprider agreement relies heavily on the partner nation and is a first step in cooperation. An example of a more advanced shiprider agreement is the one the United States now has with the Republic of Palau. The two countries signed an expanded bilateral agreement that allows the USCG to enforce maritime laws in Palau’s EEZ without a physically present shiprider. The new agreement does not replace a physically present shiprider but rather 'augments enforcement capabilities,' according to the US Coast Guard. Another version of the expanded shiprider agreement was signed with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). The US Coast Guard’s capabilities are more valuable to the FSM because its EEZ is more than one million square miles, and the FSM does not have the capacity to enforce all its maritime laws fully. Similar to the agreement with Palau, boarding and law enforcement are allowed without the presence of officials from the Federated States of Micronesia. Going Forward In September, the United States held its fourth annual Shiprider Symposium in Honolulu. The symposium brought together Pacific Island shiprider partners along with relevant maritime agencies and organizations. The purpose of the week-long meeting was to 'gather and share best practices, exchange information among subject matter experts, and foster collaboration and understanding among participating nations,' according to a US Coast Guard press release. For a shiprider agreement to be effective, the United States must be responsive to partners’ needs. Holding annual events and symposiums is a good practice that institutionalizes interactions, ensures best practices are spread, and allows all partners to be responsive to challenges or opportunities. A less remarked upon motivation for the United States conducting joint patrols is denying China potential inroads into the security framework of many Pacific Island countries. It is easy to see why the United States looks to provide maritime security capabilities after the China–Solomon Islands security deal. China’s partnering with Pacific Island police forces is potentially a significant challenge for the US and Australian regional security framework. One way to combat China’s influence is to get there first and demonstrate the utility of US capabilities and the benefits of a strong relationship with the United States. One note of caution: the United States should be responsive to any sovereignty concerns, be careful not to overstep, and make sure the USCG has a collaborative relationship with the partner law enforcement agencies. To be an effective partner, the US Coast Guard must have the support it needs to carry out the mission. The United States has taken an important step by adding a medium endurance cutter, the Harriet Lane, to the Pacific area of operations to augment current USCG forces. The new cutter allows the United States more time on station where it can aid in maritime and fisheries law enforcement. To fully realize the benefits of engagement in the region, the United States should continue to expand the frequency of Coast Guard and Navy patrols through the EEZs of countries in the shiprider program. One patrol a year might be beneficial, but it risks being seen as a novelty or a photo op; a more regular and routinized presence will yield better results. Conclusion The United States uses shiprider agreements to grow and secure ties with Pacific Island countries. These agreements benefit both parties and make it more difficult for China to make inroads in the region. The United States should look to negotiate and sign agreements with regional countries interested in the program and seek to sign expanded agreements where the United States proved valuable to its partners. As the Pacific Partnership Strategy suggests, shiprider agreements are a valuable part of a broader framework that puts the United States in a more advantageous position in the Pacific and provides tangible benefits for local partners as the Indo-Pacific becomes a greater geopolitical focal point.

Myanmar: A Nation Drowning In Drugs Crisis – Analysis	By Windia Soe Myanmar, once known for its rich landscapes and cultural traditions, is now grappling with a relentless narcotics crisis. Key Takeaways: 1. Political instability, involvement of various armed groups like UWSA and AA in drug smuggling, and weak law enforcement have fueled mass drug production and human trafficking. 2. Youth and internally displaced populations suffer from soaring addiction rates, worsening health crises, and economic instability. 3. Harsh drug laws punish minor offenders while major traffickers operate freely, undermining harm reduction and rehabilitation efforts. The country has become a major hub for methamphetamine production, exacerbated by political instability and economic collapse. This crisis is destabilizing entire regions, with widespread drug addiction affecting families and overburdening fragile healthcare systems. This article explores the origins of Myanmar's drug scourge, reflects on past failed interventions, and considers potential pathways toward a more hopeful future. How did Myanmar go from opium fields to a heroin hub? The history of narcotics in Myanmar is tragically intertwined with the nation's past. Opium poppies were introduced to northeastern Myanmar by Chinese traders centuries ago, but it was during British colonial rule (1824-1948) that opium cultivation significantly expanded. Driven by Chinese demand, the British established a lucrative monopoly, making opium a key part of Myanmar’s economy. By the late 19th century, regions like Kokang and Wa became synonymous with opium production, solidifying Myanmar’s role in the global opium trade. Independence in 1948 brought little relief, as ethnic insurgencies erupted, with many rebel groups turning to opium cultivation for funding—creating a cycle where the drug trade fueled insurgency, which in turn protected and expanded the drug trade. By the 1970s, Myanmar had become a major heroin producer, with heroin refined in border areas—particularly under the control of Kuomintang-linked groups. Its legacy highlights the ongoing challenges Myanmar faces in combating narcotics today. The Rise of a New Scourge: The Methamphetamine Era While opium dominated the 20th century, the 21st century has seen Myanmar become a major methamphetamine producer. The scale of this production dwarfstraditional opium output and unleashes a flood of highly addictive synthetic drugs across Southeast Asia. Record-breaking seizures of 190 tonnes of methamphetamine in East and Southeast Asia in 2023 paint a clear picture of Myanmar's central role in this illicit trade, creating a massive headache for neighboring countries like Thailand and China. Already burdened by decades of conflict, Shan State has become the epicenter of this illicit industry in the Golden Triangle, transforming into a global hub for ice and Yaba production. By 2010, drug production in Shan State shifted from heroin to meth, driven by the UWSA militias and other ethnic armed groups. Before the 2021 coup, the Aung San Suu Kyi-led civilian government also highlighted the involvement of militia groups like the Arakan Army (AA) in drug smuggling as a key source of their funding. Infrastructure improvements, such as upgraded roads and expanded trade routes to neighboring countries, have also unintentionally facilitated the trafficking of precursor chemicals into Myanmar and drug exports to international markets. Recent reports indicate that Myanmar has now surpassed Afghanistan as the world's top opium producer, with estimated opium yield has risen to 22.9 kilograms per hectare, surpassing the previous record of 19.8 kilograms per hectare set in 2022, highlighting the adaptability and scale of Myanmar's drug production networks. How the 2021 Coup Fueled the Methamphetamine Crisis? Following the February 2021 coup, Myanmar plunged into widespread unrest, violent crackdowns, and economic collapse. As poverty and unemployment soared, many farmers in Shan and Kachin States turned to opium cultivation for survival because of the lack of alternatives. Meanwhile, lawlessness intensified in conflict-ridden areas like Shan State, where armed groups capitalized on the chaos by expanding drug production as a key source of financing. These groups seizedtrafficking routes, protected meth labs, and taxed the drug trade, using the profits to fund their military operations and political influence. The UNODC reported a surge in methamphetamine production, with traffickers exploiting weakened state authority. In 2023, authorities in Thailand seized 648.9 million Yaba tablets (a combination of methamphetamine and caffeine) and 26.4 tonnes of crystal methamphetamine, compared to 395 million Yaba tablets and 17.6 tonnes of crystal methamphetamine in 2019. Opium cultivation rose by 18% from 2022 to 2023, reaching a total area of 47,100 hectares. A Threat to a Generation Given the above complex interplay of historical, political, and social factors, Myanmar’s escalating narcotics crisis is harming youth and endangering future stability. Cheap and highly potent synthetic drugs like Yaba and 'ice' have infiltrated communities across the country, from urban centers to remote villages. Young people, particularly in Shan State, are especially vulnerable due to their proximity to significant drug production areas. Addiction rates are soaring, especially among youth and internally displaced persons, as a coping mechanism for trauma. A meta-analysis shows that 26.4% of displaced populations suffer from depression, linking forced displacement to substance abuse. In ethnic areas, addiction ranges from 40% to 85%, with a 40% prevalence among refugees. In Kachin, where mining is prevalent, 5% of men aged 15–49 inject drugs—far above the national 0.3% rate. Weak regulatory oversight in urban centers has also fueled rampant drug use. 'Happy Water' has surged in popularity among young people. Distributedthrough a supply chain originating in conflict zones near Myanmar’s borders, it is readily available in nightlife venues like bars, clubs, and KTVs, where private Hi Rooms serve as hubs for drug sales and consumption. Once a luxury, these drugs have become alarmingly affordable since the 2021 coup, making them more accessible than ever. The consequences are catastrophic. Addiction and imprisonment rob the futuresof youth, destabilizing families and weakening economic security. Methamphetamine use and injecting drug use are driving Myanmar’s worsening HIV epidemic, tuberculosis, overdose epidemics, and hepatitis C, especially in Kachin State, Northern Shan State, and Sagaing Region, with HIV prevalence among drug users exceeding 50% in some townships. In response, families are left to address youth drug use on their own with little central government support, sending children to ethnic armed group treatment centers or big cities to escape addiction—often exposing them to exploitation and trafficking, further worsening an already dire situation. Regional and Global Threat Myanmar's escalating drug crisis extends far beyond its borders. Myanmar's strategic location between China and India, along with its position within the East and Southeast Asian drug market, makes it highly vulnerable to the narcotics trade. Myanmar’s post-coup turmoil has turned it into a global methamphetamine hub, with armed groups and militias—often linked to military officials—profiting from the trade. A steady influx of precursor chemicals from China and India has fueled mass production, flooding neighboring countries with cheap, highly addictive drugs. Record meth seizures in Thailand and China highlight the crisis, straining law enforcement and healthcare systems. The drug trade funds armed conflict destabilizes governance, and fuels violence. Beyond Asia, Myanmar’s meth reaches as far as Australia, where 70% of crystal meth on the streets originates from the Golden Triangle. Poppy seed podsEfforts and Challenges to Combat Narcotics Myanmar has tried to combat narcotics through national policies and international collaboration by participating in regional initiatives like the Mekong MOU on Drug Control. The 1974 Narcotic Drugs Law aimed to curb drug production and trafficking through a ban on illicit crop cultivation, mandatory addict registration and treatment, and severe penalties. Despite amendments in 1983 and 1988, the law remained ineffective and was replaced by the 1993 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law. In 2018, Myanmar introduced the National Drug Control Policy with UNODC support, emphasizing a balanced, evidence-based, and health-focused approach. This policy incorporates public health, harm reduction, alternative development, and human rights considerations. In Myanmar, harm reduction programs, such as needle exchange initiatives and opioid substitution therapy, have been instrumental in reducing HIV and hepatitis C transmission among PWID. Between 2003 and 2019, the distribution of sterile needles and syringes and the number of individuals on methadone maintenance therapy increased significantly. Moreover, community-driven harm reduction efforts in Kachin and Shan States, including education, clean syringes, and rehabilitation, have shown promise. However, Myanmar's efforts to combat narcotics are hampered by inconsistencies between its laws and policies. The outdated 1993 Narcotic Drugs Law primarily targets small-scale farmers and drug users while failing to dismantle major trafficking networks. This punitive approach contradicts the objectives of the 2018 National Drug Control Policy, which emphasizes harm reduction and rehabilitation. Effective reform requires updating drug laws to align with modern harm-reduction strategies and strengthening regional cooperation to combat trafficking. Conclusion Myanmar's drug crisis is deeply rooted in historical, political, and socio-economic factors. To address Myanmar's drug crisis, it is essential to dismantle trafficking networks, shift to rehabilitation for low-level offenders, and expand harm reduction programs. Enhancing regional cooperation, limiting precursor chemicals, and providing sustainable economic alternatives will reduce militias' reliance on drug profits. Only through a coordinated, multifaceted approach can Myanmar hope to break its dependence on the drug trade and foster a more stable, prosperous future.

Inside The Ukraine-US Minerals Deal (It’s Not What You Might Thin...	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- Think the deal announced between Kyiv and Washington regarding Ukraine’s valuable rare minerals is a big deal? Read between the lines. Or the fine print. Or both. The agreement -- technically a framework for a deal, not an actual legally binding contract -- was hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a 'very big deal,' and he said it would 'recoup' some of the billions of dollars of weaponry and aid Washington has provided Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s all-out invasion. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was scheduled to be in Washington on February 28 to sign the papers, described it as 'framework agreement' and said it would help ensure U.S. support for Ukraine’s continued fight. 'This deal could be a great success, or it could pass quietly,' Zelenskyy told a news conference on February 26. 'And big success depends on our conversation with President Trump.' 'It is important for me and all of us in the world that America's assistance is not stopped,' he said. At the heart of the agreement – 17 clauses, four pages in English and Ukrainian, signatures of U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukraine’s First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko – is a proposed joint fund, that will be financed by future revenues from extraction of valuable minerals in Ukraine’s subsoils. But the agreement is just an intention to set up the fund, not its actual legal establishment, experts noted. It’s unclear when exactly that will happen. That also means there’s still plenty of wiggle room about how it will actually look. The framework also talks about future revenues, rather than current income streams, which appears to compartmentalize income from entities like Naftogaz. The state energy giant contributes as much as 15 percent of the government’s budget. It also stipulates that Kyiv is expected to contribute 50 percent of revenues from future state-run resource projects into the fund. Money from the fund will be targeted at projects inside Ukraine: 'to increase the development, processing and monetization of all public and private Ukrainian assets including, but not limited to, deposits of minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas, and other extractable materials, infrastructure, ports, and state-owned enterprise.' That’s a change from previous drafts, which had initially said the money would go toward paying for U.S. weapons and aid, something Zelenskyy had objected to. Moreover, it will take years before those sorts of infrastructure projects can be realized – possibly long after Trump is out of office. 'The deal is far too vague to have any economic meaning while Ukraine is still at war and for the foreseeable future thereafter,' said Maximilian Hess, a political risk analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a Philadelphia-based think tank. 'But if it does give Trump the headline win that he desires and sees support for Ukraine continue, then it’s a very good deal for Ukraine,' he told RFE/RL. Mykhaylo Samus, who directs the New Geopolitics Research Network in Kyiv, agreed that what’s most important is the final deal. In the meantime, he said, both Trump and Zelenskyy get to portray it as a win. 'From the Ukrainian side, it’s an attempt to stop this confrontation with the Trump administration,' Samus said. 'For Trump, he wants to show he’s got a result. It means Trump could say ‘we’ve got compensation for our taxpayers [for supporting Ukraine]. It’s an attempt to say something to the American electorate: ‘You see we’ve got another a victory.'' ‘Reasonable, Fair, Definitely Not Neocolonial Or Imperial’ Zelenskyy has a fraught history with Trump, going back to the first time Trump was impeached by U.S. lawmakers in 2019. (He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.) Since Trump’s return to the presidency, the Ukrainian leader has labored to ensure that backstory did not disrupt the supply of weaponry that his armed forces are desperate for. Trump has insulted Zelenskyy, called him a dictator, wrongly suggested that Ukraine started the war, and demanded a new presidential election as soon as possible.Add to the mix: a powerful push within much of the Republican Party to pull back U.S. foreign aid commitments around the world. Enter Ukraine’s minerals, both so-called rare earth minerals and other valuable metals, like lithium and titanium. Rare earth minerals are coveted for use in defense technologies, as well as things like batteries, computers, and mobile phones. Lithium is also a major component for batteries; titanium is used in airplane manufacturing, among other things. Trump administration officials, who see the United States in competition with China for access to the valuable minerals, have prioritized locking down supplies. That’s why Greenland has been a priority. Now Ukraine is as well. As with the language in the agreement, there’s some question about exactly how much rare, valuable mineral wealth Ukraine has in the first place. Ukraine’s Geological Survey says the country has substantial amounts of rare earth and other valuable minerals; a good proportion of that is located in territories under Russian control, however. Moreover, the U.S. Geological Survey suggests those reserves may be exaggerated. A research report by S&P Global also cast doubt on the Ukrainian estimates, saying they are based on decades-old surveys. Ukraine’s lithium, titanium, and even uranium deposits are more established, as are its oil and gas holdings. In a small victory for Zelenskyy and his negotiators, the agreement calls for the revenues in the Joint Reconstruction Fund to promote 'the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine'— although the deal says that will be defined only in the final fund agreement. That’s a change from earlier drafts, and remarks by U.S. officials, who suggested the fund’s revenues would instead go toward repaying some of the costs of the U.S. supplied weaponry. For observers, Ukrainian or otherwise, the deal is a small victory for both leaders. 'Economically, this is a solid opportunity to pull in outside capital—potentially generating several billion in reinvestment every year,' Natalia Shapoval, an economist with the Kyiv School of Economics, said in a post on X. 'Politically, it’s a gamble: Zelenskyy’s administration is trusting that deeper economic ties might eventually yield better security commitments. For now, I would say, Ukraine proceeds with cautious optimism.' Tomas Kopecny, the Czech government’s envoy for the reconstruction of Ukraine, called it a 'success of diplomatic negotiations for both countries.' 'The deal itself, I find reasonable, fair, definitely not neocolonial or imperial,' he told RFE/RL. 'The deal itself is basically a way how to make American enterprises and American business and American government interested in the reconstruction of Ukraine not only on paper, but also through concrete financial and investment schemes.' No Security Guarantees The Zelenskyy government – with long memories of the failed 1994 Budapest Memorandum fresh in their minds – has long hammered on the need for security guarantees, to help avert any future Russian aggression. But any obligation committing Washington to Ukraine’s protection or security is a major non-starter for the Trump administration. However, in what one observer suggested was a diplomatic 'masterpiece,' the agreement does in fact include a security clause – 'The Government of the United States of America supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace' – but it doesn’t commit Washington to anything. Previous drafts did not include that clause. Trump told reporters at the White House on February 25 that the agreement gives Ukraine 'military equipment and the right to fight on, and originally, the right to fight.' However, at a meeting with Cabinet officials a day later, he repeated his insistence that the United States would not be providing security guarantees. 'I’m not going to provide security guarantees beyond very much,' he said. 'We’re going to have Europe do that.' 'I'm hoping and praying that this is what Trump needs as sort of the window dressing to say 'OK, we're going to help Ukraine now’,' said Ed Verona, an expert at the Atlantic Council in Washington who worked for energy and mining firms in Russia and also explored investments in Ukraine. Zelenskyy 'managed to get himself a better deal than the first two drafts that were submitted. And so he's keen to go to Washington, sign off and say, ‘OK, great,’' Verona told RFE/RL. 'And hope that maybe this assuages Donald Trump. And Trump will be able to say, ‘See what I've got. They signed on this agreement. This is good for America.’' RFE/RL Europe Editor Rikard Jozwiak and North America correspondent Todd Prince contributed to this report.

What You Need To Know About Philippine Vice President Duterte’s U...	By Jason Gutierrez The Philippines, arguably one of Southeast Asia’s freest democracies, is heading toward a trial that could lead to the removal of an impeached official – Vice President Sara Duterte. Complicating matters are shifting alliances that have long-characterized Filipino politics, with the upcoming midterm elections in May shaping up to be a battle between Duterte and her former ally, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Sara Duterte, the 46-year-old daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, is the first Philippine vice president to be impeached. The Senate will convene as an impeachment court and likely tackle the complaint after Marcos delivers his annual address to Congress in the second half of July. Before then, Filipinos will vote on May 12 to fill 12 of the 24 Senate seats and all 317 House seats. Here’s what you need to know about the impeachment process and what’s at stake: Why was Sara Duterte impeached? On Feb. 5, the House of Representatives impeached Duterte on charges of violating the constitution, graft and corruption and of plotting to assassinate Marcos, his wife and the House speaker. Duterte was alleged to have misused U.S. $10.6 million when she served as education secretary under Marcos. She’s denied all the allegations and has promised to face off against her detractors in the Senate. 'The only thing I can say at this point is: God save the Philippines,' Duterte told reporters after House members voted for the articles of impeachment. While Marcos has distanced himself from the VP’s impeachment, Duterte and her supporters have asked the Supreme Court to stop the political proceedings. It has yet to rule on her petition. When will the trial start? Senate President Francis Escudero has announced that the impeachment trial is to begin after Marcos delivers his fourth State of the Nation Address, which the constitution mandates be delivered on the third Monday of July. How long will the proceedings last? There is no fixed date as to how long an impeachment trial can last and the case would depend on the number and quality of witnesses. In 2012, an impeachment trial of the late Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona lasted nearly half a year. Over a decade before that, the 2001 impeachment trial of President Joseph Estrada, a former action movie star, abruptly ended when his allies prevented the unsealing of evidence against him. Public anger snowballed into a popular revolt that forced Estrada out of office. He was subsequently jailed on massive corruption, but was later pardoned. When is an official impeached? The House needs a vote of only one-third of its sitting members to impeach a sitting official. Following such a vote, Articles of Impeachment would be sent to the Senate, or the upper chamber, which would convene itself into an impeachment court to 'try' the case. A vote of at least two-thirds (16 members) of the Senate is needed to convict. If this were to occur, the impeached official would be removed, and the Senate, with its members acting as senator-judges, could impose additional penalties including permanent disbarment from holding public office. Who will replace the vice president if she loses? If Duterte is removed from office, Marcos could nominate her successor from among the ranks of the Senate and the House. His choice would then need to be confirmed by votes in both houses. Duterte is the fifth official in the Southeast Asian nation to be impeached after Estrada, Corona, an ombudsman and elections chief. Only Corona was convicted, while the others resigned rather than be subjected to a protracted political process. Will the trial be held publicly and what are the implications? An impeachment trial in the Senate would be held under full media scrutiny for accountability’s sake – but while the senators are called upon to be impartial, analysts said clear political battle lines had already been drawn. Duterte’s father, tough-talking former leader Rodrigo Duterte, whose legacy in office was marked by his administration’s bloody war on drugs, is leading the senatorial campaigns of opposition candidates. The slate includes sitting senators Christopher Go – who served as Rodrigo Duterte’s chief aide – and his former police chief, Ronald dela Rosa, who enforced the drug war. They are joined by Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, the former president’s spiritual adviser who is campaigning from jail while fighting sex-trafficking charges involving minors and adults, and House member Rodante Maroleta, a staunch defender of the Duterte family. What happens next? The Southeast Asian nation is no stranger to political infighting, but an impeachment acquittal could give breathing space to Sara Duterte, who remains popular especially in the south and has flirted with the idea of running for president in 2028. Marcos is constitutionally prohibited from running again. If she were to be convicted, Marcos would be in a unique position of being able to pick her successor. He could select a loyalist from the lower House where his cousin, Martin Romualdez, is the speaker and his son, Ferdinand Alexander Marcos, is a ranking member. Analysts have noted that the impending impeachment trial is a clear sign that the once-valuable political alliance between the Marcos and Duterte families, which led to a big win in the 2002 national polls, has come to a bitter end.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50-ZY4soGc93-	2025-02-27T17:31:32-08:00	
Ukraine Military Situation: Russia Launched Largest Drone Salvo S...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Battlefield Assessment The Kremlin launched its largest drone salvo since it began its full-scale invasion three years ago. The strike package included 267 Iran-designed Shahed loitering munitions and decoy platforms alongside Iskander ballistic missiles and North Korean KN-23 tactical ballistic missiles. Ukrainian air defenses and electronic warfare assets intercepted most of these munitions. Russia launched its projectiles from multiple positions, including some in occupied Crimea and its embattled Kursk region. As previous editions of this report have detailed, Russia’s use of Shahed drones, which has increased significantly since late 2024, is made possible by the growing production capacity of the joint Russia-Iran drone plant in Tatarstan. Since September 2024 Russia has launched at least 1,000 Shahed drones each month. In both November 2024 and January 2025, the Kremlin fired over 2,500 loitering munitions at Ukrainian population centers. On the ground, battlefield trends continued to favor the invaders. Russia maintained an offensive footing on every front, incrementally gaining territory in multiple locations. In Pokrovsk, Russian units secured tactical gains. Russian forces in Kurakhove pressed forward with mounting attacks from multiple axes of assault. The Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed that its combat formations captured the tactically important village of Ulakly. Further clashes raged in Chasiv Yar but produced minimal change in territorial control. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military has been fighting with gritted teeth to hold the line. Ukraine’s 71st Brigade recently repelled a Russian push near Pokrovsk, inflicting heavy material losses and casualties on the invading forces. Last week, the Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade also turned back a large-scale attack from the Russian 155th Marine Infantry, a formation notorious for committing war crimes during the initial stages of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Both parties launched separate tactical offensives in parts of the Russian region of Kursk, currently occupied by Ukrainian forces. Yet while the Ukrainian push there seems to have paused, Russian forces continue their attempts to recapture lost territory. As in previous weeks, heavy drone warfare activity surged across Ukraine, with social media platforms littered with visuals of drone engagements. North Korean forces also continued to operate in theater. The United Kingdom’s Defence Ministry reported that North Korean personnel have returned to their combat posts following a rotation period in which they suffered thousands of casualties. Open-source intelligence suggests that the North Korean military has combat deployed Bulsae-4 mounted anti-tank guided missiles in Kursk. A non-line-of-sight (NLOS) weapon with an estimated range of 6.5 miles, the Bulsae-4 is particularly dangerous against heavy armor. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine continues to highlight new models of distributed military capacity-building for the digitalized information environment of the twenty-first century. Recently, the Georgian Legion, a volunteer formation predominantly manned by ethnic Georgians, launched an online crowdfunding campaign to procure Kaspar S2 jammers. Anti-Kremlin Chechen units fighting alongside the Ukrainian Armed Forces have also resorted to campaigns on YouTube and X to raise money for their droneprogram. Ukrainian brigades and battalions have written the playbook for future generations of fighters on how to use social media to generate funding and improve public communications. 2. New Revelations of Russian War Crimes Emerge More evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine continues to surface. A recent study from the Financial Times found that Russia’s extrajudicial killings of Ukrainian prisoners of war stem from a policy propagated by the highest echelons of the Russian military. The Russian high command has also condoned and directed the deliberate shelling of churches, schools, and hospitals, the abduction of Ukrainian children, and the systematic torture and oppression of Ukrainian citizens living in occupied territories. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) also released the report from its recent visit to Ukraine. The organization’s findings confirm that riot-control agents have been used throughout the war, though the group’s mandate does not allow it to identify by whom. States signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) are required to declare all riot control agents possessing toxic chemicals, and the CWC prohibits the use of riot control agents in a conflict. The OPCW’s findings reinforce recent reports that Ukrainian border guards captured Russian quadcopter drones equipped with K-51 chemical grenadesfilled with CS gas, a chemical compound used as a tear gas and riot control agent. K-51 was the principal riot control grenade used by the Soviet Red Army. The K-51 that the Russian military possesses is more powerful than police-grade variants of the compound and can be lethal. This report will continue to monitor Russian war crimes and reports of chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Europe Can’t Blame Everything On Russia – OpEd	Western mainstream political parties continuously blaming Russian meddling for electoral failures are increasingly out of touch with voters – at least US Vice President J.D. Vance seems to think so. Vance criticized the ‘Russian meddling’ narrative in his visit to Munich. All countries, irrespective of their political theater, attempt to influence voter preferences in other countries through their intelligence apparatus and its NGO and media assets. A fortiori, not every election that does not go the way of the EU ruling elite can be attributed to the machinations of the Kremlin. Political parties attributing electoral defeats to Moscow are disconnected from their constituents, the US vice president said. There has been a 'retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.' It seems that EU politicians would rather suppress dissent than reflect on their actions. Ahead of attending the Munich Security Conference, Vance urged Western politicians to acknowledge the rise of anti-establishment politics. He criticized attempts to dismiss viewpoints on issues such as traditional values and immigration by those who attribute them to 'misinformation.' 'If your democratic society can be taken down by $200,000 of social media ads, then you should think seriously about how strong your grip on or how strong your understanding of the will of the people actually is,' Vance said. Hillary Clinton, former US secretary of state and presidential candidate, notably popularized the tactic of blaming Russia following her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election – a claim Moscow has consistently denied – and the FBI later admitted was a fraud (hoax). The US vice president argued that mainstream parties in the EU are 'kind of terrified of their own people.' He pointed to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which despite electoral success struggles to find coalition partners since centrist factions label it 'far right' – extremist. Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, ignited controversy in Berlin by endorsing the AfD. In response, the German government accused the billionaire of election interference, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz stating that freedom of speech does not encompass the promotion of 'extreme-right positions.' In one of his first executive orders after taking office, President Donald Trump suspended all foreign aid ($68.2 billion), pending a review of its alignment with US national interests. Pursuant to these orders, President Trump’s administration has frozen all funding to the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Established in 1983, it is officially a nonprofit organization that, ostensibly, provides grants to support democratic initiatives worldwide. However, over the years, it has faced allegations of covertly influencing political outcomes overseas, with critics arguing that it has taken over covert functions previously handled by the CIA, particularly those aimed at undermining and in some instances overthrowing foreign governments. The NED has faced longstanding criticism over its role in supporting political movements to undermine sovereign governments. The Center for Renewing America, a research organization founded by Russell Vought, Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, released a policy paper on February 7, accusing the NED of functioning as the 'tip of the proverbial spear for heightened CIA and State Department efforts to foster political revolution in Ukraine.' The report claimed that the NED had funneled tens of millions of dollars to a myriad of Ukrainian political entities and anti-Russian interests and 'advanced both the ‘Orange Revolution’ (2004) and ‘Maidan Revolution’ (2014) that paved the way for the current Ukraine-Russia war.' The NED has also faced accusations of sponsoring 'color revolutions' in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan and of funding opposition groups in Belarus, Serbia, and Egypt. The funding freeze on the organization comes as part of broader measures by the Trump administration to cut foreign spending. Earlier this month, Elon Musk, who heads Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was given responsibility for finding ways to cut excessive federal spending. Musk singled out NED immediately, calling it a 'scam' and an 'evil organization' that needs to be dissolved. Trump’s 'executive pen,' however, does not stop with the NED. Further oversight included a crackdown on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Washington’s primary vehicle for funding political projects abroad. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico has formally requested that Elon Musk disclose detailed information about American grants allocated to Slovak NGOs and media outlets through Washington’s primary agency for funding political projects abroad -- USAID. In a letter to DOGE chief Musk – who previously branded USAID a 'criminal organization' – Fico voiced concerns over what he described as 'gross interference' in Slovakia’s political landscape. 'It is undeniable that funds originating from USAID were also used for political purposes in Slovakia to distort the political system and favor specific political parties,' Fico wrote in a letter shared on X on Tuesday. He urged Musk to disclose which NGOs, media outlets, and individual journalists had received US funding. Last week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban similarly announced that his government would seek full transparency regarding USAID grants to NGOs and media outlets critical of his administration, emphasizing the need to 'eliminate these foreign networks' that interfere in the country’s domestic affairs. The US spends more on humanitarian aid than other countries by wide margins, though foreign aid spending is under 1% of the federal budget. The US provides some amount of aid to most countries, including nearly every country in Africa and Asia. Many polls have recently found that a majority of Americans believe the US is spending too much on foreign aid, including for Ukraine. This is a drama that will surely play out in the midst of Trump 'taking Gaza,' the Ukraine proxy war with Russia and the global array of punitive tariffs orchestrated between the US, Canada, Mexico, China and the EU. But more importantly, how will the EU respond? Will it continue its 'retreat from values' it has historically shared with America? Will it heed the entreaty from the US vice president to embrace anti-establishment reality and cease suppression of dissent contrary to the narrative of establishment elites? Will it entrench further into protectionist, establishment mentality? The European Union is at a crossroads.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50_jHGWBAzRll	2025-02-27T17:24:47-08:00	
A Practical Way To Protect The Worldwide Trading System – OpEd	By Patrick Barron In a previous essay, I pointed out that it is very likely that the US will isolate itself from the worldwide trading system due to its past—frankly unlawful—actions to steal the assets of other countries and the increasing assault on the purchasing power of the dollar. My goal was to recommend actions that the US government could adopt to reassure its trading partners that neither outright theft of assets or decline in the purchasing power of the dollar could happen. My two main recommendations were that the US readopt a gold standard and, one, move its gold to a neutral country when dollars could be exchanged for gold and, two, move the SWIFT messaging system for international trade settlement to a neutral country also. Although I believe that these actions would save the dollar and the worldwide dollar trading system, the likelihood of either happening is very slim. So, what to do? Moving SWIFT to neutral hands, say the Swiss, undoubtedly would be more acceptable for US statesmen than moving our gold reserves overseas. So, barring that solution, we must think outside the box, so to speak. What can we do to reassure our trading partners that we will pay for their exports to us in stable money? Settle International Trading Accounts in Gold The answer is to not settle in dollars at all, but settle in gold. In other words, revive the worldwide gold standard for international trade. The mechanism for accomplishing this feat has been proposed by Alasdair Macleod. The BRICS countries have discussed using a basket of currencies, which might include some gold. But Alasdair Macleod believes that this is impractical and not a stable solution. He has proposed a much simpler mechanism. With his approval, I quote him directly, As an alternative, I proposed an independent and new issuing authority for BRICS which would take in gold from member nations and issue gold substitutes in return based on Isaac Newton’s idea of 40% backing. So for every 100 tonnes deposited, a CB would get reserves in gold substitutes to the tune of 250 tonnes equivalent. My reasoning was that a central bank would be happy to increase its reserves in this fashion appearing as a balance sheet asset, against which commercial bank reserves could be held (liability to the CB) thereby guaranteeing the value of credit issued by the banking system denominated in the new currency. The purpose was for international trade settlement rather than replacing national currencies, but national currencies could be linked to it at a fixed exchange rate should a nation so desire. A gold vault and a gold bank would be established in, say, Switzerland. Each BRICS country would send enough of its gold reserves to the gold vault that it could settle its net trading position in gold credits through the gold bank. Notice that the settlement would be only its 'net' position. Some days a country’s net position might be negative, meaning that the gold bank debits that country’s account. But some days the net position would be positive, meaning that the gold bank would issue a credit. It would be up to the participating countries to send enough gold to the gold vault only for anticipated net debit positions. If a country ran persistent net negative positions, which would be settled in gold, it would have to send more gold to the vault and probably reform its internal economic policies, such as raising interest rates to increase savings and moderate loan demand. The market itself would dictate and enforce these moves, not any single or combination of nations themselves. Bankers will notice that international trade settlement is little different in application than the way that commercial banks settle check and electronic clearing each day either through a local clearinghouse or, most likely, through their reserve account at the Federal Reserve Bank. I’m sure the mechanism is the same in all developed countries. Checks presented for payment reduce the bank’s clearing account balance, whereas checks presented against other banks increase the clearing balance. If a commercial bank runs persistent net debits, it has to send reserves to its Fed account. It does this by selling assets, probably US Treasury Bills, calling in loans, or even borrowing reserves via the Fed Funds Market from other commercial banks who have excess reserves. Hierarchy of Methodological Individualism It’s all part of human action based on methodological individualism. Participants at all settlement levels desire to be paid in a sound medium of indirect exchange. The lowest level of settlement is trade between individuals. Your son wants to be paid for mowing the lawn, for example, but he may be willing to accept borrowing the family car in lieu of payment. However, if your neighbor’s son did the work, he’ll require cash. This is the first, base level of settlement. The second level of settlement is between banks. The first indication that a bank is having financial trouble is that it runs persistent debits at the clearinghouse. Individuals and businesses that borrowed and spent more than the bank’s available pool of savings must moderate their spending. This relieves the daily settlement pressure on their local commercial bank. The third line of settlement is between central banks. Persistent debit settlements by central banks are the first indication of a nation’s growing financial insolvency. Internal economic reform in the form of higher interest rates, lower government expenditures, and minimum economic regulations are required in order to stop the outflow of gold. If earth ever traded with aliens from outer space, the issue would be the same. The Earth’s Bank for International Settlements would have to find some intergalactic medium of exchange that would be acceptable to Earthlings and to Martians! Stated another way, we may say that country A trades with country B, but the underlying reality is that certain people in country A trade with certain people in country B. International settlement is merely an aggregation of lots of individual trades. The Trickle-Down Benefits of an International Trade Settlement System Based on Gold In effect, the world would be back on a gold standard for international trade. There is every reason to believe that this process of trading and settling internationally with gold would trickle down to intra-country trades. Although countries would not interfere with one another’s internal policies, a country that failed to produce real wealth would not be able to export enough to buy sufficient gold to pay for its imports. In other words, a nation’s internal currency would be tied to gold, making international trading terms, which are denominated in gold, easier to understand, and making forecasting future currency needs easier to predict. Companies would find it more accurate to predict the likelihood of future profits. All this would flow naturally from the international gold settlement system. America needs to anchor its currency in gold in order to trade internationally. This would force the federal government—which has papered the world with fiat dollars—to balance its bloated and unsustainable budget. There is little appetite for countries to expand or even maintain trade with America unless they were paid in sound money (i.e., gold). A wise American government would agree to join such a system and not try to force other countries to use the dollar by threatening them with tariffs and sanctions. Such bullying tactics may appear to work in the short term, but they are not the basis for long term success. Americans may not realize it, but they need access to the worldwide trading system, which means that they need to join other nations in a single worldwide trade settlement system. In the long run, America cannot afford to be isolated economically. About the author: Patrick Barron is a private consultant to the banking industry.

Apple Takes A Bite Of Trumponomics – OpEd	By Andrew Moran For the economic observers keeping track, Apple can be added to the growing list of multinational corporations pledging to invest billions of dollars in the US economy. Is the iPhone maker ultra-bullish on Trumponomics, or is the tech juggernaut attempting to avoid the new administration’s tariffs? It could be a bit of both, as President Donald Trump has vowed to implement a pro-business climate, and Apple is trying to diversify its global supply chain away from China. A Bite of the Big Apple The big Apple is allocating its capital to the Lone Star State. In a Feb. 24 announcement, the company confirmed that it will open a new facility in Texas designed for artificial intelligence (AI) servers as part of a broader $500 billion investment in nearly two dozen states over the next four years. The 250,000-square-foot manufacturing facility will be located in Houston and will create servers for Apple Intelligence, an AI personal assistant for its line of products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers. It plans to initiate operations in 2026. In addition to the new AI-related location, Apple will allocate part of the money to collaborate with US suppliers and produce content for its media streaming service, Apple TV+. It will double its US Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, bolster its domestic research and development investments in silicon engineering, and launch a new Michigan-based manufacturing academy. On the labor front, the tech giant intends to hire approximately 20,000 new employees nationwide. Most will be dedicated to AI and machine learning, research and development, silicon engineering, and software development. 'We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,' Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. The White House, meanwhile, called it a 'landmark' step in resuscitating US manufacturing. Trump has been attracting a tsunami of private investment in the United States following his November electoral victory. Over the last couple of months, his administration has already secured approximately $1.7 trillion of investments from US and foreign businesses: Saudi Arabia will dump $600 billion in the US economy over the next four years. The Stargate Initiative, led by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, will park $500 billion in the United States to revolutionize the nation’s AI infrastructure. SoftBank announced that it will put $100 billion toward US investments, focusing on AI. Dubai property billionaire Hussain Sajwani will pour $20 billion into building data centers across the country. Japan’s Nippon Steel will no longer try to acquire US Steel but will invest the $14.1 billion in the United States. While it is more than likely that these companies and individual billionaires will utilize the subsidies in the former administration’s Inflation Reduction Act or US Chips and Science Act, it should be noted that Trump did not bribe investors with taxpayer-funded resources. Put simply, the federal government is not paying these entities to create jobs or construct facilities – they are doing so in the confidence of Trumponomics. Or, in Apple’s case, it might want to avoid tariffs. A Tariff Worm Inside the Apple Traveling on the 2024 campaign trail, Trump had a simple message for companies: ship US jobs overseas and pay hefty tariffs, or build your product in the United States and avoid these levies. Is Corporate America listening? Siri was indeed hearing what the president asserted, though Apple has been navigating the turbulent global trade system since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Over the years, as Liberty Nation News has reported, corporations have been diversifying their worldwide supply chains. The reasons vary, from avoiding trade disputes to responding to public health crises. The biggest victim of this international initiative has been China. The largest beneficiary? Before Trump 2.0, the likes of India, Thailand, and Vietnam were the victors. Now that the old sheriff has returned to his position, the equation is elementary enough: China is still hurting, but the United States could revive its global manufacturing dominance. It is no secret that Tim Cook has depended less on China for either production or consumption. China is now the primary location for about one-third of Apple’s suppliers’ production sites, down from nearly half in 2019. For shoppers, Apple’s shipments in Beijing fell by 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024. But while the tech behemoth has set its sights on India, a new challenge has arisen: tariffs. The White House recently announced reciprocal tariffs on all US trading partners. With India maintaining one of the highest tariff rates in the world, Trump is poised to target the world’s fifth-largest economy, though the two sides could iron out a deal beforehand. Still, if the administration follows through on its threats in the spring, Apple and a plethora of other companies might need to purchase a lifetime supply of Tylenol to remedy their headaches. Winning Is Cook playing the long game by reshoring operations in the United States? Sure, labor costs might balloon, but executives may deduce that paying more is better than mitigating uncertainty in the global economy. Whatever the motive, Trump is already following through on a key campaign pledge, and he is achieving this lofty objective without relying on taxpayers as a crutch.

Beware Of Federal Education Policies: Even If You Like Them – OpE...	By Kerry McDonald It’s an exciting time in American K-12 education. Families now have many more choices about where, what, how, and with whom their children learn. Founders are embracing an entrepreneurial spirit when building new schools and the kind of educational spaces that families increasingly want. School-choice policies that enable education funding to follow students continue to expand nationwide, with 33 states now offering some form of private school choice. These school-choice wins should be applauded, as they enable more families to exit a mandatory district-school assignment for other settings if they wish. What shouldn’t be applauded, however, are federal school-choice policies—or federal education policies in general. Let’s remember that there is no constitutional role for the federal government in education, which is why the US Department of Education should be eliminated. The only areas in which the federal government could arguably have any influence in K-12 education are in the District of Columbia, and in schools overseen by the US Department of Defense and the Bureau of Indian Education. Everything else, constitutionally, should be left to the states. Linda McMahon, President Trump’s pick to lead, and possibly to dismantle, the US Department of Education, asserted this in her recent confirmation hearing, explaining that she intends to help President Trump 'return education to the states where it belongs.' The key is to reduce the size and scope of the federal government’s role in education—not to enlarge it. Even when we support certain programs or policies—such as school choice—we should speak out against the implementation of these policies at the federal level, including President Trump’s recent school-choice executive order. The Cato Institute’s Neal McCluskey wrote a great piece on this topic, stating that 'even though expanding freedom for families is highly desirable, the Constitution must come first.' Trump’s other recent education executive order on 'ending radical indoctrination in K-12 schooling' is similarly problematic. By activating the US Departments of Education, Defense, and Health and Human Services, this order aims to end federal funding for schools that promote 'anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on our Nation’s children,' specifically related to race and gender. As with school-choice policies, K-12 curriculum and content decisions should be a state issue—not a federal one. Federal funding for K-12 education is less than 15% of the roughly $900 billion that American taxpayers spend each year on K-12 public schooling. That spending should be dramatically reduced at the federal level across the board, but emboldening Washington, DC, to chime in on specific K-12 curriculum decisions sets a dangerous precedent. Just prior to the 2020 presidential election, I wrote an article here at FEE: 'If You Don’t Want a Biden ‘1619 Commission,’ You Should Oppose Trump’s ‘1776 Commission.’' I argued then, as I do now, that the federal government should not be in the curriculum business and that—constitutionally—states are the ones to grapple with these issues. Yet, in this new executive order, Trump is resurrecting the 1776 Commission and pushing for obligatory 'patriotic education'—which frankly sounds like something out of North Korea. Some could argue that the federal government is currently entangled in education policy—even if it shouldn’t be—and therefore influence on K-12 curriculum is appropriate. But a primary objective for those who believe in the decentralization of government power should be to weaken the federal role in education and let states manage K-12 schooling. The current administration has promised to shutter, or at least shrink, the US Department of Education, but these recent executive orders only serve to expand the federal government’s unconstitutional role in education, giving it even more control over what and how children learn. That may be okay with some parents while President Trump and the Republicans are in power, but what about when the political winds inevitably shift and the Democrats are again in charge? We should direct our energies and enthusiasms to advocating state-based school-choice policies that enable families to exit an assigned district school for other options that may be more aligned with their personal values and their children’s needs. I spend most of my time interviewing and writing about the entrepreneurial parents and teachers who have created innovative, low-cost schools and related learning models, and the families who benefit from them. I have interviewed parents who left public schools for other options because they didn’t like certain conversations and curriculum around gender and sexuality that they thought were inappropriate for their young children. Similarly, I have talked with parents in states that have passed bans on 'critical race theory' and related content in public schools who felt that they weren’t able to have open and honest discussions about race and ethnicity, and their important intersection with history and culture. They, too, left the public schools for other education options that were more aligned with their values and viewpoints. Freedom of exit and choice are fundamental to a free society. We don’t force our neighbors to eat at the restaurants or shop at the stores that we prefer. We recognize that a free market for goods and services is characterized by variety, choice, and abundance—allowing us to satisfy our individual preferences in myriad ways. We are finally starting to enjoy this variety, choice, and abundance in K-12 education. At the state level, we should push for expanded school-choice policies that enable more families to select an educational option that reflects their individual needs and preferences. At the national level, we should push for a constrained federal government that doesn’t control our lives or those of our children.

Fiendish Experiments: Trump’s Guantánamo Bay Migrant Detentions –...	Guantánamo Bay has been a fiendish experiment in US law for decades. The fiendishness lies in the subversion. Operating as a naval base in Cuba, this contentious facility has been the site and location for the cruelties of paranoia and empire, a place where such laws as due process are subverted, and the presumption to innocence soiled. In this contorted way, the civilian and military branches have mingled and corrupted, the result proving a nightmare for legal authorities keen to ensure that such a facility does, at the very least, observe that sad, dusty relic known as the rule of law. Legal sharpshooters have been baffled by the latest experiment with the facility, this time from the Trump administration and its efforts to use it as a detention centre for unwanted migrants. On January 29, the US president directed the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security 'to take all appropriate actions to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to full capacity to provide additional detention space for high-priority criminal aliens unlawfully present in the United States'. Furthermore, the secretaries were directed 'to address attendant immigration enforcement needs identified' by the departments. The first flight transferring migrants from US soil to the facility took place on February 4 this year. The intention is to house up to 30,000 people, but it is already clear that not all, contrary to what the president claims, are 'the worst criminal aliens threatening the American people.' Some have been found to be of a 'low-threat' category, hardly the sort to terrify the peace of mind of your average US citizen. Yet again, we find himself inhabiting a world of dismal illusions. Such an authorisation can hardly be said to fall within the all too conveniently expansive 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), which focuses on the interminable prosecution of the formerly known Global War on Terror. The MOC is its own beast, a separate instrument controversial for 'housing' (as opposed to 'detaining') its residents. It is located on the Leeward side of the base and was created to house Caribbean migrants interdicted at sea in the 1990s. The entities relevant to running the MOC are the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) responsible to the Department of Homeland Security. Interdicted migrants are assessed to see if they deserve 'protected' status, one that is granted if the individual has a genuine fear of harm arising if they are returned to their country or origin. Historically, during the phase of their assessment, migrants receive a basic set of services in healthcare, housing, education, and job training. The use of the island to deal with immigrants has been a blighted practice undertaken by US administrations since the 1970s. The Ford and Carter administrations held Haitians at the base as they awaited asylum interviews. After a cessation of immigration detention onsite under the Reagan administration, the unsavoury practice was resumed in 1991. Again involving Haitians, only this time in greater numbers, given the military coup, some 12,500 were transferred to a shoddy, makeshift camp. Under Bill Clinton’s presidency, the camp was emptied, but the rights of those interdicted was systematically stripped to enable them to be repatriated. In 1994, the camp, in all its squalid ingloriousness, was reopened to house Cubans and Haitians in their tens of thousands. The issue of valid authorisation is not a mere semantic quibble. Trump’s actions have consequential disturbances to the rule of law. The administration is seemingly pushing, not merely a smudging of the categories in terms of dealing with migrants, but their obliteration. What we are left with is a nasty mixture of terror and malfeasance, a point that utterly repudiates basic protections offered by the UN Refugee Convention. Nor is it clear whether the administration can legally carry out these measures. The MOC migrants being transferred will not be deprived of legal rights afforded them under the US Constitution, which include access to the judicial system and legal counsel, due process protections which cover arbitrary or indefinite detention, the right to appropriate conditions of confinement, and the right to seek release from unlawful detention. It is also important to distinguish those immigrants interdicted at sea who seek asylum in the United States, and those already on US soil. A case is currently pending on the issue before US Judge Carl Nichols in Washington, D.C., though a court date is yet to be set. In terms of both cost and logistics, this detention measure is also untenable. It has been estimated that the average cost for an immigration detention bed will be quintupled from its current annual total of $57,378. Ensuring access to legal counsel and guaranteeing humane treatment will also present a nightmarish scenario for the authorities, given the scale of the expansion sought by Trump. So far, lawyers from the Justice Department have unconvincingly claimed that the limited availability of phone calls to counsel located off the base was a 'reasonable and consistent' measure when it comes to the 'temporary staging' of migrants with final deportation orders to other countries. The Trump administration’s waspish approach to unwanted immigrants replicates the pattern of deterrence and demonisation used by other countries (member states in the European Union and Australia comes to mind) that have treated unwanted arrivals as an interchangeable commodity with political objects and national security: the terrorist, the hardened criminal, the deviant, the immoral figure best barred from entering their borders. But at the very least, a firmly established legal system, if mobilised correctly, has some prospect of sinking this hideous experiment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE504jwOP08pqdw	2025-02-27T16:55:19-08:00	
DRC: Romanian Mercenaries Leave After The Bloody Fall Of Goma	They disembarked buses and gathered in a long line at Rwanda’s Kigali International Airport. Some wore stern expressions, others laughed and made small talk. Some appeared to be in their 20s, others looked middle-aged. Most wore beards. The Democratic Republic of the Congo hired these Romanian mercenaries to help secure the country’s restive eastern region, where the M23 rebel group has made a violent resurgence. They were flying back home in early February, a couple of days after the M23 seized Goma, capital of the North Kivu province, following a bloody battle. One of the mercenaries told Rwandan newspaper New Times that he had worked for a private company for more than a decade and had been deployed to DRC for two years as a military trainer. 'I only work with military, which the highest rank was Lieutenant, Corporal, or something like that,' said the man, who spoke anonymously. 'As a trainer, being employed by a private military company, I was involved in training the government military to teach someone to do something. I think, yes, I did my job on my part. When M23 [were] approaching Goma, OK, we seek protection from the U.N. [United Nations] in Goma.' Another mercenary said he has a medical degree and worked in the DRC as an instructor. 'The payment was made by the contract by the one who hired us, and I cannot give you the numbers because it depends on what we were doing,' he told New Times. 'The terms were very simple. It’s three months with one month off.' The mercenaries were among those fortunate to have survived the battle. According to the World Health Organization, 900 bodies were recovered from Goma’s streets, about 3,000 people were injured and thousands forced to flee the North Kivu province. 'The human toll is staggering,' Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 'We and our partners are struggling to assess the full extent of the situation.' The Romanian mercenaries left as the M23 continued advancing. In early February, the group broke a ceasefire when it seized the South Kivu mining town of Nyabibwe. The town is a commercial hub more than halfway between Goma and Bukavu, capital of South Kivu. 'There have been clashes since 5 a.m., and it was at 9 a.m. that the town fell into the hands of the rebels,' a civil society representative anonymously told Reuters. 'They’re in the center of the town at the moment.' Between January 26 and February 12, more than 3,000 people were killed in the fighting, 2,880 injured, and more than 500,000 displaced, adding to the 6.4 million people already internally displaced, the U.N. reported. From Nyabibwe, the M23 engaged Congolese forces in Lubero, administrative center of North Kivu’s Lubero Territory, in mid-February. After breaching the defensive line of Congolese forces in Ihusi, the rebels advanced towards the South Kivu town of Katana, 11 kilometers from Bukavu’s airport, which the rebels seized on February 14. The M23’s presence in the DRC has been a longtime source of tension between the DRC and Rwanda, which is accused of backing the rebels. Kigali denies this. As the Romanian mercenaries departed in early February, Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said the DRC’s recruitment and use of European mercenaries violated a 1977 Organization of African Unity convention and a 1989 United Nations convention. At least 20 peacekeepers, including 14 from South Africa, have been killed in the fighting between the M23 and Congolese forces, according to Anadolu Agency.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50__IMdCVDzTh	2025-02-27T16:49:29-08:00	
A Cruel Hoax: The Political Economy Of Anti-Immigration – OpEd	Deporting immigrants may deliver electoral wins to politicians if voters have been sufficiently cultivated by years of demonizing and scapegoating them. For its victims, the cruelties involved are horrific. Yet such deportation makes little sense economically. It represents a nationally self-destructive program based on a faulty grasp of immigration economics. What once 'made America great' (at least for the majority white population) were its successive waves of immigrants. What underscored the American economy's strength was its ability to absorb and integrate those waves despite frictions among them: a genuinely productive melting pot. My American schooling through my PhD stressed such points. What then reversed such a positive understanding of immigration? What converted immigration instead into an urgent danger to American greatness? What lets Trump pose as 'protecting' us by sharply reducing immigration and massively deporting immigrants? (By 'immigrants' I mean the vast majority of people who are poor and join the working class at low levels of pay. Foreign-born U.S. residents comprise about 14 percent of the total population or roughly 46 million. About 12 million of them are undocumented.) Answers to such questions lie in the political economy of immigration. Yet those answers and the political economy that generates them are stunningly absent from popular debates and consciousness. The Republican party's recent years of anti-immigration rhetoric plus the immigrant deportation policies in place across the last three presidencies illustrate that absence. Many politicians from both the Republican and Democratic parties support deportation as the necessary response to the 'costly invasions' of immigrants (often equated to criminals). Yet evidence for this demonization program has been very scarce. Its proponents seem largely ignorant of the actual economics of immigration. Most immigrants coming to the United States are young adults. The young can best manage migration's hardships and dangers. They can most readily fill the hardest jobs at the lowest pay that their desperate and vulnerable circumstances force on them. The undocumented among them are the most vulnerable. They dare not complain to the police or other government officials when employers take advantage of them and abuse them. Immigrants often send portions of their wages ('remittances') back to the countries they left. Remittances help care for children, the elderly, and others who remained there and partially compensate those countries of origin for losing their emigrants' productivity. Before adult immigrants arrived in the United States, their upbringing was financed by their countries of origin. Their families and governments spent considerable sums feeding, clothing, sheltering, educating, etc., them from birth to 15-18 years of age. They 'invested' in their young people but obtained little income from that investment because the young adults migrated to the United States. Their years of productivity benefited the U.S. economy, not the economy of the countries that invested in them. In contrast, people born and raised in the United States face heavy economic costs for the U.S. economy before they become working adults. U.S. families partly defray those costs (food, clothing, and shelter). The federal, state, and local governments defray other parts of those costs (public schooling, public services, etc.). Since relatively few U.S. adults emigrate, the U.S. economy reaps their adult productivity as a return on its investment in their upbringing. Added to that payoff, the United States secures the productivity of immigrants they did not invest in. Since many of the countries immigrants belong to are often among the poorer countries, the immigration of their citizens to the United States represents a subsidy from and by the poor nations. Migration not only reflects the international inequalities of global capitalism but it also worsens them. Migrants' countries of origin lose the adult productivity they need most. Migration transfers those benefits to the rich countries that need them the least. That 'great' American past that MAGA celebrates comprised many decades of massive and successive waves of immigrants. Impressive U.S. GDP growth in the 19th and 20th centuries owed more than a little to the subsidies provided by immigrants. Early waves of immigrants stimulated economic growth that in turn attracted, welcomed, and incorporated later waves. Each immigrant wave struggled, and most of them eventually achieved rising wages; some even rose out of the working class to become employers. Immigration and growth facilitated each other in a cycle that many found 'exceptional.' As each immigrant wave arrived, its members mostly endured the worst jobs and the lowest pay and lived in the worst housing and neighborhoods underserved by public services, such as inferior schools for their children. When the next wave arrived, its members accepted the same. The economic growth that earlier waves of immigrants contributed to eventually enabled their struggles for better jobs, pay, and housing to succeed. That growth also enabled the later waves of immigrants who replaced the earlier ones at the lowest rungs of the nation's social ladder. Thus, almost all immigrants could reasonably foresee better years ahead. The United States could boast about a remarkable degree of 'social mobility.' Carefully exaggerated by 'rags to riches' fables like those in the many novels of Horatio Adler (1832–1899), working-class belief in social mobility served social peace and often blunted socialism's appeal. This analysis has so far treated migration in terms of its national or macroeconomic effects. Migration also has microeconomic effects: its impact on the employee-employer relationship. Immigrants usually work for less pay than native-born employees will accept. Undocumented immigrants accept still less. Because immigrants can represent a real competitive threat, the native-born, better-paid workers can fear, resent, and oppose their presence. Demagogues often see opportunities to obtain votes by reflecting and reinforcing that resentment and opposition. If the migrants display 'racial' differences, demagogues can integrate racism (traditional or new) to aggravate the competition between immigrant and native-born employees. Employers have often played immigrants against native-born employees and undocumented immigrants against both. Employers' divide and conquer methods have prevented united actions by native and immigrant employees and blocked or destroyed labor unions and strikes. On the other hand, in recent years, significant portions of the U.S. labor movement have revived partly by pointedly unifying immigrant (documented and undocumented) and non-immigrant employees and, thereby, defeating employers. Not surprisingly, some employers, worried about a reviving labor movement, cultivated a backlash to reinforce divisions among employees. Demonization of immigration appealed to them. Denunciations of and demands to remove diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) commitments became popular covers for and companions to anti-immigrant agitation. In the United States, recent presidents have sought votes by using hostile words and actions against immigrants. Those presidents' plans and resulting deportations responded to several years of large immigration. Political demagogues and racists played their usual roles. Trump lifted them into his campaigns and presidencies. His second term targets the most massive deportation in U.S. history. U.S. employers will regret the deportations' reduction of profitable and low-wage immigrant employees (and especially undocumented employees). Of course, employers retain their usual alternative of automation: replacing ever more workers with computers, robots, and AI. Millions deprived of government jobs (via Trump, Musk, and DOGE) will join those technologically displaced to compete for shrinking job opportunities in the U.S. private sector. The Trumpian objective is a working class cleansed of immigrants, unions, and DEI sensitivities. It is a MAGA world that has successfully resubordinated most non-whites, women, immigrants, and all others deemed inferior by the likes of Trump and Musk, and those they select. Immigration always served chiefly the needs of U.S. capitalism. Migration was always costly, dangerous, and painful to the migrants who mostly lacked other ways to survive. The U.S. working class was often threatened by immigration and thus saw it negatively, but it lacked the political power to stop it. On the other hand, the working class also appreciated the survival and opportunities immigration offered their families and ancestors. In that way, they saw immigration positively. Over several recent decades, slow, uneven economic growth redistributed U.S. wealth and income upward. A declining U.S. empire coupled with rising global competition (especially from China), climate change's mounting effects, and consequent global conflicts drove large migrations to the United States just as its jobs, incomes, and opportunities were being squeezed. Immigration's perceived negative effects came to outweigh the positive ones. Enough of the U.S. working class's sympathy for and appreciation of immigration declined to give right-wing demagogues their latest big opportunity. The demagogues exploited the changed conditions and attitudes of the United States working class to shake up U.S. politics. Daily executive orders have undone the formerly stable political consensus of alternating GOP and Democratic governments during the upswing of the U.S. empire in the 19th and 20th centuries. Since then, as the U.S. empire and capitalism commenced their mutually reinforcing decline, Republicans and Democrats turned ever more harshly on each other. Their old political establishment crumbled in bitter conflicts. Immigration became one flashpoint, one way to define a new political direction out of the decline that no party politician could dare admit to. Trump has so far best grasped the opportunity to ride an extreme position on immigration—mass deportation—to power. However, since it will soon become apparent that deporting immigrants solves little and worsens the U.S. decline, the political project's prospects are dubious. Much the same applies to other projects envisaged by him and Elon Musk. These include the neocolonialist plans to take over the Panama Canal, Greenland, and Gaza, and make Canada the 51st state of the United States. These also include imposing tariffs around the world and disconnecting the United States from global efforts related to climate change and health initiatives (WHO). Abandoning the Ukraine war and shifting its costs onto the Europeans may provoke their resistance and reactions frustrating Trump and Musk in unanticipated ways. As with immigration, the political economics of other Trump-Musk projects (and much of Project 2025) raise similar profound questions about their logic, blind spots, and unintended consequences. The deep contradictions of anti-immigration—and other projects—are not overcome by hiding them under the veneer of slogans like 'America First.' We continue to experience the American version of what 'declining empire' means. About the author: Richard D.

Trump Noncommittal On Peacekeeping For Ukraine As He Meets Britis...	By Patsy Widakuswara President Donald Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House Thursday to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and bilateral trade ties, amid the U.S. leader’s tariff threats on Europe and demands that the continent rely less on Washington for its security. Ahead of their meeting, Trump was noncommittal on providing any security guarantees for Kyiv, including on a proposed U.S. 'backstop' to support European peacekeepers to enforce a potential truce between Ukraine and Russia — a condition Starmer required. 'I hope we have that problem where we could worry about peacekeeping. We got to get there first,' Trump told reporters at the White House Wednesday. 'Peacekeeping is very easy. It's making the deal that's very tough.' Differences remain among European allies on any future deployment of troops to Ukraine. The U.K. supports a French-led proposal while other nations including Poland have ruled it out. 'I'm absolutely convinced that we need a lasting peace, not a ceasefire, and for that to happen, we need security guarantees,' Starmer said Wednesday, adding that Britain will do its part to support the measure as part of a Ukraine peace deal but only with a U.S. backstop. Russian President Vladimir Putin rejects any suggestions of a peacekeeping troop deployment to Ukraine. He said Thursday that 'Western elites' are trying to disrupt the newly established dialogue between Moscow and Washington. In recent weeks Trump has launched direct negotiations with Russia to swiftly end the war without the involvement of Kyiv or European allies, both of whom he has increasingly criticized. He has drastically reversed U.S. policies under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, whose administration’s stance on the war was to 'support Ukraine for as long as it takes,' and 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,' when it comes to peace negotiations. Pushed to clarify Trump’s position on sending peacekeepers, a senior administration official speaking on background to reporters Thursday said that there are 'concerns' about putting troops on the ground at a 'post-Minsk I level of conflict, even post-Minsk II.' The official was referring to the 2014 and 2015 agreement aimed at ending fighting between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, neither of which were sustained. The official said there would be less concern to send troops if the conflict is 'dialed down to a functional ceasefire,' as the U.S. wants, and even less with 'a broad based, consensual peace settlement among the parties.' The type of force deployed will depend on the political settlement to end the war, the official said — a 'tradeoff' that Trump and Starmer will focus on. A key message for Starmer to reinforce is that Europeans must be part of any peace discussions, said Gesine Weber, a fellow on the German Marshall Fund’s (GMF) Geostrategy team. 'Because it would be very odd to have a situation where you have the burden shift to Europeans, but not the strategic responsibility and the strategic reflections,' she told VOA. Boosting defense Trump, who wants NATO members to boost defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, also reiterated his stance that Europe should 'step up,' insisting that American taxpayers 'shouldn't be footing the bill ... more than the Europeans are paying.' In 2023, the U.S. spent 3.4% of its GDP on defense, according to U.S. government data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In what appears to be a move to appease Trump, on Tuesday, Starmer announced an unexpected increase in the U.K. defense budget to 2.5% of the nation's GDP by 2027, then to 2.6% the following year. The increase will be funded by cutting Britain’s already depleted foreign aid budget to just 0.3% of the country’s GDP. Starmer aims to further boost defense spending to 3% in the next Parliament, which will begin in 2029 at the latest after the next general election. The prime minister acknowledged that the decision to ramp up defense spending was 'accelerated' as Trump moves to negotiate with Moscow and makes clear he is reducing U.S. support for Europe’s security. The visit is a challenge for Starmer as he seeks to balance the U.K.'s interests with those of its European allies while engaging with an unpredictable U.S. administration. 'The most important thing is, do these guys get along? Do they have a common vision?' said Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution about Trump and Starmer. That, he told VOA, could signal the emergence of a Western strategy to end the war with NATO’s support. 'If that's the case, then we're in a good position to try to promote a negotiation between Russia and Ukraine,' O’Hanlon added. On Wednesday Trump signaled Ukraine should 'forget about' a path toward NATO membership and that it should not expect much from Washington. 'I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much — we’re going to have Europe do that because we’re talking about Europe is their next-door neighbor,' he said. Aside from negotiating with Moscow, Trump is also pushing Kyiv for a deal that would allow American access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals and recoup funds given by the Biden administration to support the country’s war efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet Trump at the White House on Friday. Tariff threats Starmer is keen to secure favorable terms amid potential U.S. tariffs that could impact British exports as the U.S. hits European countries with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump is threatening more, saying the European Union has been 'very unfair' to America. Starmer is 'in a bit delicate position' as the U.K. is not part of the European Union single market, said GMF’s Weber. 'So, for him, the question is basically averting the situation where there are U.S. tariffs, and of course also trying to appease Washington in that regard, while he’s also not going on a super confrontational line with the European Union,' she said. British finance minister Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday she was confident that U.S.-U.K. trade and investment would not be derailed amid Trump’s tariff threats.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50z9FIVIytyu3	2025-02-27T16:41:52-08:00	
US Condemns Thailand’s Deportation Of 40 Uyghurs To China	By Kunnawut Boonreak for BenarNews and Pimuk Rakkanam for RFA The United States condemned longtime ally Thailand for deporting 40 ethnic Uyghurs to China on Thursday, warning that the men risk facing torture when they return to the northeastern region of Xinjiang, which they fled more than 10 years ago. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision violated international agreements and ran counter to Thailand’s own commitment to protect human rights. Thailand also faced a barrage of criticism from the United Nations and human rights groups. The men had been held in Bangkok’s Immigration Detention Center since 2014 after attempting to escape Beijing’s persecution through Thailand. Uyghurs in China’s vast Xinjiang region have been subjected to widespread human rights abuses, including detention in massive concentration camps. Beijing denies that. Thailand also has strong ties with Beijing, the region’s dominant economic player. China is among the top trading partners and foreign investors in Thailand, and its leading source of foreign tourist arrivals. 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms Thailand’s forced return of at least 40 Uyghurs to China, where they lack due process rights and where Uyghurs have faced persecution, forced labor, and torture,' Rubio said in a statement on Thursday. 'As Thailand’s longstanding ally, we are alarmed by this action, which risks running afoul of its international obligations under the U.N. Convention Against Torture and the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance,' he said. 'This act runs counter to the Thai people’s longstanding tradition of protection for the most vulnerable and is inconsistent with Thailand’s commitment to protect human rights,' Rubio said. It’s unusual for the U.S. to condemn the actions of a treaty ally like Thailand is such strong terms. Ties between the two nations date back more than 200 years. At his Jan. 15 confirmation hearing to become the top U.S. diplomat, Rubio had directly called on Thailand not to deport the Uyghurs. U.N. Human Rights chief Volker Türk said the deportation is a clear violation of international human rights laws and standards. 'This violates the principle of non-refoulement for which there is a complete prohibition in cases where there is a real risk of torture, ill-treatment, or other irreparable harm upon their return,' Türk said in a statement. UN failed to protect them The Germany-based World Uyghur Congress, or WUC, said Thailand has lost credibility internationally must be held accountable for what it said was a violation of human rights. The group also blamed the U.N. refugee agency, saying it had 'failed in its mission to protect a vulnerable group exposed to great danger and to transnational repression.' WUC president Turgunjan Alawdun said the fate of the men was unclear and that 'they could be subjected to the worst possible punishment.' Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates called the deportation a 'massive human rights violation.' 'As each minute passes, it becomes clearer that the Thai government has finally done the unthinkable by forcing at least 40 Uyghurs asylum seekers back to China to face torture in custody, long prison terms, and likely death,' he said in a statement. 'What’s also clear is Thai officials involved in this forced return, using blacked-out trucks and a barrage of lying denials, have the blood of these Uyghur men on their hands,' Robertson said. Lin Jian, spokesman for China’s Ministry of Affairs, told a regular press conference in Beijing on Thursday that the repatriation was carried out in accordance with the laws of China and Thailand, international law and common practices. 'It is a step taken by the two sides to jointly combat human smuggling and other cross-border crimes,' he said. 'The lawful rights and interests of individuals concerned are fully protected.' Lin went on to say that Uyghurs in Xinjiang enjoy economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights. 'Some political forces and institutions fabricate and spread Xinjiang-related lies for no other reason than destabilizing Xinjiang,' he said. Reversal A rights group said in early January that reports from the men indicated that Thai authorities were preparing to deport them, but Thailand repeatedly dismissed the concerns and said there was no plan to do so. But early on Thursday, human rights activists and a Thai media outlet reported that several trucks, some with windows blocked with sheets of black plastic, left Bangkok’s main Immigration Detention Center after 2 a.m. and headed north towards the city’s Don Mueang airport. An elevated highway to the airport was blocked off to other traffic as the trucks passed, a human right activist said. Media later cited a flight tracker app as showing a chartered China Southern Airlines flight left Don Mueang at 4.48 a.m. The app did not give the flight’s destination but it later showed it had landed in Xinjiang. China later reported that 40 'illegal immigrants' had been sent from Thailand but it did not identify them as Uyghurs. On Thursday afternoon, Thai police chief Kitrat Penphet confirmed that the 40 Uyghurs had been deported. He said Chinese authorities wrote to the Thai government to assure it the men would be taken care of. 'They promised to ensure their safety and conduct health examinations when they arrive in Xinjiang,' he said. 'After the government received the letter, we considered it according to human rights principles,' Penphet said. 'Then the government held a meeting through the National Security Council, which subsequently resolved to repatriate the Uyghurs.' Kitrat said 'the extradition of illegal immigrants' was normal. 'It’s no different with the Uyghurs. How many more years should we detain them? They should be able to return home,' he said. Thailand has been holding a total of 48 Uyghurs, and the Turk said he believed eight remained in detention. Questions for government Thai opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang said the government had questions to answer. 'What is the Thai government doing? The prime minister must answer to the people urgently,' Kannavee said in a post on Facebook. 'They were jailed for 11 years. We violated their human rights for too long. There must be a better way out.' A Thai court has been considering a petition filed by a Thai lawyer for the men to be freed. It said last week it saw merit in the petition and had asked for more information from authorities and scheduled the next hearing for March 27. 'Thailand has laws preventing people from being sent back to face danger,' said Sunai Phasuk, a senior Thailand researcher at Human Rights Watch, referring to a 2022 law on the prevention of torture that contained a provision on non-refoulement. 'It means the government is not only violating international law but also its own domestic laws,' he said. The 48 were part of a cohort of more than 350 Uyghur men, women and children, who left China in the hope of finding resettlement abroad and were stopped in Thailand. Turkey did accept 172 of them while Thailand sent 109 of them back to China in 2015, triggering a storm of international criticism for the decision. Nontarat Phaicharoen and Jon Preechawong in Bangkok contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50yCbvh2Vx6BW	2025-02-27T16:39:12-08:00	
Monkeys Infected With Transmissible Diseases Are Trucked Across U...	Experimenting on monkeys is cruel—and keeping them is a threat to public health. 'Ramadewa looked at the numerous troops of monkeys. They were at ease and happy and showed their liveliness. All their movements, their noisy voices, their way of sleeping on branches made him happy just to look at them.' —Verse 151:V1, Kakawin Ramayana I saw macaques for the first time along the river's edge on the island of Borneo in 1983. I was in a boat with scientist and conservationist Dr. Biruté Galdikas on our way to the orangutan rehabilitation and research site she established on the island. I was 17, had never traveled outside the United States, and knew nothing about primates. Dr. Galdikas, who celebrated her 50th anniversary of orangutan fieldwork and conservation in 2021, took a chance on me. I spent my first few weeks learning how to move around in Borneo's tropical rainforest, trying to keep up with the orangutans, who are big, brilliant, and brightly colored apes. They are extraordinary, and taking your eyes off them is hard. Nevertheless, my attention often wandered to another of the reserve's primates—the troop of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis). These slender monkeys with variegated green fur and striking facial hair bounded on all fours through the trees, with their long, slim tails acting as a counterbalance. Keystone Role in Ecosystems Macaques are seed dispersers, predators, and prey, making them a keystone species in the edge environments they occupy; remove them from the forest, and you risk a cascade of ecological consequences. I could reliably find them within half a mile of the river's edge, where they spent their days foraging, grooming, swimming, and sleeping. They also routinely wandered into our camp, easily navigating the 'edges' we had opened in the forest. The adults were fiercely protective of the infants and juveniles. The troop gathered at a large sleeping tree along the river each evening before dark. When everyone was accounted for in this troop of 30 highly social and intelligent macaques, the members would huddle together for warmth, safety, and companionship. The months I spent in Borneo collecting observational data on macaques eventually led me into an academic and research career. Throughout this time, I focused on how infectious diseases move between human and macaque populations and the consequences for primate conservation and public health. Members of the genus Macaca, with their unsurpassed ability to inhabit the edges that humans create when we alter the environment, are the most geographically diverse and successful nonhuman primate group in the world. Multiple species of macaques are naturally distributed throughout Asia. Macaques have also successfully colonized Mauritius and Florida, while North Africa is home to a single species known as Barbary macaques. Exploitation for Biomedical Research The primate biomedical research community has relentlessly targeted three species of macaques: long-tailed, rhesus, and pigtailed. Ironically, macaques' remarkable ecological and behavioral adaptability has increased their visibility, ultimately putting their lives at risk. Countries like the U.S. are increasingly using them in experiments to advance human health. However, primates caught up in the experimentation pipeline have consistently proven to be poor models for human health research. One reason for this is that their biology differs significantly from ours. Furthermore, the presence of unintended and/or undetected pathogens and the immune-crushing stress of captivity distort results, making data unreliable. Decades of primate research have failed to deliver meaningful advancements for human health, while modern, human-relevant methods are proving far more effective and ethical. According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) database, more than 1.5 million long-tailed, rhesus, and pigtailed macaques have been exported from Asia and Mauritius to laboratories around the world since 1975. In 2022, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species elevated long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques to Endangered. The Cruelty of Capture and Transport These monkeys have been relentlessly trapped in urban and semi-urban areas. They have been grabbed as their sleeping trees were cut down and netted as they tried to swim away. Entire troops have been captured after being isolated in the one tree that remained in a crop field. Untold numbers of adult macaques have been beaten to death as they tried desperately to hold onto their infants or protect their friends while they were being captured to be used for experimentation. More deaths followed as they were stuffed into rice sacks, wire bags, or wooden boxes after they were captured. The 1.5 million exported macaques were the 'survivors' of these ordeals. The actual number of macaques extracted from Asia and Mauritius is much larger; captive-born and wild-born macaques form the 'breeding stock' of the 'monkey farms' in Asia and Mauritius. The stress of capture, the horrific conditions in which the macaques are kept, and their exposure to pathogens while in captivity have led many of them to die from disease. These monkeys are then 'replaced' with more wild-caught macaques. In January 2022, a truck transporting over a hundred macaques crashed in Danville, Pennsylvania. The macaques had traveled nearly 10,000 miles from Mauritius. Images of the cramped, airless wooden crates used for transport have exposed this industry's cruelty, secrecy, greed, and danger. The crash was so violent that some crates burst open, and three monkeys escaped into the surrounding area. Representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did a risk assessment and decided that the three escaped macaques be shot on sight. News coverage of the situation spread around the world. People wanted to know where the monkeys had come from, where they were going, if they carried diseases, and if there was anything to fear. The CDC's lack of transparency about the status of the surviving monkeys or even the locationof the CDC-approved quarantine facility to which they were headed is disturbing. The CDC reports that between 2013 and 2023, more than 285,000 macaques were imported into the U.S. These monkeys arrived by plane in hundreds of shipments. From the port of entry, they were loaded into trucks and sent to the approved quarantine sites for a mandatory 31 days of isolation, testing, and observation. Public Health Risks Before 1975, there was no federally mandated quarantine program for imported primates despite the arrival of primates infected with viral hemorrhagic fevers, tuberculosis, deadly diarrheal diseases, fatal diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, and herpes B—a zoonotic macaque virus. However, the CDC's mandated quarantine, which has not changed significantly over the past decades, still only requires that imported primates be screened for tuberculosis and 'monitored for signs of illness that could represent a zoonotic disease (a disease that can spread from animals to humans).' Not all the monkeys make it out of quarantine alive, and tuberculosis infections that the CDC screens for are often missed and show up months or years later, threatening public health and further undermining the utility of these monkeys as biomedical models. Post-quarantine, the surviving monkeys are dispersed to commercial facilities and laboratories around the country, all too often still infected with diverse strains of tuberculosis or deadly bacterial pathogens that the CDC admits cannot be detected with its established protocols. Certificates of veterinary inspection (CVIs) that PETA obtained from agriculture departments in numerous states give a further glimpse into the extent of monkey transport across the U.S. CVIs are required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture when monkeys are transported across state lines. PETA has pieced together a monkey transport map. Each line represents the journey the monkeys made between the lab, breeder, or importer that sold them and the facility that purchased them. PETA has yet to uncover more routes, many of which have been used multiple times since 2018. Pause for a moment and consider the magnitude and cost of this monkey madness: The next disaster like the one that happened in Danville, Pennsylvania, in which a truck crashed while transporting monkeys could happen in your community. No one is safe—the monkeys are on the move even before they arrive in the U.S. Separated from their family and friends packed into small wooden crates, they are terrified, cold, and hungry. Some die in transit as they are moved by trucks and planes across the globe. In these vulnerable and stressed conditions, they are likely immunocompromised, increasing the risk that they will shed pathogens that can cause human diseases. Even the experimenters have acknowledged that the large colony of monkeys at their facilities—in places such as Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, North Carolina, and California—threaten public health. Legal and Ethical Challenges In late 2022, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Justice unveiled indictments stemming from a five-year undercover investigation in Cambodia. The operation uncovered a large-scale international scheme in which tens of thousands of wild-caught long-tailed macaques were illegally smuggled into the United States under the guise of being captive-bred. This 'monkey-laundering' operation not only violated wildlife trafficking laws but also exposed the grave consequences of such illegal trade and the billion-dollar industry backing it. The capture and trafficking of wild monkeys inflicts horrific suffering on the animals, threatens wild populations with extinction, and compromises scientific research by introducing undocumented and potentially sick animals into the primate experimentation pipeline. Macaques are ostensibly being rounded up from forests and urban areas to provide us with lifesaving treatments and vaccines. But it doesn't work that way—macaques aren't furry little humans with long tails. Their immune systems and biology are very different from ours. Despite decades of promises and hundreds of thousands of dead monkeys, experiments using monkeys have not resulted in effective vaccines for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, or other dreaded human diseases. COVID-19 experiments have shown the scientific community how irrelevant and often misleading monkey studies are. Between 2008 and 2019, more than 700,000 'specimens' (i.e., blood, tissue, and body parts) from an unknown number of long-tailed macaques were exported from Asia—this is in addition to the 450,000 live long-tailed macaques who were shipped out for use in biomedical experiments. A study published in February 2022 concluded that the extraction of macaques from Asia for use in biomedical research is a multibillion-dollar industry. A Call for Change However, progress has been made in the right direction. As of March 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has halted the importation of monkeys from Cambodia captured from the wild for U.S. laboratories. Imports are effectively suspended for up to two years, as the FWS now requires a DNA test—yet to be developed—to prove that monkeys were bred in captivity, ensuring protection for these animals in the meantime. Still, this is a small victory, and much more remains to be done. Macaques are extraordinarily resilient animals, but we're pushing them over the edge. Experimenting on them is cruel and leads to unnecessary suffering and death. Our abuse of these animals needs to end.

Portugal And Spain’s Different Bites On Meat Consumption	By Maria Simon Arboleas and Sofia Sanchez Manzanaro (EurActiv) -- The Iberian Peninsula is a culinary powerhouse – think Spanish jamón and Portuguese bacalhau – and ranks among the EU’s top consumers of meat. But as the global debate over animal products heats up, along with the climate, Spain and Portugal are taking very different bites out of the issue. With the livestock sector accounting for over 80% of the EU’s total agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the World Health Organisation (WHO) calling for a shift to 'more plant-based diets,' eating habits have become highly political. The EU is also heavily relianton imports of protein crops, such as soybeans, to produce feeds for animals. In this context, the Iberian Peninsula provides an interesting laboratory of trends. Portugal is taking a significant step towards a greener diet: the country is set to become the second EU nation, after Denmark, to launch a national strategy promoting plant-based foods. As part of its newly released national energy and climate plan, Lisbon vowed to promote a 'low carbon diet' with less consumption of animal proteins to reduce emissions from the agricultural sector and promote healthier nutrition. 'It’s very bold,' said Joana Oliveira, director of ProVeg Portugal. Even more striking, Portugal’s government is led by the centre-right People’s Party, part of the European People’s Party (EPP) – a group that has long resisted even engaging in the debate over a reduction of animal protein for sustainability or health reasons. The political climate isn’t exactly friendly to change, either. Under pressure from the EPP and farmer protests, the Commission shelved plans for an EU-wide sustainable diets framework last year. More recently, an EU advisory group called for more plant-protein production and less reliance on animal products, but the Commission largely ignored the advice in a strategy released last week, avoiding explicit commitments to a plant-based protein strategy. Portuguese MEP Paulo Do Nascimiento Cabral, from the EPP group, told Euractiv that Brussels could draw inspiration from Lisbon's approach, which he said was rooted in a 'balanced and integrative nutritional policy.' Meat and identity politics Just across Portugal's border, in Spain – one of Europe’s last left-wing bastions – things couldn’t be more different. The debate over meat’s environmental impact only hit the mainstream in 2021. Spain’s socialist PM Pedro Sánchez publicly contradicted his consumer minister, Alberto Garzón, for slamming factory farming’s environmental impact and negative health implications of high meat consumption – but never went as far as calling for vegetarian diets. Sánchez’s categorical response still lingers in Spaniards' minds as one of the most iconic quotes of his tenure: 'For me, a perfectly cooked medium-rare chuletón [steak] is unbeatable.' Farming minister Luis Planas doubled down and said comments on the health effects of meat are 'as wrong as sugar kills.' For Samuel Brea, a Spanish researcher on public perceptions of agricultural markets at the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO), Europe’s most progressive government taking a conservative stance on food is deeply tied to identity politics. 'Meat is part of the national identity (…) if you don’t eat jamón, it’s almost as if you’re not Spanish,' Brea said. 'And that’s a tough thing to challenge, especially in politics -there’s very little to gain.' But it’s not just about Spanish identity, Brea added. Meat-based foods are also deeply embedded in regional identities, from veal cachopo in Asturias to fuet in Catalonia. 'I do think politics here does a good job of reflecting society. We’re not really in a situation where Spanish society is demanding more action,' said Brea. Labelling pioneers Far from supporting a shift towards a more plant-based diet, Madrid has only chosen to timidly acknowledge some consumer trends that favour alternatives to meat and dairy in its new National Food Strategy, which was unveiled in December. The blueprint notes that Spanish consumers are increasingly picking meat alternatives, driven by 'health, environmental, and animal welfare concerns,' with a striking 55% rise in products like tofu and seitan since 2018. The only mention of a greener diet is a subtle acknowledgement that the emerging plant-based food sector 'must have its place in the market' due to rising demand, but it does not commit to boosting domestic production or improving access to such products. While some EU countries lead the push for plant-based foods, Madrid has pioneered the opposite, being among the first to impose legal restrictions on using terms such as burger or sausage for veggie products that mimic them. Long before France’s court saga over the veggie steak ban, Madrid passed a law in 2014 defining more than 80 meat products, effectively banning their use for plant-based alternatives. Now, Spain is planning to go even further and assess whether it is necessary to modernise the legislation after a recent ruling from the EU’s top court on the matter, sources of the Spanish Agriculture Ministry told Euractiv, The secret lies in the framing For Brea, the key to preventing a reactionary response to measures like Portugal’s lies in how the changes are framed – notably, avoiding presenting the meat sector as the culprit. In this line, MEP Do Nascimiento Cabral said that his country would ensure 'the coexistence of diverse food sources' and not exclude meat and fish, which he said were 'essential components' of the country's cultural and culinary heritage. The Portuguese government pledges to encourage the production and consumption of leguminous crops, saying this could help ensure 'crop self-sufficiency and food sovereignty.' As the latter concept has gained political traction in the EU, its mention could be read as a wink to farmers’ role in feeding the country. NGOs also present the upcoming plan as an opportunity for the agricultural sector. 'Legumes are deeply rooted in Portugal’s culinary culture, yet the country produces only 14% of the legumes it consumes,' said Oliveira. 'This presents a clear opportunity for farmers to expand production.' But Portuguese farmers are not so happy with the government's wording. While welcoming measures to increase the production of plant proteins, the Confederation of Portuguese Farmers said it rejects this is done 'to the detriment' of animal proteins. While waiting for the new strategy to materialise, Oliveira urges an overdue update to the country’s 20-year-old dietary guidelines to include alternatives like tofu and plant-based drinks. Elsewhere in the EU, nutrition recommendations have already moved in this direction. Meanwhile, Brea notes that this could be a chance to recover Spanish food traditions. 'Tradition doesn't have to be chorizo and morcilla [black pudding], but a chickpea stew or fried aubergines from Córdoba are tradition at its best.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50483ZgXm-4UF	2025-02-27T16:33:30-08:00	
The Priorities For Rebuilding Syria’s Economy – OpEd	After more than a decade of war, destruction and economic collapse in Syria, the country’s new government faces an urgent and formidable challenge: rebuilding the nation’s shattered economy. Years of conflict have devastated infrastructure, displaced millions and left the country struggling with widespread poverty, inflation and a crumbling financial system. For Syria to move forward and achieve long-term stability, economic recovery must be a top priority. One of the most significant obstacles to rebuilding Syria’s economy is the severe impact of Western sanctions. These restrictions, imposed over the years due to the war and political developments, have crippled Syria’s ability to trade, attract foreign investment and access global financial networks. Lifting these sanctions — a process started by the EU this week — is essential for economic revitalization, as it would allow Syria to engage in international commerce, rebuild industries and improve the daily lives of its citizens. Regional support, particularly from Arab nations, is playing a crucial role in assisting Syria’s recovery, with efforts focused on restoring trade ties, providing investment and helping Syrians regain financial stability. Beyond lifting sanctions and securing regional partnerships, Syria’s government must implement comprehensive economic strategies to stimulate growth, create jobs and restore essential services. Revitalizing key industries, rebuilding infrastructure and stabilizing the Syrian pound are necessary steps to ensure a sustainable recovery. The Syrian economy has suffered one of the most severe contractions in modern history. According to reports, Syria’s gross domestic product shrank by 84 percent between 2010 and 2024. The nation’s currency has drastically devalued, leading to hyperinflation and making everyday goods unaffordable for most citizens. In 2023, it was reported that more than 90 percent of Syrians were living below the poverty line, struggling to afford food, medicine and other basic necessities. The country’s energy sector, once a crucial part of the economy, has suffered immense losses. Oil production has declined significantly, forcing Syria to rely on expensive fuel imports. Additionally, the destruction of infrastructure, including roads, power plants and water systems, has made industrial recovery even more challenging. Without a functioning economic system, businesses cannot operate efficiently and foreign investors will remain hesitant to engage with Syria due to the risks involved. As a result, one of the most pressing steps toward economic recovery is the lifting of Western sanctions, which have placed severe restrictions on Syria’s ability to rebuild. These sanctions have frozen Syrian assets abroad, blocked financial transactions and limited the country’s access to international markets. Lifting these sanctions would have an immediate and significant impact on Syria’s economy. It would allow businesses to engage in international trade, making it easier to import essential goods and the raw materials needed for reconstruction. Additionally, easing financial restrictions would enable Syrians to receive remittances from relatives abroad — an important source of income for many families who are struggling to survive. There have been discussions within the EU about easing sanctions and some were lifted on Monday, including restrictions on state-owned banks and investments in Syria’s energy and electricity sectors. These steps are crucial, but a broader lifting of sanctions is necessary to create real economic momentum. To rebuild its economy, Syria must attract investment, particularly in key sectors such as infrastructure, energy and manufacturing. Infrastructure reconstruction is essential for restoring normal economic activity, as roads, ports and communication networks are necessary for trade and industry to function. Investment in the energy sector is also critical. Syria’s electricity grid has been severely damaged, leading to frequent power shortages that make industrial and commercial activities difficult. By securing investment in power plants and alternative energy sources, the government can provide reliable electricity to businesses and households, improving overall economic stability. Manufacturing and agriculture are two other sectors that require substantial investment. Restoring factories and supporting small businesses can help create jobs and stimulate local economies. Similarly, rebuilding the agricultural sector will ensure food security and reduce the need for costly imports. In addition, encouraging both domestic and foreign investors to participate in Syria’s reconstruction will require significant policy reforms. The government must create a business-friendly environment by ensuring legal protections for investors, streamlining bureaucratic processes and guaranteeing stability in financial regulations. Without such reforms, potential investors may remain reluctant to engage with Syria’s economy. A fully functioning transport network is also vital for economic recovery. The destruction of roads, bridges, railways and airports has made it difficult to move goods and people efficiently, further hindering trade and investment. Rebuilding highways and roads would allow agricultural and industrial products to reach markets more easily, reducing costs and increasing profitability for businesses. Restoring railways would enhance trade efficiency, making it easier for goods to be transported across the country and into neighboring markets. Additionally, reopening and modernizing Syria’s major ports would boost international trade, allowing the country to export its products and receive essential imports more efficiently. Investment in transport infrastructure will also have long-term economic benefits by creating jobs, stimulating demand for construction materials and improving the overall efficiency of business operations. The collapse of the Syrian pound has led to inflation, making daily life increasingly difficult for citizens. Restoring confidence in the national currency is essential for economic recovery. This requires sound financial policies that promote stability, control inflation and encourage investment. Encouraging the use of banking services within Syria and strengthening financial institutions will further contribute to economic stability. Many Syrians have lost trust in the banking system due to war-related economic instability, so rebuilding confidence in financial institutions is a necessary step toward recovery. Finally, Syria’s economy can greatly benefit from increased regional and international trade. Restoring trade partnerships with neighboring countries and reestablishing commercial routes can help Syria reintegrate into global markets. Several Arab nations have already shown an interest in helping Syria regain economic stability. Strengthening these ties can lead to trade agreements that facilitate the movement of goods, reduce tariffs and encourage business collaborations. By improving its trade relations with regional partners, Syria can gain access to new markets and benefit from foreign investments that support key industries. The reopening of trade routes, border crossings and customs facilities will be crucial for Syria’s economic recovery. Facilitating smoother trade transactions with neighboring countries will help businesses thrive and create new opportunities for economic growth. In sum, Syria’s economic challenges are immense, but they are not insurmountable. The key to recovery lies in a multifaceted approach that includes lifting sanctions, attracting investment, rebuilding infrastructure, stabilizing the currency and strengthening trade relations. By prioritizing economic growth and implementing sound policies, Syria’s new government can create a foundation for stability, prosperity and a better future for its people. The road to recovery will not be easy, but with the right strategies and international cooperation Syria can rebuild its economy and offer its citizens the opportunity for a more secure and prosperous life.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50x6KlferGs33	2025-02-27T16:14:08-08:00	
Spanish Bishops: Conditions For Pope Francis To Resign Are Not Me...	By Nicolás de Cárdenas The secretary-general and spokesman for the Spanish Bishops’ Conference (CEE, by its Spanish acronym), Bishop Francisco César García Magán, expressed his conviction that the conditions for the resignation of Pope Francis, who has been hospitalized for 14 days due to health problems, have not been met. Asked at the end of the meeting of the conference’s standing committee, García explained that the resignation of the pontiff is provided for in Canon 332.2 of the Code of Canon Law, with the only requirement that 'it be free and be formally expressed.' García also pointed out that it is public knowledge that in 2013, the year he became pope, Francis gave the then-Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, 'a signed letter with his formal resignation in case of impediment.' 'I signed it and told him: ‘In case of impediment due to medical reasons or whatever, here is my resignation. You already have it.’ I don't know who Cardinal Bertone gave it to, but I gave it to him when he was secretary of state,' the pontiff revealed to the Spanish newspaper ABC in 2022. The CEE spokesman pointed out in this regard that 'these conditions are not being met because the impediment to which the pope was referring was when it is linked to a mental limitation, a mental impediment. What the pope has now are illnesses typical of age.' 'As he has said on occasion, the Church is not governed with the knees but with the head, with the help of the Holy Spirit,' added the prelate, who, after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, considered that, if Pope Francis made the same decision, 'it would not be new.' The bishops’ spokesman also stressed that 'we are not in a pre-conclave period; far from it' and made an appeal to the people of God to 'intensify prayer for the healing of this pope' and to do so 'with affection and communion.' This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner. It has been translated and adapted by CNA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE507y51QE7HLhO	2025-02-27T16:08:59-08:00	
Counting 100 Blessing A Day Enriches Your Life – OpEd	Psalm 100:4 says: 'Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to God and praise his name.' And Ecclesiastes 3:12-13 responds: 'I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their work—this is a gift of God.' A daily counting of our blessings is an age-old religious advice that actually does help improve our mood and mindset. One reason that the blessings strategy works is because it begins to counter the hard-wired tendency we have as humans to notice and remember the negative more than the positive. There's a strong evolutionary reason why we think this way: it's vital for our survival. So, we hardly notice if a cat is following us up the street, but if it was a lion we certainly would. Our brains are primed for danger in order to keep us safe. Which is good, except that in a world of constant news of war, suffering, hatred and division – all of which we can instantly access on our phones – this negativity bias can overwhelm us with unneeded negative worries and anxiety. One way of influencing people to think positively about their lives is to teach them the importance of saying blessings for the many things they experience, both in their ordinary daily and weekly life, and at occasional extraordinary times. It is a Mitsvah (Jewish religious duty) to say blessings at every meal over food and drink. Every morning when we awake it is a Mitsvah to say several blessings because various parts of our mind and body still work. During daily prayer there are 18 blessings, and there are blessings for the weekly celebration of the Sabbath. There are also blessings to say for special occasions, for our sages urged us to thank God for as many blessings as we can, since the more blessings you can say, the more blessed you are. Indeed, Jewish tradition maintains that everyone who is able to say 100 blessings a day is truly blessed. Among the special occasion blessings there is a blessing for seeing a non-Jewish sage and another one for seeing a Jewish sage. There is a blessing for hearing good news and another one for hearing bad news in accordance with Rabbi Huna's view that we need both joy and suffering to experience 'very good'. Here are a few examples of blessings for special occasions: On beholding fragrant trees:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, creator of fragrant trees. On seeing trees in blossom:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, whose world lacks nothing we need, who has fashioned good creatures and lovely trees that enchant the heart. On seeing an unusual looking person:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, who makes every person unique. On the Divine value of pluralism and human variety when seeing a large number of people:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, the Sage of esoterica, for just as no person's opinion is like that of another, so their faces are different from one another. On seeing evidence of charitable efforts:Praised be Adonai our God, ruler of space and time, who clothes the naked. On seeing people who overcome adversity:Praised be Adonai our God, ruler of space and time, who gives strength to the weary. Understanding that suffering, sorrow and even death do not nullify the basic goodness of the world God has created, and training oneself to see all the blessings that surround us, are two of the many ways the Torah tradition in Judaism teaches Jews to have a positive and optimistic view of both the natural world and the human world we live in. But although individuals can train themselves to make their lives joyful and holy, some would say that civilization has corrupted the world of nature with sin, lust, greed, violence and immorality. It is true that prior to the creation of self conscious moral creatures the world was free of evil. However, the world also lacked good for there were no creatures who could choose to do good and not evil. (Angels in Jewish thought have no free will and are thus inferior to humans.) It is possible to think of nature as always pure and modern civilization as always a corrupting influence. Indeed, this seems to be a popular view among many western ecology activists. An important Jewish teaching concerns the outcome of human history. Most ancient philosophies saw human history as cyclical. Others saw the cycle as a declining one, with each age followed by a more degenerate one. The present age was often dire and getting worse. The Prophets of Israel (from the 10th century to the 5th century B.C.E.), especially Isaiah, introduced God's assurance of a Messianic Age to come when all nations will achieve international peace, prosperity and justice. How can people, especially Jews, believe in a Messianic Age after all the world went through in the 20th century? Human society changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last century than ever before in history. Doctors saved the lives of millions. Dictators sacrificed the lives of millions. Populations exploded and birthrates declined. Technology produced both worldwide prosperity and pollution at the same time. Knowing all this, how can we look upon the future with optimistic hope? Are the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday; or are both occurring concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? Many who believe in the Biblical vision of a Messianic Age use the insights of the Prophets of Israel to provide guidance in understanding the social, economic, scientific and cultural upheavals sweeping society. Usually it is the dramatic dangers of the pre-Messianic tribulation that are emphasized. I will focus on some positive signs developing throughout the world that accord with a positive messianic vision of the Jewish Prophets.In most religious traditions, redemption is defined in terms of individual enlightenment or personal salvation. However, the Prophets of Israel conceived redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of the transformation of the Jewish community. This transformation, which will take place in this world at some future time, is called the Messianic Age.The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah. The birth of a redeemed messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her religious tradition, we would ourselves bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps. The Messiah refers to an agent of God who helps bring about this transformation. The Jewish tradition teaches that this agent of God (and there may be two or three such agents) will be a human being, a descendant of King David, with great leadership qualities similar to Prophets Moses or Muhammed. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. Where does a Messiah fit in with all of this? He will still have lots to do when he arrives. Most Orthodox Jews would not commit themselves to any individual as a Messiah unless he successfully rebuilds the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zachariah, 'He shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, he shall sit on the throne and rule, there shall be a priest before the throne, and peaceful counsel will exist between both of them.' (6:13) Now that a large part of the Jewish people have returned to the Land of Israel, and resurrected a Jewish State, one might think that rebuilding a temple of the site where Solomon originally built one almost 3,000 years ago, would be relatively simple. But a Muslim Shrine, the Dome of the Rock, presently occupies the site. Often erroneously called the Mosque of Omar, it is not a mosque and it was not built by Omar. It was built in 691 by Abd-Al-Malik and it is regarded by Muslims as the third holiest site in the world. Any attempt to replace the Dome of the Rock would provoke a Muslim Holy War of cataclysmic proportions. There is, however, open land on the Temple Mount, and a small broadcast Jewish house of worship could be built 600 feet north of the Masjid al-Aqsa, near the Dome of the Rock provided that Muslims would cooperate. Most observers agree that anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be important. Anyone who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions, 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, such Jewish/Christian/Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its leadership to be the Messiah and this would fulfill the culminating verses of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy as enlarged upon by Micah (4:3-5), 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him. For it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' If each people truly follows the best of its own religious teachings the Messiah will surely have arrived, and God's Kingdom will be established. This is the most optimistic and positive vision one can have and one that we can all work for together. As Prophet Isaiah 41:10 says: 'So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.' And best of all Proverbs 11:25 states: 'A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.' Counting blessings leads to generosity, which results in personal and communal growth. As we express gratitude, God uses us to bless others, creating a cycle of mutual enrichment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE509Zq1YHa6Gi2	2025-02-27T16:03:31-08:00	
Improving Relationships Between Dads And Daughters… It’s A Walk I...	A simple walk in the park could hold the key to unlocking a close and loving relationship between fathers and daughters, a new study has shown. Research carried out by the University of Essex’s Dr John Day has found taking part in or just discussing physical activity provides a common ground for the two to develop deep emotional connections and transform the stereotype of distant dads. The study found that a societal shift in what it means to be a dad, combined with increased focus to exercise to maintain health, has led to physical activity providing a platform for the relationship to thrive. Dr Day, of the School of Health and Social Care, said: 'My research shows daughters have always sought for a way to grow closer to their dads, while this has only recently become more of a focus for fathers. 'From a father's perspective, physical activity can simultaneously function as a method of upholding a masculine identity while performing one-to-one parenting, so they feel much more comfortable in this environment.' The study, published in Families, Relationships and Societies journal, involved interviews with 14 women born between 1950 and 1994. Those born in the 1950s largely discussed how their dads fulfilled the role as the provider for the family, and remained somewhat on the periphery as a parent. But daughters born in the 1980s and 1990s were raised in social conditions that allowed them to realise and build more emotionally connected relationships with their fathers. They recalled stories of how they had bonded with their dads while taking part in activities such as walking, swimming and cycling. Both the health and enjoyment benefits of physical activity were raised by the younger women taking part in the study, but some also spoke of how they distanced themselves from any attempts from their dad to make the activities competitive. Despite the transformation, those interviewed indicated the relationship between daughters and dads was still structured around the preferences of the latter. 'Key factors associated with fatherhood that have enabled this transformation are the increased prominence of involved fatherhood ideals and physical activity becoming a parenting and health-related practice that fathers feel comfortable performing and talking about,' said Dr Day. 'Crucial to this is the UK context, where intimate interdependence is indicative of sought after relationships and a public health context where physical activity participation is championed to reduce non-communicable disease.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfyFSSeazE50zXUzSm7OO-v	2025-02-27T15:59:46-08:00	
Iran’s Unconventional Naval Platforms – Analysis	By Can Kasapoğlu Iran’s Drone Carrier Program: An Overview To help address its conventional military industrial disadvantages, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been converting commercial vessels into drone carriers and naval missile launch platforms. Tehran has outfitted basic commercial ships with carrier decks and asymmetric offensive weapons such as combat drones, bomb-laden unmanned boats, and anti-ship ballistic missiles. These new platforms appear capable of wreaking havoc in the region. Since Tehran modifies these vessels with predominantly commercial components, traditional arms control measures are ineffective at restricting their construction. While Tehran cannot match its adversaries’ technologically superior aircraft carriers and helicopter landing docks, these makeshift vessels allow Iran to imperil regional maritime shipping and threaten the United States’ naval presence in the Middle East. Iran Commissions Its First Drone Carrier In early February 2025, Iran’s first drone carrier, the IRIS Shahid Bagheri, officially joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy. The inauguration ceremony was held in the city of Bandar Abbas, strategically positioned on the Strait of Hormuz. Iran’s new naval platform might look technologically and structurally inferior to modern aircraft carriers and amphibious assault vessels. But a careful assessment of the vessel’s design philosophy reveals that Iran has taken the lessons from the success of its Yemen-based Houthi proxy and implemented them at a larger scale. Like the Houthi arsenal, these makeshift drone carriers are designed to create tactical advantages and strategic leverage. The Shahid Bagheri was formerly a container ship, the Perarin. With a length of 787 feet and a takeoff runway of approximately 570 feet, the Shahid Bagheri is well-equipped to support a variety of Iranian drones, including loitering munitions. Vertical takeoff platforms can launch from and land on the carrier without any special modifications. The vessel also boasts a unique design feature: an angled flight deck, akin to a ski jump, that points toward the vessel’s starboard edge. This design allows the flight deck to extend beyond the Perarin’s chassis, lengthening the runway and allowing larger drones to launch from the carrier. Nonetheless, satellite imagery shows that the design of the carrier’s flight deck leaves little room for heavy aircraft recovery operations, since any landing errors could damage the vessel. It is unknown whether the craft has barrier recovery or arrested landing features to protect the ship and crew in touchdown and abort incidents. A Closer Look at the Shahid Bagheri The Shahid Bagheri provides its operators with a broad range of robotic warfare options. In her debut, she carried two subscale variants of the Qaher unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), one 60 percent smaller and the other 25 percent smaller than the Qaher’s original airframe. While it is not known whether the larger variant managed to take off from the platform, the smaller Qaher launched successfully. The Ababil-3, which can carry guided munitions or function as a kamikaze drone, also took off successfully from the carrier. The Atlas sub-variant of the Ababil-3 has a fortified airframe that allows it to carry a greater payload. Notably, the Houthis have used a kamikaze variant of the Ababil family, the Qasef. The Shahid Bagheri also had a Mohajer-6 UAV onboard during its launch ceremony. Designed by Qods Aviation Industries, the Mohajer-6 drone incorporates composite plastic materials to reduce its weight. The aircraft is equipped with a laser rangefinder and electro-optical infrared sensors. It can conduct automated takeoffs and landings and carry jamming and electromagnetic sensor payloads, important capabilities for combating electronic warfare operations. Finally, it has a line-of-sight control range of 120 miles and a ceiling of 18,000 feet, which lets it evade the engagement envelopes of most low-altitude short-range air defenses. Most analysts estimate that the drone can fly for around 12 hours, though some have reported it can last as long as 24 hours in the air. The Mohajer-6 is also the first variant of its class certified for guided munitions like Qaem-1 glide bombs. The Russian military used a limited number of Mohajer-6 drones in Ukraine to coordinate attacks, particularly over Odesa. The Shahid Bagheri can also launch Shahed baseline loitering munitions, unmanned surface vehicles for asymmetric naval warfare operations, and, theoretically, unmanned underwater vehicles. The IRGC has used the invaluable combat experience it gained from the Houthis’ drone and missile strikes against the US Navy’s assets in the region to develop these disruptive capabilities. With its drone carrier fleet, the IRGC can replicate the Houthis’ highly attritional combat operations on a larger scale. Iran’s floating bases can attack targets with mixed strike packages consisting of naval drones, loitering munitions and aerial drones, anti-ship ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles, and underwater robotic warfare platforms. Such an arsenal would threaten any maritime grouping in the Middle East. Seaborne Missile Platforms Iran’s power projection fleet can also carry anti-ship, air-defense, and land-attack missiles. The Shahid Mahdavi, a floating missile platform, was built on the container ship Sarvin and is roughly the same length as the Shahid Bagheri. This platform features helicopter pads along with ballistic missile launch positions. In 2024, the vessel test-fired Fateh-baseline ballistic missiles, likely the longer-range Dezful variant. The Houthis demonstrated that coastal anti-ship ballistic missiles can be effective even against moving targets. A floating Iranian missile and drone carrier would stress regional air and missile defenses to a considerably more worrisome extent. Apart from the Shahid Bagheri drone carrier and Shahid Mahdavi missile platform, the Islamic Republic fields the Makran, formerly a crude oil tanker, as a forward-base ship with rotary-wing naval aviation support features. Tehran also uses the Shahid Roudaki, another former container vessel, as a drone and missile launch platform. Tehran’s fast-growing fleet of floating drone and missile carriers is boosted by spy vessels such as the Saviz and the Behshad, which were also converted from container vessels. Equipped with intelligence capabilities and command-control features, these platforms play a vital role in providing Iran’s drone-carriers and floating missile bases with targeting data in real time. The Geopolitical Impact of Iran’s Disruptive Naval Capabilities In its 2019 report on Iranian military power, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) concluded that unmanned aerial vehicles are Iran’s most rapidly advancing air power capability. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 vindicated the DIA’s findings, as the Kremlin pounded Ukraine with Iran-made Shahed loitering munitions. The Houthi militia, meanwhile, showed what Iranian anti-ship missile technologies can accomplish when used alongside robotic naval warfare assets. The DIA assessed that Houthi activities in the Red Sea reduced maritime traffic in the region by over 90 percent. This affected the global economy severely, as 15 percent of global shipping transits the area, and alternate routes add roughly 11,000 nautical miles and $1 million of fuel per voyage. The Houthis’ attacks also proved lucrative: the militia allegedly made $2 billion per year by extorting and strong-arming shipping companies. Iran’s drone carriers could do even greater damage to global shipping and maritime trade, particularly if the IRGC coordinates with its Houthi proxies. Worse, Iran’s drone and missile capabilities are more potent than they have ever been. Lessons from Yemen and Ukraine have provided Tehran with invaluable real-world knowledge. And because Iran has diversified its logistics network with commercially available components, traditional arms control frameworks can do little to stop this threat. Many in the West have long thought that dialogue and diplomacy could tame Tehran’s hostile ambitions. Shahed drones buzzing over Ukrainian skies, Houthi projectiles targeting Red Sea shipping, and Iranian proxies sowing instability throughout the Middle East proved these assumptions to be groundless. Absent a more realistic Western approach to Iran, Tehran’s new unconventional naval platforms threaten to further destabilize the region.

US Paris Climate Agreement Exit Will Hit Africa Hard – Analysis	By Dhesigen Naidoo On his first day in office, United States (US) President Donald Trump signed an executive order to withdraw his country from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement. This latest plunge of the US climate change rollercoaster may be the most impactful yet. The Paris Agreement was initially met with resistance from the US, followed by enthusiasm. Under George HW Bush, a strong environmental agenda was supported at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, followed by a unanimous Senate rejection of Kyoto Protocol ratification during the Bill Clinton era. Then there was the first Paris Agreement withdrawal during Trump’s first term, followed by an enthusiastic return under Joe Biden. The latest withdrawal will take effect in one year and continue for at least three more, depending on the 2028 US presidential election outcome. Unlike the previous exit, which lasted only 107 days before Biden rejoined the agreement in 2021, there is now a reasonable time for significant harm to global climate action efforts. These impacts will be felt at multiple levels and in four main areas. The first is direct funding support. In its continued moves to weaken the United Nations system, US support for other countries and non-state actors to fully implement the Paris Agreement will be limited or seized altogether. Unlike the US’ previous exit, there is now enough time for significant harm to global climate action efforts An early casualty might be developed countries' US$300 billion pledge at COP29 in Baku. This may extend to the US being a lower-profile player in replenishing global funds like the Green Climate Fund to the tune of US$4 billion, and the new Loss and Damage Fund. The US’ dismissive stance on climate change, combined with Trump’s insistence that North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries increase their defence spending amidst heightened global insecurity, may see climate funding reduced in the developing world. This has grave implications for the mitigation and adaptation ambitions, and in particular, the needs of African countries. An example is the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) which facilitate the movement to low-carbon growth in Africa. Two African countries, South Africa and Senegal, have operational JETPs, and pilot plans are underway for three more – Egypt, Côte d’Ivoire and Morocco. The outlook for these energy transitions is grave in the short term, as the US has, to date, been a principal partner. The second impact of the US withdrawal is the gap it will leave in global institutions. After climate change sceptic David Malpass was appointed World Bank president in Trump’s first term, Biden used the position's vacancy to install climate action embracing Ajay Banga as head. Many progressive policy changes followed, including loan and grant packages for the close-down and repurposing of coal-fired power stations in South Africa. If the World Bank’s climate efforts are arrested, a knock-on effect could occur in many of its partners The World Bank Detox Development report is also highly innovative. It proposes redirecting already dedicated fossil fuel subsidies towards low-carbon energy sources, keeping the subsidies under the energy security banner – but with a renewables and nuclear character. There may also be funding possibilities for the damage caused by climate disasters, and investments in climate adaptation to help vulnerable communities cope. Trump’s ‘drill, baby, drill’ mantra and its supporting measures put this World Bank proposal at risk. Recent COPs and the 2023 Climate Finance Summit have made it clear that national and especially multilateral development banks should lead the global climate finance drive. If the World Bank’s climate efforts are arrested, a knock-on effect could occur in many of its partners. Hopefully, there will be sufficient pushback from the European Investment Bank, Asian Development Bank and the New Development Bank (BRICS Bank). If that happens, the African Development Bank and the Development Bank of Southern Africa may be encouraged to continue their climate aspirations. Commercial banks are also vulnerable to policy shifts back to fossil fuel investments. A market opening for fossil fuel chain investments, initially in the US and then beyond, could see the formula for easier profits compared to renewable energy investments becoming attractive to commercial bank investors and shareholders. Key countries must galvanise a global climate agenda at this year’s BRICS and G20 summits The third effect of the US’ Paris Agreement exit relates to the country’s role as an active negotiator in COP meetings while its withdrawal is pending. Given that it questions the UN’s value generally and its climate position in particular, the US could retard already sluggish efforts to secure more commitment for mitigation targets, adaptation financing and reasonable compensation for loss and damage. This will affect poor countries the most, whose contributions to the global carbon budget are negligible, if any. The impact will go beyond lower levels of financial aid, and into the domains of reduced technical assistance and capacity building. Africa – a vulnerable region with the highest concentration of least developed countries globally – will feel the brunt immediately. Fourth, Trump’s stance on the climate issue has disturbingly garnered support in other countries. The most visible to date has been Argentina, where President Javier Milei, a self-declared Trump ally, has said he will consider leaving the Paris Agreement. Others may follow, weakening the climate multilateral platform. The best chance to get this train back on the rails is at COP30 in Belém, Brazil in November. There is still room and hope for a more robust agreement on climate action. To achieve this, key countries must galvanise a global climate agenda at plurilateral forums in 2025 – the BRICS summit under the Brazilian presidency in July and the G20 summit under South Africa’s presidency in November. The G20 Ministers of Finance and Central Bank Governors meeting this week in South Africa will also be significant. The alternative is reduced climate action and a faster slide to global climate catastrophe – with Africa and the developing world as the first victims.

Malaysia’s Reform Aspirations Clashed With Political Realities In...	By Kai Ostwald After focusing on political survival in 2023, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim entered 2024 with ambitious plans to restore Malaysia’s standing as one of Asia’s leading economies and middle powers. Economic growth exceeded expectations — fuelled in part by a surge in foreign investment — particularly in the semiconductor sector, the Malaysian ringgit saw a modest recovery and Anwar’s active diplomacy elevated Malaysia’s global profile. Yet 2024 also demonstrated that ambition alone is insufficient to overcome Malaysia’s entrenched political divisions. Anwar’s government, constrained by an unwieldy coalition and the volatile pull of identity politics, struggled to advance significant reforms. Race and religion remained potent political flashpoints. In March, a convenience store inadvertently sold socks embossed with the word ‘Allah’, triggering viral outrage. Several political leaders used the incident to paint Anwar’s government — and its Chinese-majority coalition partner, the Democratic Action Party — as insufficiently protective of Malay-Muslim interests. Even the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a key member of the ruling coalition, saw its Youth Chief join the fray, highlighting the coalition’s internal tensions. In May, Universiti Teknologi MARA — a university historically reserved for ethnic Malays and other bumiputera — proposed temporarily admitting students from other ethnic backgrounds to its postgraduate cardiothoracic programme to address a critical shortage of qualified surgeons. The backlash was swift, with students and Malay nationalist groups mobilising in protest. In August, former prime minister and opposition leader Muhyiddin Yassin was charged with sedition for appearing to question a royal decision which followed the 2022 election. While his comments drew public criticism, the sedition charge itself reignited debates over selective prosecution. After years of politicising Malaysia’s race, religion and royalty, identity-based populism has become a force unto itself, with no clear way to contain or navigate it in pursuit of substantive reform. Another former prime minister, Najib Razak — serving time for his role in the 1MDB corruption scandal — remains a political liability for Anwar. Though popular within UMNO and its base, he is widely denounced as a kleptocrat elsewhere. In February, a Pardons Board unexpectedly halvedNajib’s sentence and slashed his fines, fuelling backlash from the public and government. Anwar’s predicament is unenviable — he needs UMNO’s backing to govern, but Najib’s preferential treatment undermines his reformist credentials. Beyond politics, Malaysia faced compounding crises in late 2024. Severe flooding in the northern states displaced hundreds of thousands, while sporadic shortages of local white rice deepened food security concerns. Transnational haze persisted and a string of incidents, from power outages in East Malaysia to a tourist vanishing into a Kuala Lumpur sinkhole, exposed pressing infrastructure gaps. None of these challenges have easy fixes. Still, Anwar may find some relief in Perikatan Nasional’s waning momentum. The opposition, which surged in 2023, has been increasingly fractured. Merdeka Center polling also suggests strengthening support for the government, which could give Anwar more manoeuvring room in 2025. The upcoming Sabah state election will be another key test of his coalition’s stability. Malaysia’s foreign policy in 2024 reflected ongoing strategic balancing. Anwar sought to maintain ties with both China and the West while amplifying Malaysia’s support for Palestine, often through sharp critiques of Western hypocrisy and the rules-based international order. Mid-year, he announced Malaysia’s application to join BRICs while making high-profile visits to Beijing and New Delhi, prompting speculation about Malaysia’s geopolitical realignment. That interpretation is premature, as Malaysia continues to seek strong ties with the United States and other Western partners. Malaysia’s relationship with China, while robust, has had tension. A leaked Chinese diplomatic note ordering Malaysia to halt exploration in its own South China Sea exclusive economic zone underscored the complexities of this balancing act. Anwar, who made dozens of international trips in 2024, frequently spoke off-the-cuff to build rapport with global leaders while also addressing domestic concerns. Many of his statements, shaped by shifting political pressures, reflect tactical positioning rather than a cohesive foreign policy shift. Malaysia’s 2025 ASEAN Chairmanship will be a pivotal test for Anwar’s leadership. Expectations are high for meaningful progress on regional challenges, particularly the crisis in Myanmar and tensions in the South China Sea. Failure to secure tangible results could deepen ASEAN’s fragmentation, prompting member states to pursue mini-lateral alternatives. Simultaneously, Malaysia must build momentum for the successor plans to the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint — frameworks that will shape the region’s future. Negotiations on the Digital Economy Framework Agreement and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area upgrade are set to conclude under Malaysia’s leadership, giving Kuala Lumpur leverage in shaping their final forms. While loftier objectives — such as finalising the South China Sea Code of Conduct or facilitating Timor Leste’s formal ASEAN accession — may prove elusive, Malaysia’s Chairmanship will be central to shaping the agenda and fostering consensus. With global politics in flux, Malaysia’s ambitious 2025 agenda will require not just bold leadership, but also pragmatic goal setting, stronger coordination and effective delegation. These may be Anwar’s real tests.

How Can The Study Of Hierarchy/Heterarchy Influence The Future? –...	How new information changes theories. Hierarchies are a familiar form of human organization where individuals and groups of high social status are ranked above others and make decisions. Some examples are an oligarchy, a small group of committed individuals (sharing religion, wealth, etc.); an absolute monarchy that controls all the levers of power; and an activity that requires a clear chain of command (armies and firefighters) for a rapid and coordinated effort. Another form of human organization is a heterarchy, where individual and group status is based on behavior, values, and the willingness to work for the common good; decisions are taken cooperatively. (An earlier version of this article originally appeared as an entry for Heterarchy in the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 1) Examples of heterarchy are elected national assemblies, unions and guilds, or a group activity whose leaders have the requisite knowledge for the required tasks. These are bare-bones characterizations—a continuum—rather than a one-or-the-other condition; sociopolitical governance is usually a mix, with strict rules for certain purposes and more flexible rules for others. Taken together, the two terms aid the examination of all sociopolitical systems and the study of how decisions are mediated and change over time. A Traditional View of Social Complexity Since archaeology's founding as a discipline in the 19th century, most interpretations have assumed a linear progression from small, early, and 'simple' societies to those that were more populous, appeared later in time, and were 'complex.' Such a definition of complex (having more administrative levels) is in contrast to the definition of complexity in nonlinear systems (more richly networked). Political systems were assumed to have greater stability the more they tended toward tiered hierarchies of power. In 1962, the American cultural anthropologist Elman Service introduced a framework classifying evolutionary stages of social and political organization into four categories: band, tribe, chiefdom, and state. He focused on the managerial benefits of the theory, which posits that chiefdoms arose due to the advantages of centralized leadership and culminated in the formation of states. In this model, leaders offer tangible benefits to their followers who consolidate the leader's power and support the expansion of bureaucratic organizations. Since Service formulated this model of complexity in human societies, dissatisfaction with both the model and the underlying assumption has grown considerably. Scholars2 have complained about the definition of these categories; the lack of clear evidence in the archaeological record; the failure of much archaeological data to fit a cultural evolutionary model; and the objectionable and persistent association with racism and colonialism. Most egregious is the assumption that ancient peoples and contemporary non-state groups are somehow less intelligent and creative than citizens of nation-states. This has played directly into Eurocentric convictions that conquest and colonial takeover were a favor to 'backward' peoples. Today, scholars realize that throughout the course of human history, there were many different forms of self-governance. The root problem has been the definition of complexity. Service understood complexity as many levels of governance, each subordinate to the one above (tiered). Heterarchies have many links (networked) of shifting importance over time. A tiered administrative system describes the formal organization of states but, even in states, the social scaffolding is better revealed when governance is seen as a network, with both official entities (departments) and unofficial ones (groups and individuals who can fulfill various functions). Heterarchy Reflects Real-Life Flexibility Introducing the concept of heterarchy into the study of societies has helped to understand puzzling activities and structures that are found in the past and the present. It is not necessarily a replacement model so much as a complementary one; studying the interplay between the two systems can be particularly instructive. First, the hierarchy-heterarchy relation admits both temporal and spatial flexibility. For example, governmental heterarchies can become more hierarchical over time, and vice versa, without collapsing. Heterarchical relationships among elements at one spatial scale or in one dimension (for example, members of the same club) may be hierarchical at another scale (the privilege of seniority in decision-making). Heterarchy is both a structure and a condition. Applying the concept of heterarchy to the study of ancient and existing societies is likely to have many uses, and exploration has begun in some areas: heterarchies of scale, heterarchies of power, and heterarchies of values. Heterarchies of Scale Spatial analysis in archaeology facilitates the study of shifting configurations of occupied areas, how they were used by their inhabitants, and how socially equal households were. Service was operating under a general assumption common among archaeologists that, over time, increasing group size was related to its complexity, defined as the size of habitation and evidence of growing political centralization, elite activity, and social stratification. In the early 2020s, excavations in Eastern Europe revealed that there were cities of up to 320 hectares (almost 800 acres) with a population of 10,000 people as early as the fourth millennium BCE but, as inequality increased, the cities lost population and were abandoned. These large population aggregations in the past found mechanisms to reduce inequality but, when that ability diminished, people left.3 Heterarchies of Power Power relations are demonstrably the most complicated and important aspect of the governance of human societies. It is particularly important to know how power shifts occur and under what conditions various power distributions constitute stable and unstable configurations. Studying this would greatly assist the study of change and perhaps explain how certain forms of governance can be associated with histories of stability and instability. Addressing the decreasing capacity of macro-states to control political and economic processes in a globalized world, political scientists have also found the concepts of heterarchy and complex systems useful in moving past failing paradigms.4 Heterarchies of Values Power relations are predicated on systems of values that, as conditions change, are ranked and reranked in their importance by individuals, groups, and organizations. Neuropsychologist and cybernetician Warren McCulloch, who examined cognitive structures in the brain, called this collective organization a heterarchy.5 He demonstrated that the human brain is not organized hierarchically but adjusts to the reranking of values as circumstances change. McCulloch contrasted a hierarchy of (ranked) values with a heterarchy of values that defied both ranking and predictability. For example, an individual may be against abortion rights but support the death penalty (or vice versa). McCulloch's 'nervous nets,' the source of the brain's flexibility, are structurally similar to the adaptive capacities of fluidly organized and highly communicative groups. McCulloch's insight into the autonomous nature of information and communication in the brain revolutionized its neural study; it also solved major organizational problems in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer design. It is quintessentially human to make nimble cognitive leaps among scales.5 1 Crumley, Carole L. (2007). 'Heterarchy.' In International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.

ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model – Analysis	By Yang Xite The global economic landscape is undergoing profound restructuring. As major economies repeatedly fall into the 'stimulus-rebound-weakening' fluctuation cycle during the pandemic recovery, and as the marginal benefits of quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus continue to diminish, a fundamental question has emerged: Has the underlying logic driving economic growth undergone a systemic shift? Over the past decade, multiple rounds of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve have failed to replicate the V-shaped recovery seen after 2008. The Eurozone's negative interest rate policy has quietly faded during the energy crisis. Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy has consistently failed to achieve the 2% inflation target. These phenomena collectively point to a confusion within the economics community: Why has the classical model, based on the input of production factors, become increasingly difficult to use to explain the growth dynamics of the real world? This disconnect between theory and practice is particularly evident in China's economic transformation. In 2024, fixed asset investment across the whole society grew by 3.2%, retail consumption grew by 3.5%, and the goods trade surplus hit a new high of USD 767.9 billion. According to the traditional 'three pillars (investments, consumptions, exports)' model, this should have resulted in a strong recovery. However, the subjective experience of micro-level entities sharply contrasts with the macro data. The manufacturing PMI has been below the threshold for five consecutive months, youth unemployment remains high, and the capital market's risk appetite continues to stay low. This paradox suggests that latent variables, not captured by traditional models, are reshaping the economic system. In this context, ANBOUND's senior researcher proposed ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model, creating a new observational dimension. This model groundbreakingly incorporates the relationships between three key factors: technology, reform, and culture, into the analysis framework. While global central bank governors are still debating the end point of interest rate hikes, this model has quietly revealed that the essence of modern economic growth has already evolved from a 'quantitative approach' driven by factor accumulation to 'ecoefficiency' based on system coordination. Specifically, ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model builds upon the traditional 'three pillars' framework and constructs an analytical framework of 'three bases and three multipliers', decomposing economic growth into three fundamental indicators: investment, consumption, and net exports, as well as three multiplier coefficients: technology, reform, and culture. The first three indicators serve as direct statistical measures of economic output, reflecting the data relationships and manifesting as explicit economic momentum. The latter three represent multiplier effects, showing coefficient relationships that amplify or diminish the impact of the first three, together forming the dynamic system of economic growth. This reveals the complexity of economic growth, especially in the current context of China's economic transformation. Ignoring the regulation of coefficient relationships could lead to policy design falling into the problem of treating symptoms but not the root causes. From the perspective of the theoretical lineage of economics, traditional growth models, such as the Solow-Swan model and New Growth Theory, primarily focus on the interaction between the input of production factors and technological progress, with little consideration of the institutional variables specific to China. The unique value of ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model lies in its ability to integrate not only the classical theories on capital, labor, and technology but also the role of government actions through reform and cultural factors within the system. For example, through reform and innovation, the Chinese government can strengthen areas such as fiscal policy, industrial planning, and institutional innovation. This can directly stimulate investment (such as infrastructure projects), indirectly boost consumption (such as tax reductions to promote domestic demand), and even reshape the structure of net exports (such as the Belt and Road Initiative, BRI). Therefore, it is important to emphasize that ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model is not a simple extension of traditional quantitative economic models. Its core lies in revealing the driving logic of economic growth through system coordination, facilitating the design of policies that can effectively stimulate economic growth. Between 2000 and 2024, China continued to rely on investment-driven growth in the face of external shocks, but this approach to regulation often came with side effects such as overcapacity and mounting debt. The root cause of this lies in the lack of deep consideration for reform to optimize investment efficiency. If policy returns are solely focused on short-term GDP numbers, while neglecting long-term goals such as industrial chain security and technological autonomy, it could lead to a vicious cycle of 'investment - unfinished projects - re-investment'. This has already led to profound lessons in areas like semiconductor manufacturing and the photovoltaic industry. The key to breaking this dilemma lies in the coordination of the three multiplier coefficients, namely technology, reform, and culture in ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model. First, technological innovation, as the core variable of the coefficient relationship, plays a crucial role through multiple pathways. According to ANBOUND Technology Innovation Transforming Productivity Model as discussed by ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan, the multiplier effect of technology on the economy can be realized through three modes: industry returns, policy returns, and capital returns. Taking industry returns as an example, China's manufacturing sector has enhanced its value added per unit of investment from RMB 1.8 / RMB invested in 2012 to RMB 2.4 / RMB invested in 2024, which is empirical evidence of the technology coefficient amplifying investment effectiveness. However, the capital return pathway faces significant distortions in China. The technology sector in A-share has been systematically overvalued in terms of price-to-earnings ratios, and although the registration system reform has accelerated the IPO process, the market's focus on 'financing over investment' has resulted in capital being unable to effectively nourish the real economy. This highlights that the activation of the technology coefficient relies not only on the intensity of research and development investment, with China’s R&D expenditure as a share of GDP in 2024 is 2.7%, but also on accompanying institutional reforms to streamline the transformation chain from 'laboratories - capital markets - industrial applications'. Secondly, the economic value of the cultural coefficient is often underestimated, yet it is closely related to consumption. It deeply participates in economic operation through implicit mechanisms such as shaping consumption preferences, brand premiums, and innovation ecosystems. On the demand side, the role of cultural identity in driving consumption upgrades has become increasingly significant. For instance, the market share of Chinese trendy brands in areas such as clothing and cosmetics has risen from 28% in 2018 to 47% in 2024. Behind this shift is the cultural coefficient reshaping the consumption logic of 'Made in China - Chinese Brands - Chinese Values'. On the supply side, cultural factors indirectly influence total factor productivity by affecting the quality of human capital. For example, the localization of 'craftsmanship spirit' in the Yangtze River Delta region has resulted in a patent conversion rate for high-end equipment manufacturing that is 12 percentage points higher than the national average. More profoundly, the cultural coefficient factor also defines the ethical boundaries of economic growth. When the concept of 'nature is wealth' is translated into institutional practices such as carbon trading markets and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments, culture becomes the underlying operating system that harmonizes growth with sustainability. Finally, the effectiveness of the reform coefficient is primarily reflected in its ability to optimize the coordination of the three key data relationships. Taking China’s new energy vehicle (NEV) industry in 2024 as an example, the government implemented a series of combined policies, such as phasing out subsidies (adjusting the consumption coefficient), financing for charging infrastructure REITs (leveraging social investment), and strategic reserves of lithium resources (stabilizing net export costs). As a result, the industry saw an 18% growth in fixed asset investment, while the consumer market penetration increased to 35%, and exports of power batteries surpassed USD 12 billion. The success of this multi-objective coordination lies in the government's shift from being a 'direct intervener' to a 'system operator'. For instance, the country’s Ministry of Finance prioritized special bond funding to support the construction of tech parks, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) released space for private investment through its negative list management, and the cultural department’s IP incubation programs promoted cultural and tourism consumption. After the cumulative effect of these various policy tools, the economic benefits generated far exceeded a simple sum of individual measures. Currently, the key to breaking through China's economic challenges lies in how to rebalance the coefficient relationships under the 'threefold pressure'. On the investment side, the use of local government special bond funds needs to shift from 'quantity' expansion to 'quality' improvement, enhancing the industrial relevance of new infrastructure through the infusion of the technology coefficient. On the consumption side, the cultural coefficient should focus on resolving the people’s paradox of 'having income but not daring to spend', in order to unlock medium- to long-term potential by fostering emerging business models like those catered for senior citizens and immersive experiences. On the net export side, the reform coefficient needs to reshape the BRI cooperation model, turning cultural identity into institutional public goods, such as mutual recognition of standards and co-governance of intellectual property. Crucially, these three coefficients are not independent. Technological breakthroughs rely on government-led basic research investments, such as reforms. Cultural soft power construction needs to be empowered by technological means. Meanwhile, the improvement in government governance resulting from reforms is closely linked to institutional innovations within a cultural context. This interconnectedness requires that policy design go beyond departmental perspectives and seek the optimal solution within the interactive framework of 'technology-reform-culture'. In this regard, ANBOUND’s Economic Growth Model provides a systematic foundation for understanding China’s 15th Five-Year Plan, as well as creating a more potential-driven, flexible window for correctly assessing the future prospects of the country's economic growth. Therefore, this model is not intended for academic purposes alone, but rather to define the future trends of economic growth, creating the necessary conditions and opening up pathways for that future development. Final analysis conclusion: Looking through the perspective of the new stage of high-quality development, the practical significance of ANBOUND's Economic Growth Model is becoming increasingly evident. It signals to decision-makers that economic growth is not just a 'data race' but also a 'coefficient revolution'. As the marginal returns of traditional growth drivers decline, breakthroughs in technology to push the productivity frontier, reforms to reconstruct incentive-compatible mechanisms, and culture to activate social capital will become key to overcoming the middle-income trap. Historical experience shows that any single dimension of growth faces a ceiling. The United States’ over-reliance on capital returns has led to industrial hollowing out, while Japan’s technological strength has been constrained by cultural isolation, which weakens its innovation vitality. China's path to breaking through lies in leveraging its institutional advantages to weave a 'six-dimensional network', deeply integrating the sharpness of technology, the precision of reform, as well as the cultural aspect.

The Future Of The US In Europe: A Proposal – Analysis	By Aaron Stein (FPRI) -- US President Donald Trump is a radically transparent person but still manages to surprise. After promising for years that he would put pressure on Ukraine to agree with Russia to halt fighting, Trump has recently followed through. He directed his administration to extort the Ukrainian government for a natural resources agreement, ostensibly to 'pay back' the American taxpayer for military assistance, and called on Europe to provide a military force to occupy the country to deter a Russian resumption of fighting after any agreement is reached. Trump’s demands have caused a serious fissure in transatlantic relations. It is essential to understand the roots of these fissures so that the US-European relationship can evolve to meet the moment. Trump is remarkably consistent, and elements of his worldview have become mainstream, particularly his demand of Europe to do more for itself so that Washington can focus on the Indo-Pacific. The Obama administration first announced the 'rebalance' towards Asia in 2011, which continued during the first Trump administration, accelerated under former President Joe Biden, and will likely fully mature during Trump’s second term. The 'rebalance' always included a basic tradeoff: The United States would de-emphasize its commitments in the Middle East and Europe in favor of a reallocation of forces in Asia and Australia. For nearly to two decades, American officials have extolled their European counterparts to spend more on defense, settling in recent years on asking for an increase in spending to 5 percent of GDP (with 30 percent of total defense spending allotted for new procurements). This call came after years of disquiet about Europe’s failures to live up to the 2014 NATO agreement in Wales to increase defense spending to 2 percent of total GDP. Europe has been slow to respond but spurred by Russia’s second invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and now the shock of a second Trump administration, the urgency to increase defense spending has increased. This urgency, however, has come with deep concern about the future of European security and whether or not Trump will sell out Europe to Moscow. It also may be impossible for Europe to meet under current fiscal rules. Germany remains hampered by its refusal to alter the debt brake (at least for now), France’s fiscal situation is less than ideal, and the United Kingdom remains mired in the self-induced malaise brought about by Brexit. The 5 percent figure is currently more than the money spent on defense in the United States, so any such increase would entail a longer-term plan for getting there. It would also entail significant changes to Europe’s social contract. It may also be necessary, if European nations want to follow through on their renewed pledges to be more autonomous from the United States. There is also a different option: to agree at the next NATO summit to increase defense spending to 3.5 percent and to try and shape the future of the security of Europe—in cooperation with the Trump administration—in mutually beneficial ways. The increase may not be easy, but it is worth trying. I believe there is still a way out of this crisis, but it requires Europe to follow through and spend more and ask Washington for specific things to enhance regional security. The United States can defend Europe through a smaller presence. Europe can spend more. It is time to think about how to do this. A Straightforward Policy The Trump administration’s Europe policy is remarkably straightforward. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth described it bluntly: The United States is prioritizing deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognizing the reality of scarcity, and making the resourcing tradeoffs to ensure deterrence does not fail … As the United States prioritizes its attention to these threats, European allies must lead from the front. Together, we can establish a division of labor that maximizes our comparative advantages in Europe and Pacific respectively. The good news is that the administration has told anyone who will listen that it remains committed to the defense of Europe. Hegseth was very clear, telling his counterparts, 'The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defense partnership with Europe. Full stop.' However, the shift in US priorities has raised a basic policy problem almost every administration has had to navigate since NATO’s founding: how to reassure European leaders that Washington would fight for European security if a localized conflict did not directly impact American continental security. This is where the Trump administration has fallen woefully short. In a social media post, Trump extolled Europe for 'failing to bring peace' and suggested that 'Ukraine is far more important to Europe than it is to us … We have a big, beautiful ocean as a separation.' This isolationism would suggest America cannot be trusted. This feeling of betrayal is made worse by Trump’s desire for a rapid peace agreement with Russia about Ukraine, which has thus far seen his administration’s talking points tilt towards those from the Kremlin. This incongruity needs to be addressed with better messaging from Washington and can be done in ways that align with Trump’s worldview. A Very Clear World View Trump has had very consistent views on foreign policy. In an interview with Playboy in 1990, Trump (speaking about himself in the third person) was very blunt about his approach towards US adversaries and allies: He [Trump] would believe very strongly in extreme military strength. He wouldn’t trust anyone. He wouldn’t trust the Russians; he wouldn’t trust our allies; he’d have a huge military arsenal, perfect it, understand it. Part of the problem is that we’re defending some of the wealthiest countries in the world for nothing … We’re being laughed at around the world. If this sounds familiar, it is because the man hasn’t really changed at all in nearly four decades. He has a very black and white approach to global security, believing that the United States has to have a strong military that is not tasked with defending allies, nor specifically looking to fight adversaries. He also has a healthy aversion to nuclear conflict, telling Playboy and the New York Times, almost three decades apart, virtually the same thing. I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people believing it will never happen because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit. Now, compare to his thoughts in 2016. Look, in the perfect world everybody would agree that nuclear would, you know, be so destructive, and this was always the theory, or was certainly the theory of many. That the power is so enormous that nobody would ever use them … And, you know, we have been under the impression that, well we’ve been, I think it’s misguided somewhat, I’ve always felt this but that nobody would ever use them because of the power. And the first one to use them, I think that would be a very bad thing. And I will tell you, I would very much not want to be the first one to use them, that I can say. Trump is neither articulate, nor diplomatic, but he is very consistent. The basic outline of his foreign policy, therefore, is easy to understand: Trump does not view alliances as additive to US power unless allies can defend themselves; Russia is not to be trusted, but also not to be unnecessarily quarreled with, and nuclear war should be prevented at all costs. However, Trump’s zero-sum approach to diplomacy also provides clear opportunities for European actors. It is naive to suggest Trump’s policy is simply more of the same from America. It is not. His policy vis-a-vis alliances is an anathema to how the US-European defense partnership is currently structured and explains why so many are now concerned about the future of the transatlantic partnership. I understand the anxiety. However, it is important not to fall into the trap of manifesting an outcome that does not need to happen. At their core, Trump and his foreign policy cadre are asking Europe to defend itself with America acting as a backstop to deter, with nuclear weapons, further Russian aggression. Hegseth did not say so directly during his recent trip to the continent but overtly implied it when he said that NATO 'will require our European allies to step into the arena and take ownership of conventional security on the continent.' This division of labor, it appears, will involve Europe assuming the conventional defense of Europe, with Washington providing nuclear guarantees, along with some elements of continued conventional assets. The question, then, is how to make the US nuclear guarantee more credible, even if such actions could raise the risk of nuclear conflict. The solution is actually a dual-track approach to US-Russian dialogue, of the type favored by Trump, alongside a clear vision of how nuclear guarantees could be additive to the 'division of labor' approach the administration favors. The test case is Ukraine, where the administration is seeking to deploy European troops in the country if an agreement on a ceasefire can be reached with Russia. The Trump administration, however, has refused to specify whether or not any European presence in Ukraine would come with a US security guarantee.Hegseth has said the troops would be deployed outside of the NATO structure and, therefore, not be covered under the Washington Treaty’s mutual defense clause. This could work with some combined European force under the leadership of a European general and be structured in a way similar to the ad-hoc coalitions that Washington has cobbled together for every military endeavor it has launched since the end of the Cold War. However, it appears that both France and the United Kingdom would condition any such deployment on a US security guarantee backed by US platforms based in Poland or Romania. Options for Mutual Defense Ground Forces and Limiting National Caveats The basic outline does provide Europe with a way out of this crisis with Washington. It is absolutely vital for France and the United Kingdom to offer up at least a division of troops to be deployed in Ukraine. Without providing a specific military proposal, Europe may be pushed to the side and only presented with a final outline of requirements by Washington. These troops need to be garrisoned near the front line and have very clear rules of engagement and clear reporting lines. One of the many concerns I have is that a multinational European force will be bogged down by bureaucracy, beset by national caveats and rules about how they can be used, thereby making the force impotent from the start. Somebody needs to be in charge and national caveats about how to use force minimized from the start. This will require a strong European leader and all parties to the European-led force to agree to subordinate national commands to a non-American leader. This will be tough. The Trump administration would be very wise to consider deploying special forces with these European brigades to augment capabilities and, importantly, to train Ukrainian units in the country. Air Support, Space Assets, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance The United States Air Force should also consider deploying aircraft from Lakenheath, England to Poland to support this European force. Europe should be asked to provide tanker support in Poland, thereby allowing for a smaller number of jets to patrol the NATO-Russian border. These jets would also be on-call for Allied troops in contact situations to support European troops in Ukraine. Finally, any European force in Ukraine would be almost entirely dependent on US-provided space assets, as well as unmanned aircraft to monitor the line of contact. These assets should be deployed in support of the European force, ideally based out of Poland (or Germany) and be modeled on the myriads of air operations America and Europe have launched together over the past three decades around the world. This approach should also include a robust role for US contractors, who are critical for the servicing of Ukraine’s armed forces. Air and Missile Defense There is also a role for NATO. The Alliance has provided augmented air and missile defense to Turkey for more than a decade. The deployment of both Patriot and SAMP/T missiles in Turkey was spurred by the Syrian civil war spilling over the border. Bashar al-Assad is now deposed. Ankara now occupies Syria. There is simply no reason to continue to deploy European missile defenses on a border that Ankara now controls. The mission should be repurposed, with NATO providing air and missile defense interceptors in Poland. The combination of these missile interceptors, alongside US and European Air Forces, should spur renewed debate about how best to patrol Ukrainian air space in the event of a ceasefire. The obvious model to pull on would be the multinational air defense of West Germany during the Cold War, complete with a dedicated reporting structure, established air corridors, routes for Allied jets to transit in and out of, and procedures to intercept any aircraft that crossed the line of contact. This all can be done from a hub in Poland, with US support, and in ways that does not require anything more than a slimmed down special forces presence inside Ukraine. A multinational air defense would also obligate the United States to NATO’s territorial defense—a goal Trump and Hegseth have both said they would honor—and help to extend those guarantees across the border into Ukraine. Finally, there is a way to tie the future of European security to Trump’s future policy agenda in ways that could be additive to the settlement of Ukraine. The early warning infrastructure for current and future US missile defenses is deployed throughout Europe. There also are two interceptor sites in Poland and Romania. These facilities are important for the administration’s 'Golden Dome for America' missile defense concept, where Hegseth has said future Pentagon budgets should spend more funds. The Role of Nuclear Weapons The final proposal is a bit more controversial but would also fit with US priorities over the next four years. If the United States is serious about providing nuclear guarantees for Europe without a large troop presence, it should consider soliciting European opinion about deploying more nuclear weapons in Europe. As of now, Washington has approximately 200 gravity bombs stored on five airbases in Europe. The weapons are not really usable in a crisis, and instead, the security of the Alliance is guaranteed by US long-range forces deployed on submarines and in the continental United States. The United States should propose deploying a nuclear armed, ground launched missile for deployment in Europe. The Typhon launcher can carry both the Tomahawk and SM-6 missiles. The Tomahawk could be assigned a modernized nuclear warhead and be deployed in Poland or Germany. The return of more usable nuclear weapons in Europe would have an obvious deterrent effect on Russia and put more 'American skin in the game' without a dramatic increase in troops. The role of nuclear weapons could also raise the stakes of a Russian violation in Ukraine and, ironically, more tightly tether the United States to the future of Europe. The defense of Europe would take on a more pronounced nuclear dimension, ensuring that any conflict that expands beyond Ukraine’s border could 'go nuclear' and therefore risk catastrophic escalation to include strikes on the US homeland. This fear of escalation would require the United States to think about future security on the continent, perhaps assuage some European concerns, and fit with Department of Defense funding priorities. France should consider a once-a-year European-only nuclear exercise modeled on NATO’s annual Steadfast Noon exercise. The basic idea would be to integrate the European Air Forces into a simulated nuclear strike mission. The exercise would obviate the need to deploy French nuclear weapons outside the country (a very unlikely scenario) or undercut the US nuclear guarantee to the continent. NATO agrees every time it rewrites its strategic document that the ultimate security of the Alliance is American nuclear weapons deployed primarily on submarines and inside the United States. The Allies have agreed that French and British nuclear weapons 'have a deterrent role of their own and contribute significantly' to Alliance security. France has overtly suggested that it is ready to have such a discussion, but too often these calls lead to a fracturing of European opinion rather than a serious debate about the future of nuclear deterrence on the continent. The transatlantic relationship is changing rapidly. It is vitally important to think about how to manage the change so that the Alliance endures and adapts. There is a clear pathway forward to ensure the United States remains engaged, Europe remains protected, and a ceasefire in Ukraine is enforced. There is also a way to do this that advances the European project, continues to roll back Russian revanchism, and works within the quirks of Trumpism. The United States is finishing its pivot to Asia, but it can and should be able to defend the continent with a more pronounced European effort and additive US capabilities.

Judicial Adventurism Can Imperil Democracy – OpEd	The only period of legal authoritarian rule in India was June 1975–March 1977 following the declaration of an Emergency by Prime Minister (PM) Indira Gandhi. I happened to be back in India, based in New Delhi, doing archival and interview research for my PhD. The experience of the overnight transition from a rambunctious democracy to which argumentative Indians had taken with gusto, to a stifling and oppressive rule by state fiat, was deeply and permanently sobering. It led to my first academic article on returning to Canada, ‘The Fate of India’s Parliamentary Democracy’ (1976). Looking back at that now, I expect I would temper my harsh criticisms of PM Gandhi. For in fact the constitutional crisis arose from an Allahabad High Court verdict, confirmed by one Supreme Court justice that was appealed but not heard before the Emergency came into force. She had won a decisive victory in the 1971 general election with 68 percent of seats in parliament. I would now be strongly opposed to the judges vacating a clear verdict on a technicality of violating electoral laws which, if applied across the board, would have led to almost all parliamentarians losing their seats. But my main point in recalling that incident and leading with it is that the issues of constitutionalism and the boundaries between law and politics and the institutions of the judiciary, legislature, and the executive, have preoccupied me for half a century in both their philosophical abstractions and practical applications. Importantly, my opinions have changed in the sense that at the end of the day, I’ve come to believe that politicians and the political process pose less of an institutionalised threat to people’s freedoms, liberties, and speech than unelected, unaccountable, and unsackable judges who often, in the guise of interpreting laws, don’t hesitate to make – and make up – laws. Indeed in India in the end it was the voters who dealt Mrs Gandhi a crushing electoral defeat in 1977 for all the thuggish excesses under the Emergency, but then brought her back decisively in 1980 when they discovered just how incompetent the other lot of rabble-rousers were. Law, Politics, and Norms in International Affairs Human rights courts have become the place where democracies go to die. Law, both within and among nations, is an effort to align power to justice. All justice systems rest on a dynamic interaction between law, politics, and norms. Politics is about power: its location, bases, exercise, effects. Law seeks to tame power and convert it into authority through legitimising principles (e.g. democracy, separation of powers, due process), structures (e.g. legislature, executive, judiciary), and procedures (e.g. elections, trials). Law thereby mediates relations between the rich and the poor, the weak and the powerful. No one is above the law in democracies; everyone is subject to the laws that apply without fear or favour to all. But equally, everyone is under the law and law protects everyone. Only when both conditions apply is everyone equal under the law. The greater the gap between power and authority, the closer we are to anarchy, to the law of the jungle where might equals right, and the greater is the legitimacy deficit. Unlike national courts, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) are not embedded in a broader system of democratic policy-making. There are no political checks on them. In a national system, the office of the prosecutor functions within a well-established structure of state governance. In the international system, neither the ICJ nor the ICC was established as part of a centralised system of world government. The ICJ regulates only interstate relations. The ICC has jurisdiction over the nationals of state parties and, in some contested contingencies, can exercise jurisdiction over non-party nationals also. But in doing so it displaces the state as the conduit of democratic representation and provides no alternative mechanism for democratic governance, which has landed it in deep trouble with the Trump administration vis-à-vis Israel. In the idealised conception, the constitution encapsulates and articulates the social purpose of a state. The laws and institutions of state give practical content to the social purpose and work together to that common end. The closest equivalent to a constitution for the international order is the Charter of the United Nations adopted in 1945. But there is no world state whose social purpose can be found in the purposes and principles spelt out in Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter. In The United Nations, Peace and Security (Cambridge University Press, 2006), I described the UN as ‘a symbol of an imagined and constructed community of strangers’ (p. 369), but also noted that the Founders’ ‘vision of a world community equal in rights, bound by a common vision and united in action is still to be realised’ (p. 359). The last great reform effort faltered in 2005 in part because of the erosion of the sense of community as the UN membership had almost quadrupled since its creation in 1945 with the addition of almost exclusively non-Western newly decolonised nations. Nor is there a world government with its own legislature and executive. The General Assembly and Security Council are very inadequate equivalents. Moreover, the Security Council, dominated by the five permanent members, is not elected by the Assembly, not answerable to it, and not dismissible by it. The UN does have a secretariat but it doesn’t have its own law enforcement agencies nor its own military force. Instead, it is dependent on member states’ cooperation for these tasks. Nor does the UN have its own elaborate structure of a multi-layered judiciary from lower courts to an apex court exercising civil, criminal, and appellate functions. Comparable, for example, to the Australian constitution which deals with ‘The Judicature’ in Chapter III, Chapter XIV of the Charter does list the ICJ as ‘the principal judicial organ of the United Nations,’ incorporates the court’s Statute as an annex, and describes it as ‘an integral part of the present Charter’ (Article 92). In communist systems, courts are not just an integral part of the structures of state, but an equally integral part of the communist party regime. Independence of the judiciary from the party is incompatible with the organising ideology of communist rule and unimaginable in practice. Thus it is that China’s ICJ judge Xue Hanqin, a vice president of the court, is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and a former director general of the department of treaty and law in China’s foreign ministry. No surprise then that, consistent with Chinese policies, in 2019 she ruled that the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean should be returned by Britain to Mauritius and in 2022 was one of only two judges to dissent from the majority judgment calling on Russia to suspend the invasion of Ukraine. The second dissenting judge was Russian. As for the ICC, why should it have authority over constitutionally legitimated democracies like Australia, Israel, or the US? But if the ICC cannot claim authority over democratic countries, can it fairly claim jurisdiction over non-democracies like China and Russia? At the other end of the spectrum lies the UN Security Council as the sole enforcement arm of international criminal justice should ICJ and ICC decisions be defied or disrespected. Unfortunately, the Security Council’s democratic credentials are exactly zero and its successful resistance to meaningful reforms has greatly eroded its legitimacy. Having multiple layers of national courts and judges means that by the time it gets to the apex court, there is greater distance of the judges from the location, events, time, and passions of the crime. In addition, the apex court’s judges benefit from the facts already elucidated and arguments canvassed and clarified in the lower courts. Australia’s Cardinal Pell was found guilty in a unanimous jury verdict; this was upheld by a two-to-one majority by the Victorian Court of Appeals but overturned in a unanimous High Court judgment. The international system lacks such essential safeguards, with only one ICJ and ICC each. This multiplies the possibility of wrongful verdicts with no recourse to appeal. Law, Politics, and Norms in National Affairs The UN system’s legitimacy deficits notwithstanding, a rules-based international order offers the prospect of normative protection, albeit less than foolproof, for the weak states against the predatory instincts of powerful states. The international rule of law is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for regulating the use of force and levelling the playing field for small and great powers. Domestically, a firmly established rule of law offers more reliable protection for the poor, weak, and marginalised members of society than the discretionary beneficence of an enlightened despot. The gap between the normative structure and power equations exists within nations as well, but to a significantly lesser degree in democratic countries. In apartheid South Africa, judges routinely denied reality staring them in the face to uphold a system of criminal injustice against blacks and Asians. In Canada, courts have succumbed to the pressure of racialised justice and apply what are called Impact of Race and Culture Assessment reports (IRCAs) in sentencing. The justification is that these will help judges better understand how poverty, systemic racism, and discrimination might have influenced and constricted the life choices and trajectory of the convicted offender. In a further subcategorisation of this racialised justice, clients who self-identify as black do not need an endorsement from the court to obtain an IRCA report, but self-identifying members of other racial communities do. In the US it’s generally acknowledged that filling a Supreme Court vacancy is of more long-term consequence than a presidential election. The nomination battles in the Senate are conducted more along ideological lines disguised in the language of legal qualifications of the nominee. The remarkable reliability of predicting the vote of most justices along the conservative-liberal divide on most precedent-setting important cases belies the myth of the impartial majesty of the legal system interpreting and applying independently objective laws. Within Western countries, the reality of mass immigration plus a difference in birth rates between native and immigrant groups means that the Third World has come to the West and diluted the pre-existing social cohesion and cultural community, to the extent that one existed. The contrast with the continuity of cultural cohesion in low-immigration, low-crime, and high-trust Japan that I witnessed firsthand during almost a decade of living in Tokyo is striking. In recent years a clear divide has emerged between the ruling elites and their peoples in the welcoming versus increasingly hostile attitudes towards continuing mass immigration. Not only is the legal clerisy, including lawyers and judges, part of the ruling elite. In addition, it too has been captured by the prevailing nostrums of the centre-left ideology during the long march through the institutions. In Australia, we saw this most clearly in the failed Voice referendum in October 2023 which would have given special recognition to Aboriginal Australians by inserting an entirely new chapter in the constitution. Lawfare and Activist Judiciaries Imperil Democracy Laws simultaneously act as both a licence and a leash. On the one hand, in their permissive function they enable individuals, authorised agents of the state, businesses, and organisations to engage in particular behaviours. On the other hand, in their restrictive function, they set out limits to what the various actors may do, transgressing which puts them beyond the safety of the law. The rights and responsibilities of the different actors as prescribed in law are the bedrock of the rule of law. Constitutional governance and the rule of law in turn are essential underpinnings of democratic politics. There is a corollary. If there is an imbalance between the licence and leash attributes of law, if laws make it either all too easy or impossible for the government to govern, then democracy can end in tyranny, with all or too much power concentrated in the government at the expense of citizen’s liberties; or its opposite, anarchy, with a complete collapse of the functions of government. In recent years I have become increasingly apprehensive at the weaponisation of law to paralyse governments, by human rights lawyers in particular, albeit not exclusively so. An essential component of the democracy project has been to transition nations of people holding power into nations of laws. Law seeks to tame the arbitrary and capricious exercise of power. Democracy seeks to make the holders and wielders of power chosen and dismissible by the citizens and the exercise of power subject to the consent of the people. ‘Judicial romanticism’ is the belief that judicial activism is the solution to all social-political conflicts and ills. It is a conceit of judicial romanticism that law can never be appropriated to serve the ideological worldviews of the juristocracy and in the process frustrate the functioning of democratic politics. Regional and global institutions of justice like the European Court on Human Rights, the ICJ, and the ICC worsen the anti-democratic pathology by not being grounded in local culture and values and physically located at considerable distance from ‘We, the people.’ The end result is that the rule of law is corrupted into the bastard child of a rule by lawyers. Within nations, Western democracies have reached an inflection point on mass immigration. The highly charged issue is proving decisive in shaping electoral outcomes from the US to the UK, Italy, The Netherlands, and Germany. One would think that this should make judges all the more cautious in venturing into the political minefield. Wrong. Pushed by voters to take back control of porous borders, governments are often frustrated by courts that buy activist lawyers’ suits alleging breaches of national, continental, and international human rights laws and conventions. USA Gwythian Prins of the LSE uses the metaphor of Trump as the captain of an ice-bound ship of state who is dynamiting the pack ice with linked and sequenced charges to break free. The shock waves from the explosions are being felt around the world. The Democrats’ weaponisation of the justice system against Trump during the Biden administration was so cynical that in the end it backfired spectacularly and proved more politically damaging to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris than to Trump. Having lost the presidency and Senate to the Republicans and failed to win back the House, Democrats have turned to lawfare to frustrate Trump’s voter-mandated second-term agenda. Why? Because the vigorous campaign to disinfect the DC swamp with sunlight is proving fatal to the swamp-dwelling bureaucracy. Trump’s blizzard of executive orders to implement his campaign promises of cutting back on government inefficiency, waste, and corruption have been countered with a flurry of lawsuits from panicked unions and Democrats that have produced some stay orders. The nationwide injunctions could bring Trump’s frenetic implementation schedule of his agenda to a stuttering halt. The institution and practice of national injunctions inevitably encourage forum shopping to lodge a case in a jurisdiction and with a judge likely to be sympathetic to the complaint. Yet there is a legal case to be made, as per a well-cited 2017 article by Samuel L Bray in the Harvard Law Review, that a federal court should give a plaintiff-protective but not a national injunction. The latter is a relatively recent innovation in US jurisprudence: ‘a federal court’s power to issue injunctions is restricted to a specific defendant’s conduct only with respect to a specific plaintiff.’ Another risk is that the injunctions might be playing into a calculated strategy of provoking lawsuits that will clarify the executive’s right to control the bureaucracy, including the so-called independent agencies that have sprawled over the last century and blur the legislative-executive-judicial boundaries. This might prove to be the most effective route to reining in the administrative state. Congress has seeded a veritable forest of regulatory agencies that perform executive and quasi-judicial functions that are free of executive control and judicial oversight, reporting only to Congress. It might be an idea for those attempting to block Trump’s ability to govern through court injunctions to look again at some of the poll findings on what voters liked about Trump: he doesn’t care what others think, says what he means, and does what he says. Vice President J D Vance, who is proving to be an articulate, cogent, and telegenic champion of the Trump agenda, tweeted on 10 February: ‘Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.’ It has had 63 million views. On 9 February, Trump himself commented that judges interfering with the executive’s political agenda was ‘a disgrace:’ ‘No judge should…be allowed to make that kind of a decision’ whereby ‘a president can’t look for fraud and waste and abuse.’When asked directly by an ABC News reporter on 11 February whether he would comply with a judge’s adverse ruling, Trump replied: ‘Well, I always abide by the courts and then I’ll have to appeal it. But then what he’s done is he slowed down the momentum.’ This has produced conniptions among Democrats and their cheerleaders, frothing that Trump is provoking a constitutional crisis. Set aside the memory of Biden openly boasting a year ago that the ‘The Supreme Court blocked’ his student loan debt relief plan ‘but that didn’t stop me.’ Separation of powers means there are limits to the jurisdictional overreach of all three branches, including the judiciary. Who holds the judiciary accountable to its limits? To claim that any reminder to the courts to stay in their judicial lane and not stray into the legislative and executive lanes risks a constitutional crisis, is to make the judiciary the sole arbiter of its own reach and limits, as well as that of the other two branches. Nice job if you can get it. Maybe Trump should launch a campaign to Make America Governable Again. A constitutional cleanup, not a constitutional crisis. UK PM Keir Starmer is already firmly stuck with the public belief that he is operating a two-tier justice system and has become known as Two-Tier Keir. Starmer’s Attorney General Lord Hermer, a human rights barrister colleague and close personal friend, is in a class of his own in the portfolio of cases involving allegations of breaches of international human rights law by the UK. His roll call of clients included the former leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, one of the plotters of the 9/11 attacks, an al-Qaeda chief linked to the 7 July 2005 bombings in London, a willing ISIS bridedemanding the right to return to Britain, and a Pakistani terrorist who plotted to bomb a Manchester shopping centre. Most recently, Hermer is reported as supporting an Oxford don, who backed the claim of Mauritius against the UK in the Chagos Islands case, as the UK’s nominee to the ICJ. Announcing Professor Dapo Akande’s nomination last year, Starmer said he was ‘personally committed to strengthening international rule of law and the institutions that support it.’ Some UK verdicts have been so outrageous as to make one wonder if judges are trolling the public and daring the government to reverse some of their incendiary rulings. Rulings just this month have granted a Gaza family of six right of entry under a family reunion scheme enacted for Ukrainian refugees, as if there are not already enough Jew-hating residents; stopped an Albanian criminal’s deportation because of his ten-year old son’s distaste for foreign chicken nuggets; granted asylum to a woman who, having failed eight times to gain asylum, joined a Biafran terrorist organisation and reapplied because of risks to safety if returned to Nigeria, with the judge acknowledging she’d joined the group solely ‘to create a claim for asylum;’ prevented deportation of a Pakistani man incarcerated for child sex offencesbecause depriving his children of their convicted paedophile Dad would be ‘unduly harsh;’ allowed a convicted paedophile, sentenced to more than five years imprisonment, to stay in Britain because he would face ‘hostility’ if deported back to Zimbabwe; and aborted attempts to deport another convicted paedophile Sri Lankan because, being gay, he could face prosecution in his home country. Europe In a similar vein, Gavin Mortimer argues in The Spectator that the judiciary is fuelling Europe’s immigration crisis. An Italian court ordered 49 migrants who had been sent to Albania after a sea rescue to be brought to Italy, the third judicial frustration in four months of PM Giorgia Meloni’s efforts to curb illegal immigration. A French court overturned the deportation order of a convicted Algerian with two failed attempts to enter illegally. An angry Interior Minister asked: ‘Should our law protect dangerous individuals or protect French society against dangerous individuals’? Germany suffered the death of a police officer in Mannheim in June by an Afghan; the deaths of three people in Solingen in August stabbed by a Syrian asylum seeker; a December car attack on a Magdeburg Christmas Market by a Saudi refugee that killed five people; and a stabbing in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg in January by an Afghan asylum seeker who killed two. Vice President Vance in his remarkable speech on 14 February at the Munich Security Conference, referencing the car attack on a trade union rally in Munich the previous day by a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker who killed a 37-year-old mother and her two-year-old daughter and injured 37 people, asked: How many times must we suffer these appalling setbacks before we change course and take our shared civilisation in a new direction? He received an answer of sorts the very next day. A 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker took a knife to a crowd in Villach, a southern Austrian town, killing one 14-year-old boy and wounding five people. The serial attacks associated with refugees and asylum seekers solidify the sentiment that Germany is adrift in uncharted waters. They fuel public support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, one of whose members was convicted last year of incitement to hatred for repeating official statistics showing Afghan migrants are disproportionately likely to commit serious sexual offences. The AfD is routinely castigated as far-right, a descriptor that is fast proving to mean ‘Too Right’ or ‘Totally Right.’ Vance’s meeting with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, in conjunction with his failure to meet one-to-one with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, was deeply symbolic. Optics matter. Vance’s message to the European leaders in the audience, in capitals across Europe, and in Brussels, was: democracy means listening to the people and responding to their concerns. In effect their sniffy reply was: Opinions may vary on that. Australia One of the best examples of the dangers of judicial activism by woke-infected Australian judges is the Love decision. In 2020 Australia’s apex court decided in a 4-3 split verdict that two men, neither of whom was born in Australia or was an Australian citizen but both claimed Australian Aboriginal ancestry, were not aliens and therefore could not be deported as non-citizens for having served over a year each in prison for violent assaults. The majority judges’ reasoning explicitly included Aboriginals’ inalienable connections to the lands and waters of Australia, irrespective of their citizenship status. Any Australian who still believes that the Albanese government has not been influenced by electoral calculations in its kid-glove treatment of anti-Semitism, hate speech, and violence against Jews is ripe for being sold one of the most iconic opera houses in the world, on the steps of which the current wave of soft policing of hate-spewing anti-Semitic protests was first witnessed and the images went viral around the world. How appropriate is it for NSW chief justice Andrew Bell to publicly criticise Elon Musk as the man ‘who attacked the Australian government’s attempts to regulate the flow of misinformation and disinformation?’ As The Australian’s Janet Albrechtsen commented, instead of trying to play the role of chief censor, ‘‘The only person Bell should censor is himself.’ Conclusion Allister Heath, editor of The Sunday Telegraph, wonders just when British democracy gave way to ‘a tyranny of the human rights lawyers.’ The Telegraph itself argued in an editorial on 12 February that judicial overreach has made Britain ‘almost ungovernable.’ It added: ‘Through a series of decisions and unintended consequences reaching back decades, the judiciary of this country has been permitted to consolidate power at the expense of other branches of the state. This must now be wound back.’ When PM Starmer and Opposition Leader Kemi Badenoch both criticised the Gaza family decision as wrong, Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr huffily declared herself to be ‘deeply troubled.’ Their criticisms, she said, were ‘unacceptable’ because any public criticism fails to ‘respect and protect’ judges. Yeah, right. The politicians were not demanding the judge be sacked. Justice Carr is demanding that the two major party leaders self-censor any criticism of judicial decisions inside Parliament. To avoid criticism, judges need to be better educated on the boundary between interpreting laws and dictating policy, or else resign from the bench and run for public office with their own policy platform. It’s the politicised quality of the judgments that is lowering public esteem for the judiciary, not the fact that political leaders are responding to that public disquiet. As this article documents, the problem is far more widespread across the West than just the UK. In the 2019 Reith Lectures, the distinguished former Supreme Court judge Lord Jonathan Sumption issued a warning against ‘law’s expanding empire.’ He’s been sobered by how the European Court of Human Rights has acquired powers well beyond its treaty. In an article for The Law Association of New Zealand on 3 November 2023, he cautioned: ‘We have to have a minimum of fundamental rights in order to function as a democracy. That I accept. But if we place too many rights beyond the reach of democratic choice, then we cease to be a democracy just as surely as if we had no rights at all.’ This article was published at Brownstone Institute. A shorter version of this was published in the Spectator Australia magazine on 22 February.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JsfSmomCUuMz	2025-02-26T17:04:02-08:00	
Yes, Marx Advocated Violence And Political Repression – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed I was recently taken aback by a lengthy piece that I read (very oddly) in the Wall Street Journal. Jacob Berger is a professor of philosophy at Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He authored an article in the WSJ on January 23 entitled 'Why MAGA Folks Should Read Marx,' in which he wrote: '[G]iven the history of murderous communist regimes like Stalin’s Russia, Mao’s China and Pol Pot’s Cambodia, it is tempting to infer that Marx encouraged tyranny. But Marx did not advocate violence or political repression, and he would be appalled by the atrocities committed in his name. He pressed for revolution, but he envisioned that the ideal transition from capitalism to communism would be peaceful and democratic, like the Velvet Revolution that freed Czechoslovakia from Soviet rule in 1989.' The Marx to whom Professor Berger was referring was Karl, not Groucho. So, I read that paragraph again, thinking perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me. Karl Marx 'did not advocate violence or political repression'? That is not my recollection, and I think I’ve read everything the bohemian scribbler ever wrote, whether with pens or crayons. He 'envisioned that the ideal transition from capitalism to communism would be peaceful and democratic'? Did I miss something in all that Marxist stuff I read? Marx called for a 'dictatorship of the proletariat.' Can dictatorship ever be consensual and serene? My good friend and Spectator editor Paul Kengor urges people to read The Communist Manifesto. That’s where Marx and his sugar daddy collaborator Friedrich Engels attacked capitalism and sketched their vision for a socialist/communist future. Paul echoes a famous quip from Ronald Reagan: 'How do you tell if someone is a communist? He’s someone who reads Marx and Lenin. How do you tell an anti-communist? He’s one who understands Marx and Lenin.' What seemed to be unadulterated revisionism in Professor Berger’s article prompted me to take up Paul’s suggestion. I read The Communist Manifesto again for probably the third or fourth painful time. I arrived at the inescapable conclusion that Professor Berger does not understand it. Despite left-wing academia’s frequent embrace of Marx, The Manifesto comes across to a reasonable and thoughtful person as mindboggling nonsense. It’s gobbledygook writ large as if cooked up by nincompoops. It’s the sort of thing one would expect from a witch doctor who misdiagnoses the problem and then prescribes all the wrong medications, who thinks the patient who suffers from a toothache needs his feet removed. The Manifesto consists of one oversimplification after another: Everything, including what and how a person thinks, reduces to the rigid economic 'class' into which he was born. Everybody is either an oppressor or a helpless lump of the oppressed. Life is all about conflict. The book’s generalizations are so sweeping and unsupported as to be ridiculous and meaningless, such as the claim that if you are a male capitalist employer (a 'bourgeois' in Marx’s pejorative terminology), you see your wife as nothing more than 'a mere instrument of production.' At the same time, you and your fellow male capitalist employers 'take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other’s wives.' People are thus reduced to caricatures and homogenized in the Marxian blender so that no exceptions can corrupt the preconceived stereotypes that serve the Marxian narrative. At one point, Marx and Engels sputter this fatuous bunk: 'But does wage labor create any property for the laborer? Not a bit.' That’s right. 'Not a bit,' the two pseudo-intellectuals proclaim. Nobody anywhere knows of anybody working for wages who owns a thing after they get their paycheck. Nobody has ever seen or heard of a worker who saves and invests, starts a business, or improves his economic condition by accumulating property. Oh, I thought, I’m sure Marx and Engels have footnoted this. I’ll look at the bottom of the page to discover the source of this absurdity… Oops, no footnotes. None! The authors of this spleen-venting screed labeled a 'manifesto' expect you to take their word for it. And you’d better not disagree because, they assert in shameless arrogance, 'The charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of serious examination.' Let’s return to the paragraph I cited from Professor Berger’s article. He wants us to believe that Marx was a peaceful fellow. In re-reading The Communist Manifesto, I looked for anything indicating Marx opposed violence. I found otherwise—on page after page. Marx despised religion but postured as a prophet. History is marching inevitably toward a communist future in which all government would magically 'wither away' after a period of a socialist 'dictatorship of the proletariat.' He never explained what would prompt anybody with total power to suddenly proclaim of his own volition, 'See you later, I’m outta here.' Did Marx know this by using tarot cards, palm reading, or a Ouija board? Did he read animal entrails? From where did his super-confident knowledge of the future come? Don’t ask me. I don’t believe in witchcraft or soothsaying folderol. But it’s obvious from The Manifesto that Marx (and his pal Engels) saw violence to achieve the communist objective as a given. Consider this paragraph: The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organized as the ruling class; and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible. Can centralizing all instruments of production in the hands of the State be achieved peacefully? Professor Berger may think so, but Marx did not. Read on: Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production. That’s word salad for 'We’ll have to kick the s— out of a lot of people.' The Manifesto claims that 'the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.' Perhaps Marx somehow saw a future Professor Berger skipping over that, so he reinforced it with this assurance: '[Y]ou reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so: that is just what we intend.' Marx criticizes socialists who do not understand the necessity of revolutionary violence. They naively 'wish to attain their ends by peaceful means' that he says are 'necessarily doomed to failure.' Does this paragraph from The Manifesto make you think of the non-violent Mahatma Gandhi or a maniac with violent proclivities? In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.…They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. The 'forcible overthrow' of not some but 'all existing social conditions.' How could Professor Berger get away with claiming that a man who put his name to such a chilling statement was a peacenik? Perhaps the most famous part of The Manifesto is the list of pithy declarations of what the communists want done—known as the 'Ten Planks' of the document. Are they mere helpful tips for better living, or are they prescriptions for the violence that Professor Berger denies? Let’s look at just a few of them: Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes. How is this 'abolition' supposed to happen? Either everybody voluntarily hands over their belongings to the government, or the government shows up with guns and seizes them. The former is children’s fairy tale stuff; the latter is the only realistic option, and it is hardly non-violent. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. Don’t pay your taxes. You’ll find out whether taxes are voluntary contributions or not. You won’t even have to read The Communist Manifesto to discover what Marx intended here. Abolition of all rights of inheritance. How do you keep Mom and Dad from passing stuff on to their kids? Give them a pamphlet explaining why they shouldn’t? Good luck with that. I think you’d better bring guns. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels. Nothing to see here. Surely Marx intended for such confiscations to be 'mostly peaceful' at the least. Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State. Once the government takes over radio, television, the newspapers, the Internet, and every other method by which we convey our thoughts or our bodies, it will allow us to say anything and go anywhere we want. Wake up, Professor Berger. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture. When Marxists are in charge, you’re damn well gonna work. It might even be as a peon in some big, conscripted farm army. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.Remember the scene in the 1985 film The Killing Fields, in which Cambodian communists forced city dwellers into the rice patties? They took Marx seriously. He wanted the state to decide where you live and work. Can that possibly be a non-violent exercise? Alas, methinks I belabor the point. Read Paul Kengor’s The Devil and Karl Marx if you need more evidence that Karl Marx was not just a Red Mr. Rogers. Will someone at Lycoming College call out Professor Berger for intellectual malpractice? Maybe some of his fellow academics? I’m not holding my breath. About the author: Lawrence W.

President Trump’s Ukraine Policy: The Art Of The Deal – OpEd	When President Trump was running for election in 2024, he said he’d end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office. That hasn’t happened. Lately, he’s called Ukraine President Zelensky a dictator and even blamed him for starting the war with Russia. It seems he’s tilting toward Russia in his attempt to negotiate an end to the war. President Trump wants a personal victory in that dispute, and for him, a victory would be the end of the war. It matters little to him whether the war ends with Russia pulling out and leaving Ukraine with its old boundaries, or with Russia taking full control of Ukraine, or something in between. He isn’t taking Russia’s side, or Ukraine’s side. He wants a win for himself. At least some of his recent negative comments about Ukraine were intended to lower Zelensky’s expectations about the war’s outcome. That’s the art of the deal. Push for a hard bargain that gives negotiators much less than they would expect so that you can make concessions to make everyone feel like they got a good deal. If Putin thinks the war could go on forever, it will put more strain on the Russian economy and cause unrest at home. He may also worry that Russia will have to pull out without gaining land. At the same time, Zelensky may fear that Ukraine could lose all the territory that Russia claims. Because of these concerns, there is a chance for both sides to negotiate a deal that is better than these outcomes. Meanwhile, President Trump wants to declare a victory by seeing the war end, regardless of its outcome. He has repeatedly stated his goal of ending the war and never stated what he thought would be a just outcome. From a foreign policy standpoint, President Trump may be leaning toward Russia to strengthen Russia’s ties to the US and weaken the bond between Russia and China. But that may not be realistic, especially because everyone—including President Trump—knows that four years from now, someone else will be residing in the White House. The big problem with allowing Russia to keep any of the occupied territories is that it sends a message to Putin that he can use the Russian military to take territory from other sovereign nations, but President Trump apparently does not see it this way. The best outcome from the standpoint of global security would be for NATO to agree that Ukraine can never join in exchange for Russia agreeing to Ukraine’s original boundaries. That may be a tough sell, but President Trump, the deal-maker, could make it appear to be a victory for both sides. The bottom line: President Trump wants a deal, and when it happens, he will declare it a victory for himself, regardless of the terms of the deal.

The Gold At Fort Knox Was Stolen From Americans – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken In recent days, President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Senator Rand Paul, and some others have pressed for an audit of the US gold reserves, with a special focus on the gold at Fort Knox. This is perfectly reasonable given that the US gold reserves—which are the property of the US Treasury and not the Federal Reserve—have not undergone even a partial audit in at least forty years. Part of the reason for the audit is to discover if any of the gold has been stolen. The US Mint, the government agency that acts as custodian of the gold, has reported for many years that the official size of the gold reserve is 8,133.46 metric tons of gold. Since there has been no audit in so many decades, though, the Mint’s position is essentially 'trust us, bro.' Trusting federal bureaucrats has never been a particularly wise policy, and this is why there are ongoing demands for some sort of transparent audit. If the total size of the US’s gold holdings is revealed to be a number below the official number, then it will just be the latest reminder that there a great many thieves and incompetents among the people running the US federal government. After all, if there is less gold than reported in the US gold reserves, it was presumably stolen at some point. This would be a fitting destiny for the US government’s gold since much of that was stolen to begin with. When I say 'stolen,' I don’t even mean in the sense that 'taxation is theft' and that the US bought the gold using tax dollars. In truth, the way the US Treasury acquired much of its gold hoard is even more underhanded than ordinary taxation. Rather, it is likely that most of the gold at Fort Knox, as with the US regime’s gold in general, is gold stolen from ordinary Americans as a part of Franklin Roosevelt’s efforts to end the gold standard and confiscate private gold holdings in the United States. That is, the US gold reserves are a legacy of the way the US government reneged on its promises to redeem US dollars in gold. Rather than pay out the gold that was owed to holders of US dollars, the US government hoarded it instead. That stolen gold is what the auditors will be counting if the US government ever allows an honest accounting of the Treasury’s gold reserves. Where Did the Gold at Fort Knox Come From? In his 1994 article for The Journal of Economic Education, economist William C. Wood writes that 'the Fort Knox depository is now an artifact of gold standard days.' He then adds, 'The gold currently in Fort Knox came from the melting of Depression-era gold coins, from lend-lease arrangements in War II, and from government operations under the gold standard.' That reference to 'Depression-era gold coins' is telling. Most of those gold coins were likely the coins confiscated from private owners by the US government following Roosevelt’s Executive Order 6102 which outlawed the private ownership of gold. Few Americans owned gold bars, of course, and the gold that was in non-institutional private hands was mostly gold coin. Roosevelt’s edict required that private citizens hand this gold over to the US government in exchange for what was effectively below-market prices. And what if you would rather not give up your property to the US government? Too bad. Moreover, private banks and the central bank held gold in the form of coins for dollar holders who, prior to confiscation, would occasionally present US dollars for redemption in gold. This is, in part, the gold in Fort Knox that that Wood classifies as gold held for 'government operations under the gold standard.' After 1933, however, banks did not need to hold onto any gold coins for this purpose since Roosevelt’s effort to end the gold standard included a prohibition on banks paying out gold. So, these coins ceased to have an immediate market value among banks. Where did all these gold coins end up? Most ended up with the US Treasury after the Treasury seized the Federal Reserve’s gold in 1934. Evidence of this can be found in the nature of the gold that is now held at Fort Knox. Wood further explains that the gold there is not the type of gold usually found in gold bars used for international transactions: 'The gold resulting from melting of coinage has considerably lower quality than the ‘fine’ or ‘good delivery’ gold commonly used in international trade. The majority of the gold in Fort Knox is the lower-quality coin gold.' The legacy of the US regime’s gold theft is not limited to the coins that happened to be in private hands in 1933, however. Much of the gold that is in the US gold reserves today is gold that would have been paid out to the private sector had the US government not reneged in its promises to pay war bonds in gold. The 1934 Default on Gold-Based Liberty Bonds Every time there is a debate over the so-called 'debt ceiling,' various servants of the US regime like Jerome Powell or Janet Yellen claim that 'the United States has never defaulted.' This is a lie. Arguably, it was a default, in the broad sense, when Roosevelt’s regime refused to make good on its obligations to dollar holders under the gold standard. The US also defaulted in a formal and legal sense when it refused to pay its World War I Liberty Bonds in gold as promised. Specifically, in 1934, the United States defaulted on the fourth Liberty Bond. The contracts between debtor and creditor on these bonds was clear. The bonds were to be payable in gold. This presented a big problem for the US, which was facing big debts into the 1930s after the First World War. As described by John Chamberlain: By the time Franklin Roosevelt entered office in 1933, the interest payments alone were draining the treasury of gold; and because the treasury had only $4.2 billion in gold it was obvious there would be no way to pay the principal when it became due in 1938, not to mention meet expenses and other debt obligations. These other debt obligations were substantial. Ever since the 1890s the Treasury had been gold short and had financed this deficit by making new bond issues to attract gold for paying the interest of previous issues. The result was that by 1933 the total debt was $22 billion and the amount of gold needed to pay even the interest on it was soon going to be insufficient. So how did the US government deal with this? Chamberlain notes 'Roosevelt decided to default on the whole of the domestically-held debt by refusing to redeem in gold to Americans.' In other words, thanks to its profligate deficit spending, the US government was running out of gold by the early 1930s. So, the regime defaulted on the gold bonds. The gold that would have passed into private hands was hoarded by the federal government and declared off limits to the public. Much of that gold remains in the US gold reserves today. Defaulting on International Gold Obligations Not all of the US Treasury’s gold is stolen from ordinary Americans. Some is stolen from foreign governments. Another illustration of the dishonesty of the 'we never defaulted' narrative is the fact that the US government defaulted in 1971 on its obligations to foreign government under the Bretton Woods system. That is, rather than pay what was owed to foreign governments, the US government once again decided to steal this gold and simply said 'tough luck' to everyone with a legal claim to the gold. Or, as Treasury Secretary John Connally said at the time, the dollar 'is our currency, but it’s your problem.' US Gold Reserves: A Legacy of Theft and Lies Like most everything else the US government 'owns,' the gold in the US gold reserves is there due to many years of lies, gaslighting, and deception. The gold is there because the US regime defaulted on its debts and reneged on its promises to back dollars in gold. One could argue that the gold stolen from foreign governments was not as egregious in the same way as the gold confiscation of 1933 and 1934. That’s arguably true since the gold 'owned' by foreign central banks was largely founded on defaults and thefts resulting from the abolition of the gold standard in those countries years earlier. Even if this is the case, the fact that Bandit A (the United States government) robbed Bandit B (i.e., foreign governments) that hardly makes Bandit A a hero. If a true auditing team is ever allowed to actually examine the US regime’s gold, it will be examining the evidence of crimes from long ago. The auditors will be counting the gold stolen from our ancestors to enrich the state and its friends.

DOGE’s Dollars To The People – OpEd	President Trump is considering a plan to send 20 percent of the money saved by DOGE back to Americans in the form of household tax refund checks. As the people should know, a similar plan has already been performed in, of all places, California. California Dollars Then In 1987, Gov. George Deukmejian took $1.1 billion in surplus state money and sent rebate checks to taxpayers. The governor was pleased to 'protect this money for the taxpayers' and honor, 'the spending limit enacted by the voters through the initiative process,' a reference to the People’s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation, Proposition 13 on the 1978 ballot. At the time, soaring property taxes burdened working families and threatened to toss the elderly out of their homes. While this was going on, the state enjoyed a budget surplus of $2.5 billion that would rise to more than $7 billion, about half the state budget. Gov. Jerry Brown blasted Proposition 13 as 'a rip-off' but it passed in a landslide, with 65 percent of the vote. Gov. Brown then proclaimed himself a 'born-again tax cutter' and proclaimed support for the measure, which did not 'cut' taxes. The measure only limited the rate at which property taxes could be increased. Proposition 13 mandated no new state spending and required no new state government hires. Even so, politicians and bureaucrats blame the measure for fiscal problems that actually stem from waste and fraud. The People’s Initiative had been in place for more than a decade but did not prevent California from boasting a budget surplus in 1987. That year, Gov. Deukmejian refunded surplus money to the people. The checks were signed by State Controller Gray Davis, elected governor in 1998 and recalled in 2003, giving way to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. No payback to the people occurred under him or any governor since. In 2017, recurring Gov. Jerry Brown branded as 'freeloaders' those who opposed a transportation package that nearly doubled Californians’ gas taxes. So Brown, a three-time presidential candidate, wasn’t a 'born-again tax-cutter' after all. California Dollars Now The administration of Gavin Newsom, elected in 2018, deployed some of the highest income and sales taxes in all 50 states. In the style of Proposition 13, embattled Californians fought back with the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act, which gave voters the final approval on future taxes and fees imposed by state and local governments. The measure gathered nearly one million signatures and qualified for the Nov. 5, 2024 ballot, but Gov. Newsom and mentor Jerry Brown teamed up to get it taken off the ballot. Under Gov. Newsom, no money from any budget surplus would be coming back to taxpayers. That leaves government waste as a source for the funds—in the style of the DOGE plan. On this front, California abounds in possibilities. If University of California President Janet Napolitano can hide $175,000,000, as intrepid state auditor Elaine Howle discovered, there could be a lot more left to find. The UC’s vast DEI bureaucracy, which violates the voter-approved California Civil Rights Initiative, is another possible source of funds for the people. California’s vaunted bullet train is well into the billions, with no riders but a Sacramento headquarters and three regional offices. The unelected Coastal Commission rides roughshod over property rights and does nothing to mitigate wildfires. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) does little to mitigate pollution but punishes the workers by ramping up the cost of gasoline. Such counterproductive, unaccountable bureaucracies could form a source of reparations for the people. George Deukmejian, who passed away in 2018, showed that it is possible to return money to the taxpayers who provided the funds in the first place. If Gov. Newsom follows suit, that could slow the exodus of workers and businesses from California and perhaps prompt some to return.

US Shows Interest In Bolstering Ties With Central Asian States	(Eurasia.net) -- When it comes to Eurasia, the Trump administration has acted quickly to reverse the foreign policy of its predecessor, underscored by moves to foster a rapid thaw in relations with Russia. But there is one Biden-era legacy that the Trump State Department seems intent on preserving, an initiative to increase US influence in Central Asia known as the C5+1 format. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the US interest in building up the C5+1 framework during a February 21 talk with Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov of Uzbekistan. According to a State Department spokesperson, Rubio 'discussed continued cooperation, including through the C5+1 diplomatic platform, in support of a more peaceful and prosperous Central Asia.' The main driver of US interest in Central Asia is the region’s abundant natural resources, not only oil and natural gas, but also minerals and rare earths used in high-tech devices and for clean energy and defense purposes. A geographic consideration may also factor into the US policy calculus: Central Asian states sit on China’s western border, and an avowed aim of Trump’s second term is containing Chinese global economic influence. Rubio in his discussion with his Uzbek counterpart specifically mentioned that 'the United States looks forward to working with Uzbekistan to highlight mutually beneficial opportunities for investment in critical minerals and US civil nuclear energy technologies.' Saidov indicated that Uzbekistan was eager to engage with the United States, describing his conversation with Rubio as 'candid and productive.' In a statement posted on Telegram, he added that Uzbekistan would work to expand bilateral ties 'in all spheres without an exception,' focusing on 'building strong bridges between business communities, increasing trade volume in both directions [and] ensuring prosperous development.' Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are considered the lynchpin states within the C5+1 context. Then-secretary of state John Kerry initiated the C5+1 format in 2015. But the Biden administration significantly elevated the framework’s status by convening the first-ever presidential-level summit of C5+1 leaders in 2023. The following year, the Biden administration launched a related initiative, dubbed the B5+1 process, to specifically promote trade and investment. The Rubio-Saidov discussion indicated that the United States will remain committed to backing Uzbek efforts to gain entry to the World Trade Organization. Prior to Trump’s return to the White House, the two countries inked an agreement in December to expand mutual market access. US officials at that time hailed the Uzbek government’s 'significant progress' in opening the country’s economy. The February 21 talks also confirmed that Uzbekistan will work with the United States on the repatriation of illegal Uzbek migrants. Rubio thanked Saidov for Uzbekistan’s 'cooperation in curbing illegal migration.' Seven Uzbek deportees arrived in Tashkent on February 24, Uzbek media reported. The US has reportedly shipped additional Uzbek deportees to Panama and Costa Rica. Meanwhile, Uzbekistan is taking the lead on regional efforts to engage the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Tashkent hopes that by pulling Afghanistan into a closer trade orbit with Central Asia, Uzbek officials and their counterparts from other regional states can increase their negotiating leverage with the Taliban on matters of regional concern, in particular Afghanistan’s construction of the Qosh Tepa canal, a project that could upset Central Asia’s already delicate water resources balance. A high-level Taliban delegation held trade talks in Tashkent on February 22 resulting in agreements covering railroad improvements, the creation of a free trade zone on the Uzbek-Afghan frontier, de-regulation of agricultural exports, mining and oil & gas development and a power transmission line project.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JjJmys_ymek1	2025-02-26T16:50:14-08:00	
The Start Of A US Government Exit From Supporting Coronavirus Sho...	Even people who took one, two, or three experimental coronavirus 'vaccine' shots during the height of the coronavirus scare are saying 'nope' to taking any more 'boosters.' Yet, behind the scenes, the United States government has kept funding companies in the pharmaceutical industry to continue developing new iterations of the unpopular 'vaccines.' This situation may be changing. A new action by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. puts a temporary halt to US support for the development of a pill form of coronavirus 'vaccine.' This could be the start of an exit of the US altogether from aiding coronavirus 'vaccine' development and, possibly, from aiding other drug development as well. Emma Colton provided in a Tuesday Fox News article details regarding how Kennedy 'issued a 90-day stop-work order on Friday related to the HHS contract with American biotech company Vaxart Inc., which is working to develop a new COVID-19 vaccine that can be taken orally.' 'Kennedy and other health officials,' further wrote Colton, are 'set to examine the study’s initial findings over the next 90 days before deciding on next steps.' This pause, Colton notes, prevents Vaxart from invoicing of the US government for 230 million dollars for clinical trials. The US government has been a key participant in the experimental coronavirus shots push. President Donald Trump helped ramp it up with the creation of Operation Warp Speed to develop coronavirus shots and then inject them quickly into as many people as possible. President Joe Biden and politicians on the state and local level also sought to increase 'demand' for the shots by imposing mandates that people take them in order to keep their jobs, enter stores and other locations, or otherwise proceed with their ordinary activities. Kennedy’s initiation of a pause in Vaxart support, as well as his previous action indicating the US government will move from promoting that people take vaccines to encouraging people to exercise informed consent in regard to vaccines, suggest a major shift in US policy is underway. Since Friday, the price of Vaxart stock has been down about 30 percent. While this share price drop likely would have worried prior Health and Human Services secretaries who saw themselves as partners with the pharmaceutical industry, Kennedy seems to have other motivations that involve instead placing emphasis on priorities including advancing the health of Americans and ensuring his department has independence from special interests — including pharmaceutical companies.

Anthropology For Kids And Visual Assembly Are Reimagining Work, E...	These interactive books and events encourage fresh perspectives on long-standing social systems. in adapting to societal change, and mental health issues that can lead to suicide and mass shootings. The challenges associated with inflexible thinking have become more evident post-pandemic. 'While rates of depression, anxiety, and mental health conditions have increased in the general population during this time of rapid change, individuals with greater inflexible thinking have had the most difficulty adapting to our continuously changing environment,' explains Psychiatry Online. No one is insusceptible to cognitive inflexibility. The Society for Personality and Social Psychology theorizes that 'once you've become accustomed to a particular simplification of reality, you will have trouble switching to a new one even when it would be more useful to do so. Switching is hard because it takes effort to reconfigure how to think about a problem.' The works of artist and writer Nika Dubrovsky encourage flexible thinking, particularly in how we perceive firmly established social structures. Her project Anthropology for Kids hopes to inspire young people to think outside the box on subjects like work, jobs, education, food, money, beauty, and art. The importance of this work is underscored by evidence suggesting that efforts to increase cognitive flexibility early in life may have lifelong benefits. Anthropology for Kids's books are inspired by what the website refers to as the 'democratic Soviet children's literature.' This genre, invented in the 1920s, served 'as a means to communicate with the general population in a language that everybody could share.' Anthropology for Kids's books contain spaces for readers to fill with drawings and writings. This is intended to provoke thought on 'questions that every human needs to have an opinion on,' Dubrovsky says. In 1990, Dubrovsky immigrated to the U.S. from Saint Petersburg, Russia. As a migrant in New York and the mother of a young boy, she 'spent a lot of time trying to figure out how the education system works in the U.S. and what education is [in the first place],' she explains. Dubrovsky's late husband, the anthropologist and author David Graeber, helped expand her knowledge of anthropology, which she saw as 'the best possible education for kids, because that's the way to [stop] reproducing all of our patriarchal, Eurocentric ideas about things like family, money, and property.' The spirit of open-ended anthropological inquiry meshed well with Dubrovsky's background in contemporary art, which Walker Art Center's website describes as art that 'reflects the complex issues that shape our diverse, global, and rapidly changing world.' The site adds that 'many contemporary artists explore personal or cultural identity, offer critiques of social and institutional structures, or even attempt to redefine art itself. In the process, they often raise difficult or thought-provoking questions without providing easy answers.' In the early 2000s, Dubrovsky began fusing art with anthropology by creating interactive workbooks for her young son. This evolved into Anthropology for Kids, which also holds workshops where participants are encouraged to work with the project's books as a group. In 2024, MIT Press published Cities Made Differently, the first English-language Anthropology for Kids book. This is the first in a three-book series that also aims to explore new perspectives on museums and artists. An outgrowth of Anthropology for Kids called Visual Assembly emerged during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the U.S. in 2020. The website for the Museum of Care, which honors the legacy of Dubrovsky's late husband, describes Visual Assembly as 'a democratic form of creative collaboration used to reimagine new ways to run and organize our social systems.' While it uses artistic tools, it 'is not only an art project. Mainly it is about a public debate on how to rearrange' social institutions and services like education and health care. A Visual Assembly event in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in February 2025 typifies these experiences: A multigenerational, culturally diverse group of approximately 20 participants sat at a table covered with a map of an imaginary city. Attendees collectively imagined and designed the city they would like to inhabit. Visual Assembly events have been held in locales like Spain, Iceland, Germany, Cuba, New York, and London. 'It's interesting how people from very different backgrounds have similar reactions to the [same] questions,' Dubrovsky notes. 'For example, when people imagine dystopian spaces, [their descriptions] are always poetic, but [when Visual Assembly participants] imagine utopian spaces, they're very practical. They immediately start to think, 'How would we produce our food? Where would we deal with our trash?'' Dubrovsky feels that these commonalities among event participants indicate that people of different cultures and ideologies can build grassroots social spaces together. 'If we just started to provide people with the spaces to think together and share their ideas about how they can do that, maybe [we would discover] that many more people than we think agree with each other. All humans need the same things, like kindergartens, hospitals, and housing. It's interesting to see [similarities in] ideas of what an ideal society [would look like when] we refrain from using [left-versus-right] language and start talking to people just as people. That's what children's literature does, and that's what anthropology has always done because it's trying to figure out the differences between cultures and groups of people. But also it's the belief that everyone is a human being, so we're all fundamentally very similar to each other.'

Apple Strikes Deal With Indonesia, Secures Future Market Access F...	By Tria Dianti A new agreement between Apple Inc. and Indonesia will allow the tech giant to sell the iPhone16 in the country, a senior government official said, resolving a dispute over investment requirements that led Jakarta to ban the model. The deal commits Apple to hundreds of millions of dollars in new investments, said Indonesian Minister of Industry Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita. Those include the establishment of a research and development center, integration of Indonesian suppliers into its global manufacturing network, and expansion of education and technology programs. The agreement allows Apple to regain compliance with Indonesia’s Domestic Component Level (TKDN) certification, a rule mandating that foreign tech companies invest in the country in exchange for market access. 'The talks were challenging until the very last 15 minutes,' Agus told reporters in Jakarta on Wednesday. 'But the memorandum of understanding has now been signed electronically on a provisional basis.' For Apple, the agreement represents a win in Southeast Asia’s largest country, where smartphone penetration is rapidly increasing. The iPhone 16 is expected to hit Indonesian stores soon after Apple secures the necessary certification and distribution permits from the government. 'Sales could begin as early as next month,' Agus said, though he declined to provide a specific date. The 2017 regulation requires that 40% of smartphones sold in Indonesia use domestically sourced components. The policy is part of Indonesia’s push to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports. The dispute escalated in late 2024, when Apple failed to meet its previous investment commitments under the regulation, prompting Indonesian regulators to block sales of the iPhone 16. Unlike rivals such as Samsung and Oppo, which have built local assembly plants, Apple had chosen to fulfill its obligations through innovation investments, a strategy that fell short of government expectations. With iPhone sales halted, Apple entered negotiations with the Ministry of Industry, culminating in this agreement, which the government said was a fresh investment cycle rather than a continuation of past obligations. Under the new deal, Apple has pledged U.S. $160 million in hard cash investments and will deepen its supply-chain presence in Indonesia, the industry ministry said in a statement. The company will bring in Luxshare, a key supplier in its global supply network, to invest $150 million in a new manufacturing facility in Batam, an industrial hub near Singapore. The plant will produce AirTag accessories, with Indonesia set to become the supplier for 65% of the global AirTag market. An AirTag is a tracking device that when attached to a user’s belongings, such as keys, helps the user find the item. Apple has also agreed to source AirTag batteries from Indonesian manufacturers, further embedding local suppliers into its ecosystem, the industry ministry said. Additionally, Apple is expanding production in Bandung, where local company Long Harmony will manufacture mesh fabric for AirPods Max, making it an official part of the company’s global supply network. These investments represent a change in Apple’s approach to meeting Indonesia’s local content requirements, moving beyond software and education programs to deeper supply chain involvement. One of the most significant commitments in the agreement is Apple’s decision to establish a research and development center in Indonesia, focused on software innovation, the ministry said. It will be Apple’s first research and development center in Asia and only the second outside the United States, after Brazil. The facility will partner with 15 leading Indonesian universities, including Bandung Institute of Technology and University of Indonesia, and will also be part of the Indonesia Chip Design Collaborative Center (ICDEC), an initiative aimed at strengthening Indonesia’s presence in the semiconductor and chip design industry, it said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5Jg8wE549_9fD	2025-02-26T16:29:42-08:00	
Bosnia’s Defiant Serb Leader Dodik Sentenced To One Year In Priso...	By Laurent Geslin (EurActiv) -- Bosnia's Serb political leader Milorad Dodik was sentenced to one year in prison and banned from holding public office by a Bosnian court on Wednesday. In defiant remarks to supporters, Dodik responded by vowing to ignore the rulings of the judiciary in Sarajevo – and urging them to do the same. Rarely has Bosnia and Herzegovina’s unity appeared so fragile, nearly 30 years after the signing of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement. Dodik, president of Republika Srpska (RS), the Serb entity in the deeply divided country, was ordered to serve one year in prison and banned from public office for six years by a Sarajevo court for defying the decisions of the High Representative, the international official responsible for overseeing the country’s post-war peace agreement. 'They say I am guilty. There is no reason to worry. I have learned to deal with tougher situations. What matters is that you are here,' Dodik told his supporters, who had gathered outside the National Assembly building in Banja Luka, the largest city in Republika Srpska. He had refused to travel to Sarajevo for the verdict, having previously stated that he would reject the court’s ruling 'whatever it may be'. Dobik can lodge an appeal against the verdict, although it remains unclear if he will. Republika Srpska defiance In the summer of 2023, Republika Srpska's National Assembly passed laws refusing to recognise the High Representative’s decisions, barring their publication in the Official Gazette, and preventing their enforcement within the entity. In response, the High Representative introduced amendments to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s criminal code, making non-compliance with his rulings a criminal offence. Ahead of the verdict, thousands of people gathered in Banja Luka, waving banners in support of Republika Srpska and its president: 'Today Dodik, tomorrow all of us', 'Conviction of the president, attack on Republika Srpska', and 'Srpska is our pride, the president is our protector'. On Tuesday, Republika Srpska's National Assembly launched a two-day emergency session in which Serb representatives were instructed to block decision-making in Bosnia and Herzegovina state institutions. Lawmakers are also expected to vote today on resolutions rejecting the verdict and refusing to recognise the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the country’s highest judicial authority. Rising regional tensions A long-time ally of the Kremlin, Dodik has ruled Republika Srpska unchallenged since the mid-2000s and has regularly threatened to push for the Serb entity’s secession. His hardline stance has always been backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who recently denounced what he called 'political attacks' against the RS leader. 'We need stability in the Balkans. This is precisely what President Dodik has ensured over the years: a stable and prosperous Republika Srpska,' Orbán declared on X just over a week ago. According to Bosnian media reports, members of Hungary’s special police forces have arrived in the Serb entity in recent days. Meanwhile, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has convened a National Security Council meeting in response to the verdict and is expected to travel to Banja Luka later today. Vučić, who is facing growing protests in Serbia, appears keen to seize the moment and use pan-Serb ethnic solidarity as a political lifeline to deflect from intense domestic pressure. A major anti-corruption demonstration is planned for Saturday in Niš, while a general strike has been called for next week.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JoWUK23tz2V7	2025-02-26T16:26:04-08:00	
RFE/RL Obtains Copy Of US-Ukraine Minerals Deal	By Ray Furlong and RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service (RFE/RL) -- Ukraine has agreed a deal to allow the United States access to its natural resources, a major agreement that comes amid rapid diplomatic efforts to end Russia’s three-year full-scale war against Kyiv. The deal, a copy of which was obtained by RFE/RL, does not address key questions and leaves most details to be provided by a future agreement. It does not contain specific U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a key demand by Kyiv. The agreement also does not specify whether the United States would continue to supply military equipment and ammunition to Ukraine. Key Points No Security Guarantees: The deal supports Ukraine’s pursuit of security assurances but doesn’t provide them Resource Development: Ukraine and the U.S. will jointly develop Ukraine's natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas Reconstruction Fund: A joint fund will receive 50% of Ukraine’s state-owned resource revenues Reinvestment: Fund profits will be reinvested 'at least annually' for Ukraine’s economic recovery Pending Details: Governance and ownership specifics will be negotiated later The text of the deal begins by noting that Washington 'has provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion.' But it makes no mention of Washington’s demand for a right to $500 billion in potential revenue from accessing Ukraine’s mineral wealth that was seen in an earlier draft of the deal. This was a point that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly said was unacceptable. No Security Guarantees for Ukraine The agreement does not include firm U.S. security pledges. But it does say that the United States 'supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees.' It also says that Washington 'will maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.' Beyond these general statements, the main body of the agreement concerns the establishment of a jointly owned Reconstruction Investment Fund. Ukraine has agreed to put 50 percent of future revenues from its government-owned natural resources into the fund. It says this relates to mineral wealth, oil, and gas, as well as related revenues from liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and ports. It explicitly states that 'such future sources of revenues do not include the current sources of revenues which are already part of the general budget revenues of Ukraine.' Money from the fund will be reinvested in Ukraine 'at least annually.' Unanswered Questions There are many questions which have not been answered. The agreement states these will be addressed in a future agreement, which working groups will start negotiating 'without delay.' Among these key points is how the joint ownership of the fund will break down, suggesting it may not be a simple 50-50. Details of the fund’s 'governance and operation' are also still to be resolved. The deal states that neither party can 'sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of' any part of the fund without agreement from the other party. In other words, neither side can unilaterally withdraw. The agreement says it is subject to approval by Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, but does not mention Congressional sign off. Ukrainian lawmaker Bohdan Kytsak, from Zelenskyy’s ruling Servant of the People party, told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service that the deal presented potential benefits for the economy. 'This requires a huge number of specialists, scientific research, and the emergence of new technologies,' he said, adding that U.S. investment could create a 'new economy.' A former economic adviser to Zelenskyy, Oleh Ustenko, told RFE/RL that 'symbolism plays a larger role here than financial and economic issues.' For U.S. President Donald Trump this may represent a political win. He has pushed hard for the deal and now he has got it. For Zelenskyy, a scrap awaits over the details. For now, the deal could ease a bitter and public rift that saw Trump brand him a 'dictator.' Ray Furlong is a Senior International Correspondent for RFE/RL. He has reported for RFE/RL from the Balkans, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and elsewhere since joining the company in 2014. He previously worked for 17 years for the BBC as a foreign correspondent in Prague and Berlin, and as a roving international reporter across Europe and the former Soviet Union.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JoHs3l1_N3P3	2025-02-26T16:24:30-08:00	
US, Ukraine To Sign Minerals Deal, But Security Issues Unsettled	By Ken Bredemeier President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will sign a deal giving the United States substantial rights to Kyiv’s lucrative rare earth minerals and to compensate Washington for weapons sent to Ukraine to fight Russia’s three-year war of aggression. Trump, at the first Cabinet meeting of his new presidential term, said that Zelenskyy will be at the White House on Friday to sign the pact and for discussions about the state of the war. Trump said the deal 'brings us great wealth,' but said his first goal is to end the war, which has killed or wounded several hundred thousand Russian and Ukrainian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians. 'My No. 2 thing is to get paid back,' Trump said of the more than $100 billion in munitions Washington has shipped to Kyiv to support its fighters. 'Without our equipment, that [war] would have been over very quickly,' with Russia overrunning Ukraine. As it is, Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory and has vowed to not give any of it back in a would-be peace settlement. Trump said he expects to eventually reach a deal with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the fighting. Trump initiated talks with Putin about ending the conflict but the first discussions last week between the top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, excluded Ukrainian and European officials. 'Because I got elected, this war is going to come to an end,' Trump declared. He said Putin 'had no intention of settling this. We’re going to have a deal.' But he said Ukraine 'could forget about' joining NATO, the West’s main military alliance, as part of a peace settlement. In Kyiv, Zelenskyy said at a news conference that the framework for the rare earth mineral deal was complete, but that U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine that the Kyiv government views as vital have yet to be settled. Trump has long expressed skepticism about continued U.S. military support for Ukraine. Last year, he refused to say he wants Ukraine to win the war. Trump has called Zelenskyy a dictator, without blaming Putin for the invasion. The U.S. leader has said he is particularly peeved that his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, agreed to the Ukraine military assistance without any provision that Ukraine would pay back the cost. Biden led the coalition of Western allies in providing the military aid as a way to fight Russian aggression without sending their own troops to fight alongside Ukrainian forces. Zelenskyy says the U.S. military aid was a grant and not a loan that needed to be repaid but now has agreed to the deal for the rare earth minerals needed for manufacturing technology products. Zelenskyy said he expects to have wide-ranging substantive discussions with Trump. 'I want to coordinate with the U.S.,' Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian leader said he wants to know whether the U.S. plans to halt military aid and, if so, whether Ukraine would be able to purchase weapons directly from the U.S. He also wants to know whether Ukraine can use frozen Russian assets for weapons investments and whether Washington plans to lift its economic sanctions on Russian entities and high-level associates and friends of Putin. Elements of the deal Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told the country’s public television channel that the agreement sets out the terms and conditions of an investment fund for the rebuilding of Ukraine. Under terms of the deal, the plan would include investing 50% of proceeds from Ukraine’s minerals, oil and gas to create a 'stable and economically prosperous Ukraine' if the war is ended, and half to a U.S.-controlled fund. The New York Times reported the economic agreement includes a line that says the U.S. 'supports Ukraine’s effort to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace,' but does not spell out details on what that might entail. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting with Trump on Wednesday in Washington to spell out a European initiative for a 30,000-person peacekeeping force to enforce a Russian ceasefire with Ukraine if such a truce can be reached, although no peace talks have been scheduled. European leaders have said a peacekeeping force would require an American 'backstop' of military assistance, such as American satellite surveillance, air defense or air force support. Trump has not committed the U.S. to such a plan but on Wednesday called the peacekeeping force 'a good thing.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JoQJaVzJofTn	2025-02-26T16:22:08-08:00	
Romania Indicts Right-Wing Presidential Hopeful Georgescu	By Marian Chiriac Romanian prosecutors on Wednesday indicted right-wing presidential candidate Calin Georgescu on six charges, including incitement to undermine the constitutional order, spreading false information, and founding an anti-Semitic organisation. Georgescu, a populist politician known for his NATO-sceptic and pro-Russian views, faces ten to 20 years in prison if convicted, and may be barred from May’s re-run presidential election. He was leading in the first round of the initial election last November before it was annulled by the Constitutional Court. Police initially took Georgescu for questioning after stopping him in traffic in Bucharest on Tuesday. 'Calin Georgescu was going to file his new candidacy for the presidency …. The system stopped him in traffic and he was pulled over for questioning at the Prosecutor General’s Office! Where is democracy, where are the partners who must defend democracy?' Georgescu’s communications team posted on Facebook. Dozens of people, including far-right politicians in parliament, protested in front of the General Prosecutor’s Office against what they described as his 'abusive detention' and 'abuse by the totalitarian state'. Earlier, police and prosecutors started searches in 47 sites in an investigation related to a group of 27 people for allegedly 'acting against Romania’s constitutional order', and the 'creation of an organisation which spreads fascist, racist and xenophobic messages'. Around noon on Wednesday, prosecutors announced the confiscation of some 1 million euros and various weapons from people who were searched. Although prosecutors did not name Georgescu or his aides in their statement, shortly after news of the searches broke, Georgescu claimed the raids were aimed at blocking his new presidential bid. Georgescu won the first round of the presidential elections in November, signalling that EU-member Romania was joining the region’s growing trend toward far-right populism. His unexpected success led the Constitutional Court in December to order a re-run of the vote, citing alleged manipulation of public opinion by a 'foreign state', likely referring to Russia. Georgescu, known for his advocacy of sovereignty and traditional values, has gained support among those disillusioned with the current political landscape. The latest polls say he leads in voting intentions. Romania is to re-run the election on May 4, with a potential run-off scheduled for two weeks later. His cause has also received unexpected support from the Trump administration in the US. US Vice-President JD Vance, speaking at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month, accused EU leaders of engaging in 'rampant censorship' and 'cancelling elections, as recently occurred in Romania'. Elon Musk amplified these claims on his social media platform, X, where he criticised the annulment of the elections and called the head of Romania’s Constitutional Court a 'tyrant'. Musk also shared content from Georgescu supporters and far-right groups.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5Jv_opjWxq7zn	2025-02-26T16:14:34-08:00	
The Western Media’s Israel-Palestine Double Standard – OpEd	America and Israel’s manipulation of the violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, exaggerating crimes against Israelis or Jews and ignoring those that target Palestinians and Muslims, should anger the entire world, especially the people of the Middle East. Unfortunately, this disparity does not get much attention in either the US or Israel. But the gap between how the two are reported is immorally immense. Last Thursday, explosions destroyed three empty civilian buses in separate car parks in Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. Israeli police immediately called it a terrorist attack. Even though no one was hurt, the nonlethal attacks dominated media reports in America and Israel. Meanwhile, barely reported by any American mainstream media is the daily carnage in Gaza. Israel’s violence in the Strip takes place 24 hours a day, every day, meaning it does not fit the journalistic definition of 'news' — that of being 'new.' Under that cloud is another wave of ongoing violence being carried out by the Israeli security services and armed Jewish settlers against West Bank Palestinians. Little is being reported. It is almost like nothing is taking place. But it is happening. Daily. The day before the attacks on the three empty buses, the Palestinian Wafa news agency reported that Israeli forces had killed at least three Palestinians in an attack on a house in the Far’a refugee camp. The mainstream American media ignored this. Had the victims been Israeli, the reporting would likely have been hysterical. B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights watchdog staffed by Jews and Arabs, continues to persevere despite an ongoing campaign of harassment, beatings and bullying by Israeli security forces. It reports on violence against Palestinians in the West Bank and in Israel itself, but its findings are often ignored. This month, for example, B’Tselem published a report into the events of Dec. 19, 2024. At about 10 a.m. that day, two vehicles with Palestinian license plates drove into the market street, a central thoroughfare in Balata Refugee Camp in Nablus. Local security signaled for the unknown buses to stop and that is when Israeli soldiers emerged from the vehicles and began firing indiscriminately, wounding six people and killing two. Halimah Abu Leil, 80, who was shopping for vegetables in the market, was shot and killed. The Israeli attack lasted more than two hours. Soldiers blocked all attempts to take the injured Palestinians to hospital for treatment. The Israelis entered a nearby home, expelled the family that lived there and used it as a command center. They used one of the family’s daughters, Lara Sawalmeh, as a human shield, stationing her at the front door as they shot at residents from the home’s windows. A neighbor, Qusai Al-Saruji, peeked out of the door of his balcony to check if the raid was over so that he could go to work. He was shot dead, the B’Tselem investigators reported. Even with all that detail confirmed by a highly respected agency, nothing was reported by the Western news reporters who work out of Jerusalem under Israeli government supervision. In another incident last year, Israeli forces went on a campaign of destruction in Tulkarem refugee camp. B’Tselem reported that special forces personnel arrived at the camp at about 12.30 p.m. on Sept. 10 in civilian vehicles with Palestinian license plates. They were later joined by additional military, border police and Shin Bet forces, who brought bulldozers. The purpose? To dig up the streets, smash Palestinian-owned cars parked on the side of the road and block the entrances to homes. The destruction was so widespread it turned much of the area into rubble. As residents returned to their homes on hearing about the raid, the Israeli forces shot at them. Two young Palestinians were killed. They were Ahmad Majdubah, 25, who was trying to close the gate of his family’s car wash to go home, and Hibat Allah ‘Obeid, 21, who stepped out of her house with her mother to see what was happening. Also, in the summer of 2024, Israeli forces repeatedly entered Hebron and injured dozens of Palestinians. B’Tselem volunteers took testimony from 25 of the victims who were abused by Israeli soldiers between May and August last year. They describe acts of violence, humiliation and abuse by Israeli soldiers against men, women, teenagers and children. The victims gave harrowing accounts of physical and psychological abuse, including beatings, whippings, cigarettes being put out on their bodies, blows to their genitals, injections of an unidentified substance, prolonged binding and blindfolding, threats, insults and more. Soldiers appeared to select the victims arbitrarily as they went about their daily lives. In most cases, they were taken away to military facilities, where the worst of the abuse occurred. None of the victims were suspected of or prosecuted for any offense. They were mostly released immediately after being assaulted, with many requiring medical treatment. Only two victims were arrested and both were released without charge within days. Nearly every Palestinian city is being targeted by Israeli forces and Palestinians are being killed every week. But where are the media reports? These incidents are ignored. Why? Because terrorism against Palestinians is not considered news by the mainstream Western news media and many Western reporters are forced to work under the confines of Israeli government censorship. They lack the courage to speak out against the inhumanity occurring right before their eyes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdWKy0J1-f5JvZTyabhfd6j	2025-02-26T16:11:11-08:00	
Syria After Assad: Addressing Chemical Weapons And Accountability...	By Shravishtha Ajaykumar Despite a Sunni majority in Syria, the Assad regime has managed to maintain its dominance through a combination of autocratic and kleptocratic rule, using patronage to secure loyalty. On 8 December 2024, following a 10-day uprising, Bashar al-Assad, son of Hafez al-Assad, was brought down along with the entire Assad Regime. The Syrian Civil War has highlighted the human tragedy and the failure of many international conventions aimed at preventing the use of banned weapons, including chemical warfare. Despite global prohibitions and condemnation, several Syrian actors have been known to deploy these weapons against protestors and civilians on multiple occasions. With the formation of a new Syrian government, the issue of chemical weapons has assumed a renewed urgency in making Syria a state free of such weapons. Bashar al-Assad's regime and chemical warfare Chemical warfare has seen use across multiple incidents of warfare throughout history. During World War I, several countries employed chlorine and mustard gases, resulting in at least 1.3 million people being affected and the death of over 90,000 people. The tragedies of the War led to many negotiations around the use and disuse of chemical weapons, leading to the formation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in 1993, officiating an agreement aimed at the cessation of the use of chemical weapons, and the elimination of their resurfacing. Nevertheless, between 1993 and 2020, there have been over 300 cases of chemical weapons use. One such prominent case was the 2017 assassination of Kim Jong Nam, allegedly ordered by his cousin and North Korean Leader, Kim Jong Un, and the 2018 assassination of Sergei Skripal, allegedly by the Russian State. Key incidents of chemical weapon use The Syrian civil war also sought to disillusion the world on the mitigation of such atrocities. As the Syrian opposition started gaining ground, the Assad regime threatened and terrified of losing power, resorted to using chemical weapons to preserve its authority and control the dissidents. In particular, sarin, chlorine, and mustard gas were used indiscriminately against military and civilian infrastructures. There have been 13 isolated attacks in Syria attributed to different actors from 2013 to 2020. Table 1: Alleged Cases of Chemical Weapon Use in Syria 2013-2020 DateAlleged PerpetratorInjured/Affected3/23/2019Unknown2111/24/2018Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (suspected)1011/24/2018Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (suspected)1111/24/2018Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (suspected)1111/11/2016Free Syrian Army2411/3/2016Ansar al-Din Front, Authenticity and Development Front, Nur-al-Din al-Zinki Movement2910/30/2016Ahrar al-Sham, Al-Nusrah Front, Free Syrian Army358/16/2016Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)58/2/2016Nur-al-Din al-Zinki Movement204/7/2016Ahrar al-Sham, Free Syrian Army, Jaysh al-Islam (Syria)298/21/2015Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)244/11/2014Al-Nusrah Front1013/19/2013Unknown130Source: Global Terrorism Database Three cases of chemical weapons in civilian areas have left a global impact. The first major chemical weapons attack in the Syrian Civil War took place during the Ghouta attack in 2013. Rockets armed with sarin gas were shot from the early morning hours into rebel-controlled sectors of Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, resulting in the death of 1500 people. The Ghouta attack shocked the international community, as it represented a clear violation of the CWC and raised alarms about the regime’s willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. Although Assad’s regime denied responsibility, alleging that insurgents were responsible for the attack, growing evidence from the United Nations (UN) investigators suggested that Assad’s forces perpetrated the crime. In 2017, sarin was also found in Khan Shaykhun, where another rebel stronghold was bombed, killing over 80 people, including children. Responding to that attack, the US conducted missile strikes, launching 59 tomahawk missiles on the assumed origin of the chemical attack, the Shayrat Airbase. Notwithstanding the US actions and the international community’s condemnation, the resolution was not adopted by the UN Security Council due to Russia’s use of Veto, where the Assad regime appeared unaffected, continuing its use of chemical weapons in later incidents. In 2018, a chlorine gas assault in the city of Douma, Eastern Ghouta district, killed 42 individuals in a civilian area in an attempt to target a rebel base. The Syrian regime had been trying to achieve a recapture of the region, and the chemical attack took place as a prelude to a concerted effort to annex the territory. The attack was deployed amid an evacuation agreement, impacting civilians who were attempting to leave an area under attack. The international community, including the United States (US), France, and the United Kingdom (UK), condemned the attack, accusing the Syrian government of using chemical weapons. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) dispatched a fact-finding mission (FFM) to examine the incident. Following that rebuke, the US, UK, and France conducted airstrikes against facilities that they alleged were associated with the Syrian chemical weapons effort. Despite the retaliatory strikes, the Assad regime, while denying liability for the attack, instead attributed it to the rebels, and the airstrikes again failed to interrupt the regime's activities. The end of the Assad regime, accountability, and enforcement Despite such numerous reports, investigations, and condemnations, including those by the UN and OPCW, Assad's government faced little consequence for its actions. Efforts to hold the Assad regime accountable was met with significant challenges, including the consistent opposing positions from allied nations such as Russia, which repeatedly vetoed proposed actions in the United Nations Security Council. While the regime's fall may be considered a geopolitical win, it does not negate the need to hold defence forces accountable for war crimes that particularly used chemical weapons against civilians. The non-enforcement of the CWC and the resistance to international retaliation have revealed the flaws in the fundamentals of the CWC and other international conventions. The voluntary nature and lack of enforcement rules in such frameworks make them little more than symbolic gestures, failing to translate into meaningful action or real accountability. The Syrian case conveys that international legal frameworks should be established and actively enforced through attribution and accountability globally, and domestically. Despite the end of the Assad Regime, Syria still contains stockpiles of chemical weapons and now must clear them to ensure such weapon use is not seen in the future. The CWC must be strengthened, and its enforcement must be redefined to prevent future tragedies. First, increasing the attribution of chemical attacks is essential. Investigative bodies like the OPCW must be better equipped to gather irrefutable evidence and ensure that perpetrators are identified; sub-committees like the FFM and JIM (Joint investigative mechanisms) must perform regular check-ins, especially in the trade and access of materials that help formulate chemical weapons and ensure accountability in not just the case of use, but also in the supply chains routed to those using chemical weapons. In addition to the control and monitoring of chemicals, the removal and control of the infrastructure for manufacturing chemical weapons is equally important. Those suspected of resuming or resurrecting their production must be under the international community’s immediate radar while invoking sanctions. Countries that are behind procurers of iodine strokes, much like in the situation of Syria with Iran and Russia, should face diplomatic, financial, and judicial repercussions. Strengthening the CWC’s attribution, accountability, and international cooperation mechanisms are vital in holding perpetrators accountable and deterring future violations. As Syria recovers from the Assad regime, the international community must prioritise the destruction of its remaining chemical weapons stockpiles. Only through robust monitoring, stricter controls on chemical precursors, and a unified global response can we prevent further atrocities and guarantee that chemical weapons will never again be used as a tool of war.

Rare Earth Minerals Front And Center In The Push For Peace In Ukr...	By Steve Gutterman (RFE/RL) -- A few weeks ago, rare earth elements, critical minerals, and other natural resources seemed like just one more factor in efforts to end Russia's war on Ukraine. Now they are front and center, a dominant focus of U.S. talks with Kyiv and a prominent vein of the intensifying diplomacy that also involves Moscow, the European Union, and others as Russia's full-scale invasion enters its fourth year. There were strong indications on February 25 that an agreement on a framework deal had been reached and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be in Washington later this week to sign it. The deal would cover the joint development of Ukraine’s critical minerals and other natural resources, such as oil and gas, according to multiple news reports quoting unidentified sources in the Ukrainian government. The reports said the agreement was a framework for a broad economic deal that would include the exploitation of rare earth minerals. It was not immediately clear whether the agreement carries any specific U.S. security guarantees or if Washington has committed to sending additional military aid, Reuters reported. But one Ukrainian government official quoted by the Associated Press said that Kyiv hopes that signing the agreement will ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs. There was no formal confirmation from the U.S. side, but President Donald Trump said Zelenskyy wants to come to Washington to sign the deal. 'I hear that. I hear that he's coming on Friday,' Trump told reporters at the White House, adding that Zelenskyy 'would like to sign it together with me' and the deal on had been 'pretty much negotiated.' Bloomberg reported earlier that Ukraine’s cabinet is expected to recommend on February 26 that the deal be signed, and AFP quoted a senior Ukrainian official as saying the government was 'working on the details' and 'considering a visit to Washington for Friday to sign the agreement.' Reuters cited two sources it did not identify as saying Zelenskyy plans to travel to Washington on February 28 to meet with Trump. The Financial Times cited Ukrainian officials as saying Kyiv is now ready to sign the agreement after the United States 'dropped demands for a right to $500 billion in potential revenue from exploiting the resources.' It said the draft deal did not include specific U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s assault, which had been one of Kyiv’s complaints about previous versions. The reports of agreement on the terms came less than a month after Trump said on February 3 that his administration was 'looking to a do a deal with Ukraine to secure what we're giving them with their rare earth and other things.' His remarks sketched the bare outlines of a trade-off: U.S. aid, including the tens of billions of dollars in mostly military support that Washington has already provided, in exchange for access to critical minerals. Since then, wrangling over a potential deal played into discussions at the February 14-16 Munich Security Conference and a starkly public exchange of criticism between Trump and Zelenskyy, who said he had rejected an initial U.S. proposal due in part to a lack of concrete security guarantees. Trump Expecting Zelenskyy To Sign Mineral Deal The White House redoubled its efforts to reach a deal with Kyiv in the wake of those developments, and on February 24 Trump said he expects Zelenskyy to come to Washington to sign an agreement sometime in the next two weeks. Earlier that day, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said in a post on X that talks on the deal were in their 'final stages' and 'nearly all key details [have been] finalized.' Hours later, Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly added a new element to the transatlantic discussions about critical minerals in what looked like a bid to complicate the path toward a U.S.-Ukraine agreement. He chaired a high-level government meeting on rare earth metals and offered the United States a chance at joint exploration of Russia's own deposits, adding: 'We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasize, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine.' Putin spoke after Trump hailed the possibilities for close U.S.-Russian economic cooperation in the event of a peace deal. He touched on a sensitive issue that is at the heart of his war against Ukraine and is likely to be a major bone of contention as efforts to end the war proceed, saying potential rare earth exploration deals could include deposits in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine, in the resource-rich region known as the Donbas. On February 23, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko told a news conference that 'about $350 billion worth of these useful critical materials' are in Russian-occupied territory. At 3.8 million metric tons, Russia's rare earth reserves are the fifth-largest in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The main Russian rare earth mining and production companies have been nationalized since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and are now controlled by Rosatom, the state nuclear company, which has strong ties with close Putin associate Mikhail Kovalchuk, RFE/RL's Russian investigative unit, Systema, reported on February 25. Rare earths are a class of more than about 17 minerals -- among them yttrium, cerium, and lanthanum -- that are found in trace amounts throughout the Earth's surface. They're in increasing demand because of their use in products such as batteries, computers, smart phones, magnets, electric cars, and high-tech weaponry. What Are Ukraine's Mineral Resources? Ukraine says it has reserves of half the 50 minerals the United States deems 'critical to the U.S. economy and national security' -- a broader category that includes lithium and titanium, among others -- and of more common mineral resources such as coal, iron ore, oil, and gas. U.S. officials have said that the minerals deal would enhance Ukraine's security because the United States would want to protect its interests, but Zelenskyy has stressed that Kyiv needs strong and reliable security guarantees in the event of a cease-fire or peace deal. In addition to concerns about security guarantees, the amounts the United States has mentioned have also caused consternation in Kyiv. Trump said earlier this month that he wanted 'the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earths,' and a new draft proposed by Washington after the rejection initially called for Ukraine to contribute to a U.S.-held fund until it reached that amount. Zelenskyy has pointed out that American wartime aid so far has been far below $500 billion and that much of the money has gone to U.S. weapons producers. As of September, Congress had appropriated $174.2 billion in emergency supplemental funding for Ukraine-related purposes, with 64 percent of that going to the Defense Department and defense-related accounts, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Financial Times said it had seen the 'final version' of the agreement, which it said was dated February 24 and did not include a demand for $500 billion. The deal would 'establish a fund into which Ukraine would contribute 50 percent of proceeds from the ‘future monetization’ of state-owned mineral resources, including oil and gas, and associated logistics,' the newspaper reported, and the fund would 'invest in projects in Ukraine.' According to the newspaper, the deal excludes mineral resources that already contribute to Ukrainian state coffers, 'meaning it would not cover the existing activities of Naftogaz or Ukrnafta, Ukraine’s largest gas and oil producers.' While the draft includes no specific security guarantees, AFP quoted a 'senior Ukrainian source' as saying 'there is a general clause that says America will invest in a stable and prosperous sovereign Ukraine, that it works for a lasting peace, and that America supports efforts to guarantee security.' Existing EU-Ukraine Memorandum Amid tension between the United States and the EU over Russia and the war in Ukraine, meanwhile, the news agency AFP reported that an EU official said the bloc had proposed a separate deal between the EU and Ukraine during a visit to Kyiv with European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen on February 24, the third anniversary of the start of the full-scale invasion.'Twenty-one of the 30 critical materials Europe needs can be provided by Ukraine in a win-win partnership,' AFP quoted the European commissioner for industrial strategy, Stephane Sejourne, as saying. 'The added value Europe offers is that we will never demand a deal that's not mutually beneficial.' However, European Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said on February 25 that there was 'no proposal' from the EU, adding the bloc has had a partnership with Ukraine on critical minerals since a memorandum of understanding was signed in 2021.Von der Leyen 'reaffirmed [a] commitment to implement this memorandum of understanding and accelerate the work to strengthen our mutual benefit partnership,' he said. 'As you see, this is really here about cooperation with Ukraine and not about any sort of competition with the United States.'Speaking to RFE/RL on condition of anonymity, a senior EU official said he would be 'surprised' if Von der Leyen and the European Commission 'would want to challenge the U.S. on this.'

Exploring Ancient Understandings Of Meteorites In Archaic Societi...	Five times a day, approximately one-fourth of the world's population turns toward Mecca to bow their heads in prayer. The Kaaba at the center of this global genuflection has a cornerstone that some speculate is a meteor. Meteoritic artifacts appear as early as the dawn of Egypt's Early Dynastic Period, approximately 4,500 years ago. Archaeological teams in the 1920s reported that beads from the Gerzeh cemetery in northern Egypt had very high concentrations of nickel, typical of meteoritic iron. These are the earliest analyzed artifacts, and modern metal testing technologies mean that chemists can now identify and catalog the presence of meteoritic iron in archaeological collections across Eurasia. Since 2013, this has led to many discoveries reframing the prominence of extraterrestrial resources in the archaeological record, including identifying that King Tutankhamun's dagger was crafted from a meteor. Experts believe this opulent weapon was a gift to the boy king's grandfather Amenhotep III around 1300 BCE, from the king of the Mitanni region, based on the Amarna tablets. This high-status gift is one of the many ways meteoritic iron was revered by ancient civilizations. One of the earliest Egyptian hieroglyphics for iron seems to be derived from a longer phrase translating to: 'iron from the sky.' This word has cosmological connotations associated with the Egyptian belief that the sky was an iron pot or tub filled with water, and bits of it fell to the Earth in the form of meteorites. 'We have evidence for the idea that the sky was a dome made of iron in a few different civilizations,' explains Victoria Almansa-Villatoro, the Egyptologist who analyzed the hieroglyphic for iron (and sky), during an interview. 'If all of these civilizations had this idea and they are so spread apart, it is possible that the idea goes way back in time, maybe before writing was invented.' Almansa-Villatoro emphasizes tracing any common meanings or beliefs linking such cultures is purely speculation. Contemporaneously to the Mitanni, it is believed the Hittites used meteoritic iron by 3,000 to 2,000 BCE as one iron dagger excavated in Alaca Höyük in modern-day Turkey was made from a meteor and dated to 2,500 BCE. Iron pendants from Umm el-Marra in Syria and an iron axe from Ugarit in Lebanon are other key examples of hammered meteoritic iron. The process of working with meteoritic iron is much simpler than having to reduce the impurities out of terrestrial iron ore (because meteoritic iron is already a metal). All that needs to be done is hammering the material. This key difference is why meteoritic iron appears well before terrestrial iron and even before the beginning of the Bronze Age, which varies by region but is approximately from 3,000 to 1,200 BCE. The Gerzeh beads and King Tutankhamun's dagger were hammered cold or hot, similar to early gold and copper processing. Smelting out impurities from terrestrial iron demarcates the start of the Iron Age because Bronze Age furnaces were not hot enough for such a complex process. The dawn of this development is between 1,200 and 600 BCE depending on the region. How early metallurgists started working with iron ore is still being actively explored by experts. Even though the melting of copper is much simpler than iron production, it may have played a role in the development of iron reduction. 'Copper slags have a lot of iron oxide, and if your furnace reduces too much you will get a small amount of iron in your slag,' explains geochemist and metallurgist Albert Jambon, Sorbonne University, during an interview. 'Maybe the first people were working with slags, but to go from slag to an ore, I just don't know.' Slag is the waste from metal processing, and it is a good and readily available source of data in the archaeological record. Jambon devised a chemical strategy for identifying meteoritic iron by studying the ratios of nickel to iron and copper in artifacts. It seems that all the iron artifacts from the Bronze Age came from outer space, but research published in 2025 identified that three of 26 iron artifacts were meteoritic. These artifacts were found in an early Iron Age cemetery of the Lusatian culture in modern-day Poland. Oddly, these artifacts were not found with any wealthy implements in what seemed like graves of 'commoners,' a stark contrast to how meteoritic iron was valued during earlier historic periods. Even though approximately 17,000 meteors weighing more than 50 grams hit Earth each year, most are made of stone. Only about 4 percent are composed of iron alloys with abnormal nickel content that people can use. These materials became a rare commodity for ancient people, who began valuing this easy-made iron above gold. Cuneiform tablets found at the Old Assyrian Colonial site of Kültepe-Kanesh in Turkey from approximately 4,000 years ago refer to a 'sky metal' that cost as much as 40 times the price of silver. Silver was the most valuable common precious metal in the region at the time. Assur, the capital of the Old Assyrian city-state, felt that the meteoritic iron needed to be taxed, which makes Jan Gerrit Dercksen of Leiden University think that it was common enough to be included in the system of trade tariffs. In Anatolia, not every merchant could afford to trade meteoritic iron, and it seems that groups of merchants combined their funds to buy this sky metal in bulk according to Dercksen. There was a smaller source of meteoritic iron coming from the East into Assur, but it is difficult to identify where the trade originated. Jambon has struggled to identify more meteoritic iron artifacts farther East, but it has been difficult to obtain and test artifacts from Turkey. As for Iran, there are very few iron artifacts and they don't appear well into the Iron Age. This as well as the context in which most Bronze Age meteoritic iron was found suggests that its rarity in part made it a highly valued commodity. This changed with the Iron Age, while meteoritic iron remained rare, terrestrial iron became more common and the early Iron Age cemetery site in Poland is the only identified site where meteoritic iron was found alongside terrestrial iron. It is unclear how much meteoritic iron was used as the number of iron artifacts exploded in the archaeological record. 'There are two possibilities: either there was so little meteoritic iron [artifacts] that it looks like there was no meteoritic iron or the second possibility [is], the price of iron sank so much cheaper than copper,' explains Jambon. 'People didn't care anymore about meteoritic iron because iron was so common it was no longer fashionable.' The Sky is Falling There is evidence globally that meteors have carried importance across millennia, including the Western Hemisphere. Archaeologists in Arizona found the Winona meteorite inset in what was assumed to be a ritual cyst in a pre-Columbian settlement. The Clackamas tribe in Oregon have a rich oral tradition and a range of ceremonies surrounding the Willamette meteor, the largest meteor found in North America. Just like the ancient Egyptians, the Hopewell tribe made beads out of meteoritic iron brought from more than 400 miles away as well as adzes and earspools. In the 1500s, Indigenous guides brought Spanish soldiers to a field of at least 26 impact craters 500 miles north of Buenos Aires that they called Piguem Nonraltá. The Spanish translated this to Campo del Cielo—'field of the sky.' The Spanish soldiers claimed they saw a huge slab of iron but couldn't believe the local stories that it had fallen from the sky. The meteor shower occurred approximately 4,500 years ago and was recorded by the local cultures as a great catastrophe. Spanish records indicate that the Indigenous tribes made weapons from the iron, but none have been preserved or identified. This field is home to some of the world's largest meteorite fragments including the 30-ton Gancedo fragment found in 2016. A meteorite currently in the Academy of Sciences of Munich struck Zanzibar in the middle of the 19th century only to be revered by the Wanika tribe until a Maasai cattle raid made them lose respect for it. They promptly sold it to German missionaries. Prehistoric stone tools also developed a type of lore as good luck charms in different periods and regions due to different cultic traditions largely associated with cosmological concepts. Tuvan reindeer herders in northern Mongolia continue to collect prehistoric stone tools for good luck and call them 'sky stones.' Obsidian and flint tools of the Neolithic and Paleolithic in both classical Greek and Roman periods were called 'lightning stones' because they looked like weapons and were associated with the lightning bolt weapons of Zeus. It was recorded as late as the 20th century in Italy that Neolithic flints were treated as amulets to protect against lightning and natural disasters. It is speculated that people didn't associate these tools or lightning stones as man-made from an earlier period. Scholar Christopher A. Faraone writes that there is 'no evidence that the Greeks or Romans realized that these axe-heads were manufactured by previous stone-age cultures and indeed the inclusion of them in [natural history and geology books] confirms... that they were believed to be 'natural' stones which, like amber, jet or coral, had special protective powers.' The historical depth and meaningful associations people have historically placed on meteoritic iron are more fully illustrated by the tale of a 1,000-year-old Buddha statue, made by the Bon culture in Tibet. A Nazi expedition looted the statue weighing just more than 10 kilograms between 1938 and 1939 not knowing that it was made out of meteoritic iron. Indiana Jones wasn't there to rescue the statue, and it disappeared for decades. The statue reappeared in the hands of a private collector, who collaborated with researchers and determined its extraterrestrial composition and landing spot on Earth. They determined it came from the Chinga meteor which landed 10,000 to 20,000 years ago in southern Siberia, likely traveling thousands of kilometers in its journey to Tibet. While the space-born Buddha is one of the most unique and intricate objects crafted from a meteor, the oldest meteoritic artifacts found east of the Levant are weapons from China's Shang Dynasty, dating to 1,400 BCE. A knife and a pole-mounted dagger-axecalled ge from 900-800 BCE were also made from meteoritic iron. Baetyls Meteors are part of many myths and stories around the globe, but one of the most interesting correlations between meteors and sacred sites is found in southwest Eurasia and the Mediterranean region. Baetyls are an ancient tradition of using sacred stones thought to be meteorites or based on meteorites. The etymological origin of the word translates to 'house of god.' Thought to originally refer to open-air sites of worship from the original Semitic term, depictions across cultures and civilizations, however, all show hewn stones at the center of god's house that some speculate are meteorites. The word baetyl itself is now used to refer to these revered stones. In Agia Eirini, Cyprus, more than 2,000 terracotta figurines were found surrounding and facing a cultic stone on an altar. This miniature terracotta army was surrounding a round-shaped small boulder that appears contextually to have been treated as a sacred baetyl. Baetyls were known to be in the Phoenician cities of Byblos and Tyre and were adopted by Greek tradition in Delphi at the Temple of Apollo and the Needle of Aphrodite in Paphos. The origin of the baetyl at Tyre may be related to accounts from the Phoenician writer, Sanchuniathon, that the goddess Astarte found a stone fallen from the sky, which she took to Tyre to worship in a shrine. It is even speculated that the cultic practices around meteors played a role in the founding of Rome. Rome had a sacred black stone and shrine like a baetyl called the Lapis Niger, which was believed to have been derived from preexisting cultic worship practices. According to the Roman Grammarian and teacher Marcus Verrius Flaccus, the Lapis Niger marks a spot of ill omen and was intended to be the mythical founder Romulus's burial spot but was, in fact, not used as such. Excavations under Giacomo Boni at the Roman Forum in 1899 uncovered what was dubbed the Lapis Niger and the tomb of Romulus. This was something of a misnomer because it is unclear whether he actually found this site or if the accounts were accurate in the first place. The archaeological journal volume about his excavations from 1903 suggested that the polished black stone on the Lapis Niger that Flaccus saw could have been a meteorite, but the excavations from 1899 only seemed to have uncovered copies influenced by the Lapis Niger. Etruscan grave markersfrom a major necropolis in Cerveteri have similar black stones to that of the Lapis Niger. There are several textual references to sacred stones from the sky in Greco-Roman sources that experts believe are meteor fragments. The religious historian Mircea Eliade even asserted that important holy sites, including the Palladion of Troy, the Artemis of Ephesus, and the Cone of Elagabalus in Emesa, were actually based on meteorites. There is no physical evidence supporting the origin stories of these shrines and the historical speculations surrounding them—no excavated or identified baetyl was a meteor. Other descriptions of baetyls are regularly just rock or even simply mounds of earth. The same stands true for the Egyptian Benben stone—a black pyramidal stone thought to either be on top of a pyramid or influence the pyramids in ancient Egypt. Benben has become a generic term for the top cornerstone of a pyramid or obelisk, but it is derived from a revered one mentioned repeatedly in Egyptian texts. The original was venerated at the 'Mansion of the Phoenix' within the Great Sun Temple of Heliopolis but likely predates the sun cult of Ra. It is linked to the creation story of Atum, one of the oldest Egyptian deities. The Benben is either the hill he rises out of the waters from or what he falls out of the sky on (remember the Egyptian sky being an iron tub of water). But Atum is credited with and linked to many cosmological symbols. Just like the Black Stone of the Kaaba in Mecca, it is still not scientifically conclusive whether or not any revered stones recorded in historical documents are meteors. It is speculated there are cultic, pre-Abrahamic items of worship inside the Kaaba Similarly, any potential meteor worship in the Greco-Roman pantheons could have been derived from earlier traditions, like how Atum's Benben predated the Sun God Ra. Although the Black Stone, or al-Hajar al-Aswad in Arabic, makes appearances during the lifetime of Abraham and Muhammad, it supposedly fell to Earth when Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden. It landed where they were to build the first temple, and it was placed into the Kaaba by the Prophet Muhammad in 605 CE. According to tradition, the Black Stone was originally white but turned black as it absorbed the sin of the hajis who touched it at Mecca. Islamic tradition is the only source of information on the origin of al-Hajar al-Aswad. In the oldest known epic poem from Mesopotamia, the titular protagonist Gilgamesh dreams of a meteor landing outside the ancient city of Uruk that he is unable to move. This dream has prophetic meaning for the rest of the epic, putting meteors front and center in one of the oldest pieces of literature. Philosophers of the Greco-Roman period were some of the first known to record rocks falling from the sky. Aristotle, Plutarch, and Pliny the Elder, to name a few, were the first to record a meteor fall in Turkey around either 467 or 466 BC. Meanwhile, the community of European scientists debated the existence of meteors until the early 19th century; a meteor shower in France in 1803 ended the debate. The uncertainty of textual references can hopefully be proved by the archaeological record. Jambon first started using his chemical analysis looking for meteoritic iron in 2010 after purchasing an XRF instrument. Despite the many obstacles in obtaining old artifacts from around Eurasia, he continues to shine a light on ancient metallurgical technologies.

How AI Can Help Both Tax Collectors And Taxpayers – Analysis	New technologies have the potential to improve the relationship between governments and citizens. Tax portals, customs IT systems and online services have simplified interactions with public authorities, reduced bureaucratic hurdles, and increased transparency. Now, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is emerging as the next transformative force. Known for its ability to understand and produce human language, GenAI opens possibilities that go beyond simple automation. However, in an area as politically sensitive as taxation, it also raises important questions that could quickly undermine trust. Tax authorities are beginning to explore GenAI, though most efforts are still at an early, experimental stage. The most evident area so far has been on improving communication with taxpayers. In Singapore, a virtual assistant answers tax questions in multiple languages and has cut call-center inquiries by half. Korea has deployed an AI guide to help citizens file and pay taxes. In France, AI can analyze incoming emails and propose draft responses for civil servants to validate. While these applications are promising, a more profound question emerges: Can GenAI significantly alter the relationship between governments and citizens? Furthermore, how will it influence the way citizens experience and perceive taxation—a politically sensitive process that is governed by law yet deeply intertwined with social norms and practices? What’s new with GenAI? Most AI systems currently used by tax and customs authorities are predictive and built for a single function. They analyze large sets of structured data—like past tax declarations or transactions—to produce things like risk scores to indicate possible fraud. By contrast, GenAI is a generalist system that understands almost all forms of information and is designed to interact with humans in any language. It can handle a range of tasks, from drafting letters to providing interactive guidance about tax regulations and assisting officers in their investigations. By training a GenAI agent with legal texts, tax codes, operating procedures, and internal guidelines, administrations can adapt it to specific needs. The result is a dynamic system capable of understanding and producing content that both civil servants and taxpayers can interact with. Transforming the State-Society Relationship While AI tools already in use often enhance efficiency, they have not fundamentally changed the way revenue authorities work or engage with citizens. They mostly replaced manual tasks or systems for econometric or statistical modelling. With GenAI, there are more profound implications. Internally, it can help tax and customs officials to focus on analytical and judgment-based roles, allowing them to become oversight specialists and increasing their productivity. Externally, it can reduce the knowledge gap between administrations and taxpayers, aiding in the interpretation of complex provisions, navigating laws, identifying deductions, and even auto-filling forms. For low-income countries, GenAI offers the opportunity to drive organizational reforms and leapfrog into the most modern systems. For example, in Madagascar, the customs authority wants to use GenAI to improve risk management, combat fraud and increase revenue, using data accumulated over 10 years to train its system. The human-like interactions offered by AI chat tools can personalize the process, as shown in Singapore and Korea, where users can ask questions and receive plain language replies. Citizens’ organizations, academics, and political parties can also use GenAI to examine proposed reforms, compare scenarios, and engage in deeper policy debates. This two-way transformation could increase overall trust, making taxation feel less like a frustrating obligation and more like a shared responsibility of both taxpayers and governments. Preconditions for success Despite its potential, GenAI also comes with challenges. Issues related to data quality, ethics, privacy concerns and hallucinations (i.e., incorrect results) must be addressed to reinforce and not erode trust. For instance, Korea’s approach—directing particularly sensitive queries to human agents—reflects the need for careful oversight of confidential matters. Results must be explainable and perceived as fair in all cases. Effective knowledge management is another requirement. Revenue authorities have extensive laws, regulations, case records, and operational manuals. However, scattered archives and incomplete digitization can hamper efforts to train AI systems effectively. A human must determine which documents are accurate, relevant, and suitable for inclusion in the training material. As GenAI becomes integrated into various aspects of revenue administration, employees will need to be trained to interpret, correct, and complement its outputs. Policymakers must ensure that errors are reported and addressed promptly. By providing human-like capabilities to support taxpayers and tax authorities, GenAI can act as both taxman and taxpayer assistant, automating routine tasks, clarifying complex issues, and fostering a more transparent and collaborative relationship. This technology can lower administrative hurdles, demystify tax obligations, and invite broader participation in policy debates. However, shaping it properly requires strong leadership, ethical policy frameworks, and vigilant oversight of data quality, privacy, and accuracy.

The Possible Reality Of The ‘Century Of The Americas’ – Analysis	By Zhou Chao It is undeniable that as of this year, the basic process of de-globalization has been ongoing for roughly a decade. The further divergence of the global economic development pattern is, therefore, an indisputable fact. As for the countries and regions that are likely to take the leading positions in the future global economic landscape, many different views have emerged in the commentary. Some argue that, with its young population and increasingly stronger economic power, India's position in the global economy will be further strengthened. Others point out that, with similar advantages, Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam are expected to become key players in the future global economic pattern. There are even opinions that foresee a promising future for the five Central Asian countries. In this regard, however, the Americas seem to have been somewhat overlooked. That being said, a senior researcher at ANBOUND has long expressed the view that, in terms of the future global economic structure, the possibility of a 'Century of the Americas' should not be underestimated. Latin American countries, represented by Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as North American countries, including the United States and Canada, will occupy a more important position in the global economic structure, with greater influence. In several prior analyses, ANBOUND has highlighted that the past focus on the economic aspects of globalization has been one-sided and superficial. This approach has resulted in overly long and complex global supply chains, which have proven highly vulnerable in the face of sudden events such as natural disasters and regional conflicts. Moreover, the widening global wealth gap has fueled increasing dissatisfaction within countries over this narrow form of globalization. As a result, regionalization is expected to emerge as a long-term trend, with the United States gradually redirecting its attention and resources to the geographically closer Americas. Recently, in matters such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the United States has essentially adopted a unilateral approach and marginalized Europe. Conflicts between the U.S. and Europe in areas such as trade, investment, and defense spending are likely to continue intensifying for a period. Furthermore, with the rise of conservative forces in the U.S. and the deepening ideological divide between them and the European Union's establishment faction, tensions in U.S.-EU relations are continuously strengthening. Moreover, since the beginning of the century, due to its own structural bloating and complex legal regulations, the EU's economic vitality has gradually weakened, and it has fallen behind China and the U.S. in areas such as cutting-edge technological research and development. The intensification of U.S.-EU contradictions and the EU's decreasing economic vitality may undermine the importance of the EU as the primary destination for U.S. capital's long-term overseas investment. For the entire Americas, the U.S.'s primary task is to effectively manage and integrate the entire continent both ideologically and economically. In North America, the economic strength of the U.S. and Canada is undeniable. While Canada has developed clear opposition with the U.S. on specific issues such as trade disputes, the ideological divide between the two countries is minimal. Economically, Canada remains highly dependent on the U.S., and its eventual full integration into the U.S.'s regional strategic framework is merely a matter of time. Therefore, the U.S.'s most important task is the integration of the entire Latin American region. In terms of economic development and strategic integration, the Latin American region holds significant importance for the U.S. The Latin American region is rich in mineral resources, holding at least 65% of the world's lithium reserves (concentrated in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil); 49% of the silver reserves (mainly in Peru, Chile, Bolivia, and Mexico); 44% of the copper reserves (primarily in Chile and Peru, with Mexico following); 33% of the tin reserves (found in Peru, Brazil, and Bolivia); 26% of the bauxite reserves (concentrated in Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela, and Jamaica); 23% of the nickel reserves (mainly in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic); and 22% of the iron reserves (concentrated in Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico). In addition, the Latin American region is also rich in oil and gas resources. Effectively managing and developing these resources is of great strategic importance to the U.S., as it plays a crucial role in ensuring resource independence and reducing reliance on China. Furthermore, the Latin American region is itself a massive consumer market. With a population of approximately 665 million, it accounts for 8.3% of the global population. The population is notably concentrated in a few leading countries, with Brazil and Mexico ranking as the seventh and tenth most populous nations in the world. Additionally, the region has a relatively young demographic structure. Data shows that in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and Chile, around 24% of the population is under 15 years old, while 65% is between the ages of 15 and 65, indicating a youthful population. The gender ratio in the region is also relatively balanced. In recent years, Latin America's economic growth has been characterized by fluctuations, with consumption potential being relatively promising. Brazil and Mexico are seen as markets with the greatest growth potential. All of these factors provide the U.S. with relatively ideal returns on potential capital investments in the region. It is also important to note that, although some countries in the Latin American region face internal political instability and other issues, the overall situation in the region remains relatively favorable on a global scale. Unlike certain Southeast Asian nations, Latin America does not suffer from severe internal military fragmentation or warlordism. The activities of criminal groups in the region, while a concern, do not possess the same level of destructive power as the Islamist extremist forces in Central Asia and the Middle East. The internal issues in Latin American countries are primarily due to inadequate governance capacity, and these challenges are far more remediable compared to those faced by some of the major countries in Central Asia, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. In terms of the U.S.' integration of the Latin American region, the major regional powers remain the primary targets. This means that the success or failure of future U.S. integration efforts largely depends on the attitudes of Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. As for Mexico, although there are confrontational feelings and positions toward the U.S. on issues like tariffs, there is no serious ideological opposition. Furthermore, Mexico's heavy economic dependence on the U.S. makes it highly likely that Mexico will be successfully integrated into the U.S.'s regional strategic plans. Mexico's own economic strength and growth prospects are also highly regarded by global capital. As for Argentina, President Javier Milei's radical reforms have already yielded significant results. His series of reforms in the monetary and financial sectors have effectively deepened Argentina's integration into the United States' regional strategy. Regarding Brazil, the country is currently governed by left-wing forces, and this creates an ideological distance from the U.S. Economically, Brazil faces structural issues such as low investment efficiency and heavy reliance on final consumption and primary product exports. However, Brazil's overall economic performance remains relatively stable, and its inflation rate is not as alarming as Argentina's. It is also important to note that in the last election, the left-wing forces did not have an overwhelming advantage; right-wing forces still maintain significant influence at both the local and central levels. This suggests that Brazil's economic reforms could still move toward an American-style neoliberal model, potentially integrating into the U.S.'s regional strategy in the future. As for other countries, due to their relatively limited population and economic scale, their ability to resist U.S. influence is weaker, making the possibility of full integration into U.S. strategy quite high. In the case of Cuba, the country has long been affected by isolation and sanctions, with ongoing internal economic and social struggles. Additionally, its aging population is the highest in Latin America, and the country's social vitality is likely to continue to decline, making it difficult to effectively obstruct the U.S.'s future strategy for the Americas. For Venezuela, although Nicolás Maduro's rule remains relatively stable for now, due to its limited overall scale and national strength, it lacks the capacity to significantly hinder the U.S.'s integration and control over the entire Latin American region. Due to the various challenges that still exist in Latin American countries, the U.S.'s efforts to integrate the region face numerous challenges. The U.S. is the dominant power in the Americas, and its development needs were historically met through global markets. In the future, these needs may primarily be met by emerging countries on the American continent. Clearly, in order to achieve this, countries like Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil must possess large, young populations, thriving manufacturing sectors, and stable social environments. Only then will these Latin American countries be able to effectively absorb and meet the development and investment requirements of U.S. capital, providing sustained growth and driving social and economic prosperity. Achieving these requirements will face a series of uncertainties, but it is not impossible. Once U.S. capital, technology, human resources, and ideas truly reshape the entire Latin American region—especially the key countries, the economic power and social development levels of these nations can experience significant leaps. Their international status and influence could also be greatly enhanced, thus creating a prosperous 'Century of the Americas'. A Latin American region like this would not only become an important base for the U.S. in the era of regionalization but also a key support point for strengthening U.S. global influence when the trend of globalization resurges. Final analysis conclusion: Since the launch of the Trump 2.0 era, actions such as demanding Canada join the U.S. and Denmark in ceding Greenland, and forcing Panama to quit the Belt and Road Initiative, have all indicated that the U.S. will gradually shift its focus and investments toward the entire American continent. Fully integrating the Americas, including Latin America, will become a key component of the U.S.'s future global strategy. While this strategic plan will face numerous challenges, it is not without possibility. If successful, both the U.S. and the major countries in the Americas will be able to further enhance their global standing, creating a 'Century of the Americas'. Throughout this process, China's existing interests in Latin America may face continuous and significant disruptions.

Vienna Process Offers A Genuine Alternative To The Taliban – Anal...	By Luke Coffey More than 100 Afghans from different ethnic and minority groups recently gathered in Vienna, Austria, for the fifth meeting of the Vienna Process for a Democratic Afghanistan. Over the past two years, the Vienna Process has emerged as the primary forum for anti-Taliban resistance movements to coordinate, strategize, and chart a common path forward. While the international community has struggled to formulate a coherent approach to Afghanistan, this growing coalition of opposition groups has steadily built a framework for an alternative future. The Vienna Process has grown in both scope and influence since its inception in September 2022, one year after the Taliban’s return to power. The first round brought together over 30 participants from various Afghan minority and ethnic groups, who issued a joint statement rejecting Taliban rule as unacceptable. Perhaps the most significant outcome was the emergence of Ahmad Massoud, the son of famed anti-Taliban commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, as the de facto leader of the resistance. By April 2023, the second round had expanded to include a broader range of activists, representing diverse ethnic, religious, and political backgrounds. While Massoud and the National Resistance Front remained central, the Ankara Coalition, Hazara, and Uzbek representatives played key roles. Notably, nearly half of the participants were women. This time, they took a bolder step, agreeing to support all forms of resistance against the Taliban, including armed struggle. The third round in December 2023 saw even greater participation, with over 50 representatives from anti-Taliban groups. For the first time, Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek commander and longtime Afghan powerbroker, sent a personal envoy. The presence of international observers from the US and Europe signaled a growing recognition of the resistance movement. By June 2024, the fourth round had grown to 70 participants, including influential figures such as former Afghan Vice President Yunus Qanuni; Hazara leader Mohammad Mohaqiq; and Anarkali Honaryar, an Afghan Sikh. Women’s rights activist Parwana Ibrahimkhel, who had been imprisoned by the Taliban in 2022, also joined. To develop a roadmap for Afghanistan’s future, participants broke into working groups focused on politics, foreign policy, human rights, and economics. This week’s fifth round was even larger and included almost 100 attendees. For the first time, there was a session giving international observers from the US and Europe an opportunity to speak and engage. In addition to Ahmad Massoud, other notable attendees included Yasin Zia, leader of the Afghanistan Freedom Front; and Rangin Dadfar Spanta, the country’s former national security adviser. The biggest outcome of this meeting was the agreement to a roadmap that various working groups had been drafting since the last meeting in June. This program is the opposition’s attempt at showing that there is an alternative to the current Taliban rule. All aspects of Afghanistan’s future and society are covered to include future economic development, security, diplomatic relations, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women’s rights. A special commission of 19 members representing all walks of Afghan society was also formed. This commission will work together and coordinate a response to implement the roadmap. At the heart of the Vienna Process is Massoud. Since fleeing to his ancestral homeland in the Panjshir Valley, north of Kabul, Massoud has pursued a dual-track approach to countering the Taliban. Militarily, the NRF is active in many provinces across Afghanistan, primarily in the north, using guerrilla warfare tactics to target Taliban forces. Last year alone, the NRF launched dozens of attacks, making it a persistent security challenge for the Taliban. Diplomatically, Massoud has led an international effort to raise awareness of the resistance and build alliances. This is one of the main reasons the Vienna Process has gained momentum. The Vienna Process offers a rare good news story about Afghanistan. Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, they have shown little ability to govern effectively. The country faces an acute humanitarian crisis that worsens each year, and the economic situation remains dire as questions arise over the sustainability of international aid. Meanwhile, human rights conditions continue to deteriorate, with ethnic minorities persecuted, girls banned from schools, and women forced out of many workplaces. Yet, the NRF and other Vienna Process participants demonstrate that an alternative future is possible. The situation today mirrors the 1990s when the Northern Alliance controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, yet refused to surrender to the Taliban. Likewise, the NRF and other resistance groups must continue their fight and ensure that the world does not forget them. The Taliban itself is deeply divided, with competing factions vying for power. These internal fractures could create opportunities for the anti-Taliban resistance to establish safe zones and reclaim territory. The international community would be wise to engage more seriously with the Vienna Process. While a few international observers attended this week’s meeting, no senior government officials participated. At the next Vienna Process gathering, representatives such as the US special envoy for Afghanistan and counterparts from other nations should attend — even if only as observers. It makes little sense that much of the international community engages with the Taliban as the de facto rulers of Afghanistan, while failing to establish meaningful dialogue with resistance movements such as the NRF and others in the Vienna Process. With each round, the Vienna Process has become more inclusive and strategic, positioning itself as the most significant platform for Afghanistan’s anti-Taliban resistance. Global policymakers should take note. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

What Is Danantara, Indonesia’s New State Investment Body? – Analy...	By Arie Firdaus Daya Anagata Nusantara (Danantara), a new state investment management body launched by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, aims to boost the nation’s economy. The announcement on Monday fulfilled a key campaign promise by Prabowo, who took office in October. But what exactly is Danantara, and how does it fit into Indonesia’s economic ambitions? Here’s what you need to know: What is Danantara? Danantara is designed to consolidate funds from Indonesia’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and channel them into strategic projects, such as renewable energy, industrial development, and food production. Prabowo has described it as an 'economic catalyst' with the ambitious goal of accelerating Indonesia’s growth rate and ensuring long-term prosperity. The name Danantara is derived from three Indonesian words: Daya (energy or strength), Anagata (future), and Nusantara (Indonesia). They reflect the body’s mission to become a driving force for the nation’s economic future. With an estimated initial asset base of U.S. $900 billion, Danantara ranks among the world’s largest state investment bodies. It surpasses Malaysia’s Khazanah ($37 billion) and Singapore’s Temasek ($596 billion) and is the seventh-largest globally. What will Danantara do? Danantara’s primary role is to optimize the management of Indonesia’s state-owned assets and invest in high-impact projects. According to Prabowo, the body will focus on areas related to sustainable energy, food security and industrial downstreaming that involves processing raw materials into higher-value products. 'We no longer want to sell our natural resources cheaply or serve as raw material suppliers for other nations,' Prabowo said during the launch. 'High-impact projects will generate significant value for our nation, create quality jobs, and ensure long-term prosperity for the Indonesian people.' Why was Danantara created? The idea for Danantara emerged during Prabowo’s presidential campaign, where he pledged to create a superholding company to manage Indonesia’s state-owned enterprises more effectively. Inspired by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, the plan was initially slated for launch in November 2024 but was delayed. Danantara’s creation was formalized following the third revision of Indonesia’s SOE Law, passed by the House of Representatives on Feb. 4. While it was initially envisioned as a replacement for the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, the ministry now retains some oversight powers, including a 1% 'special share' that grants the government veto power over strategic decisions. Who is leading Danantara? Rosan Roeslani, Indonesia’s minister of Investment and head of the Investment Coordinating Board, has been appointed Danantara’s chief executive officer. Rosan, who led Prabowo’s 2024 presidential campaign team, is joined by Pandu Sjahrir, a businessman and nephew of National Economic Council Chairman Luhut Pandjaitan, as chief investment officer. Pandu was a member of Prabowo’s campaign team as well. The Dantantara team also includes Deputy Minister of SOEs Dony Oskario, who will serve as chief operating officer. The presidential office has indicated that a former president may be appointed to Danantara’s leadership, but no details have been provided. How is Danantara funded? Danantara’s initial capital comes from seven major state-owned enterprises, including Bank Mandiri, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Telkom Indonesia, and energy giant Pertamina. Together, these companies have contributed around $20 billion in initial funds from their revenues. Additional SOEs are expected to join Danantara in the future, which will further expand the body’s asset base. The first phase of investment will focus on nickel and bauxite processing, food production, and green energy projects. How does Danantara compare with Indonesia’s existing investment fund? Indonesia already has a sovereign wealth fund, the Indonesia Investment Authority (INA), established in 2021 under former President Joko Widodo. However, Danantara is broader in scope, combining investment management, asset development, and sovereign wealth fund functions such as managing and investing state assets. INA will eventually be absorbed into Danantara. What are the concerns? Despite its ambitious goals, Danantara has faced skepticism from analysts and transparency advocates. Some worry that its leadership, dominated by political appointees rather than independent professionals, could undermine its efficacy. 'Danantara looks more like a political institution for elites rather than a professionally managed fund,' said Budi Frensidy, a capital market analyst at the University of Indonesia. Others have raised concerns about oversight. Under its legal framework, Danantara’s audits will be conducted by a public accountant chosen by shareholders and approved by the SOE minister. Only if the House of Representatives requests it would there be an intervention by the Supreme Audit Agency, which is the government body responsible for accountability of state finances. The law does not explicitly grant oversight authority to Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) either. Danantara’s CEO Roslan has sought to address these concerns, stating that the body is not immune from the law. 'The KPK can certainly step in, especially if there are improper or criminal acts,' he told reporters on Monday. Prabowo has also stressed the importance of transparency, declaring that Danantara 'must be auditable at any time by anyone because this, once again, belongs to our children and grandchildren, [and] to the future generations of Indonesia.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdu5wjfluXLeSBMFh7WUnkK	2025-02-25T17:24:40-08:00	
Trump’s Russia Strategy: Breaking The Sino-Russian Alliance Or St...	By Dr. Hasim Turker The return of Donald Trump to the White House has marked a departure from the conventional trajectory of US foreign policy. His administration’s approach to Russia signals a recalibration of priorities, reflecting an underlying strategy aimed at reshaping global alignments in Washington’s favor. Rather than maintaining the confrontational stance of previous administrations, Trump appears to favor a more conciliatory approach toward Moscow, a shift largely dictated by the imperative of countering China’s rise. This shift, however, raises critical questions about its broader consequences, particularly for the transatlantic alliance and global stability. Russia and China: The New Strategic Equation For decades, US foreign policy has been characterized by a dual containment approach toward both Russia and China. However, Trump’s return to power suggests a shift in focus, prioritizing China as the primary geopolitical challenger while seeking to ease tensions with Russia. This change underscores a belief that continued antagonism toward Moscow only serves to push Russia further into China’s strategic orbit. The assumption behind this approach is that an entrenched Sino-Russian partnership presents the most formidable challenge to US hegemony. If the two powers deepen their military, economic, and diplomatic coordination, Washington faces a significantly more complex threat environment. By offering diplomatic and economic incentives to Russia, the Trump administration aims to weaken this partnership and prevent Beijing from leveraging Moscow’s resources in a future confrontation with the United States. The urgency of countering China stems from its growing economic and military power. China has surpassed the United States as the world’s largest trading nation and advanced significantly in AI, semiconductor manufacturing, and quantum computing. The modernization of the People’s Liberation Army and its growing naval power challenge US strategic superiority in the Indo-Pacific. Meanwhile, Beijing’s global outreach through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative has significantly expanded its influence across Africa, Latin America, and even Europe. Against this backdrop, Trump’s foreign policy team views Russia as a secondary concern. While Moscow remains a geopolitical competitor, its ambitions are seen as more regionally focused, making engagement with Russia a strategic move to free up resources for the broader confrontation with China. A Diplomatic Strategy to Divide Russia and China Trump’s approach recalls President Richard Nixon’s opening to China in 1972, where Washington exploited the Sino-Soviet split to contain Moscow. However, this time, the roles are reversed, as the United States seeks to engage Russia in an effort to weaken China’s strategic position. The administration envisions diplomatic engagement, the lifting of select sanctions, and potential de-escalation of tensions over Ukraine as mechanisms to bring Russia back into a more balanced relationship with the West. The assumption is that, with the right incentives, Moscow might be willing to moderate its ties with Beijing. Yet, this assumption is flawed. Unlike during the Cold War, when ideological rifts separated China and the Soviet Union, today’s Russia-China partnership is built on shared opposition to Western dominance. Both countries benefit from economic cooperation, joint military exercises, and diplomatic coordination in multilateral institutions such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Given these realities, the likelihood of Russia abandoning its close ties with China in exchange for uncertain US concessions remains low. Implications for NATO and European Security While the logic behind Trump’s approach is clear, it carries significant strategic risks. By deprioritizing support for Ukraine and easing pressure on Moscow, Trump may embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin. A perceived retreat by the United States could encourage Russia to expand its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe through hybrid warfare or direct military action. The administration’s skepticism toward NATO, combined with its reluctance to maintain military aid commitments to Ukraine, risks fracturing the transatlantic alliance. European nations, uncertain of Washington’s reliability, may seek alternative security arrangements, undermining the cohesion that has underpinned Western stability since World War II. Additionally, by engaging in direct negotiations with Moscow without meaningful European participation, Washington risks sidelining key allies such as Germany, France, and Poland. This could push European nations toward a more independent foreign policy stance, reducing Washington’s ability to coordinate a unified response to global security challenges. Concrete Policy Shifts and Their Consequences Trump’s realignment is already manifesting in concrete policy decisions. His administration has signaled a shift away from previous commitments to European security, urging NATO members to increase their defense spending while casting doubt on the United States’ commitment to Article 5. He has also moved to curtail military aid to Ukraine, undermining Kyiv’s ability to resist Russian advances. While these measures are intended to secure Moscow’s neutrality in a US-China confrontation, they carry long-term risks that could outweigh their short-term gains. If Russia interprets these moves as signs of Western weakness, it may choose to exploit them rather than reciprocate with genuine geopolitical realignment. A More Strategic Alternative: Balancing Engagement and Deterrence If the objective is to prevent an entrenched Sino-Russian alliance while maintaining US credibility, an alternative approach is needed. Rather than offering unconditional concessions to Moscow, Washington should pursue a strategy of selective engagement coupled with reinforced deterrence. Diplomatic engagement with Russia should be contingent on verifiable actions, such as de-escalation in Ukraine and a commitment to cease aggressive military posturing in Eastern Europe. European allies should be encouraged to increase their defense contributions, but US commitments to NATO must remain firm. Enhanced joint military exercises and forward deployments in Eastern Europe would deter Russian aggression while ensuring NATO’s resilience. Economic relief should only be granted in exchange for concrete behavioral changes from Moscow, using sanctions as a bargaining tool rather than a premature concession. Washington should explore areas of limited cooperation with Moscow, such as arms control and Arctic governance, without jeopardizing broader security commitments. Conclusion: Long-Term Strategic Considerations Trump’s foreign policy shift toward Russia represents an ambitious effort to reshape global alignments, but its long-term ramifications remain uncertain. While a Russia-China split could, in theory, provide the United States with strategic flexibility, the execution of this policy raises concerns about its sustainability and unintended consequences. Weakening NATO at a time of growing Russian assertiveness could compromise transatlantic security and embolden Moscow to test Western resolve. Moreover, Russia’s incentives to break from China remain limited, making it unclear whether Washington’s overtures will result in meaningful realignment or simply encourage further geopolitical adventurism. A more sustainable strategy would balance engagement with deterrence, ensuring that diplomatic initiatives with Russia do not come at the expense of broader US strategic interests. History has shown that unchecked concessions rarely produce lasting stability, and the challenge for US policymakers lies in navigating this complex realignment without sacrificing critical security commitments. The broader question remains: Can the United States successfully realign its global strategy while maintaining stability, or will this shift inadvertently accelerate the rise of revisionist powers?

Japan: Strong Reactions To A Weak Yen Shake Economy – Analysis	By Willem Thorbecke The Japanese real effective exchange rate is now at its lowest level in 54 years. Despite the pressures of a depreciating yen — from import prices to debt repayment — Japan’s global competitiveness and financial markets make it well-equipped to handle these challenges. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has tightened monetary policy cautiously. It abandoned negative rates on the uncollateralised overnight call rate in March 2024 and raised the target to 0.25 per cent in July 2024 and to 0.5 per cent in January 2025. The move in July sparked a 6 per cent appreciation of the yen and a 12 per cent drop in the stock market, while the move in January proved uneventful. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has been waiting for what he calls good inflation — inflation driven by wage increases that increase consumption and aggregate demand — to tighten policy. Despite years of easy monetary policy and wages increasing 5.1 per cent in the 2024 spring wage offensive, real disposable income has not increased. This has led to sluggish growth in real consumption. The BOJ may face pressure to tighten in order to resist a disorderly depreciation of the yen. This is especially true as the US Federal Reserve may slow monetary policy easing because of inflationary risks due to tariffs, large US budget deficits and the repatriation of illegal immigrants. The weak yen increases the prices of imported energy and food. This has raised average household costs in 2024 by 90,000 yen (US$590). To combat this, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba implemented stimulus measures to subsidise utility bills and provide cash for poorer households. But one problem with both the BOJ’s tightening and Ishiba’s stimulus package is that they increase budget deficits. By raising interest rates, the BOJ raises the cost of servicing Japan’s public debt. At 1.2 per cent, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds are at their highest level in 14 years. Debt service costs in 2025 are already forecasted to be above 4 per cent of GDP. Ishiba’s package, along with increased spending on military and social security categories, will turn the forecasted primary budget — the budget excluding interest payments — from a surplus into a deficit of 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2025. With a public debt of 250 per cent of GDP, Japan needs to eschew additional borrowing. It should instead allow entrepreneurs to play a larger role in allocating resources. The weak yen also impacts Japan’s international transactions. It raises the costs of imports of food, fuels and other items. Yet the stimulus to exports is mitigated as many manufacturers relocated factories abroad during the strong yen period that lasted until 2012. Since the weak yen increases the cost of imports and has a tenuous impact on exports, it contributed to a trade deficit in 2024. But the weak yen raised the yen value of repatriated profitsand contributed to a 47 per cent increase in tourism. Primary income inflows and tourism revenues more than offset the trade deficit, pushing the overall Japanese current account to a surplus of 4 per cent of GDP. The Nikkei 225 stock market index also benefitted from the weak yen. It increased 19 per cent in 2024 and finished at its highest year-end level ever. Much of this occurred because the weak yen increased the yen profitability of companies such as Toyota and Komatsu, who obtain revenues from abroad. It has yet to be seen whether many Japanese firms who moved factories abroad during strong yen episodes — such as after the 1985 Plaza Accord and the 2008–09 Global Financial Crisis — will return production to Japan as the yen remains weak. The government has pushed to return semiconductor manufacturing to Japan. The weak yen may help this plan succeed. As an oil importer, Japan faces challenges from high energy costs which are only raised with yen depreciation. It is seeking to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and to promote renewables and safe nuclear power. Somewhat paradoxically for an oil importer, oil price increases raise stock prices for Japanese industrial firms. This is because Japanese companies produce niche goods and services that are needed as energy prices increase. These high-quality niche products also improve the resilience of the Japanese economy. Japanese firms produce the lion’s share of photoresists and image sensors, used in the electronics industry and medical equipment. Japanese firms are also major suppliers of inputs to the semiconductor industry. With Japan consistently ranking as the most sophisticated economy, finding substitutes for many Japanese goods is hard. This provides Japanese companies with a stable source of demand for their products across Southeast Asia, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Europe and the United States. This diversification reduces their exposure to difficulties in individual markets such as China. Japan will face challenges in 2025, including uncertainties from United States President Donald Trump, competition from South Korean and Chinese firms, dangers from wars and natural disasters, a shrinking workforce and an aging population. Japanese companies have navigated difficulties associated with the Russia–Ukraine war, the COVID-19 pandemic and the weak yen. These past successes provide reason for optimism that Japan can weather the coming shocks.

Is Taiwan Fever Breaking In Lithuania? – Analysis	By Thomas J. Shattuck (FPRI) -- One of Taiwan’s most significant foreign policy achievements since the COVID-19 pandemic was the expansion of its unofficial diplomatic cooperation with Lithuania. Both countries opened unofficial representative offices in each other’s capitals—in 2021, Taiwan’s office opened in Vilnius, and in 2022, Lithuania’s office opened in Taipei. The announcement of the 'Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania' resulted in a coercive firestorm from Beijing. Since then, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has utilized various diplomatic and economic mechanisms to pressure and punish Lithuania. The two nations’ relations remain at the chargé d’affaires level, with both countries’ embassies remaining closed. After the fall 2024 elections in Lithuania, the new government in Vilnius has made the reestablishment and normalization of Lithuania-PRC relations a foreign policy priority. As these debates continue in Lithuania, it is essential to analyze the state of Lithuania’s relationship with Taiwan, the implications of backing down to Beijing, and the current state of the Lithuanian economy and trade vis-à-vis PRC economic coercion. Taiwan-Lithuania Trade and Investment After the PRC announced trade repercussions for the enhanced Taiwan-Lithuania relationship, it was incumbent upon Taipei to demonstrate that it could be a reliable trade partner and make it worth the aggravation for Vilnius. After all, the PRC removed Lithuania as a country of origin, preventing anything from Lithuania from entering the PRC. During the first few months, Taiwanese people went out of their way to purchase items from Lithuania that were banned from entering the PRC. To her credit, then-President Tsai Ing-wen announced several new initiatives to encourage Taiwanese investment in Lithuania and to spur joint projects. The Tsai administration set up a $200 million investment fund for high-tech industries and a $1 billion credit fund for joint projects. Some funds have been utilized, but not as many as those figures would presume. Most of the investments were related to fintech and laser technologies. According to an official familiar with Lithuania’s relationship with Taiwan, Lithuanian politicians are more confident about the bilateral relationship than Lithuanian businesses are since there is a general unfamiliarity with Taiwan and how it conducts business. There are not a lot of easy wins for either country due to the types and sizes of their economies. Nevertheless, trade between Taiwan and Lithuania increased by 50 percent in 2022 from 2021. Taiwan did its part to demonstrate that it supported Lithuania during the diplomatic crisis. However, that spirit was not extended through businesses utilizing these new opportunities, so while the funds are there, the follow-through has been lacking. But that does not mean Lithuania is now worse off because of its trade situation with the PRC. Is Lithuania Worse Off? One would assume that the PRC cutting off all trade with a country like Lithuania would be economically devastating. After several years, the opposite has turned out to be true. The reason for this is simple: Lithuanian exports to the PRC accounted for under one percent, while PRC imports to Lithuanians were only 4 percent. At the outset of the crisis, some Lithuanian industries were heavily affected because the sanctions essentially turned off their business with the PRC overnight. The industries hit hardest by the crisis were furniture, lasers, and high-tech manufacturing. Companies in these industries lost tens of millions of euros from the loss in business in the initial shock. However, this is not the whole story. These companies and industries found new opportunities elsewhere in the European Union, Indo-Pacific, and the United States (not to mention the PRC quietly reduced its economic sanctions on Lithuania). The industries needed time to diversify away from the PRC and shift to other markets. In fact, 'the total exports of Lithuanian origin goods to the ten Indo-Pacific countries increased by 60.4 percent [during January-June 2022], exceeding the volume of exports to China by four times (compared to January-June 2021).' Trade between Lithuania and the PRC has improved since 2022—a reason cited by the European Commission when asking the World Trade Organization to suspend the European Union’s case against the PRC. Lithuanian exports to the PRC are still not at the pre-crisis level, but they reached the floor in early 2022, with a slow but steady increase since then. At the macro level, Lithuania’s gross domestic product has fluctuated but remained positive since the PRC crisis. In 2021, it grew by 6.4 percent; in 2022, it grew by 2.5 percent; and in 2023, it grew by 0.3 percent, with projections for 2024 of over 2 percent. A Lithuania official noted that Lithuania and its economy were not affected by PRC actions because imports and exports recovered due to the ease of finding new markets for certain commodities. The Battle of the Narrative However, measuring the impact of the PRC’s actions on possible deals with other companies and countries worried about angering the PRC is difficult. During the height of the crisis, Beijing was pressuring companies and governments not to use Lithuanian components. There was a general fear of reprisal for anything Lithuanian and how Beijing could expand that punishment beyond Lithuania. While the economic figures speak for themselves, it appears that the PRC has won the battle of the narrative by emphasizing how much worse off Lithuanians are due to Vilnius’ decision to enhance cooperation with Taiwan. Part of this narrative warfare is the failure to make Lithuania the 'gateway' in Europe for Taiwan. In early 2024, a study by the Eastern Europe Studies Centre found that 47.6 percent of Lithuanians believed that 'China is a profitable market and that Lithuania should be pragmatic and refrain from criticizing it.' About 44 percent still thought Lithuania’s 'economy would struggle without investments from China,' even though GDP figures point to a different reality. Most tellingly, 37 percent believed that 'support for Taiwan does not bring any economic benefits to Lithuania and is less important than maintaining good economic relations with China.' However, 40 percent had no opinion, and 22 percent disagreed. These numbers are a shift from another survey conducted in 2022 by GLOBSEC. Slightly over 42 percent of Lithuanians agreed that the PRC 'presents a danger (significant threat)' to Lithuania, and 71 percent disagreed with the statement that 'the Chinese regime could be an inspiration' for Lithuania. This skepticism could be attributed to President Gitanas Nausėda’s consistent disagreement about allowing the Taiwan office to be named 'Taiwanese Representative Office' and not 'Taipei.' He emphasized this point regularly since the beginning of the crisis and continues to do so. Current Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas campaigned on getting the Lithuania-PRC relationship back on track, but has remained silent on what the future holds for the name of the Taiwan office in Vilnius. He noted that he would work towards restoring full ties 'without humiliating ourselves, falling to our knees, and begging for anything.' One of the architects of the expansion of Taiwan-Lithuania relations, Gabrielius Landsbergis, who was serving as foreign minister then, is no longer serving in parliament after his party only won twenty-eight seats in the 2024 parliamentary elections. He maintains that allowing Taiwan to open an office and use the word 'Taiwanese' was the correct decision. He traveled to Taiwan for the first time in January 2025 to receive an award from President Lai Ching-te. While in Taipei, he said changing the name of the office in Vilnius would be an 'enormous mistake' and that 'it is more than just a name. It is part of [Taiwan’s] identity.' Landsbergis reminded the world that the crisis occurred because the PRC created it through sanctions against Lithuania. It is not really up to the current government in Lithuania to fix a problem that it did not create. Looking Ahead The most crucial issue for Lithuania remains the closure of its embassy in the PRC, which makes it difficult for Vilnius to conduct diplomacy with Beijing. It is difficult for people to obtain visas to visit the country for business or pleasure. A Lithuanian official interviewed on these topics noted that the United States and most of the world maintain an embassy in Russia despite the war in Ukraine. Aggressors and competitors can conduct diplomacy, but this is not the case for Lithuania and China. The sticking point is allegedly the name of the 'Taiwanese Representative Office,' and according to one school of thought, the change in the name will fix all problems. If the current government in Vilnius backs down after years of being resolute, it would mark a significant blow to democratic nations standing up to PRC coercion. The PRC’s actual problem lies with the fact that Lithuania expanded its cooperation with Taiwan, not one specific word. The name is just a detail of a larger part of PRC coercion of third parties to limit Taiwan’s international space and ability to conduct its foreign policy. What happens if Vilnius requests that Taipei change the name of its office and Beijing does not fully restore the Lithuania-PRC political and economic relationship for a different reason—like the fact that it left the China-CEE in 2021? That would be a serious blow to the legitimacy of the government, especially in a country that has a history of standing up to authoritarian regimes. Lithuania needs an open and operating embassy in the PRC, but it is incumbent upon Beijing to change its coercive behavior, not Vilnius to back down. About the author: Thomas J.

Musk’s ‘Super Government’ And The ‘New Elites’ – Analysis	By Zhao Zhijiang Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are shaking revamping the U.S. federal government. This is done through applying corporate strategies like cost reduction and efficiency improvement to government agencies, with the goal of building a super-government that no other country can match. As its name suggests, the DOGE is truly efficient. Within less than a month of its establishment, it has pushed through a series of reforms across multiple fronts. These include eliminating agencies, making personnel changes, limiting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s foreign payments, and cutting the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) departments. Every day, the DOGE shakes up the power structures in Washington. The department's current goal is to cut USD 3 billion per day, and this pace may increase in the future. Recent reports show that Musk and his government efficiency team have already reached at least 19 American government departments and gained internal system access in some of them, further expanding their power. In response to external criticism and attacks, President Donald Trump defended Musk's team, claiming that the federal government is too bloated and that waste and fraud have caused excessive financial losses. Now, Musk continues pushing toward the creation of a 'super-government', focusing on those who profit from politics, particularly Democratic senators. Recently, a video circulating on social media showed Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who usually appears composed, rudely elbowing a reporter who kept challenging her. In the video, the reporter first asks why Warren is bothered by transparency and opposes Musk exposing fraudulent government spending. Then, he asks, 'How did you get a 12 million dollar net worth on a 200,000 dollar salary?' Throughout the exchange, Warren remains silent, smiling as she walks and greets others. Her staff tries to escort the reporter away. When Warren approached her vehicle, she visibly got angry and elbowed the reporter. The video sparked a flood of outraged comments online, with many criticizing Warren as hypocritical and demanding she release her financial and tax records. Some even suggested the reporter should sue Warren for the assault. There are other Democrats in a similar situation to Warren, with unclear income sources and net assets far exceeding what would be expected of a U.S. civil servants. Recent data quoted by Musk shows that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has an annual salary of USD 223,000 but a net worth of USD 202 million. Current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer earns USD 210,000 annually, with a net worth of nearly USD 75 million. Some like certain left-wing critics question Musk's data and accuse it of being false information. However, when looking at open-source data and statistics published by authoritative research organizations like OpenSecrets, it becomes clear that these Democrats qualify as 'super-rich' under the standard definition, belonging to the wealthiest 1% of American society. For instance, OpenSecrets data shows that Pelosi's assets exceeded USD 100 million in 2018, reaching USD 115 million, while Warren had nearly USD 8 million in assets that same year. American people have known about these issues for a long time, and previous U.S. administrations were aware as well but chose to turn a blind eye and ignore them. Now, however, Musk's scrutiny has focused on this group of establishment Democrats, judges, and prosecutors, and this is causing quite a stir. The reason is that these individuals' income sources are problematic. During last year’s U.S. election, these establishment figures and people in the courts banded together to attack Trump. Recently, there have been reports showing that USAID provided large sums of money to an organization controlled by financial tycoon George Soros, which in turn funded a large number of prosecutors. Essentially, Soros’s organization was directing them to prosecute Trump during the election. It is said that the financial transactions of these institutions have already been exposed. Additionally, some argue that USAID, with its large amounts of unclear funding, is now the engine behind the U.S. left-wing culture, fueling many of the issues Musk and Trump are determined to change. The question is, what kind of result will Musk's current efforts lead to? A senior researcher from ANBOUND believes that these efforts by the non-establishment factions in the U.S. will actually create a new elite system. These new elites will no longer come from humble beginnings; they will already be wealthy, born into privileged families, and not rely on politics to make money. For them, holding political office is about contributing and serving. Take Musk himself as an example: a billionaire who works for zero salary, earning not a single penny, yet does his job tirelessly day and night, even sleeping in his office. A government made up of such people is what ANBOUND’s team has referred to as an 'elite government'. This is the government Musk aims to build. This, in essence, restores the old tradition of rule by nobles and elites. The only slight difference is people like JD Vance. From his autobiography Hillbilly Elegy, it is clear that Vance is an elite who grew up from humble beginnings. Through his own efforts, he escaped the poverty of the Rust Belt, attended Yale, worked in California, and gradually made his way into U.S. politics, eventually becoming vice president. However, one Vance alone might struggle to handle the vast governance system of a country like the U.S. Therefore Musk’s vision either needs more idealists to succeed, or it could end in failure and collapse. We can see that Musk’s recruitment for the DOGE is aimed at finding people like him. The department’s job posting on X outlines that applicants must have exceptionally high IQs and be willing to work over 80 hours a week, focusing on the tedious task of cost-cutting, with zero pay. This in effect reflects Musk’s own lifestyle and work philosophy. According to a report by Wired, the six young people in the department leading the charge for streamlining government are between 19 and 25 years old. Some are still in college, some started businesses during college, and others have interned at Musk’s companies or those of his friends. None of them have government experience, but they are experts in technology and algorithms. For example, Akash Bobba, of Indian-origin, has interned at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates, working in AI, data analysis, and financial modeling. Another example is Gavin Kliger, whose father graduated from Cornell University and works as a lawyer at the well-known credit reporting agency Experian. These prodigies come from privileged backgrounds, with strong starting points in life, good family circumstances, and little concern for wealth or salary. If a generation of capitalist giving-back, and dedicated 'new elites' truly emerges in the U.S., it would undoubtedly be a significant development in the field of political science. Musk’s efforts to build a 'super government' could gain increasing social support and gradually become part of the mainstream mindset. The outcome, of course, remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: Musk’s push to create a super government will have an impact just as profound as his mission to land on Mars, and it will undoubtedly have a massive influence on the world. Final analysis conclusion: When a generation of capitalist giving-back, and dedicated 'new elites' truly emerges in the U.S., it will undoubtedly be a major event in political science. Musk's efforts to create a 'super government' may also gain increasing social support, gradually becoming part of the mainstream mindset.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ0y1G_ajCdhn	2025-02-24T16:13:11-08:00	
President Joe Biden’s Decision To Posthumously Pardon Marcus Garv...	By Lipton Matthews President Joe Biden’s decision to posthumously pardon Marcus Garvey has been met with widespread acclaim in the United States and across the global black diaspora. Garvey is revered as an iconic black nationalist and Pan-Africanist thinker, celebrated for his vision of racial uplift and economic self-sufficiency. However, his legacy is far more complex than the hagiographic portrayals suggest. Rather than echoing the usual fawning sentiments, this article will provide an overview of Garvey’s conviction and ideological framework. Garvey’s 1923 conviction for mail fraud remains one of the most controversial episodes in American history. As the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), he was accused of defrauding investors in his ambitious Black Star Line (BSL) shipping venture. However, his trial occurred in an extremely hostile environment. Due to his vocal criticisms of the white political establishment, J. Edgar Hoover had been determined to indict Garvey for fomenting discord as early as 1919. When initial attempts proved abortive Hoover pursued other means to secure a conviction, ultimately arguing Garvey’s management of the Black Star Line could possibly constitute fraud. To build a case, Hoover deployed agents to infiltrate the UNIA. FBI surveillance of Garvey played a key role in justifying his presidential pardon, but the legal basis for such a pardon is more nuanced. The trial judge, Julian Mack, was a known ally and contributor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), an organization that frequently clashed with Garvey. Members of the NAACP supported efforts to prosecute him, and just one day before the trial, the organization’s secretary, James Weldon Johnson, wrote to Mack, raising concerns about impartiality. Citing the precedent set in Berger v. United States, which permits judicial recusal based on extrajudicial factors, Garvey submitted a petition for Mack’s recusal, but it was denied. Faced with a stacked deck, Garvey dismissed his attorney after being advised to accept a plea bargain. This decision only worsened his situation, as Mack failed to ensure Garvey fully understood the consequences of waiving his right to legal representation. Further compounding the miscarriage of justice was the perjury of Schuyler Cargill, a key witness for the prosecution. Cargill claimed to have prepared mailings and made deliveries for the BSL between 1919 and 1921, yet he was unable to identify his supervisor or coworkers. His testimony was crucial, as Garvey’s conviction rested on the allegation that a letter was sent to Benny Dance encouraging him to buy shares in the BSL. However, Cargill later admitted that prosecutors had instructed him to lie about his employment. Also of relevance is Cargill’s declaration that the prosecutor showed him a copy of a circular that the court intended to present to him, which inevitably biased the proceedings. Despite these improprieties, Mack failed to flag Cargill’s testimony as improper, and the prosecution’s case remained intact. The trial’s dubious handling extended to Benny Dance, another prosecution witness. While he received mail from the UNIA, he admitted that he did not always read the contents and could not confirm whether any letter from Garvey urged him to invest. Strangely, the envelope presented in court was empty. Nevertheless, in mail fraud cases, the mere existence of an envelope can be sufficient for conviction, even if its contents remain unknown. It is not impossible for the perpetrator to erroneously post an empty mail, so the existence of an envelope is stronger evidence. Despite these unfavorable circumstances, Garvey appealed his conviction. While the original case was marred by prosecutorial misconduct and judicial bias, the failure of Garvey’s appeal was due to the incompetence of his appellate attorneys. Legal scholar Justin Hansford argues that Garvey’s defense team pursued an ineffective strategy. Instead of emphasizing the lack of intent to defraud, they argued that there was no proof Garvey had used US mail to facilitate fraud. Hansford contends that this was a flawed approach, as they should have known that there was no need to identify the contents of the envelope to establish that Garvey proposed a scheme to defraud. Moreover, Garvey’s own trial testimony did not contradict the prosecution’s assertion that he had solicited investments via mail. By advancing weak arguments, Garvey’s attorneys effectively endorsed the prosecution’s case. Hansford even stated that it would have been nonsensical for the court to overturn his conviction based on the arguments they proposed. Undeniably, Garvey’s original case was imperfect, hence he applied for an appeal to rescind the conviction which was unsuccessful due to the incompetence of his attorneys. Furthermore, one of the judges presiding over the appeal was Justice Learned Hand, who criticized the activism of Justice Mack, so the charge of judicial misconduct is inapplicable in this case. Therefore, Biden’s pardon was unnecessary since Garvey appealed and failed in his second attempt to exonerate his name. Further, Garvey’s defenders often overlook his own awareness that the Black Star Line was poorly managed and undermined by corrupt staffers. While FBI infiltration and sabotage played a role, the BSL resembled a Ponzi scheme destined for collapse. Disgruntled employees even claimed that he purchased overpriced ships and later used the vessels for propagandistic purposes to the detriment of profit. Due to the precarious financial situation of Garvey’s enterprises, he resorted to diverting funds budgeted for financing the shipping line to sponsor the Negro World and other businesses. Strapped for cash, Garvey failed to pay employees on time and summarily dismissed accountants who exposed his financial practices. The opinion expressed by the appellate court echoes the sentiments of many who thought that Garvey preyed on naive people: The substance of the indictment is that, while there center around Garvey other associations or corporations for their object the uplift and enhancement of the negro race, the entire scheme of uplift was used to persuade Negroes for the most part to buy shares of stock in the Black Star Line at $5 per share, when the defendants well knew, notwithstanding florid representations...that said shares could never be worth $5 cash. Beyond his legal troubles, Garvey’s ideological framework warrants scrutiny. His philosophy emphasized black self-reliance, entrepreneurship, and the establishment of an independent African homeland. However, his views also contained troubling elements. As A. James Gregor notes in Black Nationalism and Neofascism, Garvey’s rhetoric and organizational methods bore striking similarities to European fascist movements. Garvey even described himself as a fascist and claimed that Mussolini borrowed ideas from him. Like European fascists, he viewed racial and tribal conflicts as inevitable and saw militarism as essential. He also believed that racial groups should always be prepared for battle and expecting to win such battles without industrializing was futile. Additionally, as a tribal thinker, Garvey opposed the multi-racial state. Garvey promoted the concept of racial homelands. Unlike liberals, he felt that Africa was for Africans, Europe was for Europeans, and America was built by white people for their descendants. Garvey’s vision for an independent black state was unapologetically nationalist and anti-integrationist which made him an opponent of the NAACP’s integrationist agenda. Another similarity between Garveyism and fascism is the primacy of the nation-state as an avenue for economic and social advancement. Both Garveyism and early fascism posited that individuals achieved personal fulfillment through the state. Likewise, these philosophies countered Marxism by envisioning a managed form of capitalism that served the interests of the nation-state. A deep preference for strong states ruled by elites who wield immense power is another area where these philosophies find common ground. Garvey’s ideal state is closer to Plato’s Republic or Singapore than to America. Additionally, to inculcate national pride, Garveyism and fascism rely on historical myths. Hence, it is unsurprising that Garvey often informed his followers that Africans were a creative race whose ideas were stolen by whites. Garvey’s eccentricity heightens when the parallels between Garveyism and Hitlerism are explored. Fascism is an identitarian, though not exclusively racist movement like Hitlerism. Hitler and Garvey implored their followers to espouse racial truths. Garvey preached that all issues should be assessed using a racial framework. He was so committed to race that he encouraged blacks to embellish facts for the benefit of the race, even lying was permitted. Paradoxically, Garvey admired the Jews but nevertheless argued that they were tribal people who could not be trusted. Despite antisemitic sentiments, Garvey criticized how they were treated by Hitler. Notwithstanding his distrust of Jews, Garvey theorized that anti-Jewish hatred was premised on envy. Indeed, he was a complicated character though it must be noted that Garvey never recanted his affinity for the generic ideas of Mussolini and Hitler, he only lambasted them when it seemed that their projects were antithetical to blacks. Garvey himself was an imperialist with plans to colonize the 'primitive tribes' of Africa, he only disliked the thought of Hitler and Mussolini colonizing blacks. Particularly controversial were Garvey’s interactions with the Ku Klux Klan. While ostensibly his dialogues with the Klan were pragmatic—rooted in a shared belief in racial separatism—they alienated many black leaders. Garvey and Klan members were natural allies because they preferred racial homelands. Klan members appreciated that Garvey was a racial separatist who wanted blacks to reside in their own state. Furthermore, contrary to popular narratives, Garvey was not a civil rights activist in the mold of Martin Luther King, Jr. or W.E.B. Du Bois. He did not advocate for racial integration or equality under a shared national identity. Quite appropriately, Garvey argued that blacks should create alternatives to white institutions, instead of depending on their benevolence. When Jim Crow laws irritated other blacks, Garvey remarked that Americans’ transportation infrastructure was built by whites for their consumption. Garvey was a conservative philosopher in the Western tradition with racist worldviews and thinking otherwise indicates delusion. Garvey’s legacy is also marred by violence within his movement. Thomas Lennon’s research indicates that UNIA members frequently resorted to attacking critics. In 1922, Cincinnati UNIA leader William Ware and three associates assaulted black educator Samuel Saxon for opposing Garvey. In 1923, Garvey’s African Legion member Charles Linous was imprisoned for making death threats during the trial. UNIA members were also accused of killing Garvey’s rivals, including Reverend James Eason, who had intended to testify against him and Laura Coffey. Garveyism is laced with negativities, however his work contains positive elements. Garvey’s emphasis on economic empowerment, professional development, and anti-corrupt leadership remains deeply relevant. While his racialist views appear problematic, his moral vision and entrepreneurial spirit inspire admiration. Despite being a black nationalist, Garvey was never afraid to tell blacks that other groups would continue to outperform them unless they improved themselves. Neither did he refrain from chastising them for expecting to get rich overnight, when entrepreneurial success requires years of hard work. While his flirtations with fascism and racial separatism merit scrutiny, his pioneering advocacy for black self-reliance and economic independence continues to resonate. Garvey’s legacy offers a roadmap for empowerment, leadership, and self-determination when stripped of its contentious elements.

The Party Is Over – OpEd	The Trump administration, pushed by the Department of Government Efficiency and deployed by the Office of Personnel Management, has sent another email to all federal employees with a normal request to present five tasks accomplished in the last week. It’s an easy task. It takes 5 minutes. In the service industry, this is entirely normal, even routine. Taking inventory of the workforce is standard for any new management in the private sector. Oddly, absolute mania broke out among the pundit class. Government unions are preparing lawsuits. The panic and frenzy is palpable. As it turns out, no new president has ever done anything like this before, no Democrat who believes in good government and no Republican who supposedly distrusts bureaucracy. Something dramatic has hit Washington. It’s about more than Trump. The party now in control of the US executive branch is a third party built out of the corpses of two existing parties. It goes by the name Republican but this is nearly a historical accident. The GOP was a vessel that was least protected against invasion and occupation. It has now been nearly taken over by outsiders who had little or no influence within the party a decade ago. Nearly all the top people now in power – including Trump of course but also Musk, Gabbard, Kennedy, Lutnick, and so many more, to say nothing of the voters themselves – are refugees from the Democratic Party. Coalitions have dramatically changed. Voting blocs have migrated. And policy debates and priorities are nothing like they have been in any period since the end of the Great War. The occupiers left a Democratic Party that was and is busy consuming itself with Rousseauian frenzies on issues about which most people do not care or are otherwise completely opposed. The legacy establishment of the Republican Party, however, never welcomed them in. They were hated and resisted at every step. The Kennedy Migration To understand the remarkable speed and trajectory of this creation of a third party within the structure of two, consider that it was not even two years ago when Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., was first contemplating running for president as a Democrat. The conditions were unique. He had gained an enormous following for his courage during Covid, standing up against the lockdowns, speaking out against the censorship and rights violations, and then decrying the imposition of shots that achieved nothing for public health. In 2023, President Biden was unpopular and not even credible as the chief executive, much less as a candidate for a second term. The thinking in the Kennedy camp at the time was that a run by Kennedy for the Democratic nomination would force an open primary and he could lead the party back to its roots, away from woke totalitarianism toward the political values of his father and uncle. In theory, all of this seemed plausible. His first rallies were crowded events, and the money poured in. Volunteers were signing up to work for the campaign. The first ads that appeared were nostalgic of a lost time, an America before the shattering of civic culture that came with the assassination of his uncle in 1963. The framing and even music of his campaign reflected such themes. If anyone could fix the Democrats, it was surely Kennedy with a lifetime of activism and experience in litigation against corporate capture of agencies, plus a recent campaign for human rights and free speech. The presumption here was that the Democrats had some base of support that still supported such values. And maybe that was right but his intentions ran headlong into the machinery of party leadership. His intention was to challenge Trump for the presidency, and the basis of the challenge was rather obvious. It was, after all, under Trump’s watch that the lockdowns began and the legal apparatus that led to the dangerous shots was deployed. It was Trump who kicked off the economic crisis with wave after wave of stimulus payments plus monetary expansion. As an empirical matter, he had presided over the worst invasion of rights of any president in history. That’s where matters stood only two years ago. When it became obvious that there would be no open primary, Kennedy was tempted by the lure of an independent run. The most immediate problem of gaining ballot access hit hard. The system, after all, is set up for two parties only and they want no competition unless such an effort works as a spoiler. That was not obvious with Kennedy – he drew equally from both sides – so everyone with power wanted him excluded. The other problem traces to the undeniable logic of winner-take-all elections. Under Duverger’s law, such contests tend to default to two choices only. This logic applies not just to politics but to all systems of voting. If you offer guests at a party the chance to vote on dinner, but the majority will prevail over the minority, everyone will immediately shift from voting for what they like toward voting against the food they hate the most. For some reason, this pattern of strategic voting is hardly mentioned in polite company but it is a reality in US politics. Voters select against the candidate they fear the most and for the person they believe can win to forestall the worst possible outcome. In the Kennedy case, then, it meant that no matter how much people loved him, they would end up supporting either Biden or Trump regardless. It so happened that over the summer, this logic was pressing itself heavily on the Kennedy campaign even as Trump faced astonishing levels of deep-state lawfare plus an assassination attempt, which conjured up deep family trauma in Kennedy. This provoked some discussions between the two that resulted in a historic realignment in politics. During these discussions, Trump was frank about what happened during the Covid period. He had been lied to by his bureaucracy, the experts who had been assigned to him to say that this virus was a bioweapon with possible cure in the form of a new vaccine. With great reluctance and only for a limited time did he approve what everyone, including family members and conservative pundits, was telling him to do. As for Warp Speed, Trump had always considered it to be an aggressive push for a solution. International and domestic sources named Hydroxychloroquine as a workable therapeutic, and so he ordered it for mass distribution. It was essentially inconceivable in those days that the deeper bureaucracy would not only remove it and other repurposed drugs from distribution but even generate fake studies warning against them, all in an effort to push the new pharmaceutical product. Trump was surely astonished to see these events unfold in a manner that he could not control. In that connection, both Trump and RFK, Jr. agreed on the dangers to American health from a variety of sources, including that emanating from the overuse of pharmaceuticals. Trump learned from Kennedy’s expertise on this matter, and they experienced a meeting of minds. And not only on this but on the evils of captured agencies, censorship, and deep state manipulation of public culture in general. They would never agree on issues of oil and gas, of course, but on that topic too Kennedy had been moved by the Covid years to reconsider the supposed science behind climate change, especially that which recommended more human suffering as a means of solving a supposed existential threat. We may never know the fullness of what took place over those two days but the discussions changed history, bringing together two mighty forces in American culture that had long been separated by party label and tribal identity: bourgeois nationalism vs. the haut bourgeois crunchy liberalism of the Whole Foods set. As it turned out, they had a common enemy. Now Kennedy is the new head of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration, which is now undertaking the largest attempt at routing the DC establishment since Andrew Jackson. His goal is to turn around the whole ship of state, industry, and science, away from fakery and industrial corruption emanating from a single focus on infectious disease toward a new focus on chronic disease with science-based and natural solutions. That is a herculean task. The Musk Migration Elon Musk is the third force within this leadership triumvirate of the new party. Before 2020, he was a politically conventional investor and entrepreneur. Mostly he associated with the default party of the elites, the Democrats. Then lockdowns came. He was the only major corporate leader in the US and probably anywhere in the industrialized world who publicly stood up in protest. He said he would sooner sleep on the floor of his factory than close it. He refused vaccine mandates in all his companies. He pulled Tesla out of California and moved it to Texas. He moved all his corporate registrations out of Delaware. By 2023, he was a changed man, newly aware of the threat of Leviathan, and did a deep dive into anti-statist literature. He faced his own family battles over woke ideology, and this made his intellectual transformation complete. He entered the political season with a new consciousness. Whereas he once regarded the bureaucracy as annoyingly necessary, he increasingly viewed it as the source of unchecked tyranny. At one level, the meetup of Trump and Musk – like the meetup of Trump and Kennedy – was completely implausible. Musk regarded his greatest achievement as a businessman as having made the most mighty contribution to clean energy yet, having broken up the automotive monopoly and mass-produced the first commercially viable electric car. Trump, on the other hand, had sworn to smash electric car subsidies and called for deregulation of oil and gas. To link up with Trump meant having to put at risk even the tax break for consumers of EVs. But he was ready for that simply because, like Kennedy, he became convinced that Western civilization itself was at risk from a woke Leviathan that had shown its teeth in the most brutal way during the Covid years. His reason for purchasing Twitter for $44 billion was to bust up the censorship cartel that was constructed to enforce lockdowns and promote the vaccine. Once having taken over, he discovered the extent of government control, uprooted it, and unleashed free speech on the US. Here again, Musk shared this concern with Kennedy and Trump. All three linked up on the crucial issues: the desperate need to curb and crush the power and reach of the administrative state. This is an issue that crosses left and right, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, and all other traditional categories. The Gabbard Migration In this connection, there was also the national security angle in which decades of neoconservative 'forever wars' had bred resentment and failure abroad, thus bringing over the articulate Tulsi Gabbard from the Democrats to Trump’s side, together with other influencers like Pete Hegseth who saw traditional military concerns having given way to woke ideology that Musk despised and Kennedy found to be deeply corrupting of traditional liberal concerns. Their interests dovetailed with the revolt against globalism generally, which had taken the form of endless unwinnable wars, unchecked spigots of foreign aid, taxpayer pillaging in the form of subsidies to international syndicates of NGOs and agencies, plus the cruel deployment of immigration as a tool of electoral manipulation. It was the immigration point that triggered the populist push for the new nationalism that gathered in new refugees from the antiwar sectors of the left and right. Donald Trump himself has undergone his own migration. An industrial mercantilist from his earliest public statements, he gradually absorbed a de facto anti-statism once his ill-fated first term was subverted from within and then he faced unprecedented lawfare and even assassination attempts to stop his second term. When he told the Libertarian Party that this lawfare made him a libertarian in spirit, he was being truthful. Once it became personal, the new head of state effectively turned against the state and all its works. These are all circuitous paths but they reached the point of having huge influence over the public mind in the wake of the Covid years that discredited existing elites and prepared the way for a completely new way of going about government and public life. Given the meme culture of our time, this new party went by various names, first MAGA and then MAHA and then DOGE (in homage to the meme coin that started as a joke and then became real). MAGA/MAHA/DOGE is not exactly the catchiest name for the new ruling party but it is far more accurate than Republican, much less Democrat. It is a new party formed out of the discredited shells of the two existing parties that lost public trust over decades of misrule culminating in an ill-fated attempt to master the exigencies of the microbial kingdom. In a Kuhnian sense, the collapse of the orthodox paradigm (rule by administrative agencies informed by captured science) was complete by 2023, preparing the way for the pre-paradigmatic coalition of these fascinating characters, backed by popular movements that are mirrored in many lands, and generally sailing under the flag of populism. And here is the crucial fact: these leaders have their reach, influence, and power because the causes they represent have come of age with a population completely fed up with misrule by experts. These are new and highly promising times, as the old undergoes a merciful dismantling and something entirely new takes its place. We find the roots of the ideology of the administrative state in the works of Woodrow Wilson, and it takes only a few minutes of reading his deluded fantasies of how science and compulsion would forge a better world to see that it was only a matter of time before the whole experiment was in tatters. It took more than a century but that day is finally here. The paradigm has shifted. For all the messiness and frenzy – including the chaos, confusion, and betrayals – our times at least present opportunity to reassert a foundational principle of the Enlightenment; namely that the people themselves should have some fluid and influential role in shaping the workings of the regime under which they are forced to live.

Now Is The Time For L.A. To End Single-Family Zoning – OpEd	By David Youngberg Los Angeles needs more housing. Now, more than ever. The fires that roared through the city in January 2025 were nothing short of devastating, with over 16,000 structures destroyed and an estimated 150,000 people displaced. In the wake of the disaster, victims scoured the still-hot wreckage for scraps of their former lives. The immensity of their loss was only dwarfed by its suddenness. And then there’s the rent. The mass destruction of homes exacerbated L.A.’s already pricey housing market. Rents substantially shot up, sometimes more than doubling. As is often the case in the aftermath of disaster, the public demanded that the government freeze prices. Disasters create the political will necessary to enact sweeping reforms, but rent control is the wrong approach because it discourages construction and causes more harm than good. Fortunately the city has not (yet) gone down this route. The California Coastal Commission is also waiving permit requirements to rebuild lost homes. But that will only return L.A. to the terrible housing market before the fires. The city should instead end single-family zoning so a better, more affordable city can rise out of the ashes. Supply and Demand Determine the Price of Housing Most people don’t know how the housing market works. The same people who understand that more cars will cut car prices and more grain will cut grain prices will flatly deny that more housing will cut housing prices. As Michael Munger once wrote, 'The mind…boggles.' It’s not as if landlords suddenly discovered money is good at precisely the same time a bunch of homes were destroyed. As 'price gougers' can 'take advantage' of people because there are so few options, they would have trouble 'getting away' with 'jacking up prices' if there were more options. If mass destruction increases the price of housing, mass creation will reduce it. The question becomes: How can L.A. radically increase its housing stock? Zoning Laws Choke Off Availability Even before the fires, Los Angeles was not a cheap place to live, with an average home price of just shy of a million dollars. Most of the price tag came from the land the house was on. This is how homes less than a thousand square feet can go for over half a million dollars. Multiple households on the same lot assuage the land cost burden. A 20-unit building on land worth half a million means each unit’s price goes up by $25,000. That’s not a trivial amount of money, but it’s far less than the unit’s construction costs. Unfortunately, in most of the places people want to live, it’s illegal for multiple households to live on the same land. Single-family zoning—one house per lot—means one family has to pay the entire price tag for the land, and the housing price is thus also high. Single-family zoning forces people to waste precious land. Single-family zoning is dreadfully common. Like in many places in the United States, areas where it’s illegal to build affordable housing dominate—an astonishing 75% of L.A.’s residential land is zoned for single-family homes. Before burnt-out housing drove up rents, unbuilt housing was the culprit. Single-family zoning isn’t the only reason there are so few places to live—parking requirements, historic districts, permitting processes, minimum lot sizes, and other barriers make it all worse—but ending single-family zoning is a great place to start rethinking the housing market. Chicago Rebuilt Better Destruction is terrible, but if you have to rebuild, rebuild thoughtfully. This is exactly what Chicago did after the Great Fire of 1871. Much like the L.A. fires, extremely dry weather and strong winds transformed a small flame into a city-consuming inferno. Chicago’s fire raged for 30 hours, destroying over 17,000 buildings and leaving a third of the population homeless. As in L.A., it was fueled by a forest of wooden homes. Chicago was too well-located to abandon, and investment poured in. Under new regulations that we’d consider common sense, the Great Rebuilding remade the Windy City. It’s no coincidence Chicago soon became home to the world’s first skyscraper, with its unburnable metal frame and massive windows (more sunlight meant fewer candles). More followed. The city rose like a phoenix, far surpassing its previous population and earning fame for its cutting-edge architecture. Los Angeles Can, Too As Chicago recognized it had too few regulations, L.A. should recognize it has too many. Now is a perfect opportunity to unmoor its residents from a system that drives up housing prices. Greater density may be a hard pill for Angelenos to swallow, but even the widespread adoption of the humble duplex would drastically increase the number of units without any increase in fire danger. Greater affordability will help combat homelessness and the fires that come with it. Los Angeles doesn’t have to take a radical position to make major progress. As L.A. residents rebuild and recover, let us hope they don’t miss the lesson: as mass destruction brought rents up, mass construction will bring rents down.

Iran: Factional Infighting Grips Regime As Economic Crisis Deepen...	With the expansion of protests in Iran and the social repercussions of the dire increase in prices and unsolvable imbalances, the regime’s internal crisis has reached a new stage. Regime president Masoud Pezeshkian, describing the dispute between the Minister of Energy and the Minister of Oil, referred to the proverb of a hard ground and butting bulls, saying: 'These ministers of ours sometimes fall short in the oil, electricity, and gas sectors, so they blame each other. We are really facing problems in electricity and gas supply right now. Reserves have also decreased; one won’t give, and the other won’t send reserves. And there’s no way to send reserves at all. The ground is hard; we can’t plow it, so we butt heads with each other' (state-run TV, February 13, 2025). The first days of Esfand (the last month in the Iranian calendar, corresponds to February 20 – March 20) and Bahman 30 (February 18) saw two consecutive sessions of the regime’s parliament (Majlis), where regime officials expressed fear of a 'revolution of the hungry' and the sinking of the regime’s ship. MP Qasem Ravanbakhsh, while admitting to the smoldering embers of poverty in society, said, 'These days, the bones of the people, especially the poor, are being crushed under the wheels of the government’s economic adjustment. In previous administrations, when the exchange rate increased, the government and parliament would think of a solution, but now that the dollar has reached over 900,000 rials and gold coins are over 70 million rials, and medicine, rice, legumes, meat, and essential goods have skyrocketed, no action is seen from the government to control it.' Javad Nikbin, another member of the parliament, while expressing concern about the explosive state of society and 'the events that are happening,' addressed the regime’s president, saying: 'These events happening in the country are not the result of sanctions but the result of your wrong decisions in foreign policy, elections, appointments, and all these areas… Twelve hours of motor-pump shutdowns a day means the farmer is ruined. Twelve hours of shutdowns a day means millions of farmers across the country are unemployed… Friends know, government officials know, Minister of Oil, Minister of Energy, know that the price of oil, gas, and electricity has increased by more than 1,500 percent from Mehr (September/October) to today…' MP Ahad Beitoteh, while warning about the deadly effects of the livelihood crisis for the regime, said, 'People are tired of empty promises… Unfortunately, in recent months, we have witnessed an unreasonable and uncontrollable increase in the prices of essential goods, especially items that have the greatest impact on people’s livelihoods… Minister of Economy! Mr. [Abdolnaser] Hemmati! You said that we would raise the Nima dollar (a subsidized exchange rate for importers) to lower the free market dollar price, but you broke the record for the speed of the dollar’s increase. After three months, you have made gold and foreign currency more than 50 percent more expensive. Medicine and essential goods have become more expensive; in less than three months, you have reduced people’s purchasing power by 50 percent…' Amid the factional infighting, Kamran Ghazanfari, a member of the parliament’s Internal Affairs Committee, announced that members of parliament had filed complaints against Pezeshkian and Mohammad Javad Zarif, Pezeshkian’s Vice President for Strategic Affairs, in the Administrative Justice Court and the Supreme Court of the regime. A significant number of members of parliament also demanded the impeachment of Pezeshkian’s Minister of Economy, Hemmati. MP Hamid Rasaee went a step further, saying, 'Do not impeach Mr. Hemmati. Prosecute him. This is the only way if you want to be honorable before history, before the people, prosecute Mr. Hemmati.' Finally, on February 19, Ahmad Naderi, a member of the parliament’s presiding board, said, 'The impeachment of the Minister of Economy has been submitted to the presiding board by the Economic Commission after necessary reviews, and therefore, with 91 signatures, it has been declared received, and the chairman of the session (Hamidreza Haji Babaei) announced March 2 as the day of impeachment.' In the same session, MP Mohammad Reza Sabaghian set aside politeness and, while warning about the sinking of the entire regime in the swamp of crises, said, 'What is the council of the heads of the three branches doing for critical issues?… Mr. Pezeshkian, you are also clinging to branches and leaves; you will also stop at the same station where previous governments stopped. Dear ones! Let’s not be polite; this ship is sinking. We will realize it when it goes underwater!'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ-6mFSNniVz8	2025-02-24T16:06:08-08:00	
Gaza’s Reconstruction Roadblock: The Unresolved Role Of Hamas – A...	By Kabir Taneja Gulf powers in the Middle East are locked in a sprint towards coming up with a viable plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and upkeep as President Donald Trump takes charge in Washington, and mobilises pressureby threatening a take-over of the strip by the US. Trump’s plan includes a 'relocation and resettlement of the population in Gaza to safer, neighbouring nations' such as Egypt and Jordan, and in return subsequently transforming the contentious piece of land into a 'riviera of the Middle East'. Trump’s quintessential take—viewing Gaza more as a real-estate problem than a deep-rooted geopolitical crisis, especially at the nucleus of many Middle Eastern fissures— has, if nothing else, forced Arab powers into an urgent huddle. The leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kuwait recently met in Riyadh to try and reinvigorate an Arab-led blueprint for the Palestinian crisis as Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza continues. How serious Trump is regarding his view of the displacement and reinstatement of a population is up for debate. But the relatively casual tone of narratives flowing in from the White House has certainly ruffled enough feathers to mobilise regional powers, ahead of the emergency Arab Summit in Cairo, Egypt on 4 March 2025, to further discuss Gaza’s reconstruction plan. However, the core issue in the Gaza context today is not simply reconstruction and rebuilding, but also the political future of the strip and the Palestinian cause. Questions about the political leadership of the Palestinians, beyond Hamas, remain critical. Currently, there is neither clarity, direction nor any movement to address this core conundrum. While Hamas has been dealt multiple blows over the past year and a half, including the planned assassination of its top leadership, it seems to be holding on to its influence despite Israel’s stated vision of eliminating the group. This is only coupled with the fact that any potential replacement of Hamas, at least in a public forum, has not been seriously discussed regionally. Replacing Hamas as both a political and military influence in Gaza will not be a simple endeavour even though the militant group itself is responsible for much of Gaza’s suffering. While Israel’s heavy-handedness in using disproportionate force since October 2023 has flattened Gaza into a nearly unrecognisable geography, Hamas is still quite functional. It recently clocked Public Relations (PR) wins on the sidelines of prisoner exchanges as part of the ceasefire agreement and a broader distinction of the idea of ‘resistance’ from ‘terror’ in many sections of public discourse. Its other sibling, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) during a recent visit to Iran added to the complexities as PIJ’s Chief Ziad al-Nakhala reaffirmed his commitment towards the 'path of resistance'. For the Arab powers, the path forward is undeniably fraught. The financial practicality behind Gaza’s reconstruction, in injecting both political and economic sponsorships, is not as difficult for several of these cash-rich states. However, to remould Palestinian politics to future-proof it against a military-first posture and simultaneously be cognizant of Israel’s security interests has multiple layers attached to it. The path forward would ideally demand both compromises and clarity from all parties involved, a task easier said than done. To begin with, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE may need to leverage their access with Iran in an institutional manner, aiming to ease Tehran’s support for Hamas, PIJ, and Hezbollah. Thereafter, Israel would have to be brought in, and at the very basic, its sovereignty-led security needs would have to be realistically addressed. Whether this translates into a two-state solution or not, remains the fundamental question. On paper, no other outcomes exist, and any other disruption in the status quo in all likeliness will not be a solution, but a bandaid at best. The underlying question now remains, whether a solution should be sought, or is the status-quo consolidating benefits to only a few, the preferred choice. The regional competition, which has benefited from the Palestinian flux, by working in a both short-term favourable capacity and often against regional players, including Arab states, will also have to deal with big power competition. This is an added spanner in the proverbial peace wheel. China has already thrown its support behind an Arab-led pro-Palestine two-state solution. Russia, however, is on the ropes. The overnight collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria not only dented Moscow’s political clout, but geographically, has also pushed it to the peripheries of the region whilst mediating with the new regime of Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus to regain control of its lost military bases on the country’s Mediterranean coast. Simultaneously, a Donald Trump–Vladimir Putin détente is not only putting Europe on the edge but Iran as well. Such a speculation is driven by Iran’s well-defined fears that its long-standing ally in Moscow could give America concessions for long-term strategic gain in the European continent in exchange for leverage over Tehran, particularly at the United Nations Security Council. In all the aforementioned kerfuffle, the future of Palestinian politics rests in a grey zone. Any attempt to dismantle the grip of Hamas Gaza would have to be a long-winded process. Militarily, an outright elimination may not be possible. Politically, subsuming Hamas into a broader Palestinian process is perhaps an even graver challenge, with the group’s penchant to fight even within the Palestinian systems to ensure its hegemony remains undeterred. Finally, the Arab world finds itself in a spot of bother. It ideally wants Hamas gone, but equally expects to not be held responsible for any long-term or even permanent displacement of the Palestinian people from Gaza. This is not only because of what may be the right thing to do from an Arab perspective, but also because any perception of their collusion over such an act could become a direct challenge to the leader’s authority, especially if the issue galvanises the street and public sentiment beyond a point. Envisioning the next four years, Trump is now imploring Europeans to think more deeply about their own security viz-a-viz Russia, and Arabs to take more responsibility for regional dynamics viz-a-viz Israel and Palestine. This disruption in particular, may not be entirely detrimental in the long run.

Centrist Coalition, More Debt: Merz Rushes To Lock In A Deal	By Jonathan Packroff and Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- Fresh off his election win, Friedrich Merz wasted no time on Monday, pushing to form a government with the Social Democrats that could unlock new security spending even before a new coalition is officially sealed. Merz’s Christian Democrats won Sunday’s German election with a big lead, but must now find a coalition partner. As expected beforehand, the party’s lead candidate quickly turned to the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of the incumbent Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, as his preferred partner. 'We will now be holding talks [with the SPD] over the next few days,' Merz told journalists at the CDU headquarters in Berlin on Monday, naming foreign and security policy, managing migration, and boosting Germany's industry as priority topics. Merz was due to talk to Lars Klingbeil, the SPD’s co-leader, the same day and added he would also speak to Scholz to coordinate during the transition. Klingbeil, who is by some accounts the party’s new figurehead as Scholz announced his imminent departure, played hard to get on Monday, saying it was not a given that the SPD would join a coalition. But he also added: 'We're ready to hold talks.' The election result leaves few other options for a stable, centrist government, as the centre was squeezed in Sunday’s ballot. The seat share of parties on the centre-left and centre-right dropped by a third compared to the last election in 2021. A coalition of the Greens and the CDU falls short of a majority, while the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) failed to re-enter parliament. The centre-right bloc would have a majority with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), but Merz again ruled out formal cooperation on Sunday. The centre's losses created an even more pressing headache for Merz regarding delivering on his Sunday night promise to bolster Germany’s defence and help make Europe independent of US protection and the erratic new president, Donald Trump. The necessary investment will be hard to fund within the boundaries of Germany’s strict constitutional debt rules. To reach NATO’s spending target of 2% alone, €95 billion annually would be needed as of 2028, according to Munich-based Ifo Institute – almost double the current defence budget. For a potential 3% target, €140 billion would be needed. But to change the constitution, a two-thirds majority is needed in the German parliament, which the centrist parties CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens narrowly failed to reach. Old rules are changing With the clock ticking, Berlin scrambled on Monday to avoid tying the hands of the new government before it takes office, which could usher in a rare and controversial move. The Greens suggested calling a snap Bundestag meeting within the next 30 days, while the parliament is officially still in session within the bounds of its previous composition, to allow for new debt and defence investment. Both Merz and Scholz signalled they were open to the approach. One option would be to agree to reform the ‘debt brake’, a constitutional deficit limit, that would increase fiscal leeway, including for defence. The debt brake, introduced in 2009, restricts structural public deficits to 0.35% of GDP, but has come under fire recently for stifling investment into infrastructure and Germany’s defence. Alternatively, the government could create an extra-budgetary special fund outside the limits of the debt brake, that can be adopted via a two-thirds majority. Such a special fund of €100 billion was created after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but will have dried up by 2027. Officially, the CDU aims to maintain the debt limit, but Merz signalled openness for reform during the campaign. The SPD, meanwhile, is in favour of reform, arguing previously that higher defence spending should not come at the expense of pensioners, the welfare state, or other public investment. Notably, Markus Söder, the leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), echoed those talking points on Monday, saying, 'It won't be possible to organise our defence by just cutting back everything' and causing 'social tension.' Merz could also opt for difficult negotiations with The Left in the new parliament. The far-left party has left the door open to jointly reform the debt brake but opposes higher defence spending. But given the perceived urgency of the situation and the squeeze of the centre, the old rules seem to be changing rapidly. Merz said his priority was to end the state of crisis in Germany and win back trust after a difficult three-year period. 'Some of you will share the view that this term could be one of the last chances to achieve this,' he told journalists.

The World Bank And IMF Await Elon Musk – OpEd	I think that Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have been misinformed. I don’t disagree with their shutting down USAID, but I think it’s rather small fry. There are much, much bigger fish to fry if you want to really save U.S. government money that is being wasted in programs that are mischievously justified as aid to the poor people of the world. Elon, hear me out: if you walk northwest from your headquarters at the Eisenhower Executive Building along Pennsylvania Avenue, you’ll come after one long block upon two ugly buildings squatting beside each other. One is the World Bank. The other is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). You can actually just walk in and demand to look at their books since they are extensions of the U.S. government. And you would have a very good reason to do so, since these are two of the most questionable and controversial institutions directly or indirectly funded with U.S. taxpayers’ money. Let me start with the World Bank, which is located at 1818 H St NW. This institution has so-called development projects throughout the Global South, otherwise known as developing countries. This agency says that its mission is to end poverty in the developing world. To fulfill this goal, its lending has risen from nearly $55 billion in 2015 to $117.5 billion in 2024. Yet, despite this massive increase, the Bank admits that global poverty reduction 'has slowed to a near standstill, with 2020-2030 set to be a lost decade.' Some 3.5 billion people, or 44 percent of the globe, remain poor, after decades of massive World Bank lending. And a major part of the reason is that World Bank programs have created poverty instead of alleviating it. Living in Luxury While 'Fighting Poverty' To manage its operations, the Bank’s full-time staff rose from nearly 12,000 in 2015 to over 13,000 in 2023. These figures are just the tip of the iceberg. If one includes all employees—permanent, non-permanent, contractual, part-time—throughout the world, the Bank employs close to 41,000 people. The vast majority, 26,000, or 63 percent, work out of the World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC, and only 3,200 are located in Africa, where most people in extreme poverty live. The Bank’s economists and top administrators are among the highest paid financial functionaries in the world, which explains the reason why the Bank is a major cause of the brain drain from developing countries: a great number of highly trained economists from developing countries prefer to work at the Bank instead of their home countries, with some going straight from Ivy League or British graduate schools to Washington, DC. Many within the Bank and the International Monetary Fund complain about the 'South Asian Mafia' that they claim controls employment opportunities for economists and higher-level staff in the two organizations. The World Bank has come under fire for the billions it has spent supporting fossil-fuel projects throughout the Third World that have contributed to global warming and to mega-dam projects that have displaced millions. The Bank, along with the Fund, has also gained notoriety for imposing 'structural adjustment' programs guided by the radical principles of the 'Washington Consensus' that are designed to promote globalization but have, instead, increased poverty and deepened inequality. The reason World Bank projects and programs don’t work or create exactly the opposite of their intended goals is because they are based on questionable propositions built on little or no empirical evidence. An assessment made a few years ago by an all-star team of renowned economists led by Princeton’s Angus Deaton, a recipient of the Nobel Prize for Economics, was damning: [The] panel had substantial criticisms of the way that the research was used to proselytize on behalf of Bank policy, often without taking a balanced view, and without expressing appropriate skepticism. Internal research that is favorable to Bank positions was given great prominence, and unfavorable research ignored. In these cases, we believe that there was a serious failure of checks and balances that should have separated advocacy and research. The panel endorses the right of the Bank to strongly defend and advocate its own policies. But when the Bank leadership selectively appeals to relatively new and untested research as hard evidence that thes preferred policies work, it lends unwarranted confidence to the Bank’s prescriptions. Placing fragile selected new research results on a pedestal invites later recrimination that undermines the credibility and usefulness of all Bank research. The Bank’s refusal to acknowledge real-world refutations of its pro-globalization advocacy and its unbalanced, one-sided research led to justifiable rejection of its advice by the people who were suffering from the policies it was implementing, confessed Paul Collier, head of the Bank’s Research Development Department of the Bank from 1998 to 2003: The profession has been unprofessional, fearful that any criticism would strengthen populism, so that little work has been done on the downsides of these different processes [of globalization]. Yet the downsides were apparent to ordinary citizens, and the effect of economists appearing to dismiss them has resulted in widespread refusal of people to listen to 'experts.' For my profession to re-establish credibility we must provide a more balanced analysis, in which the downsides are acknowledged and properly evaluated with a view to designing policy responses that address them. The profession may be better served by mea culpa than by further indignant defenses of globalization. Despite the high rate of failure of its lending programs acknowledged in internal World Bank assessments, the World Bank administrative budget that supports the high salaries of its economists and other high-level staff just keeps growing. The World Bank (IBRD/IDA) administrative budget was approved at $3.5 billion for FY25, a sizable rise from the $3.1 billion authorized for FY 2024, with no convincing reason at all. The IMF and the Art of Worsening Financial Crises The International Monetary Fund, whose address is 700 19th St NW, is the World Bank’s sister agency. It has a full-time staff of 3,100, supported by a budget of $1.5 billion. The IMF’s economists are paid even higher than those at the World Bank, and they evoke more fear, hatred, and contempt than the Bank. The IMF has an equally controversial history. It has a record of coming in to supposedly assist developing economies in crisis, only to make things worse. Its greatest debacle and scandal was its performance during the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-98, when the so-called 'tiger economies 'of the East and Southeast Asia were destabilized by the massive inflows and outflows of foreign portfolio investment. The Fund was heavily criticized on three counts. First, it had encouraged the governments of the region to eliminate capital controls, thus provoking uncontrolled capital flows. Second, it assembled multi-billion dollar 'rescue packages' that went to rescue not the people suffering from the crisis but to compensate the foreign financial speculators that had lost millions in dubious speculative ventures, thus encouraging 'moral hazard,' or irresponsible investing. Third, its measures to stabilize the damaged economies intensified the crisis, since instead of encouraging government spending to counteract the collapse of private sector, it told the governments to radically cut spending, leading to a 'procyclical' negative synergy that ended in deep recession. In just a few weeks, one million people in Thailand and 22 million in Indonesia fell below the poverty line. The only country that contained the crisis was Malaysia, which refused to follow the Fund’s dictates and imposed capital and currency controls So disastrous were the IMF’s interventions that George Schultz, President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of the Treasury, called for its abolition for encouraging moral hazard, and prominent economists like Jagdish Bhagwati and Jeffrey Sachs accused it of provoking global macroeconomic instability. Indeed, a rare conservative-liberal alliance in the U.S. Congress came within a hair’s breath of denying the IMF a $14.5 billion replenishment. Eventually, the Fund was forced to admit that the 'thrust of fiscal policy…turned out to be substantially different…because the original assumptions for economic growth, capital flows, and exchange rates…were proved drastically wrong.' But things were never the same again. The IMF was so reviled for its performance that Asian governments developed IMF-phobia, swearing never again to ask the IMF for rescue even in the most dire circumstances. For instance, after paying off what Thailand owed the IMF, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra declared the country 'liberated' from the Fund in 2004. Instead of learning from its debacle during the Asian Financial Crisis, the IMF stumbled into another fiasco more than a decade later, during the Global Financial Crisis. It allowed itself to be hijacked by Germany, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank to provide billions of public money to rescue German financial institutions and investors that had engaged in an orgy of irresponsible lending to Greece to the tune of 25 billion euros. To get the so-called rescue funds, the Greek government, like the Asian governments previously, was forced to adopt severe austerity measures that drove unemployment up to 28 percent and condemned the Greek economy to permanent stagnation, only to turn the money it was ostensibly receiving over to the German banks. Not surprisingly, so long as the IMF is there, the big international banks will assume that they will be bailed out for making irresponsible loans. The U.S. and the Bretton Woods Twins: Fiction and Fact There is a fiction that the IMF and World Bank are multilateral institutions that are owned by their many member governments. The reality is that the United States controls both institutions, with a 17.4 percent share of total quotas at the Fund and 15.8 per cent share of voting power at the Bank. These shares give the U.S. government a veto power over any policy change. But the truth is that U.S. power is not limited to its being able to veto policy decisions it does not like. No country would dare oppose a move by the United States to radically cut the administrative budgets (by, say, 75 percent initially) and the number of personnel in the two organizations (to 600 personnel each, as in the case of USAID) if it wanted to do so. All it needs to do to get its way is to threaten to withhold its contributions to the two organizations. I can guarantee that immediately the interest rate at which the Bank borrows in international capital markets would leap upward, paralyzing its lending operations. The IMF and the World Bank are monuments to misguided economic thinking and policies that have brought much misery to the peoples of the Global South. They are institutions that no longer serve any purpose except to perpetuate and enlarge themselves. If Elon Musk and Donald Trump are really serious about radically downsizing bloated bureaucracies, they could not have better targets than the Bretton Woods twins.

Trump Says Putin Ready To Accept European Peacekeepers	(RFE/RL) -- U.S. President Donald Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to accept European peacekeepers ahead of talks with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on ways to end the war in Ukraine. 'I have specifically asked him that question. He has no problem it,' Trump said, when asked by a reporter about Putin's position on the matter. Macron said European countries 'are ready and willing to provide' Ukraine with security guarantees 'which could perhaps include troops.' The French leader said any European forces sent to Ukraine would be there to 'maintain peace' and would not be placed along the front lines or become part of the conflict. Macron's visit to Washington comes on the third anniversary of the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion. He and Trump attended a virtual meeting with fellow leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) economies to discuss the war in Ukraine prior to holding one-on-one talks. The trip to Washington comes on a day of high-stakes diplomacy, where Macron's visit, along with a summit in Kyiv and a showdown over diplomatic language at the United Nations over how to refer to the war have laid bare Western divisions over how to end the war in Ukraine. Ahead of his trip, Macron said he would present a European action plan to help achieve a durable peace deal with solid security guarantees for Ukraine. During a press conference streamed on social media before departing for Washington, he said he would also present the case to Trump that how he handles Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine will either dissuade or embolden China, the United States' largest geopolitical competitor. 'You can't be weak in the face of President Putin. It's not you, it's not your trademark, it's not in your interest,' Macron said, outlining the argument he plans to make to the U.S. president. 'How can you then be credible in the face of China if you're weak in the face of Putin?' Addressing G7 leaders virtually, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he hoped to finish the war 'this year' as he appealed to Trump for continued U.S. support and argued for allowing Ukraine to join NATO, which the Trump administration opposes. 'If Ukraine remains outside NATO, it will be a much more expensive and complicated path for everyone because NATO provides the simplest and most cost-effective security guarantees,' the Ukrainian president said. Zelenskyy added that Kyiv is working 'productively' on an economic deal with Washington amid ongoing tense talks over U.S. access to Ukrainian mineral resources in exchange for continued aid.Trump has roiled America's traditional allies in Europe with his readiness to restart diplomatic ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, raising concerns that Europe -- and even Kyiv itself -- will be sidelined in the process.Macron's trip comes after Zelenskyy met with at least 13 foreign officials in Kyiv on February 24 -- with another two dozen or more joining online -- to discuss support for Ukraine in the face of questions over U.S. assistance. Those concerns -- which have expanded since U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia last week -- were borne out in comments from European governments at a summit in Kyiv where leaders looked to reaffirm their support for Ukraine. 'It is Russia that started this war,' German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said via video link. 'Russia may have gained an open ear in the White House but they have not gained an inch of legitimacy.' During the summit in Kyiv, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen vowed to 'speed up the delivery of weapons and ammunition' to Ukraine and announced 3.5 billion euros in new aid. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also promised 1 billion euros in new military support and equipment, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would contribute new military support and donate frozen Russian funds to Kyiv.The European Union also announced a new sanctions package against Russia and von der Leyen said Ukraine could join the bloc before 2030 if the country continues its reforms at their current speed and quality. 'President Trump has changed the global conversation over the last few weeks, and it has created an opportunity,' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told world leaders over video connection. 'If we want peace to endure, Ukraine must have a seat at the table, and any settlement must be based on a sovereign Ukraine backed up with strong security guarantees.' The prospect of a normalization of ties between Russia and the United States, Trump's stated desire to quickly end the war, and a public war of words between the U.S. president and Zelenskyy have worried European leaders and launched a wave of outreach to Washington. 'If you look at the messages that come from the U.S., then it's clear that the Russian narrative is there, very strongly represented,' Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, told reporters in Brussels. She is scheduled to travel to Washington on February 25 and meet with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Kallas will follow Macron in visiting Washington, and Starmer is also set to meet with Trump on February 27 at the White House. Polish President Andrzej Duda also met with Trump over the weekend. During a trip to Turkey on the war's anniversary, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow remains open to negotiations but its military campaign will only stop if the outcome is satisfactory to Russia. Lavrov added he believes many countries have become more 'realistic' in their position around the war and that the recent meeting in Saudi Arabia raised hopes of having normal dialogue between Moscow and Washington. Alongside Lavrov, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Turkey -- a NATO member that has previously helped broker agreements between Moscow and Kyiv -- was ready to host future peace talks on ending the war in Ukraine.In addition to unfolding Western divisions at the G7, a diplomatic battle over Ukraine is also taking place at the United Nations in New York City, where the United States has proposed a draft resolution that uses less critical language of Russia's full-scale invasion than a draft resolution put forward by the EU and Ukraine. The United States abstained during a vote at 193-member UN General Assembly on February 24, allowing the body to reaffirm Ukraine's territorial integrity and adopt a strongly worded resolution condemning Russia's invasion. But Washington also joined Russia in voting against a UN resolution from Ukraine and European countries that refers to 'the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation' and demanded that Russia immediately withdraw its forces.The 15-member UN Security Council is also set to vote on the same U.S. text. In order to be adopted, a council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by its permanent mebers: the United States, Russia, China, Britain, or France.In contrast, the General Assembly has no vetoes and despite being closely watched a way to gauge world opinion, its reoslutions are legally non-binding -- unlike those adopted by the Security Council.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQzxQzcghq1AP	2025-02-24T15:54:00-08:00	
US Threat To Cut Off Military Aid To Egypt And Jordan May Provoke...	President Donald Trump’s threat to cut off military aid to Egypt and Jordan—if they refuse to provide sanctuary to Palestinians removed from Gaza—is most likely to trigger protests from the US military-industrial complex, one of the most powerful lobbies in the US. Currently, Egypt and Jordan, along with Israel, are three of the major recipients of US military aid, including some of the world’s most advanced weapons systems, in the Middle East. This includes Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF), Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) and Excess Defense Articles (EDA). The EDA offers second-hand military equipment at reduced or at no cost to US allies. According to the State Department, U.S. assistance to Egypt has played a central role in Egypt’s economic and military development and in furthering the U.S.-Egypt strategic partnership and regional stability. Since 1978, the United States has provided Egypt with over $50 billion in military and $30 billion in economic assistance. Egypt is also a major security partner of the US and one of the largest recipients of US military aid in the region; it has the status of a 'Major Non-NATO Ally,' a designation under US law that provides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation, according to the State Department. Meanwhile, since 2015, the US has provided Jordan with $2.155 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF), which makes Jordan the third largest global recipient of FMF funds over that time period. In addition, the Department of Defense (DoD) has provided $327 million to the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF) under its '333 Authority', since 2018, making Jordan one of the largest recipients of this funding. Further, the United States has supported the Jordan Border Security Program, an integrated border security surveillance, detection, and interdiction system along 350 miles of Jordan’s land borders since 2009, at a cost of over $234 million, according to the State Department. Dr. Natalie J. Goldring, who represents the Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy in her work at the United Nations on conventional weapons and arms trade issues, told IDN one factor that has been given insufficient attention is the extent to which US defense contractors benefit from these military aid programs. For example, she pointed out, Egypt is required to use its military aid to buy weapons and services from US defense contractors. President Trump can threaten to cut off military aid to countries that don’t agree to accept large number of Palestinians who are removed from Gaza. 'It’s not clear that he can legally cut off military aid that has been appropriated by Congress. But even if he can, that would put him in direct conflict with US defense contractors, whose profits would be decreased as a result of these cuts,' Dr Goldring said. She said its’s difficult to know which of President Trump’s claims and threats are sincere. Is he sincere when he claims that the United States will take over Gaza and develop it? Is it mere rhetoric when he claims that Egypt and Jordan will take in the Palestinians whose homes were in the Gaza Strip? Or is this simply more of the bluster for which he is known? 'But in any case, his claims ignore the human rights of the Palestinian people – he consistently treats them as objects, rather than human beings with individual and collective rights. These proposals would also eliminate or at best severely undermine the prospects for a two-state solution for Palestinians and Israelis.' 'President Trump talks about Gaza as a real estate developer more than as a president. He emphasizes its desirable location, and describes its current condition as a ‘demolition site’. He never mentions that it’s the Israeli government that has reduced Gaza to rubble, and that US weapons have been and continue to be critically important in producing that devastation.' 'One enormous open question is what will happen with US foreign aid going forward. When Secretary of State Rubio described the US aid freeze (whose legality has not been established) he exempted military assistance to Israel and Egypt, but not Jordan,' said Dr Goldring. According to the State Department, total bilateral trade in goods between the United States and Egypt stood at $9.1 billion in 2021, the highest level ever. Egypt is the United States’ largest export market in Africa. U.S. exports to Egypt include wheat and corn, mineral fuel and oil, machinery, aircraft, and iron and steel products. U.S. imports from Egypt include apparel, natural gas and oil, fertilizers, textiles, and agricultural products. Under the Qualifying Industrial Zone agreement, the United States waives duties on imports from Egypt if the value includes 10.5% Israeli content; this program promotes stronger ties between the region’s peace partners. American firms are active in most sectors of the Egyptian economy, including oil and gas exploration and production, renewable energy technologies, financial services, manufacturing, construction, telecommunications and information technology, and the restaurant and hospitality industry. As for Jordan, the US has $4.47 billion in active government-to-government sales cases with Jordan under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system, according to the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. FMS sales notified to Congress and recent and significant prior sales include: F-16 Air Combat Training Center; UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter and related equipment; 700 Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems; F-16 weapons, munitions, ground vehicles, jet engines, and logistics support; High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), and other multiple rocket launch systems; 37 Meter Coastal Patrol Boats; as well as AMRAAM air-to-air and Javelin anti-tank missiles. Since 2016, the United States has also authorized the permanent export of over $697 million in defense articles to Jordan via the Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) process. The top categories of DCS to Jordan include: aircraft, fire control/night vision, and military electronics. Jordan was designated a Major Non-NATO ally in 1996, which provides Jordan with a number of benefits reserved to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and allied nations, including potential participation in cooperative research and development, priority delivery for Excess Defense Articles (EDA), and reciprocally-funded cooperative training. Since 2014, Jordan was authorized to receive three C-130H aircraft, MEI-23E Hawk missiles, cargo trucks, and one Intermediate Level Support Equipment Test Station via the EDA program.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQy6vLuj96nsM	2025-02-24T15:51:13-08:00	
China Conducts Live Fire Drills In Tonkin Gulf As Vietnam Draws S...	The Chinese military has announced a live-fire exercise in an area in the Gulf of Tonkin from Monday to Thursday this week, warning ships not to enter the zone. The warning came as Vietnam issued a formal map defining the baseline to demarcate its territory in the gulf. Though neither side linked their action to that of the other, it was unlikely to be a coincidence, some observers said. China’s exercise comes amid the latest wrangle between the neighbors over Vietnam’s island building in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea. A baseline under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, is the line that runs along the coast of a country, from which the extent of the territorial sea and other maritime zones is measured. In March 2024 China released its baseline in the northern part of the Gulf of Tonkin, deemed by analysts as 'excessive.' Radio Free Asia was the first media outlet to report in April 2024 that Vietnam was considering its own baseline amid concern that China may seek to expand its maritime zones. The Chinese baseline at some points encroaches about 50 nautical miles (93 kilometers) into international waters, according to analysts. The U.S. military, which promotes freedom of navigation across the world, criticized China’s baseline, saying it may provide a pretext for China to 'unlawfully impede navigational rights and freedoms guaranteed to all nations, including transit passage through the Hainan Strait.' Chinese drills not ‘a pure coincidence’ 'The establishment of the baseline in the Gulf of Tonkin aims to uphold Vietnam’s rights and obligations,' the Vietnamese foreign ministry said in a statement, 'It provides a robust legal basis for safeguarding and exercising Vietnam’s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction.' China has yet to comment on its neighbor’s announcement but some Vietnam watchers said China’s live-fire drills appeared to be a response to Vietnam’s baseline. 'Although the exercise area off northwest Hainan island is relatively far from Vietnam’s waters, the timing seems too close to be a pure coincidence,' said Song Phan, a maritime researcher. The new baseline that runs along Vietnam’s coast 'conforms strictly to UNCLOS unlike the Chinese baseline,' he said. Hanoi and Beijing in 2000 signed a Delimitation Agreement to demarcate their shares of the gulf from the mainland of Vietnam and China in the North to the mouth of the gulf in the South. The two countries, however, have yet to renegotiate a joint fishery cooperation agreement in the Gulf of Tonkin after the old one expired in 2020.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ5udE0KpbDHJ	2025-02-24T15:49:01-08:00	
Japan, Philippines Strengthen Defense Ties Amid ‘Increasingly Sev...	By Jason Gutierrez and Jojo Riñoza The defense chiefs of Japan and the Philippines agreed to boost bilateral military ties over mutual concerns driven by an 'increasingly severe' security situation in their respective territorial disputes with China. The two officials met amid a flurry of visits to Manila in recent days by foreign allies and new partners in broadened military cooperation with the Philippines. These included a visit by Adm. Samuel Paparo, the top U.S. military officer in the Pacific, and a port-of-call by the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle and its carrier group. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani arrived in Manila over the weekend, two months after the Philippine Senate ratified a new defense treaty with Tokyo, whose military forces had occupied the Philippines during World War II.'[Philippine Defense Gilberto Teodoro Jr.] and I firmly concurred that the security environment surrounding us is becoming increasingly severe and that it is necessary for the two countries as strategic partners to further enhance defense cooperation and collaboration in order to maintain peace and stability in Indo-Pacific amid such a situation,' Nakatani said during a joint press conference with Teodoro in Manila on Monday. Both Manila and Tokyo should 'deepen bilateral cooperation' with a sense of expediency, Nakatani said. Teodoro said Nakatani’s two-day trip was meant to advance bilateral defense engagements after the Philippines ratified the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA). It allows for larger-scale joint military drills and paves the way for military personnel to take part in security operations, including coordinated security patrols. The pact, however, still has to be ratified by the Japanese parliament before both nations 'get to the ground running at full speed,' Teodoro said. 'This meeting was an exchange of views on regional security issues on the Indo-Pacific, the situation in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and most importantly on our shared initiatives moving forward, not only on bilateral security enhancements, but also in promoting a sustainable, economically beneficial and defense-sustained defense industry partnership,' Teodoro said. Both Manila and Tokyo agreed to boost operational cooperation, start a strategic dialogue between 'high-level operational action officers' and deepen information sharing, Nakatani said. 'We also agreed to commence discussion between defense authorities on military information protection mechanisms,' he also said. Nakatani visited two key Philippine military sites in the north of Luzon, the main Philippine island, including Basa Air Base. Basa is one of the nine Philippine military bases under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between Manila and its long-time defense ally, Washington. First signed in 2014, the EDCA allows the U.S. military to build and operate facilities inside Philippine bases for use by American and Filipino forces. While the United States is barred from establishing permanent bases here, analysts said the pact has allowed some flexibility in cooperation – including the hosting of the Typhon mid-range missile system – raising strong protests from China. The EDCA supplemented the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement, which provides legal cover for large-scale joint military drills in the Philippines between the two long-time allies. Regional security concerns The Japanese minister’s trip to Manila came after the unprecedented visit of France’s lone nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and accompanying warships last week after the French navy ships took part in combat drills with Filipino forces in the South China Sea. The Charles De Gaulle, accompanied by three destroyers and an oil tanker, docked in Manila and in Subic Bay. In 2016, France and the Philippines signed a defense and security cooperation agreement, and have been building on it since. Adm. Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific command based in Hawaii, meanwhile met with Philippine officials in Manila last week. He was there to discuss regional security issues and underscore Washington’s commitment to the Philippine military 'to enhance maritime domain awareness and capacity building in order to counter illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities,' according to a statement from his office on Sunday. ‘Very timely juncture’ 'The visit by the Japanese defense minister is very important, coming at a very timely juncture, when the Philippines is engaged in outreach to like-minded partners,' said Don McLain Gill, a geopolitical analyst and lecturer at De La Salle University in Manila. 'The timing in fact is very important, especially after a series of provocations by China within the West Philippine Sea,' he told BenarNews, using Manila’s name for South China Sea waters within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. 'This is not just symbolic, but an opportunity to deepen or broaden the already strengthening Philippine-Japan security partnership.' Japan’s strategy is to signal its emergence as a 'major power broker' in the region, security analyst Chester Cabalza told BenarNews. 'Tokyo has felt the intensity of Beijing’s impounding presence in its own coastlines, and one way of reducing the tension is to ally with nations experiencing similar strategic territorial dilemmas with China,' said Cabalza, who heads International Development and Security Cooperation, a think-tank in Manila. Japan, unlike the Philippines, does not have territorial claims that overlap with China’s expansive ones in the South China Sea. But Tokyo has a separate dispute with Beijing over a group of uninhabited Senkaku Islands (also known as the Diaoyu Islands) in the East China Sea. 'Japan has to ink pacts with other middle powers in the region,' Cabalza said. 'By this way, China will be reprimanded to follow maritime rules-based order in the South China Sea.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ_hwhj6GpDnW	2025-02-24T15:47:15-08:00	
Ralph Nader: Stop Repeating The Vast Undercount Of Gazan Deaths; ...	Enough already of the media’s lazy indifference to the vast undercount of the Palestinian death toll from Netanyahu’s genocidal daily bombing and shelling of Gaza’s defenseless civilian population. I’m referring to all the media – the corporate media, the public media, and the independent media. They all stick with the Hamas Ministry of Health’s (MOH) count of named victims whose corpses have been identified by hospitals and mortuaries. For months there have been no operating hospitals and mortuaries to send their grisly data to the Health Ministry. The official Hamas count that all sides like to cite is now over 48,000 deaths. As American doctors back from Gaza before the Rafah closing last year said—just about everybody surviving in Gaza is sick, injured, or dying. They put the death estimate almost a year ago at a minimum of 95,000, not counting tens of thousands of families buried under the rubble when Israeli F-16s blew up entire apartment buildings. Why would all sides to this one-sided Israeli war of extermination rely on Hamas’ figures? Well, Hamas has an interest in low-balling the number of deaths to limit the rage of its inhabitants and allies abroad for not protecting the people of Gaza and not providing them with shelters. The Israeli super-hawks want to keep the undercount low to dampen down the international rage, boycotts, and demand for more sanctions and ICC prosecutions. The Biden administration and now the Trump regime also benefit from a low number. Here is the Washington Post’s esteemed foreign affairs editor Karen DeYoung’s reply on September 6, 2024 to my inquiry: 'We use the Gaza MOH [Ministry of Health] figures – as does the United Nations, World Health Organization and virtually every other humanitarian organization – while noting that independent media are not allowed to enter Gaza and the casualty counts are most certainly underreported… The Lancet [British Medical Journal] report notes that based on other ‘recent conflicts…it is not implausible to estimate’ that four times as many have died than those listed by the MOH…The time will come, I believe, when an independent accounting can be done.' But six months later the time still hasn’t come. The Biden State Department had a much higher estimate of deaths but refused to release their analysis, obstructing our Freedom of Information request filed last May 24, 2024. All kinds of estimates and projections by reputable universities, specialists, global health groups and UN agencies point to a much higher death and overall casualty toll. But the State Department won’t come forward with a reasonably estimated number that can replace Hamas’ statistical immolation. For example, in late 2023, the chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh—Professor Devi Sridhar—said that if the destruction continues, half a million Palestinians would die in 2024. The devastation has gotten worse—the bombings, the genocidal denial of 'food, water, medicine, electricity, fuel' in the omnicidal words of the high Israeli military officials, the spread of diseases, untreated injuries, babies born into the rubble, infants starved, lack of potable water, sick elderly without critical medicines, and more. This is the result of 110 thousand tons of bombs (Israeli admission) daily tank shelling and precise destructions. Yet neither she nor most other experts who have projected continuing mayhem have offered a number. Interestingly, the media has no trouble estimating the Syrian deaths at the hands of dictator Assad (500,000) nor the deaths in the wars in Sudan or Ukraine. Only the Palestinians, who are not allowed to live, don’t get the respect of having their deaths accurately estimated. One team of Gazan undertakers said they buried 17,000 bodies in mass graves by February 2024, including 800 in one day. Were the shoe on the other foot, Congress would not only have had intense public hearings: it would have declared war against Hamas. With total U.S. co-belligerency – from huge weapons supplies to the veto at the UN, Netanyahu gets away with blocking Israeli and all other reporters from going freely into Gaza, and shuts up those conscience-stricken Israeli soldiers who are sickened by what they were ordered to destroy. One of them said, 'I felt like, like, like a Nazi … it looked exactly like we were actually the Nazis and they were the Jews.' Some columnists in the U.S. like Charles Lane and Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post and Netanyahu’s mouthpiece, Bret Stephens of the New York Times, do not believe the Israeli military consciously targets civilians and civilian infrastructure. Israelis scoff at such naivete; many want more annihilation of all Palestinians whom they regard as 'subhuman,' 'vermin,' 'snakes,' or 'animals' (racist words from high Israeli politicians over the decades). Some 45 years ago, former UN Ambassador and Foreign Minister Abba Eban —under then Prime Minister Menachem Begin—wrote that Israel 'is wantonly inflicting every possible measure of death and anguish on civilian populations in a mood reminiscent of regimes which neither Mr. Begin nor I would dare to mention by name.' In August 2024, based on available historical, empirical, and clinical records, we estimated about 300,000 Palestinians had been killed. (See the August/September 2024 issue of the Capitol Hill Citizen). By now it is over 400,000. Yet the media still uses the figure by Hamas and ignores the lives blown apart under the killing fields in Gaza. At 400,000 and growing, far more Palestinians have been killed in Gaza than the combined total of deaths from Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Dresden in World War II. This week, Netanyahu dropped leaflets in Arabic signaling a forthcoming violent exclusion of Gaza’s trapped, unsheltered Palestinians from their homeland. More accurately estimated civilian casualties matters morally and for the intensity of the political, diplomatic, and civic resistance when the world learns the truer toll of death and injuries in this tiny enclave the geographical size of Philadelphia. To remind the world of the daily Israeli violations of settled international law inflicted on Gazans (also in the West Bank and Lebanon), international law practitioner Bruce Fein compiled this concise list: ISRAEL’S TEN VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL HUMANITARIAN LAW IN GAZA Genocide Count I. Killing Palestinians in Gaza. Genocide Count II. Deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Genocide Count III. Destroying hospitals and maternal care necessities intended to prevent births by Palestinian women in Gaza. Crimes against humanity. Extermination and persecution of 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza as part of a systematic attack directed at Palestinian civilians. Deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property for destruction. Failing to provide for the security and welfare of the inhabitants occupied by the Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza. Impeding delivery of humanitarian assistance. Forcible relocation of civilian population. Use of military force causing civilian casualties vastly disproportionate to the importance of any legitimate military objective. War of aggression against Gaza Palestinians.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ-JoQqQNI1GC	2025-02-24T15:45:31-08:00	
Pakistan: Terror Thrives In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – Analysis	By Tushar Ranjan Mohanty On February 23, 2025, Security Forces (SFs) killed seven Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists in two separate operations carried out in Daraban and Maddi areas of Dera Ismail Khan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). On February 21, 2025, six TTP terrorists were killed after SFs carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Karak District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). On February 17, 2025, SFs killed 30 terrorists during an IBO in Sararogha area of South Waziristan District, KP. A statement issued on February 18 from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area. On February 17, 2025, four soldiers were killed and five sustained injuries when the convoy of the Commandant of the Kurram Militia, Frontier Corps, was ambushed by unidentified armed attackers in the Manduri area of Kurram District, KP. On February 13, 2025, five terrorists including 'commander' Kharji Shah Gul alias Rohani were killed during an IBO conducted by SFs in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan District, KP. On February 13, 2025, five terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire during IBOs in the Dosali and Tappi areas of North Waziristan District, KP. On February 12, 2025, at least five terrorists were killed in SF's projectile strike, quadcopter, in Draban area of Dera Ismail Khan District in KP. On February 10, 2025, SFs killed five TTP terrorists during a late-night operation in Mir Kakam Banda area of Banda Daud Shah town in Karak District of KP. On February 6, 2025, at least 12 terrorists and one Army soldier were killed in an IBO in the Hassan Khel area of North Waziristan District, KP. On February 4, 2025, at least five SF personnel were killed while another six sustained injuries in a militant attack on the Raghzai security post in the Shaktoi area of North Waziristan District, KP. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), 346 terrorism-related fatalities, including 22 civilians, 63 SF personnel and 261 terrorists, have been reported in the current year, thus far (data till February 23, 2025) in KP. During the corresponding period of 2024, the province recorded 142 fatalities (41 civilians, 53 SF personnel and 48 terrorists). KP recorded a total of 1,363 fatalities (288 civilians, 421 SF personnel and 654 terrorists) in 487 incidents of killing in 2024, as against 941 such fatalities (205 civilians, 329 SF personnel, and 407 terrorists) in 312 such incidents in 2023, registering an increase of 44.84 per cent in overall fatalities. On year-on-year basis, overall fatalities have been on a continuous rise since 2020, with an increase from 130 (30 civilians, 69 SF personnel, and 31 terrorists) in 2019 to 216 (61 civilians, 57 SF personnel, and 98 terrorists) in 2020, 301 (72 civilians, 108 SF personnel, and 121 terrorists) in 2021 and further, to 527 (119 civilians, 173 SF personnel, and 235 terrorists) in 2022. Significantly, overall fatalities declined between 2014 and 2019, barring 2018, when they increased to 167, from 129 in 2017. Fatalities had fallen from 946 in 2013 to 607 in 2014, 298 in 2015, and 215 in 2016. Overall fatalities in 2024, at 1,363, are the highest in a year since 2009, when 5,883 fatalities were recorded in the province. Other parameters of violence also underlined a worsening security situation in the province in 2024. Total terrorism-linked incidents jumped sharply from 472 in 2023 to 702 in 2024, the highest since 2009, when there were 1,432 such incidents. The number of major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) increased from 84 in 2023 to 140 in 2024, the highest since 2009, when there were 341 such incidents; the resultant fatalities in such attacks also increased from 586 in 2023 to 891 in 2024. Similarly, KP accounted for an increased number of explosions, from 110 in 2023 to 142 in 2024 (the highest since 2013, when there were 198 such incidents), however, the resulting fatalities decreased from 296 to 207. Similarly, the province recorded a decreased number of suicide attacks from 28 in 2023 to 15 in 2024, the resultant fatalities in such attacks also decreased from 254 in 2023 to 93 in 2024. In the worst attack, on November 19, 2024, 12 SF personnel were killed when a suicide bomber rammed an explosive laden vehicle into the Mali Khel Check Post in the Bannu District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Six terrorists were also killed in the subsequent SF retaliation. Jabha Ansar al-Mahdi, a sub-group of Hafiz Gul Bahadur's faction of TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack. Of 38 Districts in KP, 28 recorded terrorism-related violence in 2024, as against 22 Districts in 2023, according to the SATP database. Of 38 Districts, 16 Districts registered terrorism-related incidents in 2022; 21 Districts in 2021; and19 Districts in 2020. The most violent District in 2024 was North Waziristan, with 271 fatalities, followed by South Waziristan (163 fatalities), Khyber (137 fatalities) and Kurram (126 fatalities). In 2023 as well, North Waziristan was the most violent District, with 151 fatalities, followed by Peshawar (122), Dera Ismail Khan (109) and South Waziristan (107). In 2022, again, North Waziristan District accounted for 177 fatalities, followed by Peshawar (87), Bannu (60) and Dera Ismail Khan (43). In 2021 again, Waziristan recorded the maximum of 106 fatalities, followed by South Waziristan (51), Peshawar (25) and Bajaur (22). In 2020, North Waziristan recorded 110 fatalities, followed by Peshawar (27) and South Waziristan (21). Compounding the rising trend in terrorism, is the flare-up of sectarian violence in Kurram District. Though sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslim groups is not a new phenomenon in Kurram District, but the renewed skirmishing in the district, commencing November 21, 2024, has so far taken over a hundred lives and drastically affected the day-to-day life of the region. On November 21, terrorists opened fire on a passenger convoy, in the Kurram District killing at least 43 persons and injuring 11. The convoy of around 200 vehicles, carrying Shia passengers between Peshawar and Parachinar, came under heavy gunfire in the densely populated Bagan town. Soon after the terrorist attack, clashes between Shias and Sunnis erupted in Kurram. The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23, resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 persons injured. Among the deceased, 16 were Sunni, while 66 belonged to the Shia community. By the time a ceasefire was imposed on December 1, a total 130 people had been killed and another 186 sustained injuries. The actual fatalities figure could be much higher, as media movement was strictly limited due to the imposition of a curfew by the Government. Despite the curfew and ceasefire, sporadic violence continues. The KP Government disclosed, on January 1, 2025, that both warring Shia and Sunni tribes in Kurram Districts finally signed a peace agreement after more than three weeks of efforts to broker a ceasefire. The seven-page peace agreement has 14 points to which both parties assented, along with the Grand Jirga members. The document stated that, keeping in view the post-merger realities, members of the Kurram Peace Committee and both sides would be bound to uphold the Muree Agreement of 2008 and all other agreements, for the benefit of locals and the establishment of peace. The Muree Agreement was brokered by the Government and signed by all the tribes on October 16, 2008, to stop the violent clashes during 2007-08. Under the agreement, the rival tribes deposited PKR 20 million with the local authorities as a guarantee that they would refrain from fighting. But the five-point Agreement, which covered all major issues, was never implemented. Tribesmen blamed a lack of interest on the part of the Government for this. Further, during the 2011 sectarian clash, an Aman Jirga (peace conclave) between Sunni and Shia tribes on February 3, 2011, signed an accord, known as 'Kurram accord' to end bloodshed between the two sects. The Kurram Accord is little more than a collection of recommendations and appeals to the Government of Pakistan, with no corresponding guarantees from the Government's side. The Accord appeals to the Government of Pakistan for support and necessary action for the repatriation of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and implementation of the Muree Agreement; and for approval of a special development package for Kurram to compensate for the losses the agency had suffered in violent clashes since 2007. It 'urged' both Shias and Sunnis to 'show restraint' and cooperate with the Government for peace, and called on the political administration and Security Forces to play their due roles to re-establish their writ in Kurram. However, despite the peace agreement, the warring groups never ceased their exchanges of fire. On January 16, 2025, 10 persons, including six drivers, two passengers and two soldiers, were killed in an attack on an aid convoy carrying essential goods to the sectarian violence-marred Kurram District, near the Bagan area of Kurram District. Six terrorists were killed in SF retaliation. At least 10 terrorists and four SF personnel also sustained injuries during the clash. On February 17, 2025, nine persons, including five SF personnel, a truck driver, a passer-by and two attackers, were killed, while another 15, including four drivers and one Police officer were injured, when an aid convoy, consisting of 64 vehicles, en-route to Parachinar, were attacked by unidentified terrorists in the Char Khail, Uchit Baghan and Mandori areas of Kurram District. The trucks were carrying food and other supplies under the supervision of SFs. Following the assault, more than 35 vehicles were trapped in the area, though nine vehicles reached Alizai safely, while 20 were sent back to Tull, with most of them stripped of their cargo. Though the Government and security agencies have been saying that the violence is between two warring sectarian groups over land disputes, there is a terrorist angel as well. Quoting the local people of Kurram, journalist Mushtaq Yousufzai noted, on December 30, 2024, that terrorists were targeting locals, not any religious group. 'They say militants are in the region,' he stated on the Aaj News programme News Insight with Amir Zia, 'When Peshawar-Parachinar Road was closed, upper Kurram peoples used the Afghanistan route or mountains tracks route. But now it seems they are besieged for more than 80 days.' When asked if the Government would be able to disarm people and shut down bunkers, the journalist added that the task was difficult, as the religious groups 'doubted' the government's intention. They believed that surrendering arms, which they insist were for their own defence, would make them more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Local people's apprehensions of terrorist attacks in Kurram are not unfounded, as the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) affiliated Al-Azaim Media's 35th 'Voice of Khorasan' (Pashto, 125 pages) editorial on December 14, 2024, called for Sunni youth to target Shias, criticizing the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Taliban for failing to defend Sunni Muslims in Kurram. It reiterated a call for lone wolf attacks, urging ISKP loyalists and others to act on its behalf in Kurram and beyond, while condemning the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), TTP, and the Taliban for 'abandoning' jihad, and for ties with the United Nations (UN). The surge in terrorism-related violence in the province can be attributed to three principal factors. First, the United States (US)-Western withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan. Second, the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on August 14, 2021. And finally, the collapse of 'official talks' between the Pakistan Government and the TTP on November 28, 2022. The spike in violence in KP in 2023 was foreseeable, when TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali, in the wake of the collapse of peace-talks, asked his fighters to resume attacks. When the US pulled its forces out from Afghanistan in 2021, it left behind around USD 7 billion worth of military equipment and weapons, including firearms, communications gear, and even armoured vehicles. The Afghan Taliban seized these weapons during the chaotic US withdrawal. On January 29, 2025, the Pakistan Foreign Office asserted that these advanced weapons have been an issue of profound concern for the safety and security of Pakistan and its citizens. The Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan issued a statement declaring, 'These weapons, left behind in the aftermath of the withdrawal of its troops in August 2021, have been used by terrorist organisations, including the TTP [Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan], to carry out terrorist attacks in Pakistan,' and further, that Pakistan has been 'repeatedly calling upon the de facto authorities in Kabul to take all necessary measures to ensure that these weapons do not fall into the wrong hands.' The FO statement came after US President Donald Trump's pledge to take back military equipment left behind in Afghanistan during troop withdrawal in 2021. However, the Taliban has reportedly refused to return any of the military equipment and urged the US to provide them with more advanced weapons to fight Daesh. On February 15, 2025, the 35th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team submitted to the United Nation Security Council (UNSC) revealed that the Afghan Taliban's continued support to TTP, despite Islamabad's increasing pressure to end backing of the outfit, was fuelling the group's escalating attacks in Pakistan. The scale of TTP's attacks in Pakistan has increased significantly, according to the report by the UNSC-formed monitoring team. The report, covering the period from July 1 to Dec 13, 2024, stated that the 'status and strength of TTP in Afghanistan had not changed', while the group intensified its assaults on Pakistan, conducting over 600 attacks during the reporting period, many launched from Afghan territory. It underscored that the Taliban continued to provide the outlawed TTP with logistical and operational space and financial support, bolstering the group's capacity to sustain its activities. Earlier on December 16, 2024, the KP Chief Minister (CM) Ali Amin Gandapur claimed that between 22,000 and 24,000 TTP members, had found safe haven in Afghanistan. Gandapur also claimed that an additional 16,000 to 18,000 TTP fighters were operating inside Pakistan. He acknowledged that Pakistan lacked the capacity to maintain law and order along its extensive border with Afghanistan. While the Afghan Taliban denied harbouring TTP members in Afghanistan, insisting they do not support the group, Gandapur argued that international legal constraints prevented Pakistan from pursuing TTP fighters across the Afghan border. He called on the Federal Government to engage in negotiations with the Afghan Taliban, adding that initiating talks was beyond the jurisdiction of his provincial administration. 'I am obligated to express my concerns about the deteriorating law-and-order situation because the people of my province are being killed by terrorism,' Gandapur stated. While the terrorists operating in the province were equipped with modern sophisticated weapons, including sniper rifles and thermal sensors, the provincial Police forces who stand on the first line of defence, remain ill-equipped. On October 1, 2024, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur chaired a high-level meeting in Peshawar to discuss peace and security in the province, particularly in the merged Districts of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and southern KP. To enhance the capabilities of the Police, 122 bulletproof vehicles were allocated to former FATA Districts, PKR 7 billion was provided for the Police in the merged districts, and PKR 1 billion was released for the purchase of Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs). Additionally, 1,300 Police positions were announced for the Tank and Lakki Marwat Districts in Southern KP. Further on December 1, Chief Minister Gandapur announced a slew of measures to strengthen the Police's Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) to fight off surging incidents of terrorism in the province. 'We are fighting an enemy that is better equipped and we have to level up at least to be able to overcome one of the biggest challenges of our lives,' Gandapur told a news conference soon after attending a detailed briefing at the CTD Headquarters at Police Lines in Peshawar. The package, totalling PKR one billion, included the purchase of high-tech drones, sniper rifles with thermal and night vision capabilities, high-tech kits and bombproof vehicles. Quoting the KP Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on December 31, 2024, The Express Tribune reported that the majority of terrorist attacks had been carried out in the southern Districts of the province, including Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Tank, Kohat, North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Khyber, Bajaur and Peshawar. The Express Tribune's sources within the KP CTD revealed that the Police had nearly abandoned the practice of patrolling outside the Police Stations after sunset in the southern Districts, where terrorist activities against both civilians and armed personnel were on the rise. Commenting on the deteriorating law-and-order situation in the province and tribal areas, Dr. Khurram Iqbal, an expert in security affairs and a PhD in Counter-Terrorism and Security from Australia, while talking to The Express Tribune, stated, The tug of war between the Federal and Provincial Governments had destabilized the maintenance of peace in the southern Districts of KP. In order to deal with the problem of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan's cross-border sanctuaries, both the Federal and Provincial Governments must take a united stand vis-a-vis Afghanistan for ensuring lasting peace'. Despite the Provincial Government's efforts, terrorism continues to thrive due to the lack of cooperation from both the Federal and Afghanistan Governments. Advocating dialogue to settle disputes on January 20, 2025, KP Chief Minister Gandapur declared that he would send a delegation to Afghanistan within two weeks to seek solutions to Pakistan-Afghan issues. 'The federal government talked about negotiations with Afghanistan over bilateral issues, but there's no success. Now, the dialogue with Kabul will be held at the provincial level. A delegation of our [KP] government will meet Afghan officials within two weeks.' However, Federal Minister for States and Frontier Regions, Kashmir Affairs, and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam asserted, on February 1, 2025, that negotiations with Afghanistan fell outside the provincial government's jurisdiction. While TTP and its affiliated groups wreak havoc in the province from Afghanistan, the failure of the Governments at the Centre and province, confer a degree of impunity on the terrorists, and can only further worsen the situation in KP in the days to come.

India: Troubled Borders In Arunachal Pradesh – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum On January 15, 2025, Police arrested one operative of United Tani Army (UTA) identified as Tana Hasi from Itanagar in Papum Pare District, for his suspected role in carrying out recruitment of operatives for the outfit. Inspector General of Police (IGP) (Law & Order) Chukhu Apa stated that Hasi, along with the self-styled 'chairman' of UTA, Anthony Doke, had been carrying out recruitment of youth for UTA using various platforms, including social media. On January 9, 2025, a gun battle erupted between Security Forces (SFs) and militants of the Yung Aung faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K-YA), at Longka village in the Changlang District. No casualties were reported from either side. On January 6, 2025, suspected NSCN-K-YA militants abducted two male workers from an illegal timber camp at the Longvi village of Changlang District, near the Indo-Myanmar border. The abduction of the two workers is believed to be related to ongoing extortion demands. These three insurgency-related incidents have been recorded in the State in 2025, thus far (data till February 23, 2025) According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), a single fatality was recorded in 2024 (data till February 23, 2025), where a cadre of NSCN-K-YA, identified as 'major' Gangjun Gangsa, was killed in a clash with the Assam Rifles in Longding District, on October 25. The NSCN-K-YA initiated the attack by firing at Assam Rifles personnel while they were moving from Wakka towards the Indo-Myanmar Border. In 2023, five (three terrorists, one civilian and one SF trooper) were killed in four separate incidents. Among the insurgents killed, one each belonged to the United Liberation Front of Asom - Independent (ULFA-I), the Niki Sumi-led faction of NSCN-K (NSCN-K-NS) and NSCN-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM). Since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data, a total of 245 fatalities (176 insurgents, 38 SFs and 31 civilians) have been recorded in the State. In 2025, one incident of arrest has been recorded, in which a UTA cadre (of January 15, above) was arrested in Papum Pare District. In 2024, a total of 23 insurgents were arrested in 11 separate incidents - NSCN-IM, 12; ULFA-I; eight and one each from NSCN-K-YA, NSCN-Unification (NSCN-U) and NSCN-K. In 2023, 39 insurgents were arrested in the State in 26 separate incidents -NSCN-K-YA, 20; ULFA-I, eight; NSCN-IM, six; NSCN-Reformation (NSCN-R) and NSCN-K, two each; NSCN-K-NS, one. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 749 insurgents have been arrested in the State. Four militants surrendered in 2024 in three separate incidents, including two from NSCN-U in Changlang District and one each from NSCN-K and ULFA-I in Tirap and Changlang Districts, respectively. In 2023, 24 insurgents surrendered in nine separate incidents: Eastern Naga National Government (ENNG), 15; NSCN-IM and ULFA-I, two each; and NSCN-K-YA, NSCN-R, NSCN-K, Eastern Naga National Organisation (ENNO) and NSCN-K-NS, one each. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 214 insurgents have surrendered in the State. As usual, the abduction and extortion campaign of militants, principally by NSCN-K-YA, in the state continued in 2024. Some of the incidents of such activities included: As reported on December 3, NSCN-K-YA issued a demand of INR 2 million from Oil India Limited (OIL), a prominent petroleum company operating in the Manabhum Reserve Forest in the Lohit District of Arunachal Pradesh. The extortion note was delivered to the company's office in the Manabhum Reserve Forest by a self-styled 'major' of NSCN-K-YA, identified as Tha Aung, and set a deadline of December 10, 2024, for the payment. OIL Spokesperson Prankush Malla Buzarbaruah accepted that the company had received the extortion note from the outfit. On November 24, two civilians, Vignesh Kumar Jha and Bishnu Chetry, were abducted by a 10-member heavily armed group of NSCN-K-YA from a bridge construction site located between the Pongchau and Konnu villages in Longding District. The group was led by NSCN-K-YA 'leader' Akham Konyak. On February 18, ten workers employed at the Finboro Coal Mine in Changlang District, were abducted because of the failure to comply to an extortion demand by suspected militants of NSCN-K-YA and ULFA-I. A group of seven armed militants held the workers at gunpoint and transported them in a dumper truck towards Old Longtoi, a remote location within Arunachal Pradesh. SFs later rescued seven out of 10 coal miners. ULFA-I, later, released the remaining three, identified as Gyan Thapa, Lekhan Bora and Chandan Narzari, on March 22, at Lalpul near Longvi in Nampong in Changlang District, which was disclosed by ULFA-I's 'spokesperson' Rumel Asom. The 'overflow' of insurgency in three districts, Tirap, Changlang, and Longding (TCL) located along the Indo-Myanmar border remains a concern. SAIRnoted, earlier, that the TCL region served as the 'axis' of conflict in the State. Activities of insurgent groups from other States, primarily Assam, Nagaland and Manipur, affect the TCL Districts of the State - all lying on the Indo-Myanmar border. Further, SAIR noted earlier, Arunachal Pradesh continues to be used as a transit route by various militant groups, whose camps are situated in the Sagaing Region of Myanmar. The TCL region recorded 189 fatalities (133 terrorists, 29 SF personnel and 27 civilians) out of the 245 fatalities in the State since March 2000. The nine districts which recorded fatalities since March 2000 are: Tirap (110 fatalities: 76 terrorists, 18 SF personnel and 16 civilians), Changlang (50 fatalities: 32 terrorists, 10 SF personnel, and eight civilians), Lohit (39 fatalities: 35 terrorists, three civilians and one trooper), Longding (29 fatalities: 25 terrorists, three civilians and one trooper), West Kameng (five SF personnel), Anjaw (one terrorist), Papum Pare (one civilian), Kurung Kumey (one SF trooper) and Namsai (one SF trooper). Meanwhile, Naga nationalism and the demand for a Naga sovereign State, Nagalim, which includes the Naga inhabited areas of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and some portions of Myanmar, play an important role in the Naga armed movement in Arunachal Pradesh. Significantly, on January 27, 2024, ENNG merged with NSCN-IM after a request by the 'president' of ENNG, Tosham Mossang, and its 'general secretary' Sompai Pongha, to NSCN-IM, on January 21, 2024. After the merger, on January 28, 2024, NSCN-IM's 'ministry of information and publicity' stated, In approaching the NSCN for merger, the ENNG 'president' and 'general secretary' stated that they sincerely support the Framework Agreement of August 3, 2015, signed on the basis of giving recognition to the sovereign right of Nagalim. With this merger they believe it will motivate the people of Tirap, Changlang and Longding (TCL) in Arunachal and allow them to get more involved and active towards the Naga national movement. Not surprisingly, on September 25, 2024, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) issued a notification under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) that the act has been extended for another six months in several regions of Arunachal Pradesh. The UMHA notification observed, Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts in Arunachal Pradesh and the areas falling within the jurisdiction of Namsai, Mahadevpur and Chowkham police stations in Namsai district of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering the State of Assam, are declared as 'disturbed area' under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, for a period of six months with effect from 01.10.2024, unless withdrawn earlier. In reviewing the security situation in the TCL region on February 17, 2025, Lieutenant General (Retd.) K.T. Parnaik, Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, emphasized the Government's responsibility and commitment to maintain peace in the TCL region. He also warned that any anti-national elements in the region would face 'severe consequences', and reiterated that citizens of the State would be protected from 'outside influence and intimidation.' Further, he highlighted the strategic significance of border security and the initiation of necessary steps to protect the interests of the nation and welfare of citizens residing in the border areas. At the end of 2024, a new insurgent outfit, the United Tani Army (UTA), released several videos of its training camps, which was made available by its 'chairman' Anthony Doke (the 'chief' of the short-lived National Socialist Council of Taniland) on December 31. The videos demonstrated the presence of weapons and operatives in the camps, though the location of the camps remained unknown. In an interview, Doke alleged that the Government of India did not care about the areas inhabited by the Tani tribes and that he would later present a 'detailed plan' for his group. An unnamed official disclosed that Doke was based in Myanmar, and that 'the camps shown in the videos look likely to be that of the NSCN (K-YA). He is trying to revive the UTA with the help of Naga militants.' On January 17, 2025, after the arrest of UTA cadre and main recruiter Tana Hasi, on January 15, 2025, the Arunachal Police asked the UTA cadres to return to the mainstream. The Police stated, Return voluntarily to your families and communities. No legal action will be taken against you if you come forward on your own. We understand that many of you may have been misled or pressured into joining. If you step back now, we will provide you with support to reintegrate into society and pursue a better future. The immediate response of Government agencies has undermined the emergence of new insurgent group in the State. However, constant disturbances by banned organisations operating in India's Northeast remain a challenge in Arunachal State. Given the State's strategic location for insurgent groups operating in the region along the Indo-Myanmar border, militant groups continue to exploit the region's vulnerabilities in pursuit of their goals and agendas.

Hegseth Welcomes Saudi Defense Minister To Pentagon, Underscores ...	By Matthew Olay US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Monday highlighted the importance of the partnership between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia while hosting that country's defense minister during a bilateral engagement at the Pentagon. After formally welcoming Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud and his delegation, both men delivered prepared remarks in the secretary's office. 'As you know, [President Donald J. Trump has] made clear in his administration [that] we're going to pursue peace through strength and put America first,' Hegseth said. 'But that does not mean ignoring partnerships; and, in fact, it requires greater attention to the ones that matter most,' he continued, adding that the U.S. partnership with Saudi Arabia 'matters a great deal.' Referencing the cooperation that took place between the countries during Trump's first administration, Hegseth pointed out that both nations worked together to pursue security and stability in the Middle East, as well as to combat terrorism in the region and increase mutual prosperity. He also highlighted the long-standing cooperation between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, noting that it dates back 80 years to when President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with Saudi King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud on the U.S. Navy cruiser USS Quincy. 'Since then, we've worked to take on terrorism and all its manifestations today, with groups like the Houthis,' Hegseth said. 'Today, our relationship is a critical center of gravity in a very turbulent world,' he added. Stating that ending the war in Ukraine is one of the president's top priorities, Hegseth said he wanted to thank the Saudi Kingdom for hosting conversations between top U.S. and Russian officials in Riyadh, Feb. 18, 2025. 'And I also want to continue deepening and strengthening our partnership to pursue security and prosperity for both Americans and Saudis. So, I'm very much looking forward to a great discussion,' Hegseth said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ0US5weGHdGT	2025-02-24T15:38:30-08:00	
Gloominess And Magical Thinking: The Comical, Frightening Mike Bu...	Never allow intelligence chiefs to speak publicly. Their prerogative lies in lying, their reassurance, cool deception. While the attractions of transparency are powerful, the result of a garrulous spook is always going to be unreliable. In Australia, a comically looking individual by the name of Mike Burgess terrorises and terrifies the local populace as head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the domestic spy agency. It will surprise no one familiar with this approach that it resembles several that have come before. Keep them frightened, soften them for the next encroaching round, and await ever larger budgets for the already fattened calf known as the national security state. In his 2025 threat assessment, the chief tries to be bracingly calm and reassuring, even as he delivers the frightening blows. 'Fortunately, I was born with the glass-half-full gene.' He tells us the agency is 'always looking ahead', which is encouraging. Prior to making that point, he says that he had 'focused on past and present threats.' With pointless contradiction assured, the theme is set for clotting clichés, grammatical torments and trying formulations. 'This year’s Assessment is future focused. And I think it’s fair to say it’s the most significant, serious and sober address so far.' Those wishing to waste their unrecoverable time listening to the address then realise that the agency has become a victim of public relations capture and trend shopping. Sections have been created that would make your run of the mill moronic university manager sigh. There is, for instance, a 'Futures Team' (think 'Future Fellows' or 'Deans of the Future' – their reality is never the now but always deferred) that supposedly 'pours over classified intelligence, reviews open source information, consults experts and uses structured analytical techniques to develop in-depth assessments about future trajectories and vulnerabilities.' The only thing missing from this froth is the use of artificial intelligence (appropriate for ASIO), which is bound to do the job as competently as any in the 'Futures Team'. For all we know, this is already being done, the machine component triumphant, the human minds lazily tempted. The predictable banalities follow in the Burgess show. 'Australia has entered a period of strategic surprise and security fragility.' If so, Australia has been entering for a very lengthy period, given the number of addresses Burgess has given. Like an academic who rises to the top on the strength of one idea and one paper eternally rewritten, the director can be relied upon to bore with ideas that have come before, ribboned and stringed for effect. 'Over the next five years, a complex, challenging and changing security environment will become more dynamic, more diverse and more degraded.' The Australian public, it would seem, is not playing along with the authorities. How dare they question and debate the norms they have been told are so sacred to servile stability? 'Social cohesion' – a vacuous term – is apparently eroding. Institutions are no longer trusted, while intolerance grows. Truth is being assailed (Burgess is a true comic as spy chief), 'undermined by conspiracy, mis- and disinformation.' For an entity that specialises in all three, this is fabulously funny. The terrifying world, it would seem, is replete with 'multifaceted, merging, intersecting, concurrent and cascading threats.' He is concerned 'about young Australians being caught up in webs of hate, both religiously and ideologically motivated'. There is a sense that individuals are seeking 'hybrid beliefs', cherry-picked from a garden of tempting varieties. Environmentalists of the left commune with Hitler in their beliefs. Islamic State propaganda converses with neo-Nazi dogma. Students of history will hardly find these couplings odd, but looking ahead will do that to you. In terms of concrete threats, one is singled out as numinous. One can only cringe at the identification of what Burgess calls 'the A-team'. This mysterious 'Australia team' is supposedly dedicated to combing 'professional networking sites for Australians with access to privileged information, and then use false, anglicised personas to approach their targets.' Their targets are offered 'consulting opportunities' and generous sums for reporting on Australian trade, politics, economics, foreign policy, defence and security. This does really sound like money poorly spent by the 'A-team', but who are we to judge? Some people are evidently living it up. Magical thinking also figures in domestic spy land. We find that questioning the imbecilic foreign policy decision by Australian governments to purchase and construct fantasy nuclear-propelled submarines as servitors of the US empire is bound to be the product of 'foreign interference'. The agency 'has identified foreign services seeking to target AUKUS to position themselves to collect the capabilities, how Australia intends to use them, and to undermine the confidence of our allies.' In his 2024 address, Burgess quotes the words of Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley to the Australian Parliament after establishing ASIO: 'It is not usual to discuss the detailed activities of a security service. Much of the value of such a service lies in the fact that it works quietly. Members of the organisation should not be unduly prominent at cocktail parties, but should devote themselves to the tasks allotted to them.' Burgess, ever the funny man, then takes a stab at humour, claiming to be more permissive than the former Australian PM: 'given the work my people do, I would never begrudge them the odd cocktail party now and then'. If only his agents, and Burgess, spent more time at such events and less time babbling on the stage, we would all be better off.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfSJJxO_OODQ7CcQg_Pp1zJ	2025-02-24T15:35:45-08:00	
Kremlin’s Militarization Of Russia’s Youngest Has Far-Reaching Co...	Russian educational institutions, especially kindergartens and early childhood education, have been militarized since the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The regular use of army songs, posters, and guns in the curriculum to promote military values and the employment of returning veterans as instructors now dominate the kindergartens and early grades of Russian schools (Govorit Nemoskva, February 17). Many Russian parents and outside observers dismiss this as a passing phase. They believe that children who are now being subject to pro-war propaganda in kindergartens and the early grades will not be affected for very long and will adopt different positions when they grow older. Aleksandra Arkhipova, an independent Russian anthropologist, however, argues that a landmark study of the impact of anti-Semitic propaganda in Nazi-era German schools suggests otherwise (Voigtländer, Nico and Hans-Joachim Voth, 'Nazi indoctrination and anti-Semitic beliefs in Germany,' PNASVol. 112, No. 26 (June 2015): 7931-7036). Arkhipova believes that what is happening in Russian early childhood educational institutions now is likely to cast a dark shadow on the future. The children now passing through these schools are disposed to support militarism and aggression long into the future, serving as an important base of support for those in the Kremlin now and decades hence who want to pursue such policies (Telegram/anthro_fun, reposted at Echo fm, February 7; Telegram/anthro_fun, February 7, reposted at Echo fm, February 8). The German study to which Arkhipova refers found through the use of surveys that Germans who were subjected to anti-Semitic messaging in schools during Nazi times were far more likely to remain anti-Semitic decades later than those born either earlier or later and not having had that experience (Voigtländer, Nico and Hans-Joachim Voth, 'Nazi indoctrination and anti-Semitic beliefs in Germany,' PNAS Vol. 112, No. 26 (June 2015):7931-7036). This finding strongly suggests, Arkhipova continues, that the same pattern will hold with Russian children who are now being subjected to pro-war propaganda and are likely to remain more pro-war than those older or younger and thus form an important reservoir of support for aggressive and pro-war Kremlin policymakers long into the future. Unsurprisingly, Arkhipova’s posts have attracted widespread attention among Russians in particular because they challenge the assumptions and hopes many in that country have about a post-Putin Russia. Additionally, unlike in the case of Germany, there is virtually no chance that Russia will suffer the overwhelming defeat and occupation that transformed German society after 1945. This transformation helped to reduce to a minimum the ideas promoted by the Nazis in kindergartens and schools. Some Russians fear, although may seldom feel free to say, that if there is no such imposed transformation in Russia, the militarist and aggressive policies Putin has implemented will continue. These policies will enjoy the support of the rising generation, in whom many placed their hopes to create a better Russia. One Russian observer who has given particular attention to Arkhipova’s argument and the evolving state of Russian national identity is Vladimir Pastukhov, a Russian scholar now based in London. In a telegram channel post picked up by Russian internet portals, Pastukhov says that Arkhipova’s argument has prompted him to think 'about the evolution that Russian society has undergone over the forty years of post-communism … from ‘new Russians’ to ‘other Russians’' (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8, reposted at Echo fm, February 9). Pastukhov’s argument extends the one posited by Arkhipova by expecting a very different Russia than the one others like him have lived through or hoped for since the end of the Soviet system. Since Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Pastukhov says, many commentators have focused on the way in which the war has become an important part of the genesis of a new Ukrainian nation. Few, however, have focused on how it is playing an analogous function for the Russian nation (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). He continues that for the reasons Arkhipova proposes as well as broader ones, it seems almost certain that 'a completely different Russian society will emerge from the war than the one which entered it' (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). Russia’s war against Ukraine marks 'the end of the history of post-communism with its ‘new Russians’ and the beginning of a fundamentally different era … the main character of which will be ‘the other Russian’' (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). This represents, Pastukhov says, the latest round of nation-building in Russia, extending the argument of others that the tragedy of Russia is that the country became an empire before the people became a nation (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). Therefore, it has little chance to become a nation-state and every chance to remain a people defined by the retention and pursuit of empire (Asia Russia Daily, January 12, 2015; Gorod 812, December 14, 2020; Svoboda, March 2, 2024). It is a contested issue, with the opposition hoping for one kind of Russian nation and the Kremlin hoping for a very different one. This struggle has not, however, attracted as much attention as it deserves, the London-based Russian analyst says. While many in Russia and the West are more than willing to suggest that Ukraine does not exist as a nation, very few are prepared to recognize that Russia is not a nation, in the modern sense. Russia’s attachment to the state and the idea of imperial expansion reflects that reality (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). According to Pastukhov, the Kremlin has a better understanding of this reality than its opponents (Telegram/v_pastukhov, February 8). It is actively working to institutionalize itself by shaping the youngest members of society as Arkhipova suggests, anticipating to 'mold golems from ‘the inhabitants’ in the hope of sitting out ‘behind the battlements’ for the time required for the golems to begin to speak' (Telegram/anthro_fun, February 7). In the meantime, this rising generation will be far more likely to speak positively of the Kremlin than promote the formation of a democratic Russian nation at peace with itself and its neighbors. The danger of that negative outcome, again as Arkhipova indicates, is likely to remain in place far longer than Putin himself (Telegram/anthro_fun, February 7).

Twenty Five Years Of Vladimir Putin – Analysis	By Ajay Kamalakaran On the evening of December 31, 1999, few in Russia knew what its first president was going to say in a recorded televised speech. The country, which was still in the financial doldrums because of its debt default, watched as Boris Yeltsin resigned. 'We are creating a vital precedent of a civilized and voluntary transfer of presidential power to a newly elected president,' Yeltsin said[1]. And yet, I have taken a different decision: I am leaving before the end of my term.' He added, 'In accordance with the Constitution, I have signed a decree giving the powers of president of Russia to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. He will be the head of state for three months, after which presidential elections will be held, also in accordance with the Constitution.' From the beginning of the new millennium, Putin has been Russia’s undisputed leader, serving as president for the entire period, except from 2008 to 2012, when he was prime minister to avoid violating the then two-term constitutional limit for the country’s highest office. In 1999, when Putin was handed over the reins of power, the country’s GDP was $1,331[2] per capita. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook estimates[3] that in 2025, this number will touch $16,077 or, and $48,957 on a PPP basis. For Russia watchers who have been living in and observing the country for the last two decades, it is hard not to notice the incredible changes that it has witnessed in this time period. At the beginning of Putin’s presidency, Russia looked like a former empire in decline – crumbling infrastructure, rampant alcoholism, street crime, often violent, extremist political movements and general disenchantment. In the Putin era, Russian cities have undergone a dramatic revival, turning into clean, restored, efficient and beautified urban spaces with expanded and safe multi-modal public transport. The development has spread far beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg. For instance, the East Asian city of Vladivostok was chosen as the host[4] of the APEC Summit. Two new suspension bridges were built to link the city to outlying areas, and its main university was expanded to accommodate a growing number of foreign students from countries such as India. Sochi, the Black Sea resort city, got a much-needed makeover in time for the 2014 Winter Olympics[5]. Foreign media was quick to point out flaws in Russia’s organisation of the sporting event, prompting Putin to take personal care to ensure that the 2018 FIFA World Cup, hosted across Russian cities, became the gold standard. It was during this event that football fans from across the world got a chance to see – and fall in love with – contemporary Russia. The urban revival has stretched to second and third tier, distant cities that for decades lacked Moscow’s attention. One such is Astrakhan[6], which is close to the Caspian Sea and an important part of the International North South Transport Corridor. The rural areas of Russia have not witnessed the kind of large-scale transformation as have its cities. Nearly a quarter of the population[7] of the country lives in rural areas. Over the last decade, the government has increasingly shifted its focus on the countryside, given the growing need for food security in a sanctioned world. In 2024, $144 million was allotted[8] by the government for preferential lending programs aimed at improving housing, transportation and living standards in rural Russia. However, inequality in Russia is relatively low: Russia’s Gini coefficient, a measure that represents income, wealth and consumption inequality in 2021 was 35.1[9], suggesting a moderate level of inequality. On foreign policy, the early years of Putin’s presidency were marked with attempts to build trust and ties with the West. His personal friendship with then German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder paved the way for the construction of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The Russian President also enjoyed warm ties with George W. Bush, who was one of 50 heads of state at the World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow. Bush was joined by French President Jacques Chirac, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and India’s Manmohan Singh. In the early 2000s, Russia and NATO were increasingly looking at boosting cooperation, forming the NATO-Russia Council[10] in 2002. This was termed 'a consultation, consensus-building, cooperation, joint decision making and joint action,' where individual NATO member states and Russia worked 'as equal partners on a wide spectrum of security issues of common interest.' Russia’s critical interests were attacked during the Barack Obama administration when American officials aggressively pursued a regime-change in Kiev. In 2013, the US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Victoria Nuland openly admitted[11] at the US-Ukraine Foundation Conference that Washington was sponsoring the events at the Maidan in Kiev that would eventually lead to a coup and the installation of a US-friendly regime[12]. Washington’s increased interference in Ukraine after the 2014 coup, and persistent meddling in other former Soviet republics like Georgia killed any hopes of this Council achieving any of the goals it had set out. While reaching out to the West, Putin made it a cornerstone of his foreign policy to simultaneously revive sagging ties with India and to remove mistrust with China. It was under the leadership of Putin and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that India and Russia signed the Declaration[13] of Strategic Partnership, and began the exercise of holding annual summits. Top-level meetings are also held annually under the Indo-Russian Inter-Governmental Commission (IRIGC) mechanism. One of Putin’s greatest foreign policy successes was the final settlement of the Russia-China boundary dispute. In 2004, the countries signed the Complementary Agreement[14] on the Eastern Section of the Russia-China Boundary. As a part of the agreement, Russia handed over half of the Tarabarov (Yinlong) Island, as well as the Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island and a few islets on the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers. The countries, which share a 4,209-kilometre border, now have more than 160 functional border crossings. The relationships built by Putin with China and India were crucial for the balanced positions the countries took when Crimea became a part of Russia. The Asian giants also refused to join Western sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of the Ukraine crisis. While the country’s isolation from the West has been irksome for some members of the political, bureaucratic and business elite, Moscow has offset this partially with its growing ties with Asia through setups like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and other emerging powers through BRICS and BRICS-plus. In an ideal world, Russia would enjoy the kind of relations with the West it did in May 2005, when Moscow hosted world leaders for the 60th anniversary of World War II Victory Day. But its critical security interests have been challenged by the West, making it difficult. The Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia to end the war in Ukraine, may help mend strained ties. Despite concerns over the Ukraine crisis prolonging and inflationary pressures at home, Putin’s approval rating[15] hovers over 80 per cent. As with most countries, it’s about the economy; life and living standards have improved drastically over the last 25 years. Most Russians would not trade this away for the instability and crises of the Yeltsin era. Opponents propped up the West are seen as those ready to take Russia back to the 1990s when food and housing were scarce. One of Russia’s greatest successes in the Putin era was the revival of agriculture. In 2005 the Russian government identified agriculture as a national priority area. From being an importer of food grains in the late 1990s, Russia went on to become a major global supplier, with exports of grain and processed grain products touching 83.5 million tonnes[16] in 2024, according to Russian agricultural watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor. Another factor in Putin’s popularity at home has been his constant support for what is accepted as 'traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.' An official presidential decree[17] to this extent was issued in 2022. 'Traditional values ​​include life, dignity, human rights and freedoms, patriotism, citizenship, service to the Fatherland and responsibility for its fate, high moral ideals, a strong family, creative work, the priority of the spiritual over the material, humanism, mercy, justice, collectivism, mutual assistance and mutual respect, historical memory and continuity of generations, the unity of the peoples of Russia,' the decree said. The 2022 presidential decree stressed the importance of religion for the country: 'Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism and other religions, which are an integral part of the Russian historical and spiritual heritage, have had a significant impact on the formation of traditional values ​​common to believers and non-believers. Orthodoxy plays a special role in the formation and strengthening of traditional values.' In Putin’s era, Russian Orthodox monasteries and churches have been revived across the country and programs on state television have promoted a return to religion. State support has also been extended to mosques and Buddhist monasteries. For instance, the old Cathedral Mosque was demolished in 2011 to make way for a new modern structure that houses 10,000 worshippers. For the opening ceremony of the new building in 2015, Putin was joined by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This emphasis on traditional values has also extended to making it easier for those who want to migrate to Russia. A 2024 presidential decree[18] grants even those who are not proficient in the Russian language or history temporary resident permits. It specifically invites those foreigners who reject 'the policies implemented by countries that impose destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes that contradict traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.' This could be a simultaneous way of building goodwill with people of foreign countries, while addressing the demographic needs. A quarter of a century after Putin became Russia’s president, a large number of Russians see this as an era of revival and regeneration after a decline that began from the days of Perestroika.

Getting Ready For Tomorrow’s Myanmar – Analysis	By Nicholas Farrelly Myanmar’s top generals have had another bad year. Under relentless attack, their subordinates have surrendered regional military command headquarters, draconian conscription regulations were introduced to bolster the dwindling rank-and-file, and in the north, east and west, rebel armies are strangling access to valuable resources. Old certainties on the battlefields have been overturned by the proliferation of armed groups, including nimble guerrilla squads in central Myanmar and the widespread use, by all sides, of new combat technologies, including drones. The economy, under these conditions, is spluttering — with the national currency, the kyat, now worth only a quarter of its pre-COVID-19 value. Regime officials have imposed price controls on essentials like rice, cooking oil, eggs, fish and meat. Even middle-class families struggle to survive, and flows of desperate migrants are continuing to flee to Thailand and Malaysia. The junta is also clamping down in the digital sphere, limiting access to information and networks through the Internet. The top generals’ devastating misjudgement of the public mood in early 2021 means monitoring and coercing the population is a bigger job than ever. In response, Myanmar’s democrats, ethnic separatists and sundry revolutionaries are steadily undermining the coherence of the dictatorship. While the wars in Myanmar, and the resistance that exists in every town and city, receive only scant media or policy attention, the realities on the ground have shifted, quite profoundly, against the military regime. In terms of the economy, territorial fragmentation, combat capacity, international reputation and diplomatic energy, the regime is faltering. The generals in Naypyitaw could hobble on in this fashion, potentially for years. The history of mismanaged military dictatorship in Myanmar suggests that this is a highly plausible scenario. In 2025, or perhaps 2026, the generals also want to hold an election to try to rebuild their authority and create some greater legitimacy, including for diplomacy through ASEAN. Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, for a start, would certainly welcome such rehabilitation, but the fact is that any such regime-endorsed election would also be immediately dismissed as flawed and undemocratic. It is increasingly clear that Myanmar’s people, and interested outsiders, need to consider what other future the country might face as the present regime continues its downward slide. With Aung San Suu Kyi still locked up, there is no unifying figure for the resistance. The National Unity Government inevitably struggles to draw all of the different fighting forces together. Some local examples help to illustrate the precarious conditions for ’day-after’ scenario planning. The Arakan Army now controls almost everything of note in the western state of Rakhine. In northernmost Myanmar, the Kachin Independence Army is increasingly dominant. Yet, in both areas, there are other political actors, including armed groups, who feel they have claims to specific territory and resources. The Shan State remains highly contested and has been where the Myanmar army has suffered particular setbacks in the past year, including the loss of strategic military bases. Myanmar’s jumbled geographical mandates are nothing new; throughout its history, Myanmar has remained a patchwork of different territorial claims. At times, the central government has, through ceasefires and other agreements, managed to create a somewhat unified national condition. Ideologies of ‘national race’ inclusion that developed over generations, remain a key part of the regime’s response to these fraught political conditions. What has changed is the strongest ethnic minorities’ tolerance for a system that defines their inclusion on Bamar Buddhist terms. Might the mess eventually lead to formal fragmentation? If there are future negotiations about the shape of a federalised Myanmar state, the armies that have fought to secure their own territories will not simply turn over security and economic decision-making to a central government. They will want to control local resources, with extra influence over educational, linguistic, social and cultural outcomes. Balkanisation, however defined, is a part of today’s and tomorrow’s realities. Within ASEAN, chaired in 2025 by Malaysia, there is deepening concern that Myanmar’s internal problems are far too big to ignore. 2021’s Five-Point Consensus clearly failed to change regime behaviour, but the path to a new mechanism for engagement is also far from clear. China has much to lose if Myanmar descends further into the quagmire. But it is not apparent it would contribute to a grand negotiation if that implied contributions from regional competitors like India, Japan or Australia. Russia, limping through its invasion of Ukraine, still keeps Myanmar stocked with sophisticated military equipment. The fall of the half-century Assad regime in Syria, after the rapid withdrawal of Russian backing, naturally heartened Myanmar’s resistance. Closer to home, they also watched the implosion of Sheikh Hasina’s government in Bangladesh, with the former prime minister forced to seek sanctuary abroad. These examples have no doubt buoyed Myanmar’s resistance fighters and offer reminders that supposedly settled conditions do sometimes tip quickly. There is little sense, however, that Myanmar has caught US President Donald Trump’s attention. But an unpredicted intervention cannot be completely ruled out. There are Republican figureswith a long-term eye on Myanmar’s democratic prospects and its possible role in thwarting Chinese designs in the wider region. With more bloodshed and turbulence inevitable, questions about how regional and global powers might find common ground to help the Myanmar people shape their own destinies are not going away.

Trump’s Reciprocal Tariffs Of Trade Destruction – Analysis	At the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, investor Warren Buffett warned of derivatives as weapons of financial mass destruction. President Trump's 'reciprocal tariffs' could have a similar impact on world trade. Last week, President Trump tasked his economic team with devising plans for 'reciprocal tariffs' on every country taxing US imports. Designed in part as bargaining leverage with other countries, they are ramping up prospects for a global trade war with both American allies and adversaries. As Trump put it, 'I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them. No more, no less.' Since Trump did not impose new tariffs yet, Wall Street sighed in relief. Though the prime financiers of the Trump campaign, U.S. financial institutions are increasingly concerned that the administration’s new tariffs are broadening trade war, penalizing consumer and business confidence and risking accelerated inflation in America. The financial institutions should be concerned. The only reason that Trump did not impose fresh tariffs was that he initiated investigations that could ignite a far worse global trade war toward the late spring. Trump's tariff war with the world The US deficits first emerged in the early 1970s; decades before offshoring, the rise of China and other large emerging economies. Since the mid-2000s, China and the large emerging economies have driven global growth prospects. In the process, U.S. goods and services deficit has soared to $918 billion in 2024, up $134 billion from the previous year. Today, the world factory is not in the US, but in China. The US doesn’t benefit from trade surplus; it suffers from a huge deficit. Similarly, in the past eight decades, US dollar’s share of global payments has halved to less than 50% of the total. Thanks to the past Trump and Biden administrations, US trade deficit has more than doubled from $40 billion per month to about $90-$100 billion monthly. On February 1, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs and 10% duties on energy products on Canada and Mexico, and 10% tariffs on China. The three countries are America’s greatest trade partners and the US has a trade deficit with each. Together with Germany and Japan, these five countries account for more than half of all US imports. They and all the rest will be next in the firing line. This week Trump suggested 25% tariffs on autos, pharma and semiconductors, which could 'go very substantially higher over a course of a year.' A (very) broad definition of reciprocal tariffs Starting with countries with the biggest trade surpluses and highest tariff rates first, the aim is to offset not just tariffs but also non-tariff measures, including vehicle safety rules. The same goes for value-added taxes (VAT), even though VATs are faced by both US and other international companies in different countries. VATs create no advantage for European firms and no disadvantage for US firms because they are neutral with respect to trade. Thanks to the new tariffs and non-tariff measures the Trump administration is also on a collision course with its major allies, the European Union and Japan. The idea is also to go after what the Trump administration deems as 'burdensome' regulations, harmful 'government subsidies' and flawed exchange rate policies. In the Trump world, all these measures erect unwarranted costs and barriers to US products in foreign markets. The Commerce Department and the US trade representative are expected to prepare their plans to achieve 'reciprocal trading status' by April 1 – perhaps appropriately on April Fools’ Day. Penalizing emerging and developing economies Should this trade war materialize, it could prove far costlier to the emerging and developing economies, and it might push several fragile economies over the edge. Ironically, export-led growth, the development doctrine that fueled the rise of many East and Southeast countries, could now hit the wall. In the postwar decades, the so-called Asian tigers – Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea – were lucky enough to industrialize during increasing global integration. The more they still rely on export-led growth and a US trade surplus, the more they will find themselves in tricky waters with the Trump White House. The successors of these countries – particularly the large emerging economies and many of the BRICS, including China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico - that rely on international trade and US trade surpluses would also have to reassess their growth models. Things are likely to get even more heated with those countries that trade oil and gas or other commodities in local currencies. Reiterating his longstanding threat, Trump said last week that US 'if [the BRICS] want to play games with the dollar' and 'if any trading gets through, it'll be 100% tariff, at least.' However, big trading economies like China, which have diversified economies and can divert their trade into the Global South, will be better insulated from US economic coercion. If the expansive BRICS can unite their forces, their collective leverage will prove formidable, even vis-à-vis the US and other G7 economies. By the early 2020s. China alone used its currency to settle half of its foreign trade and investment transactions. Overall, the emerging world will face elevated uncertainty surrounding US trade policy that can defer investment decisions and impact emerging economies linked to countries targeted by US tariffs. Undermining the WTO In a short order, Trump has tried to decimate the US aid agency (USAID), withdraw the US from the UN refugee relief agency in the Middle East (UNRWA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), while sanctioning the International Criminal Court (ICC). If completed, reciprocal tariffs would increase duties on many trading partners, while violating decades of normative trade policies by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Trump’s attacks against the WTO began in the first term, when he put the global trade body into sleep by blocking judges from its top dispute-settlement panel. Instead of correcting the wrong, the Biden administration continued it. Now the Trump administration is eager to destabilize the WTO’s principle of 'most favored nation' (MFN) status. The MFN requires member nations to ensure equal tariff and regulatory treatment to other members unless they have free-trade agreements in place. The idea of applying different tariff rates to different countries violates the WTO principle of non-discrimination among its members. As Trump’s elevated tariff rates exceed the maximum rate negotiated with other WTO members, trading rules are violated. Expressing the views of many WTO members, China condemned these 'tariff shocks' that could upend the global trading system. Ironically, Trump is purposely undermining the 'rules-based trading world' that US claims to have fostered since the 1950s. Effectively, Trump’s reciprocal tariffs would mean a fatal rupture from the WTO. It could effectively endanger the very role of the trading body, the US role in the organization and the world’s trading system itself – for the first time in 75 years. Positioning for talks with China With an eye on his legacy, Trump wants a 'deal of a century' in China. He knows it needs to be a deal that can benefit both the US and China. His neoconservative hawks – Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Sinophobe trade counselor Peter Navarro – will oppose any Chinese investment in the US. Yet, it is advisers like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent; and tech billionaire Elon Musk who he will listen. In the Middle East and Ukraine, Trump has used his special convoy Steve Witkoff to get things done (and override neocon mutinies). With China, he could do the same. But this time around, Chinese policy authorities are more wary. Trump’s interest in a 'deal of a century' with China is an opportunity. But he is seen as a risk amplifier. The stakes are too high for policy mistakes.

Why The Bureaucracy Keeps Getting Bigger – OpEd	By Murray N. Rothbard Bureaucracy is necessarily hierarchical, first because of the Iron Law of Oligarchy, and secondly because bureaucracy grows by adding more subordinate layers. Since, lacking a market, there is no genuine test of 'merit' in government’s service to consumers, in a rule-bound bureaucracy seniority is often blithely adopted as a proxy for merit. Increasing seniority, then, leads to promotion to higher ranks, while expanding budgets take the form of multiplying the levels of ranks under you, and expanding your income and power. Bureaucratic growth occurs, then, by multiplying levels of bureaucracy. The theory of hierarchical government bureaucracy is that information is collected in the lowest ranks of the organization, and that at each successive higher rank, the manager culls the most important information from his subordinates, separates the wheat from the chaff, and passes the culled information higher up, so that, in the end, the President, for example, dealing with intelligence operations, receives a two-page memo distilling the most important information gathered and culled from hundreds of thousands of intelligence agents. The President, then, knows more than anyone else, say, about foreign affairs. One problem with this rosy model, as Professor Gordon Tullock points out in his illuminating book, The Politics of Bureaucracy,1 is that the model doesn’t ask whether or not each bureaucrat has the incentive to pass the best distillate of truth on to his superiors. The problem is that bureaucratic favor, especially at the higher levels, depends on pleasing one’s superiors, and pleasing them largely rests on telling the President and the higher bureaucrats what they want to hear. One of the great truths of human history is that one tends to shoot, or at least react badly, to the bearer of bad news. 'Sire, your policy is working badly in Croatia,' is not the sort of message that the President, say, wants to hear from his envoy, and, while the outcome in Croatia remains in doubt, the President and his aides want to continue to believe that their policy is doing well. Hence, the dissident is set down as a trouble-maker if not a subversive, and his career in the hierarchy is side-tracked, often permanently. In the meanwhile, the envoys or foreign service people who assure the President 'things are going very well in Croatia,' are hailed as perceptive fellows and their careers are advanced. And then, if years later, the dissident is proved correct, and the Croatian policy lies in shambles, is the president or any other ruler likely to turn in warm gratitude to the former dissident? Not hardly. Instead, he will still remember the dissident as a troublemaker, and he will not blame his aides, who, along with himself, have been proved wrong. For after all, didn’t the great mainstream of experts make the same error? How common is sincere soul-searching and repentance for past errors among Presidents or other rulers? Those bureaucrats who are shrewd analysts of human nature, then, and who understand the way rulers operate, will, if they see that the cherished policy of their President is in grave error, tend to keep their mouths shut, and let some other sucker be the messenger of bad news and get shot down. Every human activity and institution will tend to reward those who are most able to adapt to the best route to success in that activity. Successful market entrepreneurs will be those who can best anticipate, and satisfy, consumer demands. Success in the bureaucracy on the contrary, will go to those who are most apt at (a) employing propaganda to persuade their superiors, the legislators, or the public about their great merits; and therefore (b) at understanding that the way to rise is to tell the President and the top bureaucrats what they want to hear. Hence, the higher the ranks of the bureaucracy, the more yes-men and time-servers there will tend to be. The President will often know less about what is going on than those in the lower ranks. Hence, for example, the phenomenon of President Nixon, thinking he knew more than anyone else about the Vietnam War and yet actually knowing less than the astute reader of the New York Times. For the CIA and other intelligence warnings of what was going on, developed by many of the lower officers, were screened out by the higher-ups, for being contrary to the President’s preferred line, i.e., that all was going well.2 The standard explanation of why government grows is that, as time goes on, there is more work for government to do, and that therefore the public’s 'demand for government' rises. Far more accurate is the view that there is a case of an inverted Say’s Law, where supply — or rather the suppliers of government 'services,' the bureaucracy — themselves constitute the 'demand' for their own services, and that they engineer the consent of their superiors, or of the legislature, to provide the wherewithal in the form of increased taxation. Contrast the hilariously satirical, but all too perceptive account of 'Parkinson’s Law' of bureaucracy. Thus, Professor Parkinson asserted that, in a government bureaucracy, 'there need be little or no relationship between the work to be done and the size of the staff to which it may be assigned.'3 The continuing rise in the total of government employees 'would be much the same whether the volume of the work were to increase, diminish, or even disappear.'4 Parkinson identifies two 'axiomatic' underlying forces responsible for this growth: (1) 'An official wants to multiply subordinates, not rivals'; and (2) 'Officials make work for each other.' Parkinson begins his 'model' with an official who feels himself overworked. The official could resign, but that is unthinkable; besides, he would lose his pension rights. To ask to divide his work in half with a new colleague on his own level is equally unthinkable; for his status would be cut, and he would bring in a dangerous rival for the job of his own boss when the latter retires. He could ask for one assistant under him; but that would be dangerous, because the new man might achieve something like equal status with himself. No, his preferred route is to ask for two assistants, who could then compete with each other for his favor; pretty soon, each of these new assistants will complain of overwork, and each one of these will get two assistants. The original bureaucrat now has the satisfaction of having six men under him, and he is now ready for a promotion and a substantial raise in pay. But how about the work to be done? Won’t the original quantity of work be divided into seven parts, and won’t each man now be absurdly and manifestly idle and underworked? No — and here is one of Parkinson’s scintillating insights into the theory of bureaucracy — for one aspect of Parkinson’s Law is that 'work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.' Or, as Parkinson also puts it: 'The thing to be done swells in importance and complexity in direct ratio with the time to be spent.'5 Here enters the second aspect of Parkinson’s Law of Growth: that 'officials make work for each other.' For, says Parkinson, 'these seven make so much work for each other that all are fully occupied,' and the original man 'is actually working harder than ever.' Documents have to be sent to each man in turn, each has to comment on the document and send the comments to everyone else, they all have to confer on the document and the various amendments proposed, and the original man is now also wrapped up in problems of inter-personal relations between himself and his staff, and of each of his staff amongst the others. Finally, after a lengthy process of interaction, writes Parkinson, the original official produces the same reply to the document that he would have written if all his subordinates 'had never been born.' 'Far more people,' Parkinson concludes, 'have taken far longer to produce the same result. No one has been idle. All have done their best.'6 Parkinson then illustrates his law with delightful examples from the British Royal Navy. From 1914 to 1928, the number of ships in the Navy fell by 68 percent; the number of officers and men fell by 32 percent. And yet, during the same period, the number of dockyard officials and clerks in the Navy increased by 40 percent, while, even more outrageously, the number of Admiralty officials increased by over 78 percent. The annual rate of increase in the number of Admiralty officials, with little variation, was 5.6 percent. Parkinson takes another example from the British Colonial Office, from 1935 to 1954. In that period, the area and population of colonial territories remained about the same from 1935 to 1939, fell during the war until 1943, rose again until 1947, and then steadily decreased as Britain shed its Empire. And yet, in each of these two decades, the Colonial Office bureaucracy rose steadily in number by about 5.9 percent per year, regardless of what was happening in the scope of the alleged work to be done. Considering then the rate of increase each year in the Admiralty, and averaging the rates of increase of Admiralty and colonial officials, which is not, after all, more outlandish than many other statistical procedures, Parkinson triumphantly concludes that the number of officials will increase by an average of 5.75 percent per year, 'irrespective of any variation in the amount of work (if any) to be done.'7 A similar analysis was set forth earlier, in 1950, in a grievously neglected book by Connecticut attorney and farmer Thomas H. Barber, based on years of inquiry into government and on his observations of Washington bureaucracy during World War II. Barber writes that 'there are two requisites for a bureaucrat’s promotion, the first, the ability to get and hold votes, the second, the number of subordinates he is able to keep busy.' Barber goes on: … in the Federal Government the pay of a bureaucrat executive is proportioned by Civil Service law to the number of his subordinates. This leads to the rivalry in Washington as each bureaucratic chief tries to increase his 'empire.' Generally, in order to keep his subordinates busy the boss assumes an air of great importance and affects to be very hurried and under great pressure. He is very punctual at the office and insists that everyone else be. He then deliberately begins to multiply paperwork, calling for reports on any subject connected with his job. He issues enormously complicated orders and memoranda for the organization of his office, requiring that all papers be so routed round that almost every scrap has to be read by everyone in the office and discussed by a number of interlocking committees before it is acted upon. He requires that no paper be thrown away, but all shall be cross-indexed and filed. He has anybody who can be tagged, interviewed, a stenographic report made of the interview and typed (often he has them mimeographed), and circulated to be read and initialed. By these methods it is quite easy to take an amount of work that could be done easily and efficiently by three men and two stenographers, and blow it up so that it can keep from fifty to two hundred people extremely busy, and yet fall far behind in its execution. Thus the uncompleted work gives him an apparently sound excuse for more clerks, who increase his prestige and his pay.8 Barber then goes on to relate a delightful example of bureaucracy in action that he had observed during World War II. He notes that there existed a department whose work, 'supposing it was worth doing, which is doubtful,' could have been done competently by about twenty people. It was run, as he puts it, 'by a man with a bureaucratic soul.' This man asked for written opinions from everyone on all sorts of subjects and had every one read and initial them: He was always intensely busy himself, even at night; and he kept constantly increasing his department till he got it up to two hundred men and women. This made him very important. All the two hundred were so busy carrying out his regulations that they were in a constant sweat and confusion, had no time to think, and the essential work in support of the war effort — supposing it was essential — suffered dreadfully. He was rewarded and translated to a more important job. His successor, Barber related, was a different kind of person; an old gentleman with little ambition and little regard for the taxpayer, but whose objective was to do the essential work, and keep himself and everyone else at the workplace contented. In contrast to the twelve hours a day spent in the office by his predecessor, this man spent only one-half an hour at work each morning. The rest of the day, he walked around the office, talking and joking with the employees, and played golf in the late afternoon. At the end of the first week, says Barber, 'he fired about fifty of the two hundred people, apparently at random.' As a result, 'the work lessened considerably for the remaining ones.' There was naturally a lot of discussion of this action, and 'it was generally decided that he had fired the fifty he was sure he did not like.' 'Not a very scientific way of eliminating surplus help,' adds Barber, 'but it did lighten the work.' The following week, the new boss fired fifty more people, this time apparently dismissing those 'he thought he did not like.' In consequence, 'the work for the remainder lightened enormously, though some of the essential work of those dismissed was apportioned around silently by those that remained.' A few days later, another fifty people were dismissed, these being the people 'he was not sure he did like.' Barber notes: 'With three-quarters of the force eliminated there was practically nothing left but the ‘essential work’, such as it was, to do.' This work was done effectively in about half of each day by the fifty people remaining, 'far more efficiently than it had been done by the original two hundred. The fifty did their stuff and devoted the time remaining — about half of it — to their own concerns.' Barber concludes that 'the old gentleman, being now surrounded only by those he knew he liked, felt he had done enough.' He was in the office about an hour a day, and then he evaporated. 'The ‘work’ was far better done than it had been, people had time to think and were not in each other’s way.' Barber adds that the work probably could have been done by half again of those remaining, but that then the half would 'have had to work about as hard as the original two hundred had worked and there would have been no benefit to anyone but the taxpayers.'9 In addition to this keen treatment of bureaucracy, Thomas Barber was perhaps the first person to arrive at the essence of what is now called 'public choice' analysis in the economics profession. Barber notes the 'constant tendency for all governments to grow both in size and in authority.' Why? Barber answers: because the advantage of a big, powerful government, from the point of view of the bureaucrats, is personal, clear and ever-present to their eyes; and because the cost of it, not only in money but in freedom, which is lost by giving authority to officials, is vague and nebulous in the minds of the citizens whose attention is not focused on the government at all…. Therefore, since the bureaucrats know exactly what they want and are working for their own immediate interest, and since the other citizens do not realize what they are giving up, and, in fact, have not their attention on the matter at all, it is obvious which group will prevail.10 What public choicer has put it better? About the author: This article is adapted from 'Bureaucracy and the Civil Service in the United States.' Murray Rothbard was born March 2, 1926, the son of David and Rae Rothbard. He was a brilliant student even as a young child; and his academic record at Columbia University, where he majored in mathematics and economics, was stellar. In the Columbia economics department, Rothbard did not receive any instruction in Austrian economics, and Mises was no more than a name to him. In a course on price theory given by George Stigler, however, he encountered arguments against such then popular measures as price and rent control. These arguments greatly appealed to him; and he wrote to the publisher of a pamphlet that Stigler and Milton Friedman had written on rent control.

Uneven Prosperity Mapping India’s Poverty Struggles – OpEd	A glaring and varied picture of economic inequality in India is presented by the data on poverty levels in the various Indian states. The problem of poverty has long plagued India, and some areas are still severely affected even after years of efforts. In addition to showing the extent of poverty, the percentages on the map also highlight regional disparities in wealth distribution. One of the most populous states in India, Uttar Pradesh, has terrible conditions, with 32.1% of its people living on US$ 3.20 (? 270 approx.) or less per day. Although Uttar Pradesh is an important agricultural and industrial centre for India, a sizable section of its people live in poverty. This can be ascribed to inadequate social services, bad governance, and a lack of infrastructure. A cycle of poverty has been sustained, particularly in rural areas, by slow agricultural growth and restricted access to healthcare and education. Likewise, 23.3% of people in Bihar, another state with a large population, live in poverty. Despite advancements in areas like agriculture and education, Bihar has long been one of the poorest states in India. However, the state's overall economic growth has not been sufficient to lift a sizable section of its population out of poverty. Bihar's low productivity in agriculture and lack of industrialisation are the main causes of the state's high poverty. Moreover, the state's yearly vulnerability to floods and other natural disasters makes matters worse and forces millions of people into ever-deeper poverty. At 27%, poverty is also a significant problem in Odisha. Despite having an abundance of natural resources and minerals, Odisha has had difficulty transforming its wealth into widespread prosperity. Much of Odisha's population, like that of Bihar, depends on the still-underdeveloped agricultural sector. The industrial and mining sectors have not been inclusive enough to help the economically vulnerable despite their contribution to the state's GDP. Tribal areas of the state, which have been neglected in terms of development for decades, also contribute to the high rates of poverty. Surprisingly, 34.9% of the people in Maharashtra, one of India's economic superpowers, live on ? 270 or less per day. This number is concerning because Maharashtra is home to some of India's most advanced cities, such as Mumbai, the nation's financial hub. Here, we see the sharp contrast between rural poverty and urban wealth. Although much wealth has been created in metropolitan areas like Mumbai, most is concentrated among a small percentage of the population. Maharashtra's rural areas, where agriculture is still the primary source of income, are still plagued by poverty, droughts, and a lack of infrastructure investment. West Bengal is another state with a high population density, where 35.2% of people live below the poverty line. Even though the state has improved healthcare and education, its economic development still lags behind other states. Poverty has persisted partly due to the slow rate of industrialisation and the demise of traditional industries like jute. There is now a division between the countryside and urban areas like Kolkata because rural areas, especially those in the state's north and west, have been left behind in the drive for development. Like many other agrarian states, 26.4% of Rajasthan's population lives below the poverty line. Even with recent improvements in infrastructure and tourism, Rajasthan is still heavily reliant on agriculture, which is regularly impacted by unpredictable monsoon rains. Droughts, poor soil quality, and water scarcity are persistent problems in the desert state that exacerbate its economic difficulties. The state's advancements in other areas, such as urbanisation and renewable energy, have not had enough impact to lift the poverty many rural residents face. However, states like Tamil Nadu (5.7%) and Kerala (16%) show how progressive social welfare, healthcare, and education policies can dramatically lower poverty. Kerala has a robust healthcare system and high literacy rates and has continuously done well on several human development indices. Its poverty rates are low compared to other states, emphasising how crucial a robust welfare state is to combating poverty. The success of Tamil Nadu, which has the lowest poverty rate at 5.8%, further emphasises how important good governance and industrialisation are in generating jobs and services that help people escape poverty. The development models presented by both states strongly emphasise using human capital to combat inequality and poverty. Gujarat is a mixed case with a 21.8% share. The state is well-known for its quick economic expansion and industrialisation and has done an excellent job promoting entrepreneurship and creating jobs. However, poverty still exists in some places, especially in rural areas and among marginalised communities, which suggests that growth's advantages have not been shared fairly. Gujarat's emphasis on business and industry has occasionally come at the expense of social development initiatives that could significantly lower poverty. Relatively lower poverty rates in Delhi and Haryana (14% and 15.7%, respectively) demonstrate the advantages of northern India's urbanisation and economic expansion. As the nation's capital, Delhi has witnessed tremendous advancements in healthcare, education, and infrastructure, all of which have contributed to a decline in poverty. However, there are still problems with income inequality, especially between the wealthy and the less fortunate groups, such as slum dwellers and migrant workers, who find it challenging to make ends meet. Haryana has also profited from economic growth because of its proximity to Delhi and robust agricultural base, but inequalities still exist, especially in rural areas. An intriguing example is the northeastern states, like Nagaland (12.6%). These states have historically had greater rates of poverty because of their remote locations, inadequate infrastructure, and constrained economic prospects. However, targeted development initiatives, especially through central government programs and heightened focus on regional sectors like tourism and handicrafts, have contributed to a decrease in poverty in recent years. Nagaland's comparatively lower poverty rate demonstrates that focused interventions can make a significant difference even in historically underprivileged areas. On the other hand, the union territory of Lakshadweep provides an example of how poverty can be virtually eradicated with small, homogeneous populations and well-distributed resources, as evidenced by its remarkably low poverty rate of 0.3%. Due to the territory's small population, steady government assistance, and investments in regional businesses like tourism and fishing, there is little poverty and a high standard of living. The disparity in poverty rates among these states highlights how difficult it is to combat poverty in a nation with India's diversity. Geographical features, natural resources, governance, and historical development are all important determinants of each state's economic success. Poverty has decreased more successfully in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Gujarat, which have prioritised infrastructure development, industrialisation, and human capital investment. While this is going on, states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha have had difficulty pulling sizable segments of their populations out of poverty due to their inadequate infrastructure, restricted access to healthcare and education, and excessive reliance on agriculture. Therefore, India's strategies for reducing poverty must be customised to meet each state's unique requirements and difficulties. This could entail concentrating on raising agricultural productivity, funding rural infrastructure, and expanding access to healthcare and education for states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In more developed states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, the emphasis may need to change to tackle income inequality and ensure that economic expansion's advantages are shared more fairly. Furthermore, the fact that many states continue to have high rates of rural poverty emphasises the necessity of giving rural development more attention. The majority of India's population still lives in the rural hinterlands, which are neglected, while urban centres continue to expand and draw investment. The deep-seated poverty in these areas must be addressed through policies that enhance rural infrastructure, increase agricultural productivity, and generate non-farm employment opportunities. Furthermore, the differences in poverty levels highlight the significance of governance. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala that have made significant investments in welfare programs have seen a notable decrease in poverty. This implies that although economic expansion is crucial, social policies that guarantee growth advantages are distributed fairly must also be implemented. Social security, healthcare, and education are essential for enabling people to escape poverty and should be prioritised by all national governments. Finally, India's poverty map illustrates the country's uneven development. While some states have achieved notable progress in lowering poverty, others are still caught in a vicious cycle of hardship. A comprehensive strategy that considers each state's particular difficulties is needed to combat poverty in India. The way forward is obvious, ranging from boosting social welfare programs and addressing income inequality to increasing agricultural productivity and rural infrastructure. Combining inclusive social policies and economic growth is essential to bringing millions of Indians out of poverty and guaranteeing a more equitable future for everybody.

Ending The Russia–Ukraine War On Trump’s Terms – OpEd	By Dave Patterson The hands of the Russia-Ukraine war clock have ticked past 1,000 days. President Donald Trump is determined to end the conflict and stop the carnage. The Biden administration and Ukraine’s European neighbors were helpless in bringing the Russian invaders and their victims in Ukraine to the negotiating table for meaningful discussions, and Trump has potentially done that with two phone calls. Following Trump’s Feb. 12 conversations, one with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the other with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, the stage was set for substantive talks aimed at ending three years of misery that began with the Kremlin’s unprovoked invasion Feb. 24, 2022. Peace Talks Begin The peace talks began on Feb. 18 in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh at the Diriyah Palace. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff represented the United States. They were joined by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the perennial face of the Kremlin’s foreign policy team, and Aide to the President Yuri Ushakov. A US State Department readout explained that 'President Trump wants to stop the killing; the United States wants peace and is using its strength in the world to bring countries together.' The statement continued with the observation that Trump 'is the only leader in the world who can get Ukraine and Russia to agree' to a peace pact. Regardless of who is at fault for the aggression, neither of the two belligerents trusts the other. Buildling trust between Washington and Moscow will be a steep hill to climb, so it makes sense to take on this challenge first. To that end, the talks resulted in four trust-building steps. The US negotiators announced that they had decided to: 'Establish a consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective diplomatic missions. 'Appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides. 'Lay the groundwork for future cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic economic and investment opportunities which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine. '[P]ledge to remain engaged to make sure the process moves forward in a timely and productive manner.' The State Department was clear in setting appropriate expectations for any rapid, permanent end to the destruction and bloodshed in Ukraine. 'One phone call followed by one meeting is not sufficient to establish enduring peace. We must take action, and today, we took an important step forward.' Soon after the meeting concluded, the US contingent met with journalists from CNN News and the Associated Press. A question posed was about how the Ukrainians and Europeans 'feel' shut out of the peace process as it has unfolded. In response, Rubio offered a dose of reality absent from the previous administration’s relationship with the Kyiv government and European leaders: 'Well, the comment I would have on that is that for three and a half years while this conflict has raged … no one else has been able to bring something together like what we saw today because Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that can. So, no one is being sidelined here.' Ukraine and Europeans Worried About Being Left Out To assuage the fears of the Europeans and Ukraine that they are not represented, Waltz offered, 'Look, it’s common sense. If you’re going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides.' However, for the first meeting to establish confidence, having diplomats by the score, all pushing their country’s particular agenda, would have been a waste of time. Furthermore, candid and transparent, 'Rubio said a negotiation process had not begun in earnest, and if talks advanced, the Ukrainians and other Europeans would be brought in the fold,' Reuters reported. A key player with the most skin in the game is not convinced. RealClearPolitics quotedZelensky in a Meet the Press interview about assurances that Ukraine’s position would be protected. He declared, 'So, I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. And our people, never.' His passion is understandable — the Ukrainians have lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers and citizens to a brutal Russian war machine. Nonetheless, never say never. When it comes to bringing peace to Ukraine, if not the United States, who? If not now, when? The previous administration and European leaders presided over a protracted conflict with no end in sight. It’s time for something different. The views expressed are those of the author and not of any other affiliate. About the author: National Security Correspondent at LibertyNation.Com.

China Advances To Second Place In Global Soft Power Ranking – OpE...	China has overtaken the UK to secure 2nd place globally, advancing one position from the previous year ... in the Global Soft Power Index 2025. The latest report of the Global Soft Power Index for 2025 by influential brand valuation consultancy, Brand Finance, highlights the remarkable progress of China in its index ranking the extent of power and influence in world politics and international relations wielded by countries of the world. It now sits at second place behind the US which, although ranking first, has seen its soft power standing undermined by global concerns of its political stability, reputation and governance. The Global Soft Power Index report is based primarily on key indicators in economics and business. It also measures attributes related to culture and heritage, media and communication, education and science and sustainability. These together are increasingly seen as the other more influential and effective side of the power coin as compared with the flip side of hard power associated with military power and intervention, coercive diplomacy and economic sanction. The report notes that China retains first place globally for ‘ease to do business in and with’ and ‘future growth potential’ attributes for the last four years consecutively. This is a picture quite different to the one of ‘China collapsing’ and ‘China in economic crisis’ regularly featured in western mainstream media and reproduced by supporting Asian media. What is also notable is that China has soared to 7th place in the ranking of ‘culture and heritage’ and ‘media and communication’ attributes. This trend is strengthening with the further opening up of the country to foreign visitors and the global impact of the movie, Ne Zhe2 (NZ2) and Deep Seek, the artificial intelligence app. The impact of NZ2 and Deep Seek in their respective fields has been such that western media leaders such as CNN, BBC and New York Times that regularly engage in anti-China reporting, as well as have ignored or marginalized Chinese achievements, have been reluctantly aroused to run stories on them, albeit with their mandatory negative comments. Meanwhile, missing from the mainstream media coverage is India’s decline from the 29th position in 2024 to its current 30th position in 2025. Ne Zha2 Global Movie Megahit Ne Zha2 (NZ2), the latest China produced animation film hit with its story line of family, friendship, loyalty and sacrifice encapsulated within a framework of Chinese mythology and techno wizardry has captivated movie audiences wherever it has been shown and is expected to generate more than US$2 billion in box office takings. This will make it the highest ranking box office animated film in the world. What's appealing to movie fans, especially American audiences viewing it in the small number of cinemas it is showing - 300 of 9595 movie theatres - are not just the universal themes of courage and resilience but also the absence of messages relating to wokeness, political correctness, and attitude. Unlike in the West, where cultural dominance has been tied to colonial conquest and expansion, religion and political dominance, this example of film making and cultural influence is different. In today's high-tech era, films like NZ2 demonstrate how technology, storytelling and cultural heritage can converge to create a new filmmaking and culture dissemination model rooted in non ideological equality and dialogue rather than the legacy western model with its message of white, Christian and ideological goodness, superiority and supremacy. Movie audiences are no strangers to mythology-based storytelling. However, Chinese and other non-western mythology and story lines have been underexplored in the global entertainment world despite their rich history and universal themes. This is not only due to cultural and historical differences. It is more importantly an outcome of American dominance in the development of the movie industry since the early 20th century. Hollywood - with US government support - has dominated the world box office for more than a century and helped to shape how audiences in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America view the US and the world. Whilst this continues today, the success of Ne Zha and its sequel should encourage small countries in their cultural confidence and ability to tell their own stories. This will impact their soft power influence and ranking among the countries of the world. Deep Seek: Sputnik Moment and Bombshell Impact NZ2 comes on the heels of Deep Seek with the latter emerging like a bombshell in app stores around the world. As the most downloaded AI app, replacing Chat GPT, the Chinese AI model has significantly impacted the global tech industry by its cost-effective low budget development. This has caused major tech stocks to plummet and raised questions about the shifting power dynamics in the AI market. Many now see China as a major player in AI development that can challenge western AI apps presently dominating the market and tech giants such as Microsoft and Google. What’s important to the estimated 5 billion smartphone users in the world - they account for over 60% of the world’s population - is not that it is a Chinese app but that it is free. For those using it, Deep Seek has pioneered and opened the door to an open source app that can be used and modified easily and without the need to pay a fee or royalty. Deep Seek and NZ2 are not the only examples of China's growing soft power in the world. They follow Huawei, BYD, TikTok, Red Note and other recent China innovations and products developed entirely or mainly with homegrown talent whose ripple effects are affecting and undermining US and western domination of the existing world order. How will Trump’s MAGA Impact Global Power Balance Perhaps the greatest asset to China’s influence in the world for now comes from an unlikely source - President Donald Trump. As the world’s greatest political influencer and news maker, Trump in his mission to make America great again has embarked on a foreign policy campaign that has made allies of the US realize that their client status makes it inevitable that their interests will be placed on the sacrificial table if they stand in the way of Trump’s redefinition of American hard and soft power, and the ensuing relations with Russia, China or any other adversary. This, combined with China’s burgeoning soft power achievements, and Belt and Road Initiative with its emphasis on economic development and regional connectivity to bring about shared prosperity, will result in the more rapid remaking of the current world order to a more equitable and inclusive multipolar one.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7iUZlNZE-2vR	2025-02-23T16:50:57-08:00	
Germany Swings Right As Merz’s Christian Democrats Projected To W...	By Jonathan Packroff and Nick Alipour and Owen Morgan and Victoria Becker (EurActiv) -- Germany’s centre-right recorded a clear victory in Sunday’s national elections, according to early projections, heralding a substantial political shift in Europe’s largest country and clearing the way for Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats, to become Germany’s next chancellor, replacing Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats. Early projections put Merz‘s centre-right bloc, which also includes the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), at 29%, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) at 21 % and the Social Democrats (SPD) at 17%. The Greens won about 12%, the Left 9%, the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) 4.5%, and the leftist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance 4.9%, according to the projections. The preliminary result signaled a substantial shift to the right in Germany's electorate since 2021, with the centre-right bloc and AfD recording a collective 48.5%, a massive jump from 34.5%. Given that Merz has ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD, however, the prospect of a coalition between the two is slim. It was unclear late on Sunday whether the BSW would make it past the electoral threshold of 5%, which is required to gain parliamentary representation. Barring a substantial shift in the results, the process of crafting a coalition promises to be fraught, with the early returns suggesting Merz may need two partners to build a majority in parliament, most likely with the SPD and the Greens. 'It's now about creating a government that is capable of acting as soon as possible with a solid parliamentary majority,' Merz said. 'The world out there isn't waiting for Germany, and it isn't waiting for long-winding coalition talks in negotiations.' 'Rambo zambo' If confirmed, the results would be worst in the SPD's more than 100-year history, while also marking the first time since the World War Two that the Christian Democrats and SPD did not take the first two places in a national election. The projected centre-right win marks dramatic personal victory for Merz, who had all but abandoned his aspirations of becoming chancellor more than 20 years ago after his then-rival, Angela Merkel, outmanoeuvered him for the party leadership. Much to Merkel's chagrin, Merz returned to the head of the party in 2022 after two unsuccessful bids for the party leadership in 2018 and 2021. 'Now is the time for rambo zambo at the Adenauer House,' a triumphant Merz told supporters at the Adenauer House, the Christian Democrats party headquarters in Berlin. 'Tonight we'll celebrate, and from tomorrow we'll get to work.' For Scholz, there was little to celebrate. The chancellor and former finance minister, whose ascent other the chancellorship in 2021 suprised many, led the party to its worst national election result since 1887. He proved incapable of reining his fractious three-party coalition, however, and was ultimately forced to trigger its collapse in November, a year before the end off its term. 'This is a bitter result for the Social Democratic party, it is also a defeat – it needs to be said loud and clear,' said Scholz, who signalled he would step away from the limelight. Supporters were dead silent in the party’s headquarters when the SPD result was announced. 'A win for Europe' Merz said during the election night Elefantenrunde roundtable talkshow of top candidates that he hoped to form a new government by Easter, and that he wants to talk 'properly' to the Social Democrats after a tough exchange of blows on the campaign trail. On multiple occasions, he ruled out entering into a coalition with the AfD. As majorities remained uncertain, officials feared that prolonged negotiations over a future government could spell trouble for Europe amid global upheaval. 'The world is not waiting for us. Europe is waiting for us, for Germany, to take on a stronger leadership role again,' Merz said. Merz, who is a keen transatlanticist, added that Europe should prioritise agreeing on a united position on the US's negotiations with Russia on Ukraine. 'For me, it will be an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,' he stressed, noting that 'the Americans, at least this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.' The CDU's leader in the European Parliament, Daniel Caspary, hailed the victory as a win for Europe. 'The largest European country, in the heart of Europe, is now back on track,' Caspary told Euractiv. Christian Lindner, the former finance minister whose departure from government hastened the collapse of Scholz's coalition government, announced his resignation after the FDP failed to reach the 5% minimum threshold for seats in parliament. Asked if his Greens would approach the CDU over a possible coalition, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck suggested it was Merz's prerogative to initiate those discussions. But he also made clear the Greens were willing to join a coalition. 'This is the only possibility,' Habeck told ZDF public television. 'One has to let it sink in what this result means: We are in a very difficult situation.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7jwEB3BCQvc6	2025-02-23T16:46:09-08:00	
Zelenskyy Willing To Step Down As President To Secure Ukraine Pea...	By Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is ready to give up his position to bring peace, saying it could be in exchange for his country joining NATO. Zelenskyy was speaking on the eve of the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, amid mounting pressure from Washington to engage in peace talks. 'If there is peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready.... I can exchange it for NATO,' Zelenskyy told a press conference in Kyiv, adding he would depart 'immediately' if necessary. Following a bruising week in which he had a public rift with his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, Zelenskyy also said he wanted Trump to visit Ukraine and that he was 'grateful' for American support during the war. 'I want very much mutual understanding with Trump,' Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv, adding: 'Security guarantees from Trump are much needed.' However, Zelenskyy also questioned a figure of $500 billion in U.S. support quoted by Trump, saying the real figure was closer to $100 billion. He said he would not recognize previous U.S. grants as loans. Transatlantic Cracks His comments come amid concerns of cracks in the transatlantic alliance as Washington held high-level direct talks with Moscow. In the past week, U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Zelenskyy and suggested he was responsible for starting the conflict -- although he later walked back these comments in an interview on Fox News radio, stating Zelenskyy should not have allowed Russia to attack. Zelenskyy, for his part, had caused anger in Washington by stating that Trump lived in 'a disinformation bubble.' Trump has also suggested Zelenskyy might not be needed in peace talks and called for access to Ukrainian mineral wealth as compensation for U.S. aid provided so far. Trump aide Steve Witkoff told CNN on February 23 that he expected the deal to be signed this week. Zelenskyy said it needed to include security guarantees for Ukraine, and that a deployment of U.S. troops in his country would be logical. European Diplomacy European leaders have joined Zelenskyy in voicing fears over the dangers of Western disunity -- and of their countries being left out of talks on ending the war. While other Western leaders head to Kyiv on February 24, French President Emmanuel Macron will fly in the opposite direction for talks with Trump in Washington. He'll be followed later in the week by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Both men will seek to find common ground with Trump on next steps. 'Nobody wants the bloodshed to continue. Nobody, least of all the Ukrainians,' Starmer told a party conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on February 23. 'But after everything that they have suffered, after everything that they have fought for, there could be no discussion about Ukraine without Ukraine, and the people of Ukraine must have a long-term secure future.' Starmer repeated his pledge that Britain would be prepared to provide boots on the ground in Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders have held hastily convened discussions on the subject in recent days in another reflection of their concern that Washington is cooling on further support. In a further sign of support for Kyiv, British Foreign Secretary Daniel Lammy said on February 23 that his country would announce its largest package of sanctions on Russia to coincide with the three-year anniversary. Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke in messianic terms to justify his invasion of Ukraine, on the eve of the third anniversary of his forces' full-scale assault. 'Fate willed it so, God willed it so,' he said at an event in Moscow on February 23 with soldiers who fought in Ukraine. This is not the first time Putin has used such language to justify Russia's aggression against Ukraine. In 2014, he defended his country's illegal seizure of Crimea by saying the peninsula had a 'sacred meaning' for Russia, comparing it to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities reported their country had come under its largest-ever drone attack from Russia overnight on February 22-23. Reports of casualties were gradually coming in from across the nation. The attacks further underlined Ukraine's vulnerabilities as well as its reliance on U.S. military assistance. Speaking to Current Time in recent days, military analysts said air defense was a key area where Kyiv relied on Washington. 'All other [military supplies] can be found in Europe. In some way, European help can replace American help. But air defense -- this is the key area,' said Oleksiy Alshanskiy from Conflict Intelligence Team.

Hezbollah Can Rebuild And It Will Be Disastrous For Lebanon – Ana...	By Dr. Dania Koleilat Khatib As expected, Israel refused to fully withdraw from Lebanon on Feb. 18, leaving its forces in five border areas. Maintaining the occupation in this way is exactly the breath of life Hezbollah needs to revive itself.On Feb. 23, Hezbollah held the funeral of its secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sept. 27 last year. The funeral was an occasion for the group to show it still commanded strong support among the Shiite community.Wafiq Safa, the official in charge of the group’s coordination and liaison unit, said a few weeks ago that Hezbollah would emerge stronger than it was before. He could be right. It was born out of the grievances caused by the Israeli invasion in 1982. Now, Israel has created enough hatred and pain to give the group exactly the boost it needs to rebuild itself.Prior to withdrawing from the areas they did leave, Israeli forces made sure to burn the houses they had not already destroyed. Towns close to the border, such as Kfar Kela, were razed to the ground.Southern Lebanon is an agrarian society; the people there make a living from the crops they farm. Israel bombed the south with phosphorus bombs to ensure those people would no longer be able to cultivate their land.Israeli authorities are attempting to create an undeclared 'no-man’s land,' a buffer zone along the border with Lebanon. They hope that because of all the destruction, people will be discouraged from returning home. Through this buffer zone and control of five strategic points along the border, Israel thinks it can guarantee the security of its settlements in Galilee.In addition, the Israelis think that their presence within Lebanese borders means they will be able to move freely there and target anyone they want. A few days ago, for example, Israeli forces carried out a drone attack in Saida in which they assassinated a Hamas operative. Their reconnaissance and surveillance drones and planes can breach and roam Lebanese airspace as they please. From time to time, they fly at low altitude and break the sound barrier, creating fear and anxiety among the Lebanese people.Why would they not? Israeli authorities see no restrictions on their actions. They can do whatever they want. They broke all international laws in Gaza and faced no repercussions, so why not in Lebanon?However, the Israelis underestimate the urge this is fueling among the Lebanese to fight back, especially among Shiites, whose homes and land have been devastated. This is something Hezbollah, weakened as it is, can use to its advantage.To fully understand the group’s fall, one should understand its rise. Hezbollah was created out of a need to fight an Israeli occupation. It evolved from small, random groups into a formidable, well-organized guerrilla force that could spread fear among the generals in Tel Aviv. Of course, its creation came three years after the Iranian revolution, and directly after the Israeli invasion of Beirut. The rise of Hezbollah was considered the first export of Iran’s revolution to the Arab world and it was successful mainly because of the indigenous need to fight the Israeli occupation. After Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah lost its raison d’etre as a resistance organization. Following the withdrawal of Syrian forces in 2005, the group entered politics. Its members felt they had to because they had lost their Syrian sponsor. Political power represented a tool with which to protect their arms; they did not want a government in place they could not control, which might ask them to disarm in compliance with 2004’s UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and the 1989 Taif Agreement that ended the civil war in Lebanon.In 2008, Hezbollah tightened its grip on the government through the Doha agreement, signed on May 21 that year, which was designed to end an 18-month political crisis during which the weapons the group had been pointing at the Israelis were turned on their fellow Lebanese.On May 7, 2008, Hezbollah had taken Beirut by force. It became part of the country’s corrupt political structure. The arms that had been protecting Lebanon from Israeli aggression were now the main protectors of the political elite and their corruption.The more the group’s legitimacy was eroded, the more brutal it became, domestically. It suppressed dissent, whether through assassinations or by crushing the public protests that erupted in 2019, demanding the dismantling of a corrupt political system.The group had morphed from a clean resistance organization comprising a tight-knit group of dedicated people to a more mafia-like structure. It became involved in drug production and trafficking along with the Assad family. It started to become a conglomerate inside Lebanon. It owned a bank and various businesses. Somehow it began to mimic the corrupt Lebanese political system, and became its main patron.As it expanded in the region, however, Hezbollah made too many enemies. While the group enjoyed some degree of Arab acquiescence while fighting Israel, it lost whatever legitimacy it had in the Arab world when it entered Syria and acted like a proxy of Iran as part of the latter’s quest for regional domination.The Israeli attack on Hezbollah last year using booby-trapped pagers and other communication devices, and the wider recent war on Lebanon, were a wake-up call for the group and its surviving leaders. They realized they had overstretched themselves by interfering in other countries in the region.The only way for Hezbollah to rebuild itself, then, is to return to its origins as an armed resistance to an Israeli occupation. The grievances in southern Lebanon are strong enough to fuel this project.Wafiq Safa was not entirely wrong, therefore, when he predicted that Hezbollah would eventually emerge stronger than it was before. However, this would be a very dangerous development as it would lead to another war. The authorities in Israel at present are unhinged, buttressed by a permissive administration in the US. This means that if any resistance does arise, the response from the Israelis will be extremely destructive to Lebanon.The US should be wise enough to realize that the continuing presence of Israeli forces in Lebanon, and their operations there with the aim of killing every member of Hezbollah, will only strengthen the group in the long run.For the sake of stability, Israel must withdraw and the Lebanese state must be strengthened. If this is done, Hezbollah will eventually be decommissioned as an armed movement. • Dr. Dania Koleilat Khatib is a specialist in US-Arab relations with a focus on lobbying.

Washington, Kyiv Headed Toward Deal For Ukrainian ‘Critical Miner...	The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are heading toward an agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are 'making progress' in reaching a deal. He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion, although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed. Zelenskyy called for security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any deal and said he wants better financial terms. 'I don’t want something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to pay back,' he said. The war hits the three-year mark on Monday. The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European Union. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s 'State of the Union' that he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week. Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the agreement. Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding. Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms made 'no sense' to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015. Zelenskyy said, 'I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe] Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan. And we don't have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like it and thinks that it's unjust. Maybe. I don't know. But here is what this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it's not about the figure. We simply don't see it as a loan.' Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and accused him of starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form of compensation guarantee. Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to 'understand' his position and come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend itself against the Russian invasion. 'I want very much from Trump understanding of each other,' Zelenskyy said at his news conference, adding: 'Security guarantees from Trump are much needed.' Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for Ukraine's entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to. 'If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready,' Zelenskyy said. 'I can exchange this for NATO [membership], if that condition is there, immediately.' The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading. 'I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,' Trump told U.S. state governors at the White House. 'They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,' Trump said of Ukraine. Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'in total alignment with the way we see things.' Witkoff said the war 'wouldn’t have had to happen' if Ukraine hadn’t been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the war. Witkoff said that eventually 'you’ll see concessions signed by both sides' in a peace deal. Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the Kyiv government. 'The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,' he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors. 'No one will ever sell off these territories,' Peskov said. 'That's the most important thing.' A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia. 'This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,' Peskov told state TV. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks on Ukraine, which he condemned as 'aerial terror.' Ukrainian officials reported damage in five regions of the country. Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 35 missiles of various types.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7kx3cU0zDwjT	2025-02-23T16:29:43-08:00	
Freedom For Secular Thought Still Eludes Bangladesh, A Decade Aft...	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury The climate for freedom of secular thought in Bangladesh remains bleak a decade after religious zealots murdered blogger Avijit Roy as he left a literary festival in Dhaka, family members, researchers and human rights advocates said. The killing of the Bangladeshi-born American citizen in February 2015 was the first in a spate of murders of secular writers and intellectuals at the hands of Muslim extremists that year and in 2016. 'The current atmosphere for secular thought in Bangladesh is absent. Ten years ago, the condition for secular thoughts was very bad,' Abul Kashem Fazlul Huq, a retired professor at Dhaka University, told BenarNews. 'Blogger Avijit Roy was killed for promoting secular thoughts, my son Dipan was killed for publishing his book. What fault did they have,' Kashem said, referring to his son, Faisal Arefin Dipan, who was fatally attacked in October 2015. Ten years on, the South Asian country is still unsafe for the secular community because the threat from violent extremism remains alive despite last year’s fall of the authoritarian government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, according to observers. It had cracked down hard on Islamic militants by launching a deadly counter-terrorism campaign in July 2016, in the wake of an overnight siege of the Holey Artisan café in Dhaka, where 24 people, many of them foreigners, were slaughtered by Muslim extremists. But the Hasina government executed a 'wrong' policy of countering militancy and terrorism that did not root out the problem, according to one researcher. 'During Sheikh Hasina’s rule, the law enforcement agencies conducted operations to kill militants and extremists to get applause, cash incentives and awards from the government,' Abul Kalam Azad told BenarNews. Since Bangladesh’s independence in the early 1970s, some leftist politicians and controversial intellectuals had attacked faith-based parties through anti-religion books and comments while propagating secularism, making the term 'secular' controversial, according to Kashem, Dipan’s father. 'Their anti-religion postures put the faith-based parties in existential threat. As a means of survival, those parties propagated secularism as anti-religion,' Kashem said. He noted that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina’s father who was Bangladesh’s founding leader and had led the independence movement to break away from Pakistan, defined secularism as a system where the state would not be a party to any religion. 'But the idea was not popularized,' Kashem said. 'Now, pro-Islamic parties dominate the political landscape,' he said. ‘Situation has deteriorated further’ On the night of Feb. 26, 2015, extremists who were later sentenced to death, fatally hacked with machetes Roy as he was exiting the Ekushey Book Fair in Dhaka. Roy had written books about freedom of secular thoughts and freedom of expression. His wife, Rafida Bonya Ahmed, was seriously injured in the attack. On Oct. 31, 2015, extremists killed Dipan, owner of the publishing house Jagriti where Roy’s books were printed. 'Definitely, the previous atmosphere was not conducive to freedom of secular thought and freedom of expression. But the situation has deteriorated further and now it has reached a dangerous level,' Anujit Roy, Avijit’s brother, told BenarNews. Anujit Roy said he did not know if any organization would mark the 10th anniversary because of security concerns. 'If not, then we the family members will observe his death anniversary at our house,' he said, noting that fears of violence had intensified since Hasina lost power. No support for secularism Maulana Mohiuddin Rabbani, a vice president of Hefazat-e-Islam, a conservative Islamic group, told BenarNews that religion was needed in Bangladesh. 'Secularism was imported to Bangladesh from India. But we don’t support or promote secularism. We believe that as the majority of Bangladesh are Muslims, the state religion must be Islam,' he said. 'But people from all religions can practice their respective religions as guaranteed by Islam,' Rabbani said. In recent months since an interim government took office in Bangladesh, religious zealots have obstructed several traditional cultural activities across the country. In late January, Islamists vandalized the venue hosting a female football match in Tilakpur, a sub-district in northern Joypurhat. Islamists were blamed for vandalizing a book stall on Feb. 10, during the month-long Ekushey Book Fair, for displaying a book of exiled Bangladeshi secular writer Taslima Nasrin. The Islamists alleged the book promoted atheism. Three days later, Sohel Hasan Galib was arrested and sent to jail for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through his poetry. On Feb. 12, zealots forced organizers to postpone the death anniversary of mystic poet Lalon in Modhupur, in Tangail district. A group in Bhuapur, in the same district, vandalized shops selling flowers for a spring festival on Feb. 15, leading organizers to scrap a scheduled kite festival in adjacent Gopalpur subdistrict. How Hasina handled militants Kalam Azad, the researcher and co-author of the first book on female militants in Bangladesh, said that the government under Hasina had wrongly accused many people of militancy. 'In my research, I found at least 50% of the alleged male and one-third of female militants were innocent victims. They were falsely implicated in terrorism charges with ill motives,' he told BenarNews. 'After Hasina’s fall, some groups have been trying to propagate that all alleged militants and extremists were innocent. But this is also not true,' Azad said. The researcher noted that people were panicking. 'I think the atmosphere for freedom of expression, freedom of thought and secular thought is not conducive right now due to existing bad political conditions,' he said. A former police inspector-general noted that the strategy for countering terrorism and violent extremism was flawed during Hasina’s tenure. 'The alleged militants were killed or arrested and imprisoned indefinitely without following proper judicial procedure,' Nur Mohammad told BenarNews. 'After the fall of her government, alleged militants or extremists were released,' he said. 'Now the question is whether we are free from the threat of violent extremism. The answer is, if there is no patronization, the idea will meet a natural death.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for interim government leader Muhammad Yunus said there was no room for violent extremism, adding that the government had anti-terrorism, counter terrorism, transnational crime units and other agencies working to counter violent extremism. 'We believe Bangladesh must have an atmosphere where both secular or non-secular people can express their opinion without any fear or persecution. At present, people can express their views without any fear. We want to establish a truly inclusive society free from fear and prejudice,' Shafiqul Alam told BenarNews.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7k3v2dZmQm4T	2025-02-23T16:26:19-08:00	
Pentagon Tells Gold Star Families: We’ll Find Loved Ones, Bring T...	By C. Todd Lopez In Sacramento, California, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency on Saturday held the largest-ever family member update in its history. More than 500 Gold Star families attended to learn how the agency is proceeding in efforts to repatriate the remains of service members who never returned home from the Vietnam War, the Korean War or World War II. Around the nation, the DPAA holds several family updates each year so the families of service members who went missing in action can meet with officials one-on-one to discuss the details of their cases. Since 1995, DPAA has conducted these family updates, reaching more than 31,000 family members through face-to-face meetings. Nearly 82,000 service members still remain unaccounted for from conflicts dating back to World War II. According to DPAA, 71,981 service members are missing from World War II, 7,444 are missing from the Korean War, 1,573 are missing from the Vietnam War, and 126 are missing from the Cold War. Finding those service members and bringing them home is the sacred duty of the DPAA, said Fern Sumpter Winbush, the principal deputy director of DPAA. 'Not only is this mission a sacred obligation, but it's a moral imperative,' she told families. 'The agency exists because there are unaccounted for ... there are men and women who gave their ultimate all. We serve the families because you are the ones that are still here. You are relying on us because we're the only ones that are doing this mission. We'll continue to put [the] mission first. We're not going to accept defeat. We'll never quit, and we're never going to leave a comrade behind.' Winbush told family members that the DPAA mission would take recovery operations to 33 territories and countries this year. The ability to do that requires building relationships with nations around the world to earn the trust needed to gain access. It's something she said the agency will continue to work on. Right now, she said, there are 10 ongoing missions in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines. Winbush also stressed to families in attendance the importance of getting family member DNA on file. 'We can't make an identification unless we have something to compare it to,' she said. 'For many of the unaccounted-for, we don't have the proper family reference samples on file. This is one way we work to collect them.' Also, she noted the number of young people attending the family member update and stressed how important it is that families keep other family members aware that a family member who served overseas never returned home and that the DPAA is still looking for them. 'We need third, fourth, and even fifth-generation families to stay on top of their loved one's loss,' Winbush said. 'We don't forget ... we have all of the records. But it's critically important that you stay on top of it so that the story can continue to be told.' She said it's common for DPAA to call families with a notification that a loved one has been found, only to find that some families were unaware or don't believe what they are being told. 'They don't know this mission exists,' she said. 'They don't believe that we're still searching for their great, great uncle [or] father ... from World War II,' she said. 'We've got to keep all of the families involved.' As part of the family member update, the DPAA also unveiled its annual poster, which will be used later this year to commemorate National POW/MIA Recognition Day, Sept. 19, 2025. This year's poster was created by artist Jeannie Huffman, the daughter of Navy Cmdr. Edward James Jacobs Jr., a Vietnam War pilot who never came home. He went missing Aug. 25, 1967, while piloting an RA-3B Skywarrior aircraft over the Gulf of Tonkin in North Vietnam. When her father left for Vietnam, Huffman was only two weeks old. She was just five months old when her mother learned her father went missing. She said her father had been able to hold her as an infant before he deployed for the war, but there's no record of that for her to look at today. 'One thing that kind of bothers me ... I have no photos of that,' she said. 'I wish I had a picture of him and me, and I don't.' Back in 2018, Huffman attended her first DPAA family member update in Greensboro, North Carolina. There was not a lot of information then about recovery efforts for her father, and this was because her father had been put into a non-recoverable status. Huffman's husband, Dave, explained what had happened. 'In 1993, when previous iterations of what's now the DPAA [were] charged with the mission, there was an order that came out to try to touch as many sites as possible,' he said. 'They got in a boat and went out to the grid coordinates of the last known location of the airplane and said there's no visible wreckage.' That finding resulted in Jacobs and the crewmen he was with being deemed unrecoverable — which stood until January 2024. However, the two did their own research and were later able to convince DPAA to begin anew in an effort to find Jeannie Huffman's father. 'We had a meeting with the DPAA in Washington, D.C., and we presented our research and investigation to them in November of 2023, and they revisited his case, and now his case and the two crewmen that were with him have all been changed from non-recoverable to active pursuit,' Dave Huffman said. This year's DPAA annual poster is not Jeannie Huffman's first for the agency. However, it is the first time one of her works will be used as part of the agency's official National POW/MIA Recognition Day commemoration. On the poster are five service members — four men and one woman — representing each service and the conflicts from which there remain service members who have not come home. 'It was important to capture all the conflicts of the POW/MIAs,' she said. Another aspect of the poster is that each individual photographed, representing each service and each conflict, is wearing period uniforms and gear. 'I believe that each of our missing is still seeking their way home, and they expect that our nation's promise will be kept, which is to bring them home,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7oN6RhcI9w8F	2025-02-23T16:23:12-08:00	
Iranian Officials Meet Lebanon’s President In Beirut	The parliament speaker and the foreign minister of Iran had a meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun in Beirut on Sunday. Speaker of the Iranian Parliament Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi have traveled to Beirut to take part in the funeral of the late leaders of Hezbollah, Seyed Hassan Nasrallah and Seyed Hashem Safieddine. The two Iranian officials held a meeting with Lebanese President Aoun and Foreign Minister Youssef Rajji at Baabda Palace, the official residence of the president of Lebanon, on Sunday morning. Lebanon is holding the funeral of former Hezbollah leader Nasrallah, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli air strike. The event is held at the Camille Chamoun sports stadium on the outskirts of Beirut. He will then be buried at a dedicated site nearby. Nasrallah was killed on September 27 in an Israeli air strike as he met commanders in a bunker in Beirut’s southern suburbs. The funeral also honors Hashem Safieddine, who led Hezbollah for one week after Nasrallah’s death before he was also killed in an Israeli attack. He will be buried separately in the south on Monday	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7v3axTY5jW56	2025-02-23T16:18:07-08:00	
Indonesia’s Secret Weapon For Korean Peace: Lessons From Cambodia...	Indonesia has long been recognized for its diplomatic finesse and commitment to non-alignment principles that have shaped its foreign policy since independence. With a 'Free Active' approach Indonesia has consistently advocated for peaceful conflict and resolution earning neutrality credibility on the international stage. The Korean Peninsula remains one of the most geopolitical persistent conflicts in modern history marked by divisions ideological military tensions and nuclear proliferation concerns. Although Indonesia is not primarily a mediator, its balanced diplomatic engagement in multilateral forums and its historical experience in peace facilitation position it as a promising facilitator of peace. This essay argues that Indonesia’s diplomatic engagement has informed Cambodians about a model of dialogue, which includes the China-South China Sea approach to building confidence measures. This model offers a viable path for fostering reconciliation and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Indonesia has maintained diplomatic relations with North Korea since 1964 and with South Korea since 1973. This dual engagement allows Indonesia to facilitate open channels of communication between both nations. Unlike major global powers that often take a more partisan stance, Indonesia's neutrality allows it to be perceived as an honest broker. This balanced approach aligns with the Cambodian conflict model of resolution where reconciliation was achieved through inclusive dialogue involving multiple factions. The Cambodian model emphasizes the integration of adversarial actors into a structured peace process that Indonesia could advocate for Koreans in negotiations. Indonesia has played an active role in multilateral diplomacy, particularly within ASEAN. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) serves as a platform for regional dialogue, with North Korea participating in its discussions. The 2023 ASEAN Summit highlighted security concerns, indirectly addressing the stability of the Korean Peninsula. ASEAN’s approach to dispute resolution, especially in the South China Sea, offers a useful model for Indonesia's role regarding Korea. The Sea China model is a confidence measures reduction risk and strategies engagement that could be applied to the Korean peninsula. The development of a security multilateral mechanism similar to ASEAN initiatives in the China-South Sea facilitates sustained engagement between North and South Korea. Indonesia also supports the United Nations resolutions for denuclearization, promoting peace, and encouraging solutions. Although Indonesia has not directly been involved in peacekeeping efforts on the Korean Peninsula its broader commitment to international security aligns with UN objectives leveraging these multilateral platforms Indonesia can promote dialogue and de-escalation efforts. Economic and cultural diplomacy are also critical components of Indonesia's approach. While Indonesia is a major economic partner of South Korea, its minimal trade with North Korea enables it to maintain a neutral stance. Rather than exerting economic pressure, Indonesia focuses on engagement policies. Track II diplomacy, including academic collaborations and cultural exchanges, fosters informal connections that contribute to long-term trust-building. Scholarships for North Korean students and academic exchanges foster connections among individuals, similar to the grassroots reconciliation efforts observed in the Cambodian model. Historically Indonesia has demonstrated its ability to host international dialogues such as the 1955 Conference Bandung and Jakarta Informal Meetings. These suggest precedents in Indonesia that served as neutral venues for Korean peace talks. In Cambodia, neutral venues played a significant role in ensuring inclusive participation among conflicting parties. Applying this strategy to Korea and Indonesia could create an environment in the North where South Korea can engage in direct discussions and influence the majority of global powers. Despite potential Indonesia significantly faces challenges facilitating peace on the Korean Peninsula as follows: 1. Geopolitical Complexities: The Korean Peninsula is heavily influenced by global superpowers particularly the United States and China. Both nations have strategic interests in the region and their involvement complicates independence diplomatic efforts. Indonesia must navigate geopolitical intricacies carefully to maintain neutrality encouraging constructive dialogue. 2 . North Korea’s Isolation: North Korea remains highly isolated economically and sanctions self-reliance. While Indonesia maintains diplomatic ties with Pyongyang the Korean North leadership's reluctance to engage externally in dialogue poses significant barriers. 3. Lack of Leverage: China, unlike the U.S., lacks direct economic or military leverage over the two Koreas. Its influence is primarily diplomatic, which may limit its ability to advocate for substantial policy changes. 4. Concerns about Security Trust and Deficit: Both Koreas have deep distrust rooted toward external mediators. While Indonesia's neutrality is an asset, engaging North and South Korea in Indonesia-led initiatives remains challenging. Additionally, regional security concerns, such as North Korea's nuclear program, complicate the situation further. To address these challenges, Indonesia must integrate strategies modeled after those of Cambodia and the South China Sea : 1. Establishing a Neutral Dialogue Platform: Drawing from the Cambodian model, Indonesia could advocate for an inclusive dialogue mechanism in which regional stakeholders and international players participate in structured negotiations. 2. Confidence Expanding-Building Measures: Inspired by the South Sea China model Indonesia could push for ASEAN-led initiatives such as joint crisis communication hotlines security systems and risk reduction exercises between North and South Korea. 3. Track Strengthening II Diplomacy: Expanding cultural exchanges, joint economic initiatives and educational programs gradually lay the groundwork for reconciliation. Trust Building through societal engagement will formally complement efforts diplomatic. 4. Utilizing Multilateral Leverage: Indonesia should continue leveraging the role of ASEAN and the UN to encourage sustained diplomatic efforts on the Korean Peninsula. Supporting regional security frameworks advocating peace for talks in international forums will enhance Indonesia's credibility. Indonesia’s nuanced approach to diplomacy is rooted in its'Free and Active' policies, which establish it as a credible facilitator for peace on the Korean Peninsula. By drawing on the lessons of the Cambodian model—which emphasizes dialogue inclusive—and the China South Sea model—which focuses on confidence building—Indonesia can contribute to conflict resolution efforts. While geopolitical challenges and North Korea's isolation pose security concerns and obstacles to Indonesia's diplomatic engagement and multilateral influence, Indonesia's historical role as a neutral mediator provides a solid foundation for peace efforts. Though Indonesia is not a primary mediator, its strategic engagement with ASEAN and experience in dialogue facilitation with the UN make it a key player in promoting stability and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. By integrating proven diplomatic frameworks, Indonesia can help bridge trust, foster collaboration, and contribute to a long-term resolution of one of the world's enduring conflicts.

Friendship Or Foreign Meddling? Trump’s $21 Million Bombshell Exp...	It began as vintage Trump: red-meat rhetoric, swaggering boasts, the electric thrum of a comeback tour. But in a single incendiary swipe, the former president detonated a geopolitical grenade. Speaking at a rally last week, Trump alleged that USAID—the U.S. government’s global aid arm—had quietly funnelled $21 million to India’s election machinery under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his self-proclaimed 'friend.' The claim, precise and pointed, ripped the lid off a Pandora’s box long sealed by diplomatic decorum. For the first time, Trump tethered Modi’s name to America’s shadowy election-finance labyrinth, casting Washington not as a watchdog of democracy but as an alleged architect of its manipulation. As outrage erupted across continents, the revelation laid bare a chilling paradox: in an age where foreign interference is a political death sentence, the U.S. now stands accused of pulling the strings—and Trump, the disruptor-in-chief, is holding the knife that slit the secrets open. The Forensic Breakdown: Trump’s Words, Modi’s Silence Trump’s statement, delivered at the Governor’s Working Association meeting, was not a mere off-the-cuff remark. It was a calculated disclosure, one that thrust Modi’s government into an unwelcome spotlight. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) called the claims 'deeply troubling.' The opposition Congress Party demanded a white paper detailing all USAID funds received under Modi’s tenure. Yet, Modi himself—India’s master orator, a leader who thrives on control over his image—has chosen to remain silent. Instead, the BJP and its media ecosystem scrambled to spin the narrative. First, they claimed vindication—that Trump’s comments proved foreign powers had conspired to meddle in India’s 2024 general election, a frequent BJP talking point. But Trump’s follow-up remarks shredded that defense. The money, he clarified, went to Modi. That revelation turned the tables, forcing Modi’s government into damage-control mode. A Pattern of Political Convenience This moment is not happening in isolation. The Modi government has repeatedly painted itself as a bulwark against Western influence, framing any external criticism as a neo-colonial attack on India’s sovereignty. Yet, it has gladly courted U.S. and European support when it suits its agenda—whether in trade, defense, or, as Trump’s comments suggest, electoral strategy. The USAID funding, as per Trump’s disclosure, was part of a broader $486 million package meant for 'election strengthening' worldwide. India’s $21 million slice was ostensibly aimed at increasing voter turnout—an anodyne phrase that now demands forensic scrutiny. Which voters? In which regions? And crucially, under whose directives? The Opposition Strikes Back The Congress Party, long accused by the BJP of appeasing the West, has seized on this scandal as proof of the Modi government’s double standards. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera framed it with brutal clarity: 'This is a matter between two ‘friends.’ But one ‘friend’ has betrayed another. Modiji, you owe a response to the country. Did you or did you not take $21 million from the U.S. to influence the elections in India?' This is not just rhetorical posturing. The implications are seismic. If U.S. funding was leveraged to influence voter behavior in India, it raises ethical and legal questions of staggering proportions. It also punctures the BJP’s long-standing claim of being the sole custodian of India’s nationalistic pride. USAID: A Benevolent Front or a Political Tool? For decades, USAID has positioned itself as an instrument of democracy-building. But the realpolitik of foreign aid is rarely that simple. Governments receiving aid often direct those funds toward programs that solidify their own political standing. And donor governments—especially the United States—have long wielded aid as a tool of influence, ensuring that recipient regimes remain aligned with their strategic interests. In this case, the 'voter turnout' initiative may well have been crafted with the noblest democratic intentions. But democracy promotion becomes suspect when it is selectively beneficial to one ruling party over another. This is precisely the charge now haunting Modi’s government. The Deafening Silence in Washington and Delhi Trump’s comments have forced both governments into an uneasy quiet. The Trump administration has refrained from commenting, wary of stepping into a controversy that could affect U.S.-India relations. In India, the silence from the ruling party is even more telling. For a leader who rarely misses an opportunity to shape the public discourse, Modi’s refusal to address the allegations suggests a crisis his government is still struggling to contain. Meanwhile, investigative reports have begun surfacing, suggesting that the $21 million in question may have actually been allocated for election-related programs in Bangladesh, not India. This raises a separate, but equally troubling, question: Was Trump misinformed, or was he deliberately misleading his audience? If the latter, what was his motive? Was this an attempt to entangle Modi in controversy as an implicit bargaining chip for future negotiations? The Real Stakes: India’s Democratic Integrity At its core, this controversy is about far more than just one funding allocation. It’s about the integrity of India’s democracy. If the Modi government knowingly accepted external funds for election-related activities, it shatters the myth that India’s electoral process is invulnerable to foreign influence. If the funds were used to engineer favorable voter turnout, it amounts to nothing less than a manipulation of democratic will. The opposition’s demand for a white paper is not just political theatre—it’s a necessary step toward transparency. India’s voters deserve to know whether their democracy was subtly, insidiously, influenced by external forces. They also deserve to know why their prime minister has refused to confront this issue head-on. The Final Reckoning Trump’s remarks have ignited a fire that neither Washington nor New Delhi can easily extinguish. The Modi government, which has built its brand on self-reliance and nationalist pride, now faces a credibility crisis of its own making. The BJP’s silence will not hold forever. Sooner or later, Modi will have to answer: Did he or did he not benefit from $21 million in U.S. funding for voter turnout? For now, the silence is deafening. But in politics, silence is rarely a sign of strength. More often, it is the prelude to a reckoning.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7iiSojihFiHN	2025-02-23T16:02:39-08:00	
Before The Storm: How Microgrids Can Future-Proof Our Power Suppl...	When you want to buy an apartment, you are very concerned about the quality of tiles on the floor, the quality of plumbing, the quality of fixtures in the bathrooms, the quality of the appliances in the kitchen. But how many people ask whether this building adheres to the latest seismic safety codes?,' notes Kamal Kishore, Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General (SRSG) for Disaster Risk Reduction and Head of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). His point is clear: we often overlook critical resilience factors in infrastructure planning, yet as climate change drives more frequent and severe disasters, the consequences of such oversight are becoming increasingly dire. Recent findings from the UNDRR's Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction indicate a dramatic surge in the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters over the past two decades. Between 2000 and 2021, 83% of major power outages in the U.S. were due to extreme weather events, while globally, economic losses from disasters reached $2.97 trillion between 2010 and 2019. Moreover, extreme weather-related power disruptions increased by 78% between 2011 and 2021, underscoring the urgent need for resilient infrastructure. 'Extreme weather events that used to occur once in a century now happen every 20 years, and in a number of major disasters such as cyclones and earthquakes, we have seen that 40% of infrastructure damage is in the power sector, in the energy systems,' Kishore highlights. As the current power grid is not designed to withstand the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather 'we have to come up with plausible worst-case scenarios and develop preparedness planning according to those scenarios. This means that if you invest in infrastructure, you must also put aside money for its maintenance. If you don't do so, it comes back to haunt you'. In the event of extreme events such as cyclones or earthquakes, maintaining power supply is critical for emergency response and recovery efforts. According to Saeed Manshadi, Associate Professor at the College of Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the San Diego State University, renewable energy sources and microgrids are already playing a crucial role in ensuring energy supply during natural disasters. 'Given that renewable energy sources are locally available, we can install local battery and solar as distributed energy resources to energize microgrids as building blocks for the future smart grid. Under national disaster scenarios, while most of the time distribution and transmission lines are down, microgrids enable self-sufficient and self-healing capabilities for the local grid.' Compared to traditional centralised grids, new generation microgrids are particularly effective in disaster-prone regions. 'Microgrids enable grids to locally supply mission-critical facilities under blackout conditions. If they are self-sustainable, meaning they have enough battery storage and renewable energy resources available, they can maintain essential services,' explains Manshadi. In areas vulnerable to hurricanes, wildfires, and floods, microgrids can prevent catastrophic power outages and allow communities to function autonomously until the main grid is restored. 'Think of a situation where you’re in a very hot zone, flooded with Wi-Fi disruptions, or hit by a hurricane, and the main grid fails. Microgrids provide localised control, allowing essential infrastructure — like hospitals and emergency shelters — to continue operating'. However, in order to fully exploit the potential of green microgrids as useful tools in disaster resilience, a number of technical obstacles must be overcome. The major is to deal with a century-old energy delivery system, based on AC (alternative current), while in order to maximise yield and not waste energy and money, renewable energy based microgrids must operate through DC (direct current). One of the most promising advances in resilient energy solutions is the development of hybrid microgrids, which integrate renewable energy sources with advanced power management technologies. Eduardo Garcia-Martinez, Technical Director of Tigon, a European project aimed at enhancing the reliability and resilience of decentralised renewables-based power systems, explains: 'If there is an issue with the external AC grid, our microgrid can operate autonomously by shutting down the AC connection. With integrated battery storage and renewable energy generation, it ensures continuity of supply even in case of a blackout'. A key breakthrough of this project is the implementation of a 3,000-volt DC voltage level. 'Most DC microgrids today operate from 700V to 1,500V. We are pushing the limits with 3,000V, which allows us to transfer more power with lower current, increasing efficiency while reducing material costs and the need for extensive copper wiring,' he highlights. Another solution developed within this EU-funded project is the integration of solid-state transformers (SST), which facilitate seamless energy conversion. 'The SSTs enable DC generation and DC loads to be integrated more efficiently, avoiding unnecessary AC-DC-AC conversions that waste energy,' García explains. This approach enhances grid efficiency and resilience by minimising energy loss and stabilizing decentralised networks— an essential step in mitigating disaster-induced power failures. 'We’ve already achieved the main milestone of generating 3,000V. Now we need to integrate photovoltaic generation, batteries, and interconnections with other DC microgrids to prove feasibility,' García notes. If successful, this could pave the way for widespread adoption of hybrid microgrids useful in climate disaster prevention. Kamal Kishore, who has been observing and addressing issues related with catastrophic events around the world for 30 years, adds: 'A microgrid is great in terms of its modularity, and hence, less interconnection. This modularity is a source of resilience, so investing in microgrids is essentially investing in local resilience'. Manshadi agrees: 'Microgrids can supply their own community within the boundaries and supply mission critical facilities under the blackout. Especially if they are self-sustainable'. But the benefits of microgrids extend beyond resilience. As Kishore points out, they also contribute to energy affordability: 'Green power generated by microgrids brings costs down. While technical challenges remain — such as storage capacity — over the lifecycle of energy infrastructure, the investment in renewables and decentralized grids makes eminent sense. A very attractive proposition, particularly in the context of renewables, where you produce energy locally, and you consume it locally'. Despite the promise of microgrids, major policy and financial hurdles remain. 'We need more policies supporting distributed energy resources,' Manshadi stresses. 'Utilities are already overwhelmed with disaster risk and decarbonisation mandates. Policymakers need to enable third-party entities to take part in the expansion of distributed energy solutions'. Kamal Kishore echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the need for long-term investment in resilience: 'We need greater public awareness, not just for efficient post-disaster responses, but to prevent risks from emerging in the first place'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7lHkdhQaoqJq	2025-02-23T15:59:53-08:00	
Democratic Republic Of Congo: Locals Call For Prayer As 70 Bodies...	By Sabrine Amboka Locals at a village in the embattled North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are appealing for prayers after approximately 70 bodies were found inside a church building in the village. Local sources contacted by Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) International said the killings took place between Feb. 12 and Feb. 15 in Maiba, a village in the eastern region of the DRC. In a report that ACN published on Feb. 21, the sources said that on Feb. 12, rebels from an Islamist terrorist group, originally from Uganda, entered the village and took approximately 100 people hostage. The sources recounted that on Feb. 15, about 70 bodies were discovered inside a Protestant church. 'Many of them had been bound and some beheaded. Among the victims were women, children, and the elderly,' said the source, which ACN did not identify for fear of reprisals from the many armed groups that operate in the region. 'It is likely that these victims were unable to resist or endure the forced march, because when the rebels take hostages, they make them travel with them, either as reinforcements for their group or as forced labor for the war effort,' the source is quoted as telling ACN. According to the source, abductors force people to carry the loot after raiding villages. 'If you get tired on the way, you’re done,' the source told ACN. 'I believe that is what happened to these 70 people.' According to the same sources, the Maiba massacre was carried out by the armed Islamist group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which operates in Uganda and the DRC and has terrorized the local population for over a decade. 'The Islamic groups have stepped up their attacks and raids in remote villages, killing thousands of Congolese civilians. Before they used to be in other areas, but now it is Lubero which is being attacked,' the local source told ACN. The source shared that fear has gripped the village because the residents believe that the terrorists have local collaborators who facilitate their operations. This Maiba massacre comes at a very delicate time for the region, given the worsening of the humanitarian situation in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, which have seen heavy terrorization by another armed group, the March 23 Movement (M23) rebels. Reportedly supported by neighboring Rwanda and the Congolese armed forces, the M23 has taken important cities and outposts in the region, including Goma and Bukavu, amid heavy fighting. ACN’s local sources have expressed fear that over the next few days, M23 will take Butembo, North Kivu’s second-largest city, as it did Goma and Bukavu. 'We are living through very, very difficult times. We are expecting the rebels to enter the city any moment now, as they are only 70 kilometers [about 44 miles] away from here. There is a lot of psychological suffering in Butembo, because the war is literally at our door. We have seen how other regions were overrun by chaos, and now it seems it is our turn,' the source is quoted as saying. The source concluded with a call for prayers, imploring: 'Let us pray. Prayer is what keeps our hope alive amidst this situation we are living through.' This story was first published by ACI Africa, CNA's news partner in Africa, and has been adapted by CNA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7qvOC380oLRX	2025-02-23T15:56:15-08:00	
Why GPT Can’t Think Like Us	Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models like GPT-4, has shown impressive performance on reasoning tasks. But does AI truly understand abstract concepts, or is it just mimicking patterns? A new study from the University of Amsterdam and the Santa Fe Institute reveals that while GPT models perform well on some analogy tasks, they fall short when the problems are altered, highlighting key weaknesses in AI’s reasoning capabilities. Analogical reasoning is the ability to draw a comparison between two different things based on their similarities in certain aspects. It is one of the most common methods by which human beings try to understand the world and make decisions. An example of analogical reasoning: cup is to coffee as soup is to ??? (the answer being: bowl) Large language models like GPT-4 perform well on various tests, including those requiring analogical reasoning. But can AI models truly engage in general, robust reasoning or do they over-rely on patterns from their training data? This study by language and AI experts Martha Lewis (Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the University of Amsterdam) and Melanie Mitchell (Santa Fe Institute) examined whether GPT models are as flexible and robust as humans in making analogies. ‘This is crucial, as AI is increasingly used for decision-making and problem-solving in the real world’, explains Lewis. Comparing AI models to human performance Lewis and Mitchell compared the performance of humans and GPT models on three different types of analogy problems: Letter sequences – Identifying patterns in letter sequences and completing them correctly. Digit matrices – Analyzing number patterns and determining the missing numbers. Story analogies – Understanding which of two stories best corresponds to a given example story. A system that truly understands analogies should maintain high performance even on variations In addition to testing whether GPT models could solve the original problems, the study examined how well they performed when the problems were subtly modified. ‘A system that truly understands analogies should maintain high performance even on these variations’, state the authors in their article. GPT models struggle with robustness Humans maintained high performance on most modified versions of the problems, but GPT models, while performing well on standard analogy problems, struggled with variations. ‘This suggests that AI models often reason less flexibly than humans and their reasoning is less about true abstract understanding and more about pattern matching’, explains Lewis. In digit matrices, GPT models showed a significant drop in performance when the position of the missing number changed. Humans had no difficulty with this. In story analogies, GPT-4 tended to select the first given answer as correct more often, whereas humans were not influenced by answer order. Additionally, GPT-4 struggled more than humans when key elements of a story were reworded, suggesting a reliance on surface-level similarities rather than deeper causal reasoning. On simpler analogy tasks, GPT models showed a decline in performance decline when tested on modified versions, while humans remained consistent. However, for more complex analogical reasoning tasks, both humans and AI struggled. Weaker than human cognition This research challenges the widespread assumption that AI models like GPT-4 can reason in the same way humans do. ‘While AI models demonstrate impressive capabilities, this does not mean they truly understand what they are doing’, conclude Lewis and Mitchell. ‘Their ability to generalize across variations is still significantly weaker than human cognition. GPT models often rely on superficial patterns rather than deep comprehension.’ This is a critical warning for the use of AI in important decision-making areas such as education, law, and healthcare. AI can be a powerful tool, but it is not yet a replacement for human thinking and reasoning.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWekbpKNgd6a7nLDoD_XO2aE	2025-02-23T15:52:43-08:00	
The Transformation Of Ukraine’s Arms Industry Amid War With Russi...	By Kateryna Kuzmuk and Lorenzo Scarazzato Three years on from Russia’s escalation of its war on Ukraine with the full-scale invasion, Ukraine faces mounting military challenges. At the same time, there is growing uncertainty about future military assistance from the United States under the Trump administration. This makes the question of Ukraine’s ability to supply its own military needs and its reliance on aid all the more pertinent. Since February 2022, Ukraine has relied heavily on foreign military aid for its defence against Russia. Its domestic arms industry has also been able to increase production and develop its capabilities significantly. In 2023 Ukraine’s largest arms producer, Joint-Stock Company Ukrainian Defense Industry (formerly UkrOboronProm), achieved a 69 per cent year-on-year increase in arms revenues to $2.2 billion—the fastest increase and highest revenues the company has ever recorded. As Ukraine seeks to rapidly strengthen and modernize its military capabilities amid the conflict, numerous smaller producers have appeared, along with emerging joint ventures with foreign companies, creating a more vibrant, diverse and innovative sector. This topical backgrounder examines how Ukraine’s arms industry has transformed during the Russia-Ukraine war. From the Soviet legacy to specialization Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine inherited around 30 per cent of the Soviet arms industry, including both production capacity and research and development facilities. This legacy comprised around 700 enterprises with over 1 million employees, making it the most capable part of the newly independent Ukraine’s manufacturing sector. Ukraine’s inherited production base was particularly strong in manufacturing missiles, transport aircraft, tanks, surface ships, and both marine and aero engines. It also included facilities for the production of munitions, explosives, radar systems, communications equipment and military optical devices. Notable examples of arms producers included Pivdenmash, the producer of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles, and Antonov, the company behind the An-124 Ruslan and An-225 Mriya, formerly the largest transport aircraft in the world. Despite this, Ukraine did not have anything approaching self-sufficiency in arms production. Before 1991, Ukraine’s arms industries had been integrated into a network spanning all Soviet republics, with the overwhelming majority of final arms production concentrated in Russia. Developing the missing capabilities within Ukraine would have required costly restructuring and investment, which the country, caught in a severe economic crisis, could not afford. At the same time, the shifting military-political environment made arms production less of a priority. Following the end of the cold war, many countries reduced their military expenditure and started converting parts of their military industrial capacity to civilian production, and Ukraine followed suit. Under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear missile capabilities and significantly reduce its arsenal of conventional weapons. Most of its military budget went to the basic upkeep of the armed forces, with only a small portion allocated to the maintenance and development of the arms industry. As a result, the number of arms-producing enterprises in Ukraine had already fallen by nearly two thirds to reach 267 by mid 1993, and continued to decline in the following years. With limited domestic investment and procurement budgets, Ukrainian arms producers turned to the export of modernized Soviet-era equipment, technology transfers and joint ventures. This approach helped the industry to maintain a degree of economic viability and to preserve some technological capabilities. Competitive pricing and the proven durability of its systems enabled Ukraine to secure new export markets in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. As a result, for nearly two decades after 1993, Ukraine nearly always ranked among the world’s top 15 arms exporters. The wake-up call of 2014 Following Russia’s invasion of Crimea and the Donbas region in 2014, there was an urgent need to strengthen Ukraine’s defensive capabilities. In response, the government began steadily increasing military spending. Where the military procurement budget in 2014 was $62 million, by 2021 it had increased 13 times over, reaching $836 million. While much of the procurement budget was spent on imports, a surge in domestic orders fueled an expansion of the Ukrainian arms industry. The industry was, however, still plagued by a culture of secrecy, clientelism and corruption—another legacy of Soviet times—which even after 2014 not only weakened Ukraine’s military capabilities and delayed the development of critical military systems but also deterred Western investors. These problems were especially prevalent within UkrOboronProm, the conglomerate that oversaw more than 100 state-owned companies and served as the primary supplier to Ukraine’s armed forces. It was not until 2020, under pressure from civil society and foreign governments and also driven by a growing willingness for political intervention, that Ukraine began reforming its arms industry to address widespread corruption and inefficiency. The reforms included the creation of a new Ministry of Strategic Industries, the introduction of more transparent arms procurement procedures, an overhaul of leadership in state institutions and state-owned arms companies, and the corporatization of enterpriseswithin UkrOboronProm. Despite some progress, particularly in leadership changes, many of the reforms stalled or remained unimplemented due to funding constraints and bureaucratic inertia. Problems in the state-owned industries also led to the rise of private arms companies, which often surpassed their state-owned competitors in production efficiency, innovation and adaptability to the military’s needs. In 2015, 25 per cent of state orders went to private companies. By 2020 this share had more than doubled to 54 per cent, whereas state enterprises received 36 per cent and the remaining 10 per cent were imports. The expansion of Ukraine’s arms industry after 2014, along with reform efforts and the rising role of the private sector, laid the groundwork for increased arms production and technological innovation in the years that followed. Adapting under fire Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 presented Ukraine’s evolving arms industry with a new set of challenges. Proximity to active combat zones and targeted attacks severely disrupted production at many factories. In the first two years of active hostilities, major arms producers suffered significant losses. According to a report by the Kyiv School of Economics assessing damage during the first two years of the war, engine manufacturer Motor Sich and aircraft producer Antonov alone reported damage amounting to a combined $601 million in industrial assets. As a result, companies were forced to adapt by relocating and restructuring production. Nevertheless, Ukraine’s arms industrial capacity recovered quickly as the country shifted to a wartime economy. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has allocated more than 50 per cent of government expenditures to the military, significantly increasing funding for its arms industry. By 2023, government spending on arms and dual-use goods surged to 20 times the 2021 level, reaching $30.8 billion. Although a substantial portion of the procurement budget went into purchasing weapons from abroad, Ukrainian arms companies were able to restore and even expand their production capabilities. By 2024, approximately 500 arms producers were reported to be operational in Ukraine, collectively employing nearly 300 000 people. In the past three years, Ukraine’s arms production capacity has grown not only in terms of volume but also of the range of military hardware that can be produced. This growth has been largely driven by the development of new technologies, as the scale and nature of the war have created a demand for military innovation. One of the most notable advancements has been in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), with Ukraine significantly increasing the number of domestically produced UAV models. Technological progress has been further accelerated by government initiatives, such as Brave1, a state-led platform that provides assistance to military technology developers and fosters collaboration between industry stakeholders. In just under two years since its launch, Brave1 has grown to support over 1500 military technology start-ups. Resilient but still reliant Thanks to coordinated efforts by Ukraine’s government, private sector and civil society, the Ukrainian arms industry has been able to rapidly modernize and grow in response to the war. Despite this, the industry is still hampered by outdated technology, financial constraints and inefficient spending. The Ukrainian war effort remains highly dependent on Western arms, whether provided as aid or imported on commercial terms. Since 2022 Ukraine has managed to start domestic production of certain types of weaponry that it has received hitherto from abroad, such as globally scarce artillery and tank ammunition. However, it is still a long way from being able to produce alternatives to all the imported systems it uses on the battlefield. A significant portion of procurement funds are thus spent on purchasing weapons from abroad, which does not facilitate the development of the domestic industry. To address this, Ukraine is striving to implement new production technologies through cooperation with partners. Arms producers from the United States and Europe have been increasing their presence in Ukraine, with companies such as Rheinmetall, KNDS and AeroVironment opening production facilities and forming joint ventures with Ukrainian producers. These collaborations not only help in the modernization of Ukraine’s arms industry but also accelerate the standardization of Ukrainian-made armaments to NATO requirements, advancing the country’s long-standing ambition of Euro-Atlantic integration. To further stimulate the development of its arms industry, Ukraine has managed to engage Western partners through special programmes aimed at financing its domestic arms production. While it is still short of its $10 billion objective, by 2024 Ukraine had raised over $1.5 billion for investment in its domestic arms industry from nine Western donor countries under a new programme called Zbroyari (armourers) Manufacturing Freedom. Partnerships with Western companies have also catalysed long-overdue reforms, with partners urging Ukraine to address corruption and inefficiency in its arms companies. A notable example is the ongoing corporatization of UkrOboronProm, including its transformation from a state conglomerate into a joint-stock company. The transformation includes a plan to introduce Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) corporate governance standards across the numerous state-run arms companies under its control, to enforce transparent management practices and make them increasingly attractive to foreign investments. The steps mentioned above are undoubtedly helping to develop and expand the Ukrainian arms industry, and thus to increase the country’s ability to supply its own military needs. However, at least in the short term, Ukraine will remain heavily reliant on military aid for its defence, making it vulnerable to the whims of its partners. In an unpredictable geopolitical landscape, Ukraine needs to reduce this reliance and build a resilient arms industry sector that can serve as much of the country’s military needs as possible. Recent developments seem to be heading in the right direction to achieve those ends: prioritizing innovation and technological advancement along with fostering a competitive, transparent market should help to create an environment that is more attractive to sustained foreign investment, ensuring that the industry is economically viable in the longer term.

How ASEAN Nations Shape South China Sea Policies Around China – A...	Tensions between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea have been making more headlines in 2025 after escalating alarmingly last year. Some other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), meanwhile, are trying to maintain good relations with their big neighbor to the north, whose economic and political influence is only growing in importance, while protecting their interests in the disputed waterway. Reporters from RFA and BenarNews look at how three countries in the South China Sea are approaching relations with China. INDONESIA: Growing openness toward China In November 2024, Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto stunned South China Sea watchers with a sentence in a joint statement issued in China on his first overseas trip since becoming president. The seemingly innocuous line explained that Jakarta and Beijing had reached an 'important common understanding on joint development in areas of overlapping claims' in the South China Sea. But analysts were quick to point out that by acknowledging overlapping maritime boundaries, Prabowo and his officials had effectively acknowledged the legitimacy of China’s claims, something Indonesia had never done before. Indonesia had always insisted that China’s so-called nine-dash line, which it uses on its maps to claim historic rights over most of the South China Sea, has no legal basis, as seen in a note verbale to the United Nations in May 2020. Indonesia realized the mistake and issued a correction two days later, saying mutual recognition of differences and disputes does not equal accepting the other side’s legitimacy and China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea still lacked legal basis. Muhammad Waffaa Kharisma, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta said that nevertheless, there has been 'a shift toward a closer relationship that could reduce Jakarta’s assertiveness in the South China Sea under President Prabowo Subianto.' China is Indonesia’s largest trading partner and one of its biggest sources of foreign direct investment, and expanding economic ties have been a major factor in Jakarta’s decision-making. This year, Indonesia became the first Southeast Asia member of the BRICS bloc led by China. Raden Mokhamad Luthfi, a defense analyst at Al Azhar University Indonesia said that there was growing openness toward China, not just in trade and investment but also in security cooperation. Prabowo’s dominant role in foreign policy appears to have sidelined Indonesia’s ministry of foreign affairs, he said. 'I am concerned that under Prabowo’s leadership, Indonesian diplomats may have less space to provide input and guidance on how the country’s foreign policy should be shaped,' Luthfi said. Waffaa noted a sense that 'Indonesia is increasingly practicing self-censorship when dealing with China.' 'One possible explanation is China’s proactive diplomatic approach, which includes strong responses, or even retaliatory measures, against criticism,' he said. 'This makes Indonesia more cautious, possibly fearing economic repercussions and as a result, it has become difficult to openly address concerns over sovereignty and international law.' Indonesia is one of the founding members of ASEAN and long served as its de facto leader, playing a crucial role in mediating regional crises. Analysts warned that its leadership in the group on the South China Sea issue would wane if it stopped championing international legal norms. Indonesia has repeatedly said it is not a party to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. But its law enforcement agencies have had to deal with encroachment and illegal fishing, including by Chinese vessels in the waters off the Natuna islands. A major question now is whether warming relations will keep encroachments at bay. MALAYSIA: Aligning with China’s preferences? Malaysia’s leaders have always seen China as an important neighbor and partner with which they have to navigate a complex relationship. The two countries established a comprehensive partnership in 2013 and China is Malaysia’s top economic partner, with trade worth more than U.S. $200 billion in 2022. In comparison, Malaysia-U.S. trade was $73 billion in the same year. Since coming to power in 2022, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has made it clear that fostering good ties with China is one of his priorities. Regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea, Malaysia’s long-standing policy has been to protect its sovereignty via international law. Malaysia has never recognized China’s nine-dash line and even ordered the removal of a scene from an animated movie that showed it. Yet some of the prime minister’s comments have stirred controversy. In March 2024, in a speech at the Australian National University in Canberra, Anwar said that countries needed to put themselves in China’s shoes and that trying to block its economic and technological advancement would only bring grievances. In November, after meeting President Xi Jinping in Beijing, Anwar said that Malaysia was 'ready to negotiate' on the South China Sea, suggesting bilateral negotiations over conflicting claims in the waters off the coast of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia. At the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in January, once again the Malaysian leader stated that China should not be singled out for the tensions in the South China Sea, striking a clear pro-Beijing tone. 'Malaysia’s desire to exclude other countries, such as Australia, Japan and the United States, from South China Sea disputes aligns with China’s preferences,' wrote Euan Graham, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. 'It also helps China’s behind-the-scenes efforts to influence negotiations with ASEAN on a code of conduct for the South China Sea,' Graham added. China and ASEAN have been discussing the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea for years but have yet to reach a final agreement. In February, during a trip to Brunei, Anwar called for the code to be completed 'as soon as possible' to address escalating tensions in the waterway. Malaysia is the ASEAN chair this year. 'I believe Malaysia prefers to settle the issue among the stakeholders through dialogue and engagement without any intervention from outside,' said Lee Pei May, assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at the International Islamic University Malaysia. 'If there is intervention from outside powers, I believe the situation would be chaotic,' Lee said. 'The U.S., U.K. and other powers, they are not directly related to the dispute so they are considered outside powers.' The U.S. and its regional allies, for their part, argue that they are also Pacific nations, and have an interest in a free and open Indo-Pacific. Some analysts said that the Anwar administration, despite being criticized for its seemingly pro-Beijing stance, had not compromised Malaysia’s claims in the South China Sea. 'To be sure, Malaysia has adopted a very different approach to the South China Sea dispute than either Vietnam or the Philippines,' said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. Anwar’s policy still 'allows Malaysia to maintain close ties with China while asserting its territorial claims and protecting its sovereign rights,' he said. VIETNAM: A balancing act On Feb. 19, Beijing for the first time officially and publicly denounced Vietnam’s island-building activities in the South China Sea. Foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said that China opposed construction on 'illegally occupied islands and reefs,' referring to the features that Vietnam began reclaiming in the 2020s. It is not a secret that Vietnam wants to strengthen defenses against China’s dominance in the Spratly islands and the island-building activities have received strong support from the Vietnamese public as the sign of a refusal to compromise on sovereignty. 'If you listen to leaders’ speeches on both sides, Vietnam-China relations appear to be warm and flourishing,' said Dinh Kim Phuc, a South China Sea researcher. 'But Hanoi’s developments in the South China Sea show that they don’t really trust each other very much.' With China’s first public protest against the island building, it seems that an 'informal understanding' with Vietnam is over, noted Bill Hayton, an associate fellow at the British think-tank Chatham House. This tacit compromise meant that for a few years, Vietnam did not look for oil and gas inside China’s nine-dash line and China said nothing about Vietnam’s island-building activities, Hayton said. There may be several explanations for China’s objection but analysts believe Vietnam’s expanding ties with the United States is a major factor. Looking at overseas trips by Vietnam’s leaders, including the new Communist Party chief To Lam, Vietnam also seems to 'emphasize the values of ASEAN and the West' in its strategic thinking, according to Phuc. Vietnam has been reported as wanting to elevate ties with fellow ASEAN members Indonesia and Singapore to comprehensive strategic partnerships, the highest level of bilateral relations, this year. But that doesn’t mean that a decoupling from China would happen any time soon, analysts say, as Vietnam’s economy depends greatly on Chinese trade and investment. On the same day that China criticized Vietnam’s 'illegal occupation' in the South China Sea, Vietnam’s parliament approved a multi-billion-dollar railway running from the Chinese border to the South China Sea. Part of the funding is expected to come from China, despite some public unease about the potential debt. Gestures by General Secretary To and other leaders that can be seen as 'pro-West' or 'anti-China' are deemed as 'merely populist' by Dang Dinh Manh, a Vietnamese dissident lawyer now living in the U.S. 'They need to appease the general domestic public, which is increasingly nationalistic,' Manh said, adding that in his opinion the Hanoi leadership needed to appease China, too, and how to strike a balance can be 'a serious task', especially when it comes to sovereignty in the South China Sea.

The Case For Carbon Taxes In Southeast Asia – Analysis	By Subhramit Das Southeast Asia’s climate crisis is hardly a new phenomenon, with extreme weather events disproportionately affecting its populations and economies. But as public support for carbon taxes grows, governments in the region have a rare opportunity to implement effective carbon pricing policies that curb emissions while addressing economic and social concerns. The Asian Development Bank’s 2024 climate change perception survey of 14 Asian economies found that there is widespread public support for introducing carbon taxes as a measure to limit emissions. Another 2024 survey by the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute indicated that over 70 per cent of the respondents from across Southeast Asia supported a national carbon tax, and 93 per cent of that segment were willing to bear the personal costs that might arise from a carbon tax. These survey results lend urgency to Asian governments to explore the effectiveness of carbon taxes. The ‘polluter pays’ principle in economics argues that those responsible for creating pollution are responsible for managing it. Greenhouse gas emissions are a by-product of economic activity that impact society as they contribute to climate change, reduce quality of life and can be lethal, causing an estimated 4.2 million associated deaths worldwide in 2019. By imposing a price on emissions through a carbon tax, polluters are forced to internalise this cost. The key benefit of a carbon tax is that it provides businesses with a predictable path for controlling emissions, which helps them plan their shift to low-carbon technologies. In 2025, Singapore’s carbon tax rate is S$25 (US$18.4) per tonne of emissions. This will increase to between S$50–80 (US$37–59) per tonne by 2030. Singapore’s polluters are paying a low price initially while they develop and implement low-carbon technologies. The primary objection to a carbon tax regime has been its regressive nature — it disproportionately impacts lower-income households. Some countries have tried to get around this by introducing tax breaks, credits and targeted public spending that make the carbon tax revenue neutral. Canada’s British Columbia province introduced a carbon tax in 2008 and has been distributing the revenues as tax benefits for low-income households, as well as introducing tax cuts for small businesses to ensure they are not disproportionately affected by the carbon tax. Norway’s carbon tax revenue goes toward its Government Pension Fund Global. As of 2024, 39 countries have implemented a carbon tax. Most of the Nordic countries have had carbon taxation in place since the early 1990s. Carbon tax has directly caused a reduction in emissions in these countries. In 2015, Sweden reported a 30 per cent drop in emissions as a direct result of the tax scheme. The United Kingdom introduced a carbon tax on the power sector in 2013, which reduced electricity-related emissions by 26 per cent in just three years. Asia is facing headwinds from the European Union with the imposition of its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from 2026, which puts a price on carbon emitted during production of goods that enter the European Union. As the European Union is the ASEAN region’s third largest trading partner, it is imperative for the region’s governments to implement carbon pricing. But Asian policymakers must tread carefully as introducing any new tax is often a political minefield. The failure of carbon taxes in Australia is a cautionary tale, but there are ways to counterpublic dissatisfaction. Phasing in carbon taxes, as seen in Singapore, lets the public experience the costs and benefits of the taxation without being immediately onerous. Spending the tax revenues on initiatives that mitigate climate change seems to increase support for a carbon tax among voters. Japan — the first Asian country to implement a carbon tax — uses the revenues to support renewable energy projects and develop energy-saving technologies. Redistributing carbon tax revenue to support those disproportionately affected, especially as the taxes ramp up over time, will also help soften the blow. A 2022 study by the German Institute of Development and Sustainability estimated that a carbon tax of US$50 per tonne of emissions would increase poverty by 20 per cent in South Asia without revenue redistribution. But through revenue redistribution, carbon tax could alleviate poverty and reduce inequality worldwide. The key to winning support for carbon taxes is effective communication with stakeholders well ahead of implementation through public consultations. Governments should focus on the benefits of carbon taxes for society at large, such as improved atmospheric visibility and quality of life, neutralising the effects on low-income households and the overall economic impact of the green transition. While countries have the option of achieving carbon pricing through an emissions trading system, a carbon tax regime yields the greatest benefits for developing countries in Asia. To ensure enforcement, governments should impose the carbon tax upstream on fossil fuels. Developing nations typically have large informal sectors with limited enforcement capacity, so an upstream carbon tax is a necessary safeguard. With greater institutional knowledge and experience in carbon pricing, developing countries can move toward a hybrid approach with carbon taxes for some sectors and emissions trading systems for others. CBAM is a wake-up call for governments in the ASEAN region to urgently review incoming external carbon pricing mechanisms and counter their economic impacts. Developing nations are disproportionately impacted by extreme weather events, so their populations know well how important it is to rein in emissions. Given the region’s broad support for a carbon tax, this might be an opportune time to test its feasibility.

Nazism, Fascism, And Communism: Warring Sons To A Common Father –...	By Amirhossein Ojaqfaqihi What if two of history’s most infamous ideologies—Nazism and Fascism—shared more in common fundamentally with Communism than we often recognize? Recently, a chairwoman of a German political party controversially claimed that Hitler was a communist. While this assertion is incorrect, much of the criticism it drew focused only on the visible differences between Hitler and Communists, leaving their deeper ideological similarities unexamined. By revisiting the words of Hitler and Mussolini, it becomes clear that their rivalry with Communism was less about rejecting its principles and more about promoting competing visions of collectivism. It is now the duty of classical liberals, who fundamentally diverge from both communists and fascists, to seize the opportunity and reveal the shared collectivist roots of these ideologies. As a classical liberal, I have always been skeptical of my ideology being grouped on the same 'side' as the Nazis, given the stark philosophical differences. The disproportionate attention drawn to the rivalries between various forms of collectivism hinders thorough political discourse and leaves the core question of individualism versus collectivism inadequately explored. Mussolini: From Marxist to Nationalist Collectivist 'If the 19th century was the century of the individual, we are free to believe that this is the ‘collective’ century,' wrote Benito Mussolini. He began his career as an ardent Marxist, even editing a socialist magazine. However, World War I and his perceived failure of Communist internationalism to galvanize workers led him to reconsider. Rather than abandoning collectivism, he sought a unifying force stronger than class: nationalism. In The Doctrine of Fascism, he argued that 'the nation has not disappeared,' emphasizing that class distinctions obstruct true unity: 'Class cannot destroy the nation. Class reveals itself as a collection of interests, but the nation is a history of sentiments, traditions, language, culture, and a race; it is a spiritual community.' Mussolini criticized socialism, not for its collectivist nature, but for its inability to unify all segments of society. He describedFascism as an ideology that subsumed the individual into the state: Liberalism denied the State in the name of the individual; Fascism reasserts The rights of the State as expressing the real essence of the individual…. The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. For Mussolini, the individual had meaning only as part of the collective, bound by traditions, culture, and duty: Fascism sees in the world not only those superficial, material aspects in which man appears as an individual, standing by himself…but the nation and the country; individuals and generations bound together by a moral law…founded on duty. Hitler’s Vision: Sacrificing the Individual for the Race The Nazis developed a slogan that can be read in a May 1, 1934 New York Times article title: 'The Common Good Before the Good of the Individual.' This Nazi slogan encapsulates Hitler’s collectivist ethos. While he diverged from socialism in practice, he acknowledged the collectivist appeal of its goals. In Mein Kampf, he states: 'I had no feelings of antipathy towards the actual policy of the Social Democrats. That its avowed purpose was to raise the level of the working classes…' However, Hitler’s break with socialism stemmed from its perceived failure to preserve national unity and identity. He viewed socialism’s internationalism as a threat to German identity: 'But the features that contributed most to estrange me from the Social Democratic movement was its hostile attitude towards the struggle for the conservation of Germanism in Austria…' What set Hitler apart was his emphasis on race. His core concept of racial superiority was fundamentally rooted in collectivism, seeing the Aryan race as embodying the ideal of self-sacrifice for the community: The greatness of the Aryan is not based on his intellectual powers, but rather on his willingness to devote all his faculties to the service of the community…. for the Ayran willingly subordinates his own ego to the common weal and when necessity calls he will even sacrifice his own life for the community. Compare this to Marx’s assertion that 'all previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority.' Both philosophies promoted visions of collective good, differing only in the identity—class or race—that served as the unifying force. For Hitler, the individual existed to serve the collective, with the state as the enforcer of this vision: '...the State is looked upon only as a means to an end and this end is the conservation of the racial characteristics of mankind.' While he opposed Marxism’s internationalism, he saw it more as a rival than a fundamentally different philosophy: Only when the international idea, politically organized by Marxism, is confronted by the folk idea, equally well organized in a systematic way and equally well led--only then will the fighting energy in the one camp be able to meet that of the other on an equal footing; and victory will be found on the side of eternal truth. Language Matters Although sophisticated exploration of these subjects in the literature is important, what benefit would it bring if these ideas don’t reach the masses? How can we serve our passion for liberty if we fail to assert it daily through its most powerful tool—language? Should we tolerate the perception that our ideology is just a matter of degrees from Nazism and Fascism? Meanwhile, the most impactful irony is that these ideologies are often categorized as being on the 'right!' Are we unaware of the implications of this neglect? Or, if we are aware, have we been passionate enough to address it? What we need is an abundance of daily discourse that blends factuality with simplicity—one that consistently reinforces its implications through language until it becomes widely accepted. Conclusion The debate over whether Hitler and Nazism belong to the left obscures a deeper truth: their collectivist roots align them more closely with Communism than with individualism, classical liberalism, or libertarianism. The qualities of Hitler and Mussolini differed significantly; their denial of individualism was philosophical, whereas their resentment of Communism was more of a passionate rivalry. By highlighting the shared foundations of these ideologies through promoting alternative political categorizations, we should incorporate these facts into everyday political discourse and reestablish their significance as the only truly distinctive ideology. Recognizing these less-explored, but fundamental, common features would help societies to have a broader perspective towards political relations and avoid falling for runaway collectivist movements simply because they offer a new leading identity—whether defined by class, nation, race, or gender. Classical liberalism has played a groundbreaking role in shaping the modern world—a world that, despite its flaws, is far removed from the hardships of earlier times. It should now become the mission of classical liberals to uncover the truth. About the author: Amirhossein Ojaqfaqihi is a master’s student in Electrical Engineering at TU Chemnitz with a deep interest in political philosophy, particularly the Enlightenment era. A classical liberal, he believes activism alone is not enough and advocates for a return to deeper intellectual discourse.

What Policymakers Should Prioritize On Ukraine – OpEd	Russia’s war against Ukraine will soon enter its fourth year. Since February 2022, violations of the laws of war have led to needless civilian death, suffering, and devastation with more than 12,456 Ukrainian civilians killed and 28,382 injured, at least 6.8 million having left the country, and millions more internally displaced. Thousands of homes, hospitals, schools, and other civilian infrastructure in Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed. As this dreadful anniversary nears, the Trump administration is rapidly moving towards negotiations with the Kremlin. Civilian protection and justice need to be central to any negotiations. One immediate issue is the need to release Ukrainian civilians from Russian custody. These include thousands unlawfully detained and held by Russia in occupied areas of Ukraine and those forcibly transferred to detention facilities in Russia. A United Nations body recently concluded that Russian authorities torture Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) 'as a crime against humanity.' While the Geneva Conventions require the prompt release and repatriation of POWs at the end of active hostilities, negotiations offer an opportunity to highlight the urgency of achieving this. Russia continues to be an occupier in parts of Ukraine where millions live and is bound by the law on occupation. Investigations should continue into Russia’s violations of its obligations as the occupying force for example, by coercing residents to serve in the Russian military, imposing Russian citizenship, forcibly transferring civilians to other areas, imposing the Russian state curriculum in schools and other educational institutions, and politically indoctrinating school children in order to deny them the right to know and express their Ukrainian identity. Justice cannot be negotiated away. The perpetrators of war crimes, including widespread, indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilians and civilian infrastructure, torture and ill-treatment in occupied areas and Russian prisons, and the torture and executions of POWs, must be held accountable. Investigations and prosecutions need to be supported and well-resourced. The International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and five other high-ranking officials must be honored and ICC member countries should oppose the Trump administration’s sanctions on the court and forcefully support the court’s crucial role. Trump’s recent, incendiary and factually untrue statements and controversies around potential negotiations should not distract from urgent concerns for the rights of people in Ukraine’s occupied areas. The release of civilian detainees and repatriation of POWs should be a priority and victims of atrocities should receive justice and reparations for the harm they have suffered.

India’s Language Debate: Unity Or Identity? – OpEd	India’s linguistic scenery is as vibrant and complex as its cultural history. With over 120 major languages and thousands of dialects, the country’s diversity is both a source of pride and a battleground for political and cultural identity. At the heart of this struggle lies a decades-old debate: Should India prioritise a three-language policy—promoting Hindi, English, and regional languages—or embrace a two-language approach that sidelines Hindi in favour of regional tongues and English? This question has resurfaced with renewed intensity in recent years and months, fuelled by educational reforms, protests, and the ever-present tension between national unity and regional pride and identity. The roots of this conflict trace back to India’s post-independence era. In 1968, the Three-Language Formula was introduced to balance linguistic diversity with national cohesion. It encouraged states to teach the regional language, Hindi, and English. While Hindi-speaking northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar adopted this model, southern states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala resisted. For them, Hindi represented not unity but cultural domination by the North. Instead, they championed a two-language system, focusing on their native languages—Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada—and English, which they saw as a neutral bridge to the wider world. This historical friction reignited in 2020 with the Modi government’s National Education Policy (NEP), which urged non-Hindi states to teach Hindi 'wherever possible.' Though framed as a suggestion, critics argued it was a backdoor tactic to impose Hindi, linking federal funding to compliance. Tamil Nadu, with its long history of anti-Hindi sentiment dating back to violent protests in 1965, erupted in outrage. 'They call Hindi the ‘national language,’ but India has no national language. This is about erasing our identity,' said Ganesh, a student protester in Chennai. The NEP’s ambiguity felt like a betrayal to many, echoing fears of linguistic homogenisation. By 2023, the flames of dissent spread to Karnataka. When the state government proposed making Hindi compulsory in schools, Bengaluru saw massive protests. Activists and opposition parties accused the ruling BJP of undermining Kannada, the state’s native language. 'Hindi is not our culture; it is a political agenda,' declared Kannada writer Vasudha Krishnamurthy. In Tamil Nadu, activists took symbolic action, stripping Hindi signage from metro stations and shops—a defiant rejection of what they termed 'linguistic colonialism.' Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M.K. Stalin framed the resistance as a fight for Dravidian heritage: 'We will not let Hindi bulldoze our history.' Proponents of Hindi, however, paint a different picture. Leaders like Uttar Pradesh’s Yogi Adityanath argue that Hindi is essential for national integration: 'It unites us all. Those opposing it are dividing the nation.' Economically, Hindi’s prevalence, spoken by 43 percent of Indians, offers practical advantages, opening doors to jobs in northern markets. Yet, for non-Hindi speakers, this logic rings hollow. 'Language is not just communication—it is memory, history, and resistance,' asserts Tamil scholar Ram. The debate also exposes stark class and caste divides. Rural India, where 65 percent of the population resides, relies heavily on state-language education. Without fluency in English or Hindi, students here face limited opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty. Urban elites, meanwhile, flock to English-medium private schools, cementing a divide between those who can navigate global markets and those left behind. The caste dimension adds another layer: Historically, upper castes monopolised Sanskrit and English, while lower castes were marginalised. Today, promoting Hindi as the 'people’s language' risks sidelining non-Hindi communities, reinforcing what Dalit activist Anand Teltumbde calls 'upper-caste dominance.' Technology has emerged as a new frontier in this battle. Government apps like Aarogya Setu, which initially lacked Tamil and Kannada options, sparked accusations of digital exclusion. Social media campaigns like #StopHindiImposition trend regularly, reflecting grassroots resistance. Yet tech also offers hope. Apps like Duolingo and AI-driven tools can democratise language learning, empowering users to bridge gaps without top-down mandates. The path forward may lie in flexible federalism. States like Kerala offer a model: teaching Malayalam, English, and Hindi but allowing students to choose between Hindi and Sanskrit post-primary school. This balances practicality with cultural choice. Decentralising language policy, investing in teacher training, and promoting regional languages in tech and media could preserve diversity while fostering unity. India’s linguistic struggle is ultimately a referendum on its identity. Can a nation of such staggering diversity thrive without imposing uniformity? The answer, perhaps, lies in embracing coexistence over coercion. As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen reminds us, 'India’s plurality is its identity. To destroy that is to destroy India itself.' The Tamil farmer’s pride in his language and the Hindi clerk’s aspirations need not clash. In respecting both, India’s many voices can harmonise into a chorus that celebrates difference without discord. In a democracy as vast and varied as India’s, linguistic justice is not merely policy—it is a promise. A promise that every language, like every citizen, has a place in the nation’s story. The challenge is not to choose between Hindi and English, North and South, but to weave a tapestry where every thread strengthens the whole. Only then can India truly speak as one.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFqzt6PV9P9Tx7	2025-02-21T17:14:08-08:00	
Executive Orders Are Not A Panacea For America – OpEd	Many conservatives are exuberant that Donald Trump has won another term in the White House. And from a conservative perspective, there are undoubtedly reasons to celebrate Trump’s return to power, especially when compared with the Kamala Harris alternative: the abrupt termination of the US government’s profoundly discriminatory 'Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion' programmes; a commitment to end government-sponsored censorship of Americans’ speech; a promise to cut government spending; the much-needed shake-up of the US’s pharmaceutical, health, and food regulatory establishment; and withdrawal from a WHO compromised by glaring conflicts of interest such as support from Pharma investors like Bill Gates. You do not need to be a front-row MAGA fan to be happy about these sorts of changes or see that they are far more sensible than what Kamala Harris was offering to the American people. However, I have the sense that some people are so caught up in the excitement of the moment that they are losing sight of the bigger picture. The bigger picture is this: The United States is an increasingly polarised society, divided between people who identify as 'progressives' and/or Democrats, and people who identify as 'conservatives' or libertarians and/or Republicans. This polarisation has translated into a divisive and acrimonious competition for federal power, that reaches its climax when both sides vie for the presidential office every four years. Federal power, whether over public finance and spending, the monetary system, the healthcare system, education, banking, commerce, or public health and hygiene, has grown to such an extent that people’s everyday lives are at the mercy of the person who ends up in the White House or the makeup of the US Supreme Court. This puts people’s freedom and prosperity on a very precarious footing indeed. Yet this has come to be widely accepted as the norm. And implicitly, it has come to be embraced by those who treat the president as a sort of messianic figure, who will either protect the 'little American' against Big Money, or 'make America great again,' and fight an epic, batman-like battle against the allies of Big Pharma, Big Bureaucracy, and Big Taxes. Don’t get me wrong. If you live in a centralised political system, it is rational to want the best candidate, or the least damaging candidate, to get into the White House. And you might be right in wanting a big shakeup of a corrupt oligarchic system, even if it takes a bit of a 'Batman' figure to pull it off. If I was Argentinian, for example, I would be happy that a country crippled by debt and cronyism was being shaken up by a powerful figure like Milei. One might wistfully hope that the rise of a Trump or Milei to power would somehow spark far-reaching reforms that ultimately returned power to the people. But that does not seem at all likely, given that the path to political reform in both cases is not grassroots change, but sweeping uses of executive power. If anything, there is a strong possibility that both Milei and Trump will further strengthen the executive office and make the national government even more powerful than before by showing the world how it can be effectively leveraged by a powerful president. Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that the man currently occupying the White House is a sensible, wise man who can restore 'common sense' in the national government and introduce policies that favour freedom and economic growth, without allowing the national government to become too intrusive or domineering. Even assuming that this is the case, this individual will not occupy the White House forever. The chances are, especially in a politically and culturally polarised country like the United States, that a very different candidate will come along, in four, eight, or twelve years, and win enough votes to get into office and reverse his or her predecessor’s reforms. For example, if an executive order can undo DEI policies, stop government collusion with Big Tech censorship, or weaken the hold of Big Pharma over the healthcare complex, then a future executive order can reinstate DEI policies, restore government-sponsored censorship of 'misinformation,' and put Big Pharma and Big Food cronies in charge of the national food, drug, and healthcare regulatory apparatus. This means that political reform, however dramatic and exciting to behold, is inherently unstable in a centralised system with a strong executive office, particularly in a society that is deeply divided over the proper ends of the national government and over the values that represent the country at its best. So those who care about the long-term health and stability of the United States should favour more far-reaching structural reforms, that weaken both Congress and the presidential office, and return power to the State and local levels of government. This way, many highly divisive political disputes can be removed from the national stage and returned to the State and local levels, where different solutions can be developed that are tailored to local needs and local sensibilities. If people don’t like the results, they can 'vote with their feet,' and seek out a State more to their liking.

Congress Is (Unfortunately) Key To DOGE’s Success – OpEd	Most Americans have suspected that the federal government is riddled with wasteful spending. In the last few weeks, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has begun to pull back the curtain and expose the misuse of money. Examples include $32 million for a Civil Society Centre in Prague, $14 million for 'improving public procurement' in Serbia, and $373 million for DEI training grants. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the early poster child for government waste, fraud and abuse. Some of its wacky spending includes $70,000 for production of a 'DEI musical' in Ireland, $32,000 for a 'transgender comic book' in Peru, and $2 million for sex changes in Guatemala. Nearly all staff for the USAID were placed on administrative leave as the Trump administration ponders the future of the agency. Considering that the federal government spent $1.8 trillion more than it took in last year, the waste of funds strikes working Americans as verging on criminality. At a minimum, it is gross negligence by our elected leaders. President Donald Trump imposed a funding pause on all USAID money while his administration decided how to go forward. A federal judge, however, has ordered the president to temporarily lift the freeze on USAID spending. So just how far can Trump go in righting the wrongs of Congress and prior administrations? In constitutional parlance, Trump’s refusal to spend money appropriated by Congress is known as impoundment. Throughout American history, presidents have declined to spend appropriated funds. For example, in 1803, President Thomas Jefferson declined to spend $50,000 Congress had appropriated for gunboats in anticipation of a conflict with France. Jefferson’s negotiation of the Louisiana Purchase rendered military conflict unlikely, and Congress supported Jefferson’s impoundment decision. During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt impounded millions in congressionally appropriated funds when addressing various economic dislocations tied to the Great Depression and the war. Significant controversy over impoundment occurred during the presidency of Richard M. Nixon, who impounded 17-20% of congressional appropriations. Nixon used impoundment to curtail domestic programs with which he disagreed. Crippled by the Watergate scandal and just a month before resigning, Nixon signed the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 into law. At base, the statute requires the president to report impoundments to Congress and to abide by a congressional decision on the matter. If Congress takes no action to review the impoundment, the president must spend the money. The Supreme Court has never addressed the constitutionality of the Impoundment Control Act. Advocates of executive power argue that the statute infringes upon the president’s inherent powers, while proponents of congressional power contend impoundment gives the executive an extra-constitutional veto on congressional actions. How about the termination of federal agencies such as USAID? While President John F. Kennedy established USAID through an executive order in 1961, Congress in 1998 designated USAID as an 'independent establishment' outside of the State Department. Because of the congressional legislation, it is doubtful that Trump can abolish the entity. Had Congress not acted in 1998 and USAID was still a creature of a JFK executive order, the situation would be different (but still subject to wrangling in the courts over whether the presidential decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act). Americans cheering DOGE and Trump should focus their energy on Congress. For better or worse, the Constitution’s Article I vests 'all legislative Powers herein granted . . . in a Congress of the United States.' The president cannot submit legislation to abolish USAID, but Congress can. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) has introduced a bill (H.R. 1123) to halt all taxpayer funding to USAID and to claw back funds not yet distributed. In light of the DOGE discoveries and the anger of Americans at USAID’s malfeasance, if H.R. 1123 can’t pass with significant majorities in the House and Senate, there is no hope to ever Make America Great Again. H.R. 1123 presents Congress with, to borrow a phrase from Elon Musk, a fork in the road: continue to bankrupt the country by funding Guatemalan sex changes and other foolishness or take a stand for fiscal sanity. Absent a concerted effort in Congress to act on DOGE findings, Trump’s impoundments and employee furloughs will be caught up in the federal courts for months or years. While law geeks drool over the thought of the Supreme Court hearing arguments on the Impoundment Control Act, in the meantime, waste, fraud and abuse will continue in a business-as-usual manner. It’s time for the people supportive of DOGE to burn up the Capitol Hill switchboard.

Can The US And Russia Impose A Peace Deal On Ukraine? – Analysis	By Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- A whirlwind week that has seen two emergency summits in Europe and worried comments from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy underlines the gnawing fear in capitals from Kyiv to London. Namely, that Washington and Moscow could try to make their own deal on the future of Ukraine without Kyiv and U.S. allies in Europe. U.S. President Donald Trump has added to the angst with his post on Truth Social, accusing Zelenskyy of being a dictator and saying 'we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia.' U.S. officials have denied they wish to exclude anyone from the process. But U.S. suggestions that Europe would not be at the negotiating table has caused widespread alarm, and the positive vibes from U.S.-Russia meeting in Riyadh on February 18 also set nerves on edge. At this stage, there are two key questions: would Washington and Moscow even be able to agree on a mutually acceptable settlement to end the war in Ukraine, and if they did, what could anyone else do about it? The White House clearly wants peace. It’s not clear that Moscow does. Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv on February 19 just hours after overnight Russian strikes pounded Ukraine. Some 250,000 people were left without power in subzero temperatures in the port city of Odesa. In Moscow, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the State Duma that 'the crisis should not be resolved with a cease-fire.' If the Kremlin is ready for a deal, it looks ready to push for a hard bargain. The nightmare scenario for Ukraine and its European allies is that Washington will agree to one. U.S. officials have said that both sides in the conflict will need to make concessions but have not provided detail of what Russia’s might be. Asked about this at the Munich Security Conference on February 15, Kellogg said: 'There’s going to have to be territorial concessions,' and 'it could be the renouncement of the use of force.' Skeptics have warned that the United States is giving away too much, too early, in search of a quick and easy diplomatic win. But if there is a deal that Ukraine and Europe do not accept, what then? There has been a string of strong statements. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha was asked at Munich what Kyiv’s 'non-acceptance' of a bad deal would look like? 'We know how to resist. We proved this, on the battlefield,' he said. But without ongoing U.S. support, Ukrainian defiance is going to be difficult. So far, Europe has provided more aid to Kyiv than the United States, according to figuresfrom the Kiel Institute of the World Economy. The figures cover military, financial, and humanitarian aid. But Washington is the largest provider of military support, underlining the scale of the challenge Ukraine would face without U.S. backing. To make up the shortfall, Europe would have to nearly double its overall support to Kyiv. European leaders have repeated a mantra that they will provide assistance to Ukraine for 'as long as it takes.' But this does not address the question of whether they would massively increase this assistance to fill the gap. Even talk of a European peace-keeping force, which would be deployed in Ukraine after a potential cease-fire or peace deal, has been with the caveat that it would require U.S. involvement and support. Given fiscal limitations and political divisions, it’s unclear whether Europe would step up. So far, every step of the way, it has needed America to hold its hand.

Why Donald Trump’s Obsession With Greenland Is All About China – ...	By Joshua Frank In early January, Donald Trump Jr.’s private plane landed on a snowy airfield in Greenland. There was little fanfare upon his arrival, but his 14 million social-media fans were certainly tagging along. 'Greenland coming in hot…well, actually really really cold!!!' President Trump’s eldest son captioned a video he posted on X. It was shot from the cockpit of the plane, where a 'Trumpinator' bobblehead (a figurine of his father as the Terminator) rattled on the aircraft’s dashboard as it descended over icy blue seas. It was a stunt of MAGA proportions. Don Jr. was arriving in Greenland on behalf of his father who, along with his new buddy Elon Musk, had announced a desire to seize that vast Arctic landmass from Denmark through strong will or even, potentially, by force. There’s been plenty of speculation as to why Trump wants to make Greenland, the largest island on this planet, a new territory of the United States. And yes, his inflated ego is undoubtedly part of the reason, but an urge for geopolitical dominance also drives Trump’s ambitions. His fascination with Greenland can be traced back to his first administration when, in late 2019, he signed the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act establishing the US Space Force. 'There are grave threats to our national security,' he said shortly after signing the bill. 'American superiority in space is absolutely vital. The Space Force will help us deter aggression and control the ultimate high ground.' The following year, the US government renamed Greenland’s Thule Air Base, the Department of Defense’s northernmost outpost since 1951, Pituffik Space Base. According to the official United States Space Force Website, the 'Top of the World vantage point enables Space Superiority … Pituffik SB supports Missile Warning, Missile Defense, and Space Surveillance missions.' As such, it’s a key military asset for NATO and the United States. Denmark, a founding member of NATO and the country that has long controlled Greenland, had no problem with Trump’s Space Force operation taking root on that island’s soil. Some have argued that Trump’s obsession is related to the Pituffik Space Base and Greenland’s strategic importance for US power, given its proximity both to Europe and to the melting Arctic. Yet, given that the US Space Force already operates there with NATO’s and Denmark’s blessing, it’s hard to understand why this would be the case. So, what gives? Do you wonder whether Trump has his sights set on exploiting Greenland’s natural resources? A few small problems there: it has no accessible oil. Tapping its sizable natural gas reserves — mostly parked beneath massive sheets of glacial ice — would be challenging, if not impossible, and certainly not profitable. Even pipelines and other infrastructure would be difficult to build and maintain in its icy climate. Besides, the US already has the world’s fourth-largest natural gas reserves. Let’s assume that Trump’s fascination with Greenland is unrelated to fossil fuels or military installations. If so, that leaves one other obvious possibility: Greenland’s expansive reservoir of minerals, deposits crucial to making the gadgets we use and producing the green technologies that Trump appears to oppose. Trump’s green energy paradox As soon as President Trump took office, his administration began issuing executive orders in hopes of dismantling and disrupting environmental initiatives put in place by the Biden administration. One of its first actions included canceling Biden’s electric vehicle mandate, which requested that 50% of all autos sold in the US be electric by 2030 (though it wasn’t binding). 'We will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers,' Trump boasted during his inaugural address. 'In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.' Of course, from their batteries to their engines, Biden’s push for electric vehicles would require a plethora of critical minerals, ranging from copper to graphite, cobalt to lithium. So, too, would other clean energy projects the Biden administration supported, from home energy storage systems to the deployment of solar panels. Given Donald Trump’s battle over electric vehicles, you might assume he would prefer to keep such minerals in the ground. Yet, like much of Trump’s bombast, his ploy to reverse Biden’s mandate had ulterior motives. Like Biden’s executive order, Trump’s doesn’t automatically change existing regulations. All emissions policies remain in place, and no rules have been altered that would require congressional approval. In many instances, such executive orders are essentially aspirational. Tax credits for electric vehicles remain active, but the federal government, as under Biden, doesn’t require automakers to sell a certain number of electric cars. This isn’t to say that Trump doesn’t want to alter such standards. However, doing so would require outfits like the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to propose changes and then provide time for public feedback. Bureaucracy can run slow, so during Trump’s first term, such changes took over two years to implement. Moreover, despite his war on electric vehicles, Trump has shown no sign of any eagerness to slow the mining of critical minerals on federal lands. In fact, his advisers want to do away with nettlesome environmental reviews that have gotten in the way of such mining. He is going all in, looking to ramp up not just oil, coal and natural gas production but also uranium and critical minerals. After taking office, one of his first actions was to sign an executive order declaring a 'National Energy Emergency,' which specifically called for expanding critical mineral development. 'The energy and critical minerals … identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs,' reads the order. 'We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.' Energy experts disagree. The US is not experiencing an energy emergency and hasn’t for decades. Gas prices are at a three-year low, and the country remains the world’s largest oil producer and natural gas exporter. In reality, Joe Biden’s oil and gas approvals outpacedthose in Trump’s first term, even if he also halted some further oil and gas exploration on public lands. After initial excitement from oil and gas companies, insiders admit that Trump’s emergency declaration isn’t going to cause a production ramp-up anytime soon. Those companies are, of course, in it to make money, and overproduction would lead to significant price drops, resulting in lower profits for shareholders and company executives. If that’s the situation for fossil fuels, when it comes to critical and rare earth minerals, Trump wants to hamper renewables’ growth while increasing the domestic production of those minerals. If that seems incongruous, that’s because it is. He wants to boost US mining of critical minerals because he knows that China, his archnemesis, is leading the global charge for their acquisition. Trump doesn’t seem to understand that it’s hard to stimulate investment in critical minerals if the future appetite for the technologies they support remains uncertain. As a result of his battle against electric vehicles, manufacturing expectations are already being slashed. While he may not comprehend how contradictory that is or even care, he certainly understands that the US depends on China for many of the critical minerals it consumes. Around 60% of the metals required for renewable technologies come directly from China or Chinese companies. Trump’s tariffs on China have even worried his buddy (and electric car producer) Elon Musk, who’s been workingbehind the scenes to block additional tariffs on graphite imports. Chinese graphite, an essential component of the lithium-ion batteries in his Teslas, may face new tariffs of as high as — and no, this is not a misprint — 920%. Such pandemonium around imports of critical minerals from China may be the true factor driving Trump’s impetus to steal Greenland from the clutches of Denmark. Trump and Musk also know critical minerals are big business. In 2022 alone, the top 40 producers brought in $711 billion. Total revenue grew 6.1% between 2022 and 2023, exceeding $2.15 trillion. That number is set to jump to $2.78 trillion by 2027. Eco-colonialism Greenland’s Indigenous Inuit people, the Kalaallit, account for 88% of that island’s population of 56,000. They have endured vicious forms of colonization for centuries. In the 12th century, Norwegians first landed in Greenland and built early colonies that lasted 200 years before they retreated to Iceland. By the 1700s, they returned to take ownership of that vast island, a territory that would be transferred to Denmark in 1814. In 1953, the Kalaallit were granted Danish citizenship, which involved a process of forced assimilation in which they were removed from their homes and sent to Demark for reeducation. Recently uncovered documents show that, in the 1960s, Danish authorities forcibly inserted intrauterine devices (IUDs) in Kalaallit women, including children, which post-colonial scholars describe as a 'silenced genocide.' In other words, the colonization of Greenland, like that of the United States, was rooted in violence and still thrives today through ongoing systemic oppression. The Kalaallit want out. In 2016, 68% of Greenlanders supported independence from Denmark, and today, 85% oppose Trump’s neocolonial efforts to steal the territory. 'Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale,' said the island’s prime minister, Múte Egede, who leads the democratic socialist Inuit Ataqatigiit party, which won 80% of the votes in the last general election. Even though Greenlanders are Danish citizens, the territory is self-governing. This brings us back to what this imperialist struggle is all about. The island is loaded with critical minerals, including rare earth minerals, lithium, graphite, copper, nickel, zinc and other materials used in green technologies. Some estimates suggest that Greenland has six million tons of graphite, 106 kilotons of copper, and 235 kilotons of lithium. It holds 25 of the 34 minerals in the European Union’s official list of critical raw materials, all of which exist along its rocky coastline, generally accessible for mining operations. Unsurprisingly, such enormous mineral wealth has made Greenland of interest to China, Russia and — yep — President Trump, too. 'Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!' Right now, in this geopolitical chess game, graphite might be the most valuable of all the precious minerals Greenland has to offer. The Amitsoq graphite project in the Nanortalik region of southern Greenland could be the most significant prize of all. Considered to be pure, the 'spherical' graphite deposit at the mine there may prove to be the most profitable one in the world. Right now, GreenRoc Mining, based in London, is trying to fast-track work there, hoping to undercut China’s interest in Greenland’s resources to feed Europe’s green energy boom. The profits from that mine could exceed $2 billion. Currently, spherical graphite is only mined in China and is the graphite of choice for the anodes (a polarized electrical device) crucial to lithium-ion battery production. 'This is not a joke.' Despite President Trump’s attempt to put the brakes on EV growth in the US, sales are soaring across the planet. In 2024, EV sales rose 40%in China and 25% globally. Such growth comes with obstacles for manufacturers, which will need a steady stream of minerals like graphite to keep the assembly lines moving. It’s estimated that 100 new graphite mines alone will need to come online by 2035 to meet current demand. Such a reality is, no doubt, well understood by Elon Musk, the co-founder and CEO of Tesla. Musk benefits from his very close relationship with Donald Trump, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (which isn’t an actual department but an office inside the White House) and would certainly benefit if the US came to control Greenland. 'If the people of Greenland want to be part of America, which I hope they do, they would be most welcome!' Musk recently wrote on his platform X. Musk is not the only one with potential interests in Greenland. Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, has a financial stake in the territory, though he’s promised to divest. Lutnick’s investment firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, backs Critical Metals Corporation, which is set to start mining in Greenland for rare earth minerals as soon as 2026. Like Musk, Lutnick will significantly influence Trump’s approach to the island, even if he officially divests. Trump has also dispatched Ken Howery, a billionaire tech investor, co-founder of PayPal, and buddy of Musk, to be the next US ambassador to Denmark. Howery has told friends he’s excited about his post and the possibility of brokering a deal for the US to acquire Greenland. Marco Rubio, the new secretary of state, insists that Trump isn’t bullshitting when it comes to Greenland. 'This is not a joke,' he said. 'This is not about acquiring land for the purpose of acquiring land. This is in our national interest and it needs to be solved.' Greenland and its resources are merely the latest potential casualty of Trump’s quest for global domination and his fear of China’s economic power. His interest in the green energy sector does not signify a change of heart regarding the dangers of climate chaos or the value of renewables but rather a drive for global financial supremacy. Like the billionaires around him, he desires it all — the oil, the gas and the critical minerals essential for the global energy transition, while China is pushed aside. Regarding the Kalaallits and their aspirations, he could care less. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.

Four Scenarios For Securing Peace In Ukraine – Analysis	By Tatiana Vorozhko U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for a peaceful resolution to Russia’s now three-year full-scale war in Ukraine. VOA examined several approaches floated by think tanks recently aimed at achieving a lasting peace to the war. Maximum pressure strategy A plan by the Center for European Policy Analysis, or CEPA, titled 'How to Win: A Seven-Point Plan for Sustainable Peace in Ukraine,' calls for 'a maximum pressure strategy to bring Russia to the negotiating table in good faith.' It proposes that the U.S. and its allies: 'Should provide immediate materiel support to Ukraine without caveats, aiming to wear down Russia’s military and thereby improve Ukraine’s negotiating position.' 'Should increase sanctions on Russian financial institutions and energy sector entities, release frozen Russian assets to support Ukrainian defense and reconstruction and enact secondary sanctions to intensify economic pressure not only on Russia but also on the authoritarian regimes of China, Iran, and North Korea.' CEPA says that 'Ukraine and Europe' must be included in any peace talks with Russia, that the U.S. should support 'a European-led coalition of the willing' to enforce any 'ceasefire line with an international force,' and that 'European allies must make consistent and as rapid as possible progress toward Ukraine’s accession to the European Union.' One of the report’s authors, Catherine Sendak, CEPA’s director for transatlantic defense and security, told VOA’s Ukrainian service that the United States should enter talks with Russia only having 'equipped Ukraine with the strongest possible means' and using its toughest 'diplomatic tools.' She added that the issue of Ukraine’s possible membership in NATO should not be included in talks with Russia. 'To discuss that with a non-NATO member … I don’t believe it is advantageous to any negotiation,' Sendak said, noting that it would give Russia 'veto power, if you will, over … choosing members to join the alliance or not.' Negotiating tactics Josh Rudolph, a German Marshall Fund senior fellow and head of its Transatlantic Democracy Working Group, worked on Russian and Ukrainian policy at the National Security Council during the first Trump administration. Last month, he offered policy recommendations to the current Trump administration on ending the Ukraine conflict. Among them: 'Approach [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from a position of strength. Whereas Putin looked tough and capable at the outset of Trump’s first term, his blunder in Ukraine has left him diminished. … As the dominant partner in this relationship, Trump, not Putin, can set negotiating terms.' 'Know when to walk away. A critical moment in the negotiations will come when Putin refuses to make major concessions. Trump must be prepared to walk away.' 'Combine sanctions with lower oil and gas prices. The best way to make Putin to see that pressing on in Ukraine would spell disaster for his rule is to pressure Russia financially. … Harnessing his warmer relationship with Saudi Arabia than [former President Joe] Biden enjoyed, Trump should flood the fossil fuel market, which would make the sanctions sustainable, starve Russia’s war machine, and generate political stability risks in Moscow.' Rudolph also recommended arming Ukraine 'to the hilt'; giving it 'all $300 billion of Russia’s frozen assets'; making Europe 'pay more for weapons' and provide 100,000 troops as 'peacekeepers'; enabling 'American companies to rebuild Ukraine'; and inviting Ukraine to join NATO should Putin refuse to accept 'reasonable' peace deal terms. Rudolph told VOA that Trump could convince those in the U.S. now skeptical of continuing to arm Ukraine that doing so as part of a peace deal would benefit American workers. '[H]e tells them, OK, now we’ve got a good deal, it’s secured by rare earth [minerals], it has ended the war, and in order to hold it together, we’re going to need to provide a continued stream of good old American-made weapons, which by the way, create all of these American jobs and facilities and factories across red states.' Touting economic benefits In a report titled 'Dollars and Sense: America’s Interest in a Ukrainian Victory,' Elaine McCusker, Frederick W. Kagan and Richard Sims of the American Enterprise Institute looked at the cost of ending support for Ukraine, concluding that this would lead to Ukraine’s defeat and Russia’s advance farther into Europe, forcing the U.S. to surge its presence in Europe. Among the report’s conclusions: 'Supporting Ukraine to victory against Russia is in the best interest of the United States.' 'A world in which Russia prevails would be more dangerous and more expensive for America — requiring an estimated increase of $808 billion in defense spending over five years.' 'Alternatively, an increased and accelerated multinational commitment to Ukraine and the conclusion of the war in the near term would result in a vibrant and free Ukraine with a newly modernized and battle-tested military and a thriving industrial base, which would help stabilize Europe.' In an interview with VOA, Frederick Kagan said a Russian victory in Ukraine would be a victory for Iran, China and North Korea, encouraging adventurism in their respective regions, and allow Russia to rebuild its army by obtaining additional human and material resources within Ukraine. A Russian takeover of Ukraine would send a wave of refugees into Europe, further destabilizing the continent, Kagan said. 'They’ve committed atrocities on the Ukrainian population in the areas they occupy. I would expect that would get worse the further west the Russians move and the more they move into the hardest traditional anti-Russian, pro-Western areas of western Ukraine. The horrors will be unspeakable,' he predicted. He said surged assistance to Ukraine would turn it into a bulwark for European peace and security — a country with a battle-tested army and rapidly developing military industry — thereby allowing the U.S. to focus on other regions. Middle road approach The Heritage Foundation’s 'Project 2025 Presidential Transition Project' includes policy recommendations concerning the Russia-Ukraine war. It noted that the American conservative movement is split over Ukraine — one side supports Kyiv, the other favors walking away — and offered a middle road. Among Project 2025’s recommendations: 'With respect to Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military aid (while European allies address Ukraine’s economic needs); and have a clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.' 'Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland. The conflict has severely weakened Putin’s military strength and provided a boost to NATO unity and its importance to European nations.' 'The next conservative president has a generational opportunity to bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions within the movement and chart a new path forward that recognizes Communist China as the defining threat to U.S. interests in the 21st century.' James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation who is responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, told VOA that it is in the U.S. interest to have a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself. 'For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself, and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine’s occupied by Russia. Now, having said that, are we … way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is ‘absolutely.’'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq38nZZPlAOx6	2025-02-21T16:52:28-08:00	
Musk’s Buddy Javier Milei Tangos With Crypto Scam – OpEd	Argentina’s President Javier Milei, who has won high praise from Elon Musk, was caught in the middle of crypto scam in the country, that may have cost investors close to $5 million. The story is that Milei used his huge following on social media to promote a new crypto coin called the $LIBRA. Milei told his followers that the $LIBRA would stimulate the economy and help small businesses grow. This post sent the value of the $LIBRA soaring. However, as people began to investigate the coin, they became suspicious that it was a scam. The price began to crumble, and Milei took down his post. The coin quickly lost more than 90 percent of its value. Milei then said that he didn’t know anything about the coin and took no responsibility for his actions. Meanwhile, a number of people bought the coin near its peak, allowing the originators of the scam to cash out with big gains and leaving them with big loses. In the scheme of things, a $5 million dollar scam is not a big deal even in Argentina. But it does say a great deal about the way things work in the Trump-Milei world. Like Trump, Milei has taken big pride in disrupting Argentina’s government and economy. He also fired large numbers of civil servants and cut back government spending in many areas. In fairness, Milei did have more to complain about. The country was suffering from double-digit inflation, and the economy was in a recession. Nonetheless, it is not clear that Milei’s wrecking ball approach is likely to be a step forward. The poverty rate soared to over 50 percent as the recession became far steeper and the unemployment rate jumped. Part of Milei’s agenda, like Trump’s, is promoting cryptocurrency. As with Trump, Milei has never suggested a serious use for crypto. In Argentina, as in the U.S., the only known use for crypto is facilitating illegal transactions like drug dealing and ransom payments. Nonetheless, both presidents express a strong fondness for it. Donald Trump and Melanie Trump even have put out their own crypto currency, likely pocketing close to $100 million from it. It is a bit ironic seeing the Milei venture, and possibly the Trump coins, referred to as 'crypto scams.' That is a bit like fake counterfeit currency. But apart from the philosophical issue, there is the point about the extraordinary ability of a president to use the power of the government for their own personal gain. While past presidents may not have been squeaky clean, we have never seen a president so willing to openly use their power to line their pocket as Donald Trump. At this point it is not even news because Trump is so open about it. In that sense the Milei clown show is interesting in that, at least in Argentina, this sort of sleaze is still a scandal. Argentina generally has not ranked very high on most people’s lists for good governance, but for now, it stands well above the United States.

Europe Braces For A ‘New’ Germany	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- The most attentive spectators at Germany’s many pre-election party conferences were easy to miss. While leaders courted the cameras on stage, European diplomats discreetly mingled with the crowds that gathered in the Berlin area on successive weekends to rubber-stamp lead candidates and manifestos. One week, observers might have spotted the British ambassador to Berlin at the City Cube conference centre talking to the lead MP on foreign policy of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The next, they may have stumbled across a representative of the Portuguese embassy queuing for coffee at the Green Party conference at the same venue. Europe has been nervously watching the election campaign of the continent’s biggest economy, whose importance at a time of global upheaval can hardly be overstated. 'The world doesn’t stop spinning with everything that is going on in America, the first 100 days of Trump, and even the European budget,' one European diplomat told Euractiv. 'Europe needs to have someone to engage with in Germany.' For Germany’s neighbours, it may be reassuring that the country’s officials seem to be aware of their responsibility to Europe, with the four leading parties all campaigning on distinct visions for Germany’s future role in the European Union. The most likely outcome of Sunday’s ballot would see Berlin play a more muscular role on the European stage – if at the risk of stepping on some toes. It would certainly be a contrast to the last three years. German observers have watched in horror as the country went from purportedly ‘leading the free world’ under Angela Merkel to becoming an also-ran under Scholz. If the chancellor ever made a splash in Brussels, it was because of a botched relationshipwith Emmanuel Macron – the other half of the EU’s Franco-German ‘engine’ – and unilateral measures in moments of crisis. At other times, his unruly three-party coalition has been so hopelessly divided that it derailed the EU's legislative process, or failed to agree on any position at all in Brussels – the infamous ‘German vote'. Ending Germany’s ‘speechlessness' Frustration over this is rife among Scholz's rivals, especially his coalition partners, the Greens, who have often been blamed by extension for what they see as the chancellor's failures. At the start of the campaign, when journalists at a background briefing pressed Robert Habeck, the lead candidate of the Greens, on the central narrative of his campaign, his answer was clear: a strong focus on Europe. Scholz’s mixed record on Europe was also a preferred campaign target of election frontrunner Friedrich Merz, a former MEP, who has vowed to introduce a proactive leadership style that prioritises coordination and ends Germany's 'European speechlessness'. While the campaign was hardly more Europe-focused than usual, Merz and Habeck notably tried to set themselves apart from Scholz on Germany's leadership in the EU, noted Johannes Lindner, director of the Jacques Delors Centre. European topics gained slightly more traction with Donald Trump’s moves on Ukraine and tariffs, and a swelling debate over irregular migration and national border controls, he said.This has yielded four distinct scenarios for Germany’s future role in Europe. On one side of the spectrum, Habeck has advocated for federalist leadership that would make Germany’s vast resources available to Europe, including openness to new common debt and funding. On the other side, Alice Weidel, the leading candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the second-most popular party, has promised to take Germany out of the EU and the Euro. Between the two, Merz promises a new, pan-European leadership style, but explicitly defends national policy interests. Meanwhile, Scholz stands for a status quo, in which the EU is hardly front and centre. 'He didn’t even mention the EU once,' said one European diplomat after the chancellor’s keynote speech at the SPD’s election conference in January. In voters’ hands But the choice – and Europe’s fate – ultimately lie in the hands of German voters. As usual, the EU was low on the list of the most pressing issues for the electorate, with only 1% seeing it as a priority matter, according to a recent YouGov poll. Yet they are mostly aligned with the vision of the likely winner, Merz. According to a survey commissioned by the European Movement Germany (EBD), most voters back Germany's EU membership and want the bloc to do more, rather than less, to boost Europe’s defence, border security, and competitiveness. Unlike Habeck, however, they do not want Germany to lend more of its spending power to the bloc and are divided about further enlargement. Merz's Christian Democrats are cautious about both. Merz’s promise is that his government will bring new European momentum to areas like security and competitiveness, through stronger European cooperation and a strengthened single market, said Lindner. 'Merz has underlined his appetite for leadership,' he noted. Whether he will succeed will depend on his ability to form a stable, two-party coalition at home and to coordinate closely with EU allies, Lindner added. The flip side That is not a given: Merz's appetite can translate into a lack of consideration. On migration, Merz has championed a 'Germany first' policy that involves permanent border controls and the rejection of all asylum-seekers that enter from neighbouring countries, which would all but undermine Europe's cooperation on borders and migration. His opponents have compared this unilateral approach to 'Clint Eastwood' (Habeck) and 'Viktor Orbán' (Scholz), with the chancellor accusing Merz of 'burying Europe'. Not to mention that some EU allies dreaded the prolonged period of German dominance under Angela Merkel during the sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s. But for now, Germany's neighbours seem satisfied that Merz has namechecked their priorities. 'There are signs that the key players in Germany are prioritising the right issues, such as security and competitiveness,' said Sweden’s ambassador to Berlin, Veronika Wand-Danielson. Above all, she cares that Germany will regain its footing soon. 'We hope that a new government will be formed as quickly as possible,' she told Euractiv. 'We have so many common interests and so many common challenges and no time to wait.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq78ond_4ajfq	2025-02-21T16:39:43-08:00	
India’s Growing US Ties And Its Impact On China Relations – OpEd	India's growing closeness with the United States has significant implications for its relationship with China, shaping the geopolitical landscape of Asia and beyond. As New Delhi strengthens its ties with Washington, concerns arise regarding the potential for increased tensions with Beijing. This dynamic is influenced by various factors, including military cooperation, economic strategies, and regional security considerations. Military Cooperation and Strategic Alignments The deepening military cooperation between India and the U.S. is a central element of their burgeoning partnership. This includes joint military exercises, defense technology transfers, and intelligence sharing, which enhance India's capabilities to counter Chinese assertiveness in the region. The U.S. has positioned itself as a reliable partner for India, especially in times of crisis, as demonstrated during recent border tensions with China. This support has bolstered India's confidence in confronting Chinese aggression, leading to a more assertive stance along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). However, this military alignment also provokes a strong reaction from China. Beijing perceives the U.S.-India partnership as a direct threat to its regional influence and security interests. Chinese analysts have expressed concerns that India's increasing military capabilities, supported by the U.S., could lead to a strategic encirclement of China. Consequently, China may respond by enhancing its military presence along its borders with India and increasing its support for Pakistan, further complicating the security dynamics in South Asia. Economic Implications Economically, India's alignment with the U.S. presents both opportunities and challenges in its relationship with China. The U.S. seeks to diversify supply chains away from China, and India is positioned as a potential alternative manufacturing hub. This shift could benefit India's economy by attracting foreign investment and creating jobs. However, it also risks exacerbating tensions with China, which may view these developments as an attempt to undermine its economic standing. China has historically leveraged its economic influence in South Asia through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has strengthened its ties with neighboring countries. As India aligns more closely with the U.S., it may find itself at odds with these Chinese-led initiatives, leading to further economic competition between the two nations. Technology and Supply Chain Dynamics The U.S.-India partnership emphasizes technology cooperation, particularly in sectors like defense and cybersecurity. As India seeks to attract American investment in technology sectors such as semiconductors, it faces the challenge of competing against China's established supply chains. The potential for U.S.-India collaboration in critical technologies could bolster India's position but may also lead to increased competition with China in global markets. Beijing is likely to respond by enhancing its own technological capabilities and seeking alternative partnerships. The Role of Global Actors The evolving dynamic between India, the U.S., and China is not isolated; it affects other global actors as well. For instance, Russia has historically maintained strong ties with both India and China. As India aligns more closely with the U.S., Moscow may seek to leverage its relationships to maintain influence in South Asia while also benefiting from China's economic growth. This triadic relationship complicates India's strategic calculations as it navigates its partnerships while being mindful of Russia's interests. Regional Security Dynamics The strategic rivalry between India and China is further complicated by regional security dynamics. China's growing influence in the Indian Ocean poses a direct challenge to India's traditional dominance in the region. The U.S.-India partnership aims to counterbalance China's maritime ambitions through initiatives like the Quad—a strategic alliance involving Japan and Australia focused on ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. This increased collaboration among Quad members signals a collective effort to address shared concerns about China's assertiveness. However, it may also provoke Beijing to intensify its own maritime activities, leading to heightened tensions in contested waters. The potential for miscalculations or confrontations in these areas underscores the fragility of peace in the region. Diplomatic Maneuvering Despite these tensions, both India and China have expressed interest in managing their bilateral relations amid their respective alignments with the U.S. However, this balancing act is precarious; any significant warming of relations between India and the U.S. could prompt China to adopt a more aggressive posture towards India. Moreover, India's historical ties with Russia complicate this dynamic further. As India navigates its relationship with the U.S., it must also consider its longstanding partnership with Moscow, which remains critical for defense procurement and energy supplies. The interplay between these relationships will shape India's foreign policy choices moving forward. In conclusion, India's growing closeness with the United States significantly impacts its relationship with China across military, economic, and diplomatic dimensions. While this partnership enhances India's capabilities and positions it as a key player in countering Chinese influence in Asia, it also invites greater scrutiny and potential retaliation from Beijing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq71DST6wfYfo	2025-02-21T16:35:30-08:00	
More Reports Of Russian Mercenary And FAMA Attacks On Civilians	Members of the Malian Armed Forces (FAMa) and Russian mercenaries now known as Africa Corps are accused of killing nine people, including women and children, in an attack on a vehicle in Mali’s Segou region in January. Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, spokesperson for the coalition of Tuareg groups in northern Mali, told Reuters that the victims were headed to a refugee camp in Mauritania when they were attacked. It was the latest in a series of atrocities committed by FAMa and Russian mercenaries since the United Nations peacekeeping mission, MINUSMA, left the country more than a year ago. Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara also have been active since MINUSMA left. The terror groups killed at least 47 civilians and displaced thousands between June and December 2024, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). JNIM burned more than 1,000 homes, looted thousands of livestock, and increased attacks on civilians and security forces. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED) reported that attacks on Malian civilians have increased 38% since MINUSMA left, with the battles and attacks spreading to new areas in northern Mali. ACLED said the Malian Army and Russian mercenaries commit 'torture, summary executions, beheadings, ejection of prisoners from aircrafts and the booby-trapping of corpses.' According to ACLED, Malian military and allied forces carried out 255 operations, killing 1,063 civilians between January 1 and the end of October 2024. During the same period in 2023, these forces conducted 216 operations that killed 912 civilians. A recent HRW report included interviews with witnesses to some of the atrocities. In search of ethnic Fulani men accused of supporting JNIM, Malian forces and Russian mercenaries on May 8 killed two men and a boy in Barikoro, a village controlled by the terror group. They arrived on motorcycles and about 10 military vehicles, including armored cars. A mechanic said that he advised a Fulani man to leave his garage when he heard the forces were coming. After the man left, the mechanic heard several gunshots. 'I found my cousin’s body on the west side of the village with eight gunshots: in the forehead, the head, the back, and the legs,' a survivor told HRW. 'Meters away we found the bodies of two Fulani men also riddled by bullets, so we dug three holes and covered them with sand.' Malian and Russian forces on August 16 raided the village of Dounkala, where JNIM regularly attacks security forces. Witnesses said the forces went door to door and rounded up all men and interrogated them outside a mosque, where they killed a 19-year-old. 'His mother told me that when Wagner [fighters] ordered him to go to the mosque, he refused and called them ‘kuffar’ [nonbelievers],' a witness told HRW. 'So, a Wagner [fighter] shot him. I saw the body with a bullet wound in the chest.' Forces conducted similar operations on August 15 in the village of Toulé, killing seven men and torching dozens of homes. A farmer said he hid in an irrigation canal in his rice field. He heard people shouting and saw flames coming from the village. 'The following day, I returned to Toulé and found the bodies of seven villagers, their hands tied up behind their backs, blindfolded, and with their throats slit,' he said. A 52-year-old man said three of his sons were among the 21 civilians reportedly killed in Tinzawaten, where 47 FAMa soldiers and 84 Russian mercenaries were killed in July during a fierce three-day battle with JNIM. Two of the man’s sons were younger than 18. 'I heard the two strikes, and the fear of a third one prevented me from rushing to the scene,' the man told HRW. 'So, the bodies of my children remained there until the early evening when I finally saw them, all hit by shrapnel. … We buried them in a single hole without taking off their clothes, just 900 meters from the place of the strike.' Dozens of Malian soldiers and about 10 Russian fighters attacked the village of Ndorgollé on October 8. Witnesses said uniformed soldiers arrived at 8 a.m. in more than 20 military vehicles, including two armored cars. They surrounded the village, killed two men and arrested three others. 'They asked an older man where his son was,' a herder said. 'He replied he didn’t know. So, one soldier shot him in the chest point-blank. After that, his son came out and was shot in the head.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq4W4WFYz0z9d	2025-02-21T16:31:56-08:00	
New HHS Secretary Curtails US Government Role As Drug Promoter – ...	It has been commonplace for so long that most Americans cannot remember a time before the United States government was out running public relations campaigns urging Americans to take this or that vaccine or other pharmaceutical industry product. Now, an early action by new US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. suggests this practice may be coming to an end. Helen Branswell reported Thursday at STAT News that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 'was ordered to shelve promotions it developed for a variety of vaccines, including a ‘Wild to Mild’ advertising campaign urging people to get vaccinated against flu' and that the CDC was informed that Kennedy 'wanted advertisements that promote the idea of ‘informed consent’ in vaccine decision-making instead.' What a major change — a transition from being a pharmaceutical company product promoter to being a promoter of, as Branswell describes informed consent in her article, 'the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any drug they are prescribed.' This is a good early step by Kennedy. It clarifies a new orientation placing focus on advancing information and choice instead of pushing product. If Kennedy continues on this course, he can accomplish major advancement for health and freedom in America as his appointment suggested would be possible.

Sudanese Refugees Imprisoned And Impoverished By Ethiopian Visa P...	By Augustine Passilly Sudanese refugees living in Ethiopian cities are being driven deeper into poverty because of government-imposed visa fees that are beyond their means, and some have even been arrested for failing to pay the monthly charges and arrears. Ethiopia requires Sudanese who want refugee status to live in designated camps—where they don’t have to pay visa fees – but had previously offered visa exemptions to those who decided to live in urban areas where there is less insecurity. However, these exemptions were halted last October, forcing thousands of refugees living outside the camps to start paying $100 every month to renew their visas, and an additional $10 per day in fines if they miss the payment. 'The police regularly arrest Sudanese people and throw them in jail because they haven’t paid the monthly fees,' one refugee*, who hasn’t been able to pay the charge since entering Ethiopia last July, told The New Humanitarian. A high school teacher in Sudan, the refugee said she relies on her son in France to pay for the modest hotel room she shares with her daughter. Since hearing about the monthly fees, she said she avoids going outside. Sudan’s war—which pits the paramilitary-turned-rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF) against the regular army—erupted in April 2023, and has produced the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. According to the UN, more than 12.3 million people have been uprooted by the violence, of whom 3.5 million have crossed borders into neighbouring countries, mainly Chad, Egypt, and South Sudan. Since the beginning of the war, some 163,000 people from Sudan—including 85,000 Sudanese nationals—have arrived in Ethiopia, which is home to the second-largest refugee population in Africa, hosting over a million people. 'They won’t have access to essential services like healthcare, education, or work opportunities, and may be vulnerable to exploitation.' Ethiopia has been widely commended for allowing so many refugees into the country, yet it has several policies that are harmful to the refugee population, and it is also embroiled itself in a number of destructive and deadly internal conflicts. Sudanese refugees in camps have faced dire humanitarian and security conditions, especially in the Amhara region, where local militias have subjected them to attacks, abductions, and rapes. Some refugee settlements have closed as a result. Meanwhile, many of the urban Sudanese refugees, who are thought to number around 15,000, lack protections that would have been afforded to them if they had refugee status. 'Sudanese nationals who don’t register as refugees may lack legal protection and face deportation or detention,' said Tarik Argaz, a communications officer for UNHCR in Ethiopia. 'They won’t have access to essential services like healthcare, education, or work opportunities and may be vulnerable to exploitation.' 'I try to feed myself. That is my only concern' Sudanese wanting to apply for asylum are supposed to register on arrival in the Ethiopian border towns of Metemma and Assosa. Once registered, they are then required to settle in UN-run camps allocated by local authorities. Those wishing to live outside the camps can request a permit from the government’s Refugees and Returnees Service, yet these can be hard to obtain because applicants must have a local sponsor or prove their ability to support themselves. Many of the urban Sudanese refugees therefore don’t have refugee status nor the hard-to-obtain residence permits. That means they are required to constantly renew their visas, even though few can actually afford it. A 25-year-old homeless Sudanese refugee who has been living in Addis Ababa since last April said he can only focus on his daily survival out on the streets and is terrified of encountering the Ethiopian security services. When he arrived in Ethiopia, he was working for a design company that wanted to fly him to its offices in Mauritania. But he said he was robbed last year of his phone and laptop, which stopped him from working and resulted in his contract being terminated. A single mother who crossed the Ethiopian border with her four children in June 2023 said she is also unable to pay the visa fees because she is focused on more essential things. 'I try to feed myself. That is my only concern,' she told The New Humanitarian. 'I haven’t paid my rent in two months, but the landlord knows I’ll repay him when I have the money,' she added. A makeup artist in Sudan, the woman said she does small informal jobs to feed her children, from henna hand art to serving tea and snacks in the courtyard of a restaurant run by a Sudanese-Ethiopian couple. A Sudanese mathematics professor who has sought refuge in Addis Ababa said he owes so much money to the Ethiopian government that he cannot afford to travel to another country, which is trapping him in a vicious cycle. The professor said many Sudanese refugees in the capital are facing a tough time, with some youth even turning to crime to make ends meet. 'They are willing to do anything in exchange for a meal or a small sum of money,' he said. Detained refugees Arrests of Sudanese who have not renewed their visas are common, according to Hassan Tawakol, a Sudanese academic who is raising funds in Addis Ababa to pay for the bail of detainees. Tawakol sent The New Humanitarian a list of 12 Sudanese refugees he said have been detained since the beginning of February, all of them incarcerated in the capital. A diplomatic source in Addis Ababa, who asked not to be named to speak freely, said Sudanese embassy officials had requested an extension to the original visa fee exemption and that the Ethiopian authorities had promised to grant one. The official said they were unsure if the government had fulfilled its pledge because of 'a lack of will' or for political reasons, which could be linked to Ethiopia’s fractious recent relations with Sudanese authorities. A Sudanese journalist in Addis Ababa said he was stopped last year by security services in civilian clothing and was imprisoned for two months because he hadn’t reviewed his visa for more than half a year. The journalist said he shared a cell with around 40 detainees, including seven Sudanese refugees who all owed money to the Ethiopian government’s Immigration and Citizenship Services agency. He said he was released but has arrears amounting to $1,200 and fears being arrested again. 'There is no logic in asking us to pay such amounts when we fled a war,' he said. 'The Ethiopian government is simply looking for money.' A second Sudanese refugee journalist said the visa fees are supposed to be paid in dollars, which complicates matters further for those who already cannot afford to pay. 'To obtain dollars, I must go through the black market, which is by definition illegal,' the journalist said. 'The police can arrest me if they find dollars or any other hard currency in my pocket.' Fears of returning Despite the difficult situation they are facing – and recent advances by the Sudanese army against the RSF – the refugees who spoke to The New Humanitarian said they are not considering returning to Sudan anytime soon. 'I abandoned my home in Khartoum,' said the single mother living in Addis Ababa with her daughter. 'I have nowhere else to live. Moreover, rents have become exorbitant in cities controlled by the army.' The young man living on the streets said his family members in Sudan are internally displaced and facing dire conditions he would not want to experience. 'My father lost his teaching job because schools are closed,' he said. 'There is no work, no services, no network, no electricity there. And as a young man, it would be very dangerous for me to return to Sudan. I could be forced to take up arms.' *The names of all refugees are being withheld given the risks they face. The writer is a freelance journalist based in Ethiopia, and previously in Sudan. This article is part of The New Humanitarian’s wider body of reporting on abuses against Sudanese refugees in Chad, Egypt, and South Sudan.

Who Flew A Reconnaissance Drone Into Kazakhstan?	(Eurasianet) -- Kazakhstan is finding itself caught up in the Russia-Ukraine war after an unidentified drone crashed in the Bokeyorda District of the West Kazakhstan region, not far from the Russian city of Volgograd. Russian officials are trying to pin the incident on Ukraine, while Ukrainian experts have offered evidence that the drone was a Russian vehicle. Kazakh sensitivities have been heightened by a February 17 drone attack carried out against a vital pumping station in Russia operated by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), part of a pipeline that connects Kazakhstan to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. The CPC pipeline is the main route used for Kazakh oil exports; the destruction caused during the attack will allegedly reduce the pipeline’s export capacity by roughly one-third for several months, according to Russian officials. Ukrainian officials acknowledged the attack on the CPC facility in Krasnodar Krai and say attacks on Russian energy infrastructure will continue. 'They not only support Russia’s military by supplying fuel to enemy forces but also play a crucial role in financing the war through oil profits,' the Kyiv Post quoted a Ukrainian Security Services source as saying. The Kremlin reportedly wants members of the CPC consortium to shoulder the repair and upgrade costs for the damaged pumping station, including advanced firefighting equipment. The American oil giant Chevron and the Kazakh government-controlled energy entity KazMunayGaz are among the largest CPC shareholders. The drone discovery in West Kazakhstan occurred the day after the CPC attack, according to Kazakh media reports. The crash site is situated in the vicinity of a Russian military training ground, Kapustin Yar. Soon after Kazakh reports of a downed drone began circulating, Russian Telegram channels and web information portals began spreading unsubstantiated claims that the drone in question was a reconnaissance vehicle on a mission to coordinate a Ukrainian 'kamikaze' drone attack on CPC infrastructure in Kazakh territory. Russian media described the drone as a French-made UAV used by the Ukrainian military. The Ukrainian Military Center, a Kyiv-based public organization with strong ties to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, accused Russia of trying to stoke 'an international provocation,' adding that the photo of the downed drone published by Kazakh media bears no resemblance to the design of the French-made drone that Russian sources say it is. The Ukrainian Military Center also posted visual evidence that indicates the vehicle is Russian-made, saying 'the characteristic shape of the hull, fuselage elements and the drone’s camera unequivocally confirm that it was the Orlan-10 drone that went down in Kazakhstan.' According to Kazakh media reports, the drone is now being analyzed by Kazakh military experts at a facility in the regional capital Uralsk. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry announced it will seek discussions with Ukrainian officials about drone attacks. 'This is a very important issue for the economy of Kazakhstan, and we will certainly discuss this situation with our Ukrainian partners through diplomatic channels,' the official Kazinform news agency quoted a ministry spokesman as saying. Kazakh officials at the same time are downplaying the impact of the February 17 attack on the CPC pumping station, saying it 'will not pose risks to the transportation of Kazakh oil,' according to the Kazinform report. Export data raises questions about the reliability of Russian damage estimates to the CPC pumping station. The Reuters news agency reported that Kazakhstan pumped a record high volume of oil on February 19, two days after the Ukrainian drone attack on the pumping station. 'It was not immediately clear how Kazakhstan had been able to pump record volumes given output increases need to correspond with export pipeline capacity,' the Reuters report states.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFqz8NOjERTJH6	2025-02-21T16:18:50-08:00	
British Court Confirms Vatican Was Defrauded In London Real Estat...	By Victoria Cardiel A ruling by the High Court of England and Wales published Feb. 21 has confirmed that the Vatican Secretariat of State was deceived by Italian financier Raffaele Mincione in the irregular purchase of a London building. For this transaction that ended in fraud Mincione was sentenced in December 2023 by a Vatican lower court to five years and six months in prison for financial crimes related to the case. In addition, he was ordered to forfeit 200.5 million euros (about $210 million), one of the largest financial penalties ever imposed in the Vatican courts. In that trial, Cardinal Angelo Becciu was also sentenced to five and a half years in prison for embezzlement of public funds. According to the ruling, Becciu arranged the acquisition of property located on Sloane Avenue when he was deputy secretary of state from 2011 to 2018. To do so, he used a third of the reserved funds of the Secretariat of State: that is, $200 million that was paid between 2013 and 2014 at the request of Becciu. This amount was used to buy shares through a fund managed by the Italian intermediary Mincione, who was also convicted along with Becciu by the Vatican lower court for money laundering, embezzlement, and corruption. Following the sentence, Mincione filed a lawsuit against the Vatican Secretariat of State in British court in June 2020, and the court published its ruling Feb. 21. The Italian financier’s aim was to obtain a series of legal declarations in his favor regarding his handling of the buying and selling of the Sloane Avenue building. Mincione argued that his conduct in the transaction had been transparent and in accordance with the standards of good faith. However, the British court rejected his allegations, confirming that the Vatican had reasons to consider itself the victim of a damaging financial scheme. According to Judge Robin Knowles’ 50-page ruling, Mincione and his companies withheld key information and misrepresented the value of the London property, causing significant harm to the Vatican. The court found that Mincione made 'unrealistic' statements, inflating the price of the property and taking advantage of the Vatican’s lack of experience in such investments. Much of the lengthy summary of the verdict focuses on the reconstruction of the irregular transaction.The British court made it clear that the Vatican Secretariat of State was deceived, which coincides with the primary thesis of the Vatican court, which had previously convicted Mincione of money laundering, embezzlement, and corruption. As a lower court ruling, Mincione has the possibility of appealing the decision. For the Vatican, the ruling 'has important implications not only for Mincione but also for future cases involving the financial operations of the Holy See,' according to a Vatican News editorial on the subject. According to Vatican journalist Andrea Tornielli, the ruling 'establishes an important precedent by recognizing that the Vatican was the victim of financial fraud in one of its most important real estate investments.' He also confirmed that according to the Vatican 'the lack of transparency and ethics with which Mincione and his entourage operated could influence other ongoing judicial proceedings.' The sentence reinforces, Tornielli said, 'the conclusions of the Vatican tribunal, which had already convicted Mincione for crimes related to fraudulent investments of funds of the Holy See.' Tornielli also referenced a statement by the Vatican promoter of justice, Alessandro Diddi, expressing his satisfaction with the British court’s ruling against Mincione. 'The British judges have shared the view of the Vatican tribunal and have confirmed that Raffaele Mincione did not act in good faith as required in this type of transaction. With this ruling, it is clear that the Vatican court acted correctly in its assessment of the case,' Diddi said. This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

What We Can Learn From Burckhardt’s Writings – Analysis	By Dr. Badran Al-Honaihen Johann Ludwig Burckhardt was a prominent Swiss traveler, historian and orientalist who visited the Arabian Peninsula in the early 19th century. He is known for his accurate and fair observations. Burckhardt studied Islamic religion and the Arabic language in Britain before embarking on a journey with a pilgrimage caravan to Makkah during the era of the First Saudi State. His writings are considered a significant contemporary source of historical information. He relied on his personal observations and social analysis of the society at that time, in addition to oral narratives and a limited number of written sources, and he produced remarkable works about the period following the founding of the First Saudi State. How can the concept of the state accommodate the population of the Arabian Peninsula, the majority of whom are composed of nomadic tribes? How can the concept of exploitation and plunder through influence and power, which involves seizing the spoils from the weaker, be eradicated so that the populace can develop the vision of a state founded on integrity, Islamic principles, security, and peace? Burckhardt addressed these inquiries, conveying a detailed historical account through the pages of his books. Judicial reform Burkhardt presented an orientalist vision from outside the Arabian Peninsula, which articulated the existence of state values that the inhabitants had not previously recognized. This perspective imposed upon them, as individuals accountable to the state, the concepts of stability and peace, which had been absent for centuries in the region. It also addressed the management of tribal relations and governance, the importance of respecting the judiciary for the first time in centuries, and the prohibition of the use of force and weaponry. This wisdom represented a novel vision and direction for the residents of the Arabian Peninsula, emphasizing that the state bears responsibility for their welfare. The judiciary was the authority to which all tribes turned for arbitration, and it represented one of the most significant outcomes of the state’s legal framework, originating from Diriyah, the capital, and extending beyond it through individuals known for their integrity. The state directly allocated funds as a new legal system, replacing the traditional customs that had been prevalent among the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula in previous centuries, where expenses were incurred by the disputing parties to discuss and resolve their cases. In the judicial system, the right to appeal a decision was also guaranteed under the First Saudi State across all its regions, specifically through the review process in Diriyah, to consider the appeal of the decision, representing a new development in a judicial system that differs from previous practices in the region’s history. Security for all Burckhardt also discussed how the early Saudis approached the concepts of security and peace for all inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula. The state entrusted the complete responsibility for investigating thefts occurring within their territories to tribal leaders and local rulers. They were penalized with fines equivalent to the value of the livestock or property that had been stolen. The leaders of the regions and the chiefs of the tribes were thus tasked with protecting their neighbors and travelers just as they would safeguard their own properties. Consequently, there was a cessation of thefts and acts of plunder that had previously occurred. This level of order following the establishment of the state had not been experienced by the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula since the time of the Prophet and the era of the rightly guided caliphs. Burckhardt noted that a merchant could traverse the Arabian Peninsula alone with complete safety, and that the Bedouins slept without fear of nighttime thieves targeting their livestock and possessions. Burckhardt wrote about the personal guards of the imam, known as the Munqiya, who were recognized as some of the bravest knights of the Arabian Peninsula and formidable warriors. They were permanently stationed in Diriyah and served as a regular force for the state. To join this elite group, one needed to be a distinguished knight with a notable reputation among his people before gaining recognition from others. Each member was provided with a suitable horse or camel from the royal stables, received a salary, and was equipped to the highest standards. The horses or camels were outfitted with gear made from wool covered with felt, which offered significant protection against swords and spears. State protocols In Burckhardt’s writings, there is a notable emphasis on the social details pertaining to the state, particularly highlighting the era of Imam Saud bin Abdulaziz. This historical account is rarely found among local historians, who express admiration for the imam’s elegance and his keen attention to his appearance and pleasant demeanor. Additionally, it is noted that he took great care in grooming his mustache and beard, distinguishing himself from others primarily through the opulence and cleanliness of his attire, as well as the fragrances emanating from his headscarf. Burkhardt elaborated on intricate details of royal etiquette. He discussed the protocol of the Salwa Palace, located in the At-Turaif District, which was home to Imam Saud, and the manner in which princes from various countries and tribal leaders were received. Additionally, he described the palace’s engagement in hosting guests, including the provision of lunch and dinner, as well as the care for horses and camels of the visiting dignitaries. The majlis’s reception times were designated for three specific periods: early morning after dawn; after the afternoon prayer until sunset; and again after the evening prayer late into the night. This latter time was often reserved for the family of the imam and his descendants who happened to be present in Diriyah. Anyone wishing to meet the imam could simply approach the majlis. The common titles used by the public to address the imam included Saud, Abu Abdullah, and Abu al-Shawarib. The majlis was always enriched with the recitation of the Qur’an, discussions of Hadith, interpretations, and cultural insights from the scholars of the court. Imam Saud would conclude the session by addressing the book intended for explanation, followed by a serious discussion among the scholars regarding its contents and a thoughtful exchange of perspectives. According to Burkhardt’s testimony, Imam Saud excelled over others in his profound cultural knowledge, dialogue, and persuasive abilities. This was evident in his high-level writings that demonstrated his skill in persuasion. His eloquence and melodious voice particularly sparked curiosity and admiration, enabling his words to resonate deeply with the hearts of the Arabs around him. The generosity of the imam and his hospitality toward his guests astonished this orientalist, particularly in his description of the stable housing 2,000 Arabian horses. Additionally, he noted the presence of 500 family members and attendants, all of whom were provided with ample food, including rice, bulgur, dates, and lamb, sufficient to accommodate both them and the palace guests. The imam as a father Burkhardt illustrates the imam’s dedication to the upbringing of his children, particularly his son Abdullah, who would later become an imam himself. At the age of five, he was taught to ride horses, allowing him to experience the thrill of galloping. Additionally, the imam is said to have closely observed his children’s behavior and imparted wisdom and sound advice to them. His fondness for fatherhood is evident to anyone who visits the At-Turaif District, where the proximity of the imam’s palace to his sons’ residences is apparent. Imam Saud exemplified wisdom and the ability to address issues swiftly. He was highly educated, possessing a profound understanding of politics. He garnered significant popularity among the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula. His military engagements began at the age of 12. One of the most emotionally significant family moments for Imam Saud occurred during his pilgrimage when he stood before the Kaaba as the people of Saudi Arabia were adorning it with a new covering from Al-Ahsa. While he was preoccupied with observing the pilgrims circumambulating the Kaaba, his son Fahd’s wife approached him, cradling her child in her arms. She had come to fulfill the fifth pillar of Islam and was eager for Imam Saud to meet his grandson, whom he had never seen before. In a tender moment witnessed by all the pilgrims, the imam took the child into his arms, embracing and kissing him affectionately for an extended period. I appreciated Burkhardt’s awareness of social details and the sincerity of his expression; this is what distinguishes a writer from any nation when viewed from an external perspective with a different Western lens. He captures intricate details that may have seemed insignificant to people at the time, which later became a vital source for studying the history of the era. Thank you, Burkhardt, for that account which transported us to the First Saudi State with remarkable detail and precision. Dr. Badran Al-Honaihen is the special projects executive director at the Diriyah Gate Development Authority.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWen4rS1FLbFq19R-LfGYFIe	2025-02-21T16:08:16-08:00	
Rebuilding Myanmar: A Needs-Based Approach To Post-Conflict Trans...	By Harry Myo Lin As Myanmar likely will move toward a post-coup transition in 2025, rebuilding the nation requires a comprehensive and strategic approach. The country’s deep-seated divisions, economic instability, and social fragmentation call for a framework that addresses immediate humanitarian concerns and long-term peacebuilding. By applying Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs to conflict transformation, this article provides policymakers and stakeholders with a structured understanding of how unmet needs fuel conflict and how fulfilling them can foster reconciliation and stability. Drawing from successful post-conflict examples in Aceh, South Africa, and Colombia, we outline practical applications that can guide Myanmar’s path to sustainable peace. From economic justice and governance reforms to interfaith dialogue and trauma healing, this article highlights how a needs-based approach can rebuild trust, empower communities, and ensure a democratic and inclusive Myanmar. Theoretical Framework: Maslow’s Hierarchy and Conflict Dynamics Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Conflict transformation, a process aimed at addressing the root causes of violence and fostering sustainable peace, requires a deep understanding of human motivation and needs. Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, a seminal psychological theory, provides a structured framework to analyze how unmet needs perpetuate conflict and how fulfilling them can promote reconciliation. By bridging psychological principles with peacebuilding methodologies, addressing physiological, safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs can dismantle cycles of violence and empower individuals and communities. Maslow’s theory posits that human needs are arranged hierarchically, with basic physiological and safety needs forming the foundation, followed by social belonging, esteem, and self-actualization (Maslow, p. 370–96). Lower-level 'deficiency needs' (D-needs) must be 'more or less' met before higher 'growth needs' (B-needs) become salient (Maslow, p. 69). However, Maslow later acknowledged flexibility in the hierarchy, noting that needs can overlap or reorder based on individual and cultural contexts (Maslow, p. 68). Figure 1: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Source: Wikimedia Commons. Linking Unmet Needs to Conflict Structural conflicts, such as colonialism, patriarchy, or economic exploitation, often arise from systemic deprivation of basic needs. The Dependency-Power-Violence (DPV) Triangle illustrates this: involuntary dependency on dominant groups creates power imbalances, which, when sustained, justify violence as a means to fulfill unmet needs (Arai, p. 30). For instance, marginalized communities deprived of physiological needs (food, shelter) or safety (employment, healthcare) may resort to violence to reclaim agency (Arai, p. 30). Similarly, dehumanization—a key conflict dynamic—stems from polarised groups denying each other’s humanity, often due to perceived threats to their safety or esteem (Conflict Dynamics, p. 1). Figure 2: The DPV Triangle. Source: Arai (Adapted from Lederach, 2005). Conflict Transformation Through a Needs-Based Lens Conflict transformation strategies must address both immediate needs and structural inequities. Johan Galtung’s concept of structural violence—systemic harm caused by unjust institutions—aligns with Maslow’s emphasis on deficiency needs (Galtung, 2010, p. 157–188). By ensuring access to resources (physiological/safety), fostering inclusive communities (belonging), and empowering marginalized voices (esteem/self-actualization), practitioners can dismantle cycles of violence. Practical Applications for Myanmar Transitioning from Theory to Practice Applying Maslow’s hierarchy to Myanmar’s post-coup transition requires a needs-based approach to rebuilding the nation after the military is defeated. Myanmar will face a reconstruction period, requiring a careful strategy to address the economic, social, and psychological scars of military rule. By looking at successful post-conflict models from Aceh, South Africa, and Colombia, we can propose practical steps for Myanmar’s transformation. 1. Addressing Physiological and Safety Needs: Economic Justice and Stability Land Rights and Economic Redistribution: Myanmar’s history of land dispossession and economic control by the military must be addressed through comprehensive land reforms. Inspired by South Africa’s post-apartheid land restitution program, Myanmar can implement policies that return land to displaced ethnic minorities and provide economic opportunities to former resistance fighters and war-affected populations. Employment and Financial Stability: A post-conflict Myanmar will need economic stabilization programs similar to Aceh’s reintegration projects for ex-combatants. These programs can provide former resistance fighters with vocational training and employment opportunities, reducing their reliance on armed struggle. Microfinance programs, modeled after Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank, can be extended to rural Myanmar to empower women and local businesses. 2. Building Belonging and Esteem: Social Reconciliation and Healing Interfaith and Ethnic Dialogue: Religious and ethnic divisions fueled by military propaganda will require structured reconciliation efforts. In Colombia, interfaith dialogue and truth commissions were crucial in rebuilding community trust. Myanmar could create community dialogue forums in the different potential federal unit areas where religious and community leaders engage in trust-building initiatives, learning from South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Education and Media Reform: To dismantle ethnic and religious prejudices, education reform is essential. Curriculums should be redesigned to promote pluralism, civic education, and human rights awareness, following Rwanda’s model of post-genocide education reform. Media regulations must ensure that hate speech is countered, similar to Germany’s strict anti-hate speech laws, preventing extremist ideologies from resurfacing. 3. Empowering Self-Actualization: Grassroots Leadership and Civic Engagement Decentralization and Local Governance: A post-coup Myanmar should avoid over-centralization of power. The governance model can be inspired by Indonesia’s post-Suharto decentralization, where local communities were given greater control over governance. Local councils, led by former resistance leaders and civil society actors, can provide a sense of ownership in rebuilding Myanmar. Arts-Based Peacebuilding: Creative expression is a powerful tool for social healing. Sri Lanka’s Butterfly Peace Garden demonstrated how art, theater, and storytelling help trauma-affected youth reconcile with past conflicts. Myanmar’s traditional cultural arts (e.g., Zat performances, poetry, songs, animations, movies, murals, etc) can be used to create shared narratives of unity and national renewal. Challenges and Considerations Cultural and Contextual Adaptation: Maslow’s hierarchy, developed in Western individualistic contexts, may not fully align with Myanmar’s collectivist society. Efforts must respect communal identities while ensuring individual agency. Power Asymmetry and Structural Barriers: While symbolically powerful, women’s inclusion in peace talks may remain tokenistic unless patriarchal norms are actively challenged. Quotas for female participation, modeled after Liberia’s post-war governance reforms, can help address systemic barriers. Psychological and Trauma Considerations: A conflict-affected society like Myanmar will have profound psychological wounds. Addressing trauma healing and mental health services is essential to preventing cycles of violence. Programs modeled after Bosnia’s post-war psychosocial interventions could help address collective trauma and ensure sustainable reconciliation. Balancing Immediate Needs and Long-Term Goals: Simultaneously addressing urgent survival needs and long-term democratic restructuring will be critical. Myanmar’s transition must prioritize stability and justice, ensuring that governance structures do not replicate past inequalities. Conclusion A needs-based approach provides a holistic framework for Myanmar’s post-coup transition. By addressing economic justice, social reconciliation, and grassroots leadership, Myanmar can lay the groundwork for sustainable and inclusive peace. Learning from global post-conflict transformations, Myanmar’s future must be shaped by policies that bridge psychological well-being with structural reforms, ensuring a resilient and democratic society. Policymakers and all stakeholders must work collectively to achieve this vision of national renewal.

External Revenue Or Protectionism: A Tariff Can’t Be Both – Analy...	By Tate Fegley One of President Trump’s proposals for his new term is to abolish the federal income tax and replace it with tariffs as the primary revenue source for the US federal government. In a brilliant rhetorical move, he suggests implementing this through abolishing the Internal Revenue Service and replacing it with the 'External Revenue Service,' claiming that the tariffs collected by this new agency would be financed by foreigners rather than Americans. This sure sounds like a good deal. Trump has claimed that 'tariff' is the most beautiful word in the English language, even more so than 'love.' Perhaps it would be if it were a device by which one could costlessly extract funds from foreigners. But is a tariff capable of doing such a thing? Standard microeconomic analysis tells us that the economic 'incidence' of a tax (that is, who really pays what portion of it) is not necessarily who statutorily collects it. In other words, just because sales tax is collected by the seller who then pays it to the tax man, this doesn’t mean that it is the seller paying the whole tax. Rather, the incidence of the tax depends on the relative elasticities of the buyer’s demand and the seller’s supply. A greater portion of the tax will be borne by the party whose demand (or supply) is relatively inelastic, as shown in the figure below. So is AOC right when she says the recently threatened tariffs on Colombian exports to the US will be paid by Americans? Not if she means that the tax will be exclusively paid for by Americans, but yes, if she means to say that at least some will be. The US is a big market for Colombian exporters—it is unlikely that Colombian coffee producers, for example, could halt all their exports to the US, attempt to sell it all elsewhere, and receive the same amount of revenue. In other words, the supply curve of Colombian for exports to the US is upward sloping, rather than flat. However, unless that supply curve is vertical (in which case, the quantity of Colombian coffee supplied to the US would be completely unresponsive to changes in price), at least some of the incidence of a tariff on Colombian coffee exported to the US would be borne by US consumers. The only other possible way that the tariff would be fully paid by Colombian exporters is if the demand curve of US consumers for Colombian coffee is horizontal, which would mean that any increase in price would lead to Americans not buying any Colombian coffee at all. As such, any tariff would have to be fully paid by Colombian exporters. To reiterate: there are only two (unlikely and perhaps even impossible) circumstances under which the incidence of tariffs would fall fully upon foreigners: The supply curve of the foreign exporter is vertical (perfectly inelastic) The demand curve of US consumers for a particular country’s exports is horizontal (perfectly elastic) A far more plausible scenario in the realm of international trade is a relatively elastic supply curve. Indeed, a model commonly presented in international trade textbooks analyzes the effect of a tariff in a 'small' country, which is assumed to lack the heft to sway world markets through its citizens’ decisions to buy or abstain from buying, and thus faces a horizontal world supply curve: In this case, the reason the importing country faces a horizontal supply curve at PFT is because consumers in the importing country have to compete with the rest of the world’s consumers, and if they aren’t willing to pay at least PFT, exporters can find plenty of other consumers who are willing to pay that price. As such, if the importing country’s government imposes tariffs on this good, the full burden of the tax will be on domestic consumers because the only way exporters are willing to sell in that country is if they receive at least PFT. Something you’ll also find in a typical international trade textbook is a model analyzing the effects of tariffs in a 'large' country, meaning that demand in that market is large enough such that exporters cannot find just as many willing buyers elsewhere. Under such circumstances (and if supply and demand curves are drawn in a certain way), in this model it’s possible for the large country to 'benefit' on net from tariffs—that is, the total dollar value of deadweight losses from the tariff in terms of losses in consumer welfare and production inefficiencies is outweighed by a sufficient amount of the tax falling on exporters. (However, this net 'benefit' treats taxpayer dollars in the hands of the government as just as valuable as taxpayers being able to keep their money.) But even in this optimistic scenario (in the real world we could not even determine whether such an 'optimal tariff' had been achieved), it is still the case that tariffs are being at least partially paid by domestic consumers. There is no free lunch. One further thing to emphasize (as noted by Robert Murphy in a recent episode of The Human Action Podcast) is that there is a conflict between the goals of having a tariff protect domestic producers on the one hand and be revenue-generating on the other hand. In the former case, the end of having a protective tariff is making imports sufficiently expensive that domestic consumers will choose to buy from a domestic producer. The more successful the tariff is in this regard, the fewer imports there are and, therefore, the less tariff revenue there is. If it is 100 percent successful and no imports are purchased, then there is no tariff revenue. Gary North agreed with Trump that 'tariff' sounds better than 'sales tax': The politicians of the national state come before the voters and propose sales taxes on goods that cross into the nation from abroad. The politicians are careful not to describe these sales taxes as sales taxes. Too many voters are tired of paying the existing level of taxes, let alone a new tax. So, the politicians call these sales taxes by a new name: tariffs. But there is nothing magical about tariffs. They are taxes and they are paid by you.

Khamenei Admits Defeat In Battle For Public Trust Among Iran’s Pe...	In a speech on February 17, 2025, Iranian regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei once again revealed his deep fear about the unstable state of the regime and the inevitable prospect of its overthrow. He acknowledged the sequential desertions and demoralization among the regime’s rank and file and dispirited forces with the phrase 'doubts about the pillars of the state!' and, to boost their morale, resorted to empty boasting. 'Today, in terms of hard defense, in terms of the enemy’s hard threat, we have no worries or problems. Today, thank God, we ourselves know, our friends know, and our enemies know that Islamic Iran, in terms of its ability to deal with hard threats, is at a high level, and the people feel secure in this regard. Therefore, our issue today is not the enemy’s hard threats,' Khamenei said. If Khamenei’s problem is not a hard threat, then what is it? Acknowledgment of Feeling Danger from Inside the Country In this speech, Khamenei said: 'Today, our enemies admit that they have come to the conclusion that if they want to overcome the Iranian nation, if they want to push the Islamic Republic back from its powerful positions, the way is to create problems inside the country, inside the nation, and inflict the people with problems and soft threats.' These words indicate that the most important priority for the Supreme Leader, as always, is to preserve the regime against the danger of being overthrown by the people and their fiery uprising. Unlike in the past, when Khamenei used foreign threats as an excuse to justify internal repression, he now explicitly admits that the real threat comes from inside the country and from within the Iranian people. His statements can also be interpreted from the angle that street repression can no longer control the deep social and political crises. The regime’s main enemy is not Khamenei’s delusions about foreign conspiracies, but the Iranian people; people who, according to him, are the subject of a 'soft threat!' due to their increasing and escalating awareness of political and social issues, and each of them, by organizing a base of revolution in their homes, streets, and workplaces, can ignite the matches ready for an uprising. Filling the Empty Bag with Government-Staged Shows In this speech, Khamenei once again tried to promote the street carnival and the exposed show of government-organized crowd-making on the anniversary of the anti-monarchical revolution as evidence of his regime’s legitimacy. He claimed that these marches show that the people still support the regime. The reality is that such shows are organized with huge expenses, forced mobilization, and threats to employees and students, and have nothing to do with the real demands of the people. Khamenei is making these statements while the claim of Jamshid Amouzegar, the then Prime Minister of the Shah, on April 10, 1978, about the gathering of 400,000 people in Tabriz is still in the collective memory of the Iranian people. The Shah regime was busy making fake crowds by bringing the army, police, and SAVAK [Shah’s secret police] onto the scene in the guise of plainclothes agents while the officials and leaders of the regime were competing with each other in buying real estate in California to flee the country. Khamenei’s main challenge is that people no longer trust official narratives. In today’s world, with the expansion of social networks, the truths behind these shows are revealed. Scenes of empty streets, pre-determined slogans, and carrying government placards can no longer deceive society. Confession to Failure with the Phrase 'Soft Threat' Khamenei admitted that the issue for his government today is not the enemy’s hard threat, but the soft threat. He defined this threat: 'What is a soft threat? A soft threat means manipulating people’s public opinion, creating discord, creating doubt about the pillars of the Islamic Revolution; this is a software threat. A soft threat means creating doubt about resistance against the enemy; this is what they are doing.' This confession is proof of the fact that the regime has become powerless in the face of people’s awareness. Khamenei knows that the Iranian people have risen up to confront the regime’s lies by relying on information, awareness, and social networks. The mentality of society can no longer be changed with censorship, filtering, and government propaganda. In order to survive, the regime is trying to keep people in ignorance and unawareness. But people are becoming more aware day by day and are no longer deceived by government shows. The widespread protests of students, workers, teachers, and other dissatisfied groups in Iran show an increase in the level of public awareness. This has terrified the regime. By carefully examining the content of his statements, it can be understood that it is not the people who have fallen into doubt about the 'pillars of the regime' (i.e., the rule of clergy and the policy of repression and export of terrorism). The people’s stance towards this regime has been clear for years. Khamenei’s reference is to the regime’s crumbling base of loyalists, which can no longer be preserved with the regime’s superficial and propagandistic slogans. A Futile Attempt to Justify the Regime’s Enemy-Making Khamenei continued his speech and tried to justify the regime’s enemy-making. He said: 'Some, in incomplete analyses, like to pretend that Iran itself creates enemies with its own hands, this is not the case.' Everyone knows that the regime’s aggressive and repressive policies are due to its fascist nature, and creating a fictitious enemy to justify these policies is an inherent characteristic of fascism. The mullahs’ regime is the main cause of enemy-making by suppressing the people, supporting terrorist groups in the region, and creating internal and external crises. The Iranian people know well that the real enemy is not outside the country, but within this oppressive regime. A Future Without the Mullahs’ Rule Khamenei’s statements reveal his fear of the future more than ever before. He knows that Iranian society no longer accepts the medieval and outdated system of the mullahs’ rule. Every day that passes, the foundations of his rule become shakier and the wave of public anger expands. As mentioned earlier, the real threat that Khamenei is talking about does not come from foreign enemies, but from within the streets of Iran and from among the people who no longer want to submit to the coercion and oppression of the absolute rule of the mullahs. This speech as a whole is an acknowledgment of the weakness, decline, and inevitable end of religious fascism. The Iranian people, more aware and determined than ever, are moving in the direction of overthrowing this dictatorship in line with the organized resistance and Resistance Units. A future without the mullahs’ rule is on the horizon.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj39xSmSumFuT	2025-02-20T16:50:48-08:00	
Speak Truth To Power…Or Irrelevance – OpEd	Back in July, in the immediate aftermath of the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump and that photograph of him rising phoenix-like from the floor with a bloodied ear and raised fist shouting the defiant ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’, J D Vance’s selection as Trump’s running mate caused a meltdown among those afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome. On the Democratic left, because Vance was regarded as an apostate and the only befitting punishment for apostates is death. On the Republican right, because Vance, an Iraq veteran, was the symbol of the long-overdue end of the interventionist neoconservative movement addicted to forever wars. There was a third line of criticism, which still bubbles up occasionally, which attacked Vance as an opportunist who had turned from excoriating Trump to singing his praises. He had described himself as a Never Trumper and called Trump ‘an idiot,’ ‘noxious,’ ‘America’s Hitler,’ and ‘unfit for our nation’s highest office’ because he is ‘morally reprehensible.’ The thing is though, as Salena Zeto wrote in the Atlantic back in 2016, while Trump’s supporters took his candidacy seriously but didn’t take his rhetoric literally, opponents take his words literally but don’t take him seriously. Vance’s earlier views of Trump were of the latter variety. For those who have read Vance’s autobiographical Hillbilly Elegy (2016), however, there is a natural political-cum-philosophical affinity between him and Trump. He grew up an Appalachian hillbilly, overcame ‘white trash’ origins and a dysfunctional family, joined the Marines, and leveraged military service into degrees from Ohio State and Yale. His social, economic, and governing philosophies are the result of this hardscrabble backstory. His business and political success offer a lesson in redemption that is the very essence of the American dream. Writing in the Spectator Australia on 27 July, I said: ‘Other potential picks for a running mate (who alone of the senior advisers cannot be fired) might have better helped Trump to win the election, but 39-year-old J D Vance offers the best chance to entrench the MAGA revolution in and beyond a second Trump administration.’ Vance brought his compelling backstory to life in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Milwaukee on 17 July. The introduction of his previously drug-addled and serially partnered mother, clean and sober now for a decade, to the whole nation was a fitting culmination of his life story to date. His wife Usha Vance represents another stream in the American dream, of immigrants who come to America as the land of opportunity where education, talent, and hard work are rewarded. Indo-Americans have achieved success without victimhood and grievance. Vance is exceptionally attuned to the ravages of American deindustrialisation with US manufacturing hollowed out, jobs shipped overseas, and swathes of the homeland turned into a wasteland along the Rust Belt. As Vance said in his acceptance speech, China built its middle class on the backs of growing numbers of unemployed Americans. Vance similarly prioritises the health of the US economy above the health of the planet under the alleged threat from ‘global warming.’ The commitment to reversing this destructive trend rests equally powerfully on the recognition of the importance of dignity conferred on human beings by productive work and living wages and the role of well-paying jobs in sustaining stable family life. Like Trump, Vance’s instincts are not to flinch but to go all in to turn the American nightmare into the American dream once again. His youth will ensure a continuation of Trumpism after Trump by an articulate and thoughtful politician. In foreign policy, he could be expected to shy away from military adventurism but punch hard if and when necessary to defend American interests and values. In personal traits, he came without the crude vulgarities of his boss that millions of Americans are unable to get past in order to appreciate his policies and achievements. Vance is a champion of the post-liberal right. To decry him as isolationist betrays willful blindness. He represents realism and restraint alongside strength. He has remained steadfast in US support for Israel in its war with Hamas. He questions why Europe, comparable in wealth and population to America, cannot deal with Ukraine on its own. Its military underspending is ‘an implied tax on the American people to allow for the security of Europe,’ he wrote in the Financial Times a year ago. He holds Asia to be the key strategic battleground in the foreseeable future. Similarly, Vance is no more racist and anti-immigrant than Trump. Both welcome legal immigrants who share in and commit to core American values. Both oppose discrimination – positive and negative – based on faith and skin colour. Why wouldn’t Vance want equality of opportunity for his own children? In a triumph of hope over experience, I concluded my July article with the thought that ‘Australian conservatives could do with a Trump-Vance combination whose focus is on the wellbeing of productive workers on the farms and in the factories.’ Vice President Vance Delivering his acceptance speech to the nation on 5 November after winning the election, Trump said of his running mate: [J D Vance is] a feisty guy isn’t he? You know, I’ve said 'go into the enemy camp' and, you know, the enemy camp is certain networks and a lot of people don’t like it, they’re like 'Sir, do I have to do that?' He just goes 'Okay, which one? CNN? MSNBC?' He’ll say 'All right, thank you very much.' He actually is like the only guy I’ve ever, he really looks forward to it and then he just goes in and absolutely obliterates them… We had of course seen these traits in the course of the campaign in the calm and methodical manner in which Vance did indeed obliterate many hostile media interviewers with complete courtesy but a deadly command of his brief. Trump added: He’s turned out to be a good choice. I took a little heat at the beginning, but he was – I knew, I knew the brain was a good one, about as good as it gets. And we love the family. Vance has grown into the office of Vice President. He is articulate, smart, knowledgeable and well-informed, intellectually agile, and able to marshal facts and evidence in support of the broader argument. He can respond with passion without losing his cool. A man of both gravitas and charm. Little wonder that he seems to have been given a national and international role of unique visibility and impact in the history of the office in my lifetime. The annual Munich Security Conference brings together the world’s top politicians, statesmen, generals, and corporate leaders to discuss the weighty issues currently on their mind. In a fiery address on 14 February that referenced Soviet-era language of misinformation and disinformation by the bad guys who censored dissidents, cancelled elections, and closed churches, Vance criticised Europeans for abandoning their roots as ‘defenders of democracy.’ He framed his attack along two axes, the retrenchment of free speech and the loss of border controls and national identity with mass immigration. The first is especially dear to my heart. Vance began by saying that the threat to Europe that most concerns him is not from Russia, China, or any external power but ‘the threat from within.’ The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values that are also American values. Romania’s elections annulled because EU commissioners didn’t like the outcome and warned the same could happen in Germany. Warning that ‘You can’t force people what to think, what to feel, or what to believe,’ he cited examples from across Europe of police action for online anti-feminist comments, judges saying that free speech doesn’t give people a ‘free pass’ to say things that offend a particular group with strongly held beliefs, the arrest, conviction, and fining of a man for praying silently 50 metres from an abortion clinic, and, most egregious of all, the Scottish government warning people that private prayers inside their own homes within ‘safe access zones’ could break the law. The next day, theTelegraph revealed that almost 300 people have been charged with online speech crimes under Britain’s controversial Online Safety Act. More than just talk about democratic values, ‘We must live them.’ He criticised the ban on populist elected parliamentarians from participating in the conference. It’s critical to engage in dialogue with everyone who represents an important constituency and not construct firewalls to quarantine the political system from being infected by their ideological disease. This has happened with Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Nigel Farage in the UK, and, before her election as prime minister, even Giorgia Meloni in Italy. You cannot run ‘in fear of your own voters,’ afraid of their voices, opinions, and conscience, he lectured his audience. You cannot govern effectively without a democratic mandate when difficult choices have to be made on energy and supply chain security and ‘You cannot win a democratic mandate by censoring your opponents or putting them in jail.’ After criticising the organisers for excluding the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Vance met its co-leader Alice Weidel outside the conference. Mass immigration is possibly the most urgent policy issue confronting Western democracies. On the eve of the Munich conference, a 28-year-old Afghan who lost his asylum application drove a Mini Cooper into a trade union demonstration in Munich, killing a young mother and baby and injuring 28. He was already known to police, which is another common thread in the recent spate of asylum seeker-related attacks across Europe and the UK. Many populist parties are riding the wave of public support on the back of promises to bring ‘an end to out of control migration.’ In a democracy, ‘the people have a voice’ and ‘leaders have a choice.’ Far from protecting democracy, ignoring people, ‘dismissing their concerns,…shutting down media, shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process …is the most surefire way to destroy democracy.’ I wonder how the Albanese government now feels about Australia’s recently toughened hate speech law? And the supposedly centre-right Coalition parties that voted with Labor to enact it? It was a courageous speech in front of an expectedly hostile audience that by the end was barely registering a smattering of strained applause. Chancellor Olaf Scholz responded at the conference that Vance’s interference in Germany’s election was unacceptable. It’s worth repeating that Vance was born into the very types of circumstances and conditions that liberal leaders profess to be most concerned about. He delivered many telling home truths on the need for states to serve the people as active participants in the political process. Far too many countries have morphed into hollowed-out zones of discontentment run by career politicians, technocrats, and oligarchs. Instead of a distant, technocratic, and coercive behemoth feared by the people, institutions must once again become responsive to citizen aspirations and apprehensions and work with them to achieve economic stability and restore cultural identity and national sovereignty. One can quibble with particular phrases and debate the details. It’s the broad thrust of Vance’s two-pronged argument that I found attractive. ‘Free speech, I fear, is in retreat,’ said Vance. He called EU commissioners ‘Commissars’ and warned that ‘in Britain and across Europe, free speech is in retreat.’ Heady stuff! It was a brutal public dressing down of European liberal smugness ever from a visiting American dignitary. Progressive leaders habitually scold others. They are not used to being at the receiving end of a tongue-lashing. Because the EU is a geopolitical lightweight, we cannot call it an example of speaking truth to power. Instead, we could describe it as an instance of power speaking truth to an audience courting irrelevance.

India’s Dalit Women: Silent Battles Against Sexual And Caste Abus...	The relationship between sexual violence and caste in India exposes ingrained social injustices that have persisted for decades despite the country's independence. Even though equality before the law is guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, people from marginalised communities—especially Dalits—often experience a very different reality. In India, caste has a significant influence on sexual violence and is not just a problem for one gender. The victim's caste often dictates the reaction of the legal system, public indignation, and media coverage. This piece examines the widespread problem of rape in India, emphasising the particular difficulties faced by Dalit women and how caste affects justice. India's caste system, though legally abolished, continues to govern social, economic, and political life. Caste determines one's status and opportunities. The caste system dictates an individual's standing and prospects, and Dalit women frequently experience dual oppression as members of a marginalised caste and as women. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) states that a crime against Dalits is committed every fifteen minutes and that six Dalit women are raped every day. In spite of these concerning figures, Dalit victims frequently do not garner the same level of attention or condemnation as women from higher castes, highlighting the systematic discrimination that exists in Indian society. There was a lot of public outrage, quick political responses, and media coverage of the upper-caste victim in the Bengal case. In contrast, the Bihar incident, in which a Dalit girl was the victim, received little attention from the media and generated little political or public outcry. The dearth of response in the Bihar case was partly caused by the victim's caste, underscoring the institutionalised prejudice in the way these cases are managed. There has long been a pattern of caste-based inequality in rape cases. A prime example of this inequality is the 2020 Hathras case, in which a young Dalit woman was brutally raped and killed. Government agents swiftly suppressed those pursuing justice, destroyed evidence, and dropped the case. The 2012 Nirbhaya case, on the other hand, involving a victim from the upper caste, caused a great deal of outrage, important legal changes, and even a special session of the Supreme Court. While the Nirbhaya case became emblematic of India's struggle against sexual violence, it also exposed the partiality of public and judicial support. Although frequently biased, the media plays a critical role in influencing public opinion and the administration of justice. Storylines about victims from the upper caste are more likely to be sensationalised and to be reported nonstop, but Dalit victims' cases are often disregarded, with the media emphasising the 'criminality' of the community rather than the suffering of the victims. Because of the selective reporting, Dalit voices are marginalised, and caste-based discrimination is perpetuated, allowing offenders to go unpunished. The way the Indian judiciary and law enforcement operate is also influenced by caste dynamics. Crimes against Dalit women frequently result in intimidation of the victims' families, delays in the investigation, and refusals to file First Information Reports (FIRs). However, when it comes to victims who are from higher castes, the authorities tend to move quickly and decisively. These obstacles in the court system for Dalit victims are glaringly evident in the Hathras case, where authorities keep protecting the offenders ahead of serving justice.Socio-economic factors make Dalit women especially susceptible to sexual violence. Dalit women frequently work in low-paying, unofficial jobs with little access to legal, medical, or educational resources. Since they lack the social and financial resources to defend themselves, their economic marginalisation makes them easy pickings for sexual assault. Due to the combination of economic disparity and caste, Dalit women are primarily dependent on upper-class employers or landlords who can take advantage of their weaknesses without worrying about the consequences. Although there is a strong legal framework in place to prevent sexual violence, caste prejudice frequently makes it difficult for these laws to be implemented. Law enforcement usually uses the Prevention of Atrocities Act insufficiently or ignores it, which reflects ingrained prejudices and the intention of shielding Dalits and Adivasis from caste-based violence. Victims of dominant caste abuse frequently have few choices because of the perpetrators' frequent use of social and political influence to evade justice. The social stigma attributed to Dalit women's gender and caste exacerbates the psychological effects of sexual violence against them. Knowing that they are more likely to be victims of violence and not get justice because of their caste exacerbates the trauma of rape. The widespread sense of helplessness and terror that accompanies this perception of Dalit women as second-class citizens contributes to long-term mental health problems, such as elevated rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Dalit women and activists persist in resisting and fighting for justice in the face of these overwhelming obstacles. Dalit women's rights and legislative and policy changes have been spearheaded by groups such as the National Dalit Movement for Justice (NDMJ) and the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch (AIDMAM). These organisations empower Dalit women by battling systematic discrimination, spreading awareness, and offering legal support. The community's tenacity and resolve to end caste-based oppression are demonstrated by the increasing visibility of Dalit voices in the campaign against sexual assault.

Bureaucrats Tossing Gold Bars Off The Titanic – OpEd	During its last four months in power, the Biden-Harris administration opened the U.S. government’s money spigots as wide as they could. Appointed officials and bureaucrats across the federal government frantically spent money at a rate never before seen outside of pandemics and wars. But there was no national emergency in these months. A very different motive drove their frantic spending. For the outgoing officials and the bureaucrats who supported them, it was their 'insurance policy' against losing power in Washington, D.C. That claim was made by a member of the Biden-Harris administration who served as a special adviser to the Environmental Protection Agency. It was captured in a undercover investigation by Project Veritas and reported nearly a month after former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election. After the report, the Biden-Harris EPA spokesman denied any wrongdoing. In the weeks and months that followed, the allegation was not confirmed. It seemed the story was at a dead end. Evidence Emerges of a Wild Spending Spree That changed on February 12, 2024. The new EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, confirmed in a video announcement that the EPA rushed large amounts of cash out the door in the Biden-Harris administration’s waning days. Here’s a transcript of the portion of the video directly addressing the allegation: One of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars. There will be zero tolerance of any waste and abuse. An extremely disturbing video circulated two months ago featuring a Biden EPA political appointee talking about how they were 'tossing gold bars off the Titanic', rushing to get billions of your tax out the door before Inauguration Day. The 'gold bars' were tax dollars and tossing them off the Titanic meant the Biden Administration knew they were wasting it. Following this revelation, during my meetings with members of Congress, I made a very important commitment to them and to the American people, which I reiterated at my confirmation hearing that if confirmed, I would immediately get a full accounting. Fortunately, my awesome team at EPA has found the gold bars. Shockingly, roughly 20 billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA. This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight. Even further, this pot of $20 billion was awarded to just eight entities that were then responsible for doling out your money to NGOs and others at their discretion with far less transparency. Just under $7 billion was sent to one entity called the Climate United Fund. I’m sure you and I now have some of the same questions. How do these organizations decide how to allocate funding? How much money have they given out so far and to whom? Are there any former Biden EPA staff offers who are now working at these entities? Let me make one thing abundantly clear. At this point there is zero reason to suspect any wrongdoing by the bank. Here’s my position as EPA administrator. The financial agent agreement with the bank needs to be instantly terminated and the bank must immediately return all of the gold bars that the Biden Administration tossed off the Titanic. EPA needs to reassume responsibility for all of these funds. We will review every penny that has gone out the door. I will be referring this matter to the Inspector General’s office and will work with the Justice Department as well. The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over. The American public deserves a more transparent and accountable government than what transpired these past four years. We take our obligations under the law as seriously as it gets. I’ve directed my team to find your gold bars and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps. To get so much money out the door so quickly, Biden-Harris EPA officials circumvented safeguards intended to prevent government officials from wasting taxpayer money. They were indeed'throwing gold bars' off their 'sinking Titanic.' Their actions to short-cut these spending controls gave them away. Potential Criminal Dimensions In addition to circumventing the EPA’s accounting controls, the officials and bureaucrats may alsohave tripped over other laws restricting government employees from exploiting their positions for personal gain. For example, if any officials improperly moved taxpayer funds to groups where they later got jobs after leaving public service, that feather-nesting could represent a kind of embezzlement or racketeering. The Justice Department will very likely investigate that potential. I suppose the most amazing part about the story is the original claim made by the Biden-Harris special adviser to the EPA. Their brazenness following their election loss suggests they didn’t think they would ever face any consequences for their actions. It’s a remarkable dimension in the annals of bureaucrats behaving badly.

Trump ‘Very Frustrated’ With Zelenskyy, US National Security Advi...	By Merhat Sharipzhan and Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- The White House national security adviser said that U.S. President Donald Trump is 'obviously very frustrated' with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and urged the Ukrainian president to reach an agreement soon granting the United States access to Ukraine's critical minerals. The remarks from Michael Waltz came after Zelenskyy and Trump traded sharp criticism in recent days, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and suggesting he started the war with Russia -- comments that caused concern in Ukraine and Europe and prompted pushback from some senior U.S. Republican lawmakers. A day earlier, Zelenskyy rejected a proposal that would reportedly hand the United States $500 billion in mineral wealth, including rare-earth elements, as a form of payment for U.S. military and financial support for Kyiv's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion, which enters its fourth year next week. 'He needs to come back to the table,' Waltz said at a press conference at the White House on February 20. Zelenskyy has pointed out that U.S. wartime aid so far was far less than that amount and that the U.S. proposal did not offer concrete security guarantees. Trump's harshest criticism to date of Zelenskyy came after Zelenskyy charged that Trump was pushing 'a lot of information that is coming from Russia' and that the United States was helping Russia 'break out of years of isolation' by holding high-level talks in Riyadh on February 18 and moving toward normalizing relations. The bilateral U.S.-Russia talks, on the war in Ukraine and other issues, stoked worried in Ukraine and among some of its backers that Kyiv could be sidelined from negotiations and pressured to accept a cease-fire or peace deal that would favor Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron said he will travel to Washington, where he will urge Trump to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and try to convince him that the interests of the United States and Europe are in line with one another. 'I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of [Putin],' Macron said. The White House said that Trump will host Macron on February 24 and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on February 27. Zelenskyy struck a conciliatory tone following what he called a 'productive meeting' on February 20 with Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, who is on his first visit to Ukraine. The pair had 'a good discussion, [covering] many important details,' Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X. 'I am grateful to the United States for all the assistance and bipartisan support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.' 'Ukraine is ready for a strong, effective investment and security agreement with the President of the United States,' he wrote, adding, 'Strong Ukraine-U.S. relations benefit the entire world.' However, a joint press conference by Zelenskyy and Kellogg was canceled, and there was no immediate comment from Kellogg after the meeting. Meanwhile, several senior U.S. Republican lawmakers have been pushing back against Trump's recent criticism of Zelenskyy. They worry that signaling a willingness to cut off support for Kyiv could embolden Putin. Trump's framing of Zelenskyy in negative terms stands in stark contrast to those Senate Republicans who view Ukraine as a victim of Russian aggression. They voiced strong support for Ukraine on February 19 and warned against appeasing Moscow. Senator John Kennedy (Republican-Louisiana) did not mince words when addressing the threat posed by Putin, describing him as 'a gangster with a black heart...who makes Jeffrey Dahmer (a notorious serial killer) look like Mother Teresa.' 'It is Vladimir Putin who started the war.' Kennedy said. 'I also believe through bitter experience that Vladimir Putin is a gangster…. He has Stalin's taste for blood.' Senator Roger Wicker (Republican-Mississippi) echoed Kennedy's concerns, saying that talks to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine must be held with Ukrainians being involved while also taking account of European interests. 'Putin is a war criminal and should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed,' he said. At least seven people were killed and 30 injured over the past 24 hours due to Russian attacks, regional military officials said on February 20. Targets included residential areas, social infrastructure, and essential services. Children were among the injured. After Trump called Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' the head of the Ukrainian Central Election Commission, Oleh Didenko, said in an interview with RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, that talk of elections in Ukraine only benefits Russia. 'This issue is being raised in order to undermine the legitimacy of the government in Ukraine, to weaken confidence in the government, to weaken support for Ukraine from international partners,' he said. Trump also wrote that 'we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia.' He added that Zelenskyy 'better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.' Trump’s remarks came after Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian 'disinformation bubble' and said he would like Trump’s team to be 'more truthful.' Senator Thom Tillis (Republican-North Carolina) disagreed with Trump's characterization of Zelenskyy as a 'dictator,' although he avoided directly criticizing Trump. 'It's not a word I would use,' he said, adding that there is 'no moral equivalency between Vladimir Putin and President Zelenskyy.' 'Clearly, Vladimir Putin is responsible for this war,' Tillis told reporters in Washington on February 19. 'His decision has resulted in the murder, rape, torture and kidnapping of untold numbers of Ukrainians. He owns responsibility for this war.' Senate Majority Leader John Thune (Republican-North Dakota) also declined to criticize Trump for his remarks. 'The president speaks for himself,' he told reporters. 'I think what I'm in support of is a peaceful outcome and result in Ukraine… And I think right now, the administration, the president and his team are working to achieve that.' Although Zelenskyy's presidential mandate was due to expire in May 2024, the constitution bars elections under martial law, which was imposed when Russia launched its full-scale invasion and has repeatedly extended.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj4TrlJ8myQaM	2025-02-20T16:34:24-08:00	
Afripol Announces 37 Arrests In East African Terrorism Sweep	In a sweeping operation that covered multiple East African countries, Afripol recently announced the arrest of 37 terrorism suspects and the destruction of weapons, including a missile and antitank armaments. The operation in November and December 2024 netted members of the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Shabaab, along with other foreign fighters. Working with Interpol, Afripol authorities made arrests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania. In the DRC, police arrested four alleged members of the Allied Democratic Forces and two associates. They also captured and destroyed a missile and antitank device abandoned by terrorists. In Kenya, authorities arrested 17 people, including two suspected IS members, several foreign fighters, and more people involved in terrorism financing, radicalization and propaganda. In Somalia, authorities arrested three people, including a suspected bombmaker for an intelligence unit of al-Shabaab, who had been planting improvised explosive devices to target law enforcement officers and Soldiers. Another suspect was an al-Shabaab operative believed to have attacked several police checkpoints with hand grenades. In Tanzania, police arrested an alleged member of IS-Mozambique and a Ugandan national who tried to join a terrorist group in Mozambique. In addition to the countries where arrests were made, Afripol worked with law enforcement authorities in Djibouti, Mozambique, South Africa and Uganda to capture the terrorism suspects. The arrests were part of a five-day border security operation that used Interpol databases to search for people suspected of major crimes, including fraud, money laundering and robbery. Jalel Chelba, acting executive director of Afripol, praised the international cooperation that enabled African law enforcement to take terrorists and organized crime operators off the streets. 'Tackling terrorism and organized crime demands a unified and forward-thinking strategy that addresses both immediate risks and the deeper vulnerabilities that enable them,' Chelba said in a statement. 'This operation highlights the critical role of international cooperation and the exchange of intelligence in disrupting criminal networks and curbing their reach.' Authorities said East Africa’s porous borders, political instability and economic challenges create a favorable environment for terrorism. 'These positive results demonstrate the power of international collaboration in the fight against terrorism,' Cyril Gout, Interpol’s acting executive director of police services, said in a statement. The East African counterterrorism operation came after a separate joint Afripol-Interpol investigation in September and October 2024 that resulted in the arrests of more than 1,000 people suspected of cybercrimes across 19 Sub-Saharan countries. Operation Serengeti broke up more than 134,000 scam operations that had stolen more than $193 million from victims worldwide. About the same time as Operation Serengeti, Afripol and Interpol worked with 12 Nigerian law enforcement agencies in Operation Eagles’ Nest to arrest 36 people involved in cybercrime and seized $3 million in illegal drugs, ammunition and vehicles. The Nigerian operation focused on several types of online scams, including: 'Romance baiting,' in which scammers cultivate online relationships to manipulate victims into investing or giving them money. Investment and cryptocurrency scams, in which scammers lure victims through fictitious financial schemes. Celebrity scams, in which scammers impersonate famous figures to steal money from fans. 'This landmark initiative in Nigeria not only strengthens national capacities but also exemplifies the collective resolve of African member states to combat evolving criminal threats,' Chelba said in a statement about the arrests.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj1Hj-pCc6okS	2025-02-20T16:30:20-08:00	
After Assad: A New Dynamic – Iran, The Gulf Monarchies And Erdoğa...	The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria and the resurgence of Turkey as a regional 'player' offers a new dynamic in the Middle East — and not just for raw power but for political leadership of the Sunni Muslim umma. New alliances and a rapidly changing dynamic are remaking decades old geopolitics, which up to today had seemed intractable to Middle East observers. The resulting instability, grounded in religious strife and political division, has (since Sykes-Picot first drew the 'lines in the sand' and oil was first discovered at the turn of the 20th century) fostered conflicts throughout the region. Today, that seemingly endless struggle for power is being supplanted by a new and different type of strife. The multi-party tug of war illustrates the distorted reasoning behind Middle East power politics, as regional players adapt to altered perceptions of strength and weakness, friend and foe. Persia's ancient land of Parthia (today's Iran) is reassessing the region’s politics and its position in it. The mullahs understand that the escalating influence driven by Ankara’s ambitions is towards its creation of a caliphate – a new Ottoman Empire. As a foil against Turkey’s designs for greater influence, Tehran is making overtures towards better relations with the Arab League in general and the Gulf monarchies in particular. The status quo in the Middle East was disrupted with the fall of the Assad regime. Syria’s geographic location under the latter functioned as the means through which Tehran’s influence – especially the flow of weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza was accomplished. With the collapse of Assad, Syria was left destabilized, leaving a void which Ankara seeks to fill. From incursions into northern Syria and encroachment in Libya and Somalia, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has sought to position Turkey as a strategic force in the region with which to reckon. Ankara has begun to initiate a more assertive foreign policy in the region – military, economic and sectarian initiatives are now employed to increase and even solidify its political footprint. Erdoğan’s rhetoric about Turkey as a 21st century Sunni (Ottoman) caliphate harkens back to Ankara's past of imperial designs. While it is disconcerting to his neighbors in the region, it strikes a chord of empathy within various corridors of domestic politics. Ankara’s ascendency, however, is not just about political influence; rather, it has revamped the struggle for leadership within the Sunni Muslim umma. Riyadh and its regional Gulf allies have historically exerted this authority – they view themselves as the caretakers of Islam’s most sacred sites and formidable economics. Turkey now imperils that leadership; it supports political Islam and regional actors such as the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Gulf states view as a threat to their regimes. This sectarian competition within Sunni Islam has furthered the geopolitical divide, as Gulf states now consider Ankara more than a rival; it has become a destabilizing force within the region. The competition between the 7 Gulf states and Ankara can be felt throughout various sectors in Africa. Libya is a perfect example of this rivalry in North Africa. Turkey provides military assistance and political cover to the Government of National Accord (Tripoli), while the UAE and Egypt support the forces of Khalifa Haftar (Benghazi). In Somalia (the easternmost country in continental Africa) which Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi consider critical to their own security interests, Ankara’s presence and influence continues to evolve concern from them. The cautious relationship between Ankara and the Gulf monarchs is evident through Turkey's previous (2017) rapid intervention in support of Qatar during the Gulf states sanctions on the latter. Over the last decade, Tehran’s attempts to have its political power respected in the region has put it at cross purposes (politically and militarily) with the Gulf states. Today, Iran is reassessing how it will pursue regional power to check Ankara's moves while mollifying the monarchs. It is cautiously reevaluating its way forward. It seems that Iran realizes the value of 'Realpolitik' (pragmatism) as it works its way through the political and sectarian minefields ever present when navigating between the Gulf states and Ankara. Pivotal to these efforts is the recent detente between Iran and Riyadh, revealing Tehran’s desire to mitigate tensions with its Gulf neighbors. Such actions between the two adversaries demonstrate their mutual concern with Ankara’s regional ambitions. Turkey’s more aggressive behavior in Syria and Libya could even precipitate the Gulf monarchies to seek 'arrangements' with Israel (like the Abraham Accords) or the US – especially now that a cease-fire with Gaza has occurred and Trump is in the White House. Relationships with Europe have proven, historically, to be of little value to regional stability. The Gulf states will attempt to balance the increasing concerns posed by Turkey while being vigilant against the problems of their historical nemesis, Iran. In particular they must strengthen political and military alliances if they are to maintain their relative positions within the region vis-a-vis Erdoğan’s ambitions. The U.S., for its part, appears to be pivoting towards Southeast Asia – the Pacific Rim. This creates an opportunity in the Middle East for regional powers like Turkey to magnify its role. At the same time, China and Russia are carefully insinuating themselves into this new regional hierarchy. Russia’s relationship with Iran and Turkey, while pragmatic, could encounter headwinds if their interests clash in the yet to be determined politics of Syria. China is strengthening relationships with both Iran and the Gulf states; it hopes to obtain much needed energy flows and expand its relatively 'no-strings-attached' infrastructure-development approach to its politics. As the dynamics between Iran, Turkey and the Gulf develop, one question presents itself: Will 'Realpolitik' prevail through innovative diplomatic discourse or will history (again) repeat itself – promises broken, alliances breached with renewed mistrust leading, inevitably, to further military interventions – and another status quo of instability?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj1nDZfY58bKN	2025-02-20T16:21:45-08:00	
Foreign Direct Investment Increased To A Record $41 Trillion – Op...	Global foreign direct investment grew again in 2023 after declining the previous year. Inward direct investment climbed $1.75 trillion, or 4.4 percent, reaching a record $41 trillion, according to the IMF’s latest Coordinated Direct Investment Survey, which provides detailed information on direct investment positions between countries. FDI rose in most regions, with Central and South Asia, Europe, and North and Central America contributing most. Direct investment between advanced economies grew by $880 billion, or 3.6 percent, while those from advanced economies to emerging market and developing economies rose by $538 billion, or 7.6 percent. As our Chart of the Week shows, the United States extended its lead as the top destination for direct investment. Singapore recorded the largest gain in 2023, with its position rising $307 billion, followed by $227 billion for the United States and $164 billion for Germany. Meanwhile, the Netherlands and Luxembourg posted the steepest declines but remained in the top five, alongside the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Strong growth was also seen in many emerging economies. Most notably, India, Mexico, and Brazil each saw their inward direct investment positions rise by around $130 billion or about 20 percent, marking the largest increase for these three economies in total since the survey began in 2009.

Russia-US Meeting In Riyadh More Than An Icebreaker – OpEd	By Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg The meeting held in Riyadh on Tuesday has turned out to be more than an icebreaker. It was already significant as the first high-level meeting between Russia and the US since January 2022, when former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Geneva, a few weeks before the war broke out, but they failed to avert it. By contrast the outcomes of the Riyadh meeting went beyond expectations. It took place in the offices of Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry and lasted more than four hours. The fact that it was held in the Kingdom showcases the country’s diplomatic credentials and its efforts to achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine. In a statement issued earlier this month, Saudi Arabia recalled that those efforts began at the start of the Ukraine crisis. This was when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called both President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 3, 2022, to offer the Kingdom’s good offices to reach a political solution. After the Riyadh meeting, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Kingdom was playing an 'indispensable role' by bringing the parties together, expressing hope that it would continue this effort. At the Tuesday meeting, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan facilitated the talks together with National Security Advisor Dr. Musaad Al-Aiban, the seasoned minister who is described as the man for difficult missions. On the US side there was also a high-powered team led by Rubio, a former senator, on his first trip to Saudi Arabia. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who is also a former lawmaker from Florida, was on the team. Probably the closest to President Donald Trump was his Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, a real estate magnate known for successful dealmaking. Outside of family, there is no one more trusted by Trump as Witkoff, CNN has reported. He was instrumental in getting the Israel-Hamas deal done even before Trump took office and his remit has now expanded to the Russia-Ukraine war. Lavrov, the veteran diplomat since the days of the USSR, led the Russian side, together with Kirill Dmitriev, who was born in Kyiv, Ukraine, studied at Harvard Business School, and began his career with stints at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Company. He has managed large private equity funds and completed a series of landmark transactions for Russia. He now heads the Russian Direct Investment Fund and is a confidante of Putin. Following the meeting, Rubio said they agreed on four points. Firstly, to re-establish the 'functionality of our respective missions in Washington and in Moscow,' to facilitate progress. Secondly, the appointment of a high-level team to help negotiate an end to the conflict in Ukraine 'in a way that’s enduring and acceptable to all the parties engaged.' Thirdly, to begin to discuss both the geopolitical and economic cooperation that could result from an end to the conflict in Ukraine. Fourthly, they agreed to remain engaged at the same high level to 'make sure that it’s moving along in a productive way,' Rubio said. Waltz stressed the need for a permanent and quick end to the war, which has 'turned into a meat grinder of people on both sides,' revealing that as a 'practical reality,' there was going to be some discussion of territory, not ruling out possible concessions. Rubio indicated there would be sanctions relief. Witkoff described the talks as 'positive, upbeat, constructive … solution-based.' He added: 'We couldn’t have imagined a better result after this session. It was very, very solid.' The Riyadh meeting came just a week after Trump spoke to Putin telephonically. And Lavrov said after the talks the sides agreed to fast-track the appointment of new ambassadors and 'lifting artificial barriers to the work of the US and Russian embassies and other missions.' The two sides agreed to set up high-level working groups to begin exploring a negotiated end to the conflict. It was not immediately clear when these teams would first meet, but both said it would be soon. For the main objective of this effort — ending the war — a high-level team from the two countries will begin to engage with the Russian side on 'parameters of what an end to this conflict would look like.' On the idea of a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, Lavrov said Moscow would not accept any troops from NATO members, stressing that Ukraine’s bid to join the alliance was a major security issue. Lavrov said: 'We explained that the deployment of troops from the countries that are NATO members, even if they are deployed under the EU or national flags, will not change anything and will certainly be unacceptable for us.' But he seemed to imply the possibility of a UN force. The presence of Witkoff and Dmitriev at the Riyadh talks is indicative of the two sides’ ambition to move from the current crisis to a close economic relationship. Dmitriev told reporters that Russia and the US should develop joint energy and other ventures, including in the Arctic and other regions. And Rubio said that once the Ukraine conflict was brought to an end, it could open 'incredible opportunities' to partner with Russia 'on issues that hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term.' Realistically, there could be difficult hurdles before these ambitious ideas materialize. First, the US needs to persuade Zelensky and its NATO and EU allies of the value of its diplomatic approach to the crisis. Aware of this need, Rubio said: 'There’s going to be engagement and consultation with Ukraine, with our partners in Europe, and others. He did not specify dates but remarked that Trump was 'not patient in terms of getting action. 'He drives. He drives hard. He wants to get things done. He’s been wanting to do this, and he’s moving very quickly.' - Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg is the GCC assistant secretary-general for political affairs and negotiation.

Eight Ways Trump Can Tank The Economy – OpEd	President Biden handed off the best economy to an incoming president since at least the 2001 handoff from Clinton to Bush II. In his last quarter in office, GDP grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate (final demand, which excludes inventory fluctuations, grew at a 3.2 percent rate). That brought the average growth rate for Biden’s presidency to 3.2 percent, the highest since Clinton’s second term. The unemployment rate fell to 4.0 percent in January, keeping it in the narrow band between 4.0 percent and 4.3 percent it has been in since last May. For Biden’s whole term the unemployment rate averaged 4.1 percent, the lowest since Johnson’s last term, more than half a century ago. Inflation is still slightly above the Fed’s 2.0 percent target, but it shows no clear trend. It’s worth noting in this respect that below 2.0 percent inflation rates were largely a post-Great Recession story. Prior to the Great Recession, inflation generally ran somewhat about 2.0 percent. Inflation, as measured by the CPI, was 3.4 percent in 2000, the last year of the Clinton administration. In addition, productivity growth has been unexpectedly fast, running at close to a 2.0 percent rate in the last year. And these productivity gains are being passed on in rising real wages, with workers across the wage ladder getting their share of productivity growth. This translates into an extraordinarily good economic picture, but we know that Donald Trump has big plans for the economy. Given his bold pronouncements coming daily, or even hourly, he has many possible routes for ending the boom we have been seeing. Here are my eight favorite economy wreckers, in no particular order: 1.) Stock market crash, 2.) Mass deportation, 3.) Tariffs run wild, 4.) Pandemic wipe out, 5.) Global warming disasters, 6.) Splurge of spending cuts, 7.) Debt limit crisis, 8.) Messing with economic data. It is not entirely accurate for me to say there is no order. I do think a stock market crash is by far the likeliest way that the economy gets derailed. I should also say that a crash would not necessarily be Trump’s fault. If we have a bubble, as I strongly suspect, then it is likely something will burst it, even if we had competent people setting economic policy. However, after the prospect of a stock crash, my views on the likelihood of the other dangers changes by the hour, or even the minute, as some new craziness spews out of Donald Trump or Elon Musk’s mouth or social media feed. Rather than making an arbitrary, as of this minute, ordering, I’m just going to say that the other seven are equally likely. I’ll quickly go through each in turn. Stock Market Crash The story here is straightforward. The price-to-earnings ratios in the stock market are near their 1990s bubble peak, even as most projections are that real profits will grow slowly over the next decade. This implies that either the profit projections are grossly understated, that price-to-earnings ratio will go even higher, people are willing to invest in stocks for returns only slightly higher than what they can get from bonds, or the market is likely to crash. I’m inclined to think that the crash is the most plausible scenario, but I could be wrong. It is worth correcting an important error on this one. Clearly the highest PEs can be found on AI-related tech states, but the market as a whole is likely over-valued, even if it might be by a smaller amount. If we go back to the 1990s, people often referred to the soaring stock market as a tech bubble. The tech stocks were the ones that took the largest hits when the market did crash, but even the stock of companies like GM and McDonalds lost close to half its value. So, the bubble was much more broadly based than just the tech companies. I would speculate that there is a similar story today. The AI companies might well take the biggest hit in a stock market crash, but a much wider set of companies is likely to be affected. (For an especially pessimistic assessment of the prospects for AI and the tech companies listen to this On the Media segment.) A plunge in the stock market will have two effects. First, it can destroy tens of trillions of dollars of wealth. People who thought they had plenty of money in their 401(k)s for retirement suddenly find out otherwise. This is likely to lead to major cutbacks in spending, especially for those who are near retirement or have recently retired. The other effect is likely to be a hit to investment. The companies that are now throwing money indiscriminately at everything related to AI will suddenly be more careful to only spend in areas where they can reasonably expect to see a payback in the not-too-distant future. It is also worth correcting a common misunderstanding about the stock crash recession in 2001. From a GDP standpoint this looks like a very short and mild recession. We did not even see the traditional two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. However, we get an opposite picture from a labor market perspective. Employment peaked before the recession in February of 2021. We didn’t get back to this same level of employment for four full years. At the time, this was the longest period without job growth since the Great Depression. It is wrong to think of this as a short and mild recession. Mass Deportation Sends Prices Soaring The biggest uncertainty with mass deportation is whether we will actually see it. While the call for mass deportation was central to Trump’s campaign, the reality of recent immigration bears almost no resemblance to the tales of drug dealers, rapists, and murderers overrunning our borders, and many people around Trump know this. The simple fact is that the overwhelming majority of recent immigrants came here to work. They take physically demanding low-paying jobs that few native-born workers would want. If a large share of them were rounded up and thrown out of the country, we would see massive labor shortages in large sectors of the economy. This would be most apparent in agriculture, where estimates put the share of undocumented workers as high as 45 percent. However, a large share of workers in food processing, construction, and a number of other industries are undocumented. If we see mass deportations, it is a safe bet food prices will rise considerably, and construction will slow. This will mean a boost to inflation and a reduction in people’s purchasing power. If the Fed responds to higher inflation by raising rates, this will further weaken the housing sector and slow demand through other channels. It’s worth noting that even a Trump controlled Fed may not be able to keep long-term rates from rising, unless it is prepared to engage in highly unorthodox monetary policy. The end story here is that we get a recession. This again could be a long one, depending on how many people get deported, as the economy eventually adjusts to having a considerably smaller workforce. Tariffs Flow Like Water Donald Trump seems to really like tariffs and also have no idea what they are. As much as Trump likes to talk about imposing tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico or whatever other villain of the moment appears in his sights, he actually is imposing a tax on us, on the goods we import from these countries. We pay the tariff, not the bad actor in Trump’s tough guy warnings. Higher import taxes raise the price of imports in the same way that a tax on barrels of oil leads to higher gas prices at the pump. Depending on how many goods get subject to the tax, and the actual tax rate, we could end up paying out a lot of money to cover the cost of Trump’s tariffs. As a simple approximation, our goods imports come to roughly $4 trillion a year or 13 percent of GDP. If we imposed an import tax of 20 percent, we would be paying $800 billion a year ($6,000 a family) as a result of the tariffs. (This assumes no reduction in imports, which clearly would not be the case.) As with mass deportations, this would directly push inflation higher, in addition to pulling money out of our pockets. If the Fed raised rates in response, we again would face a serious risk of recession. Here also we get very mixed signals from the administration. He threatened 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but then walked the threat back before the tariffs actually took effect. However, he did go through with 20 percent tariffs on aluminum and steel. There are clearly people in the administration who know that major tariff hikes will be bad news for the economy, and even more immediately the stock market. It would take someone with more inside knowledge than me to know whether a tariff hungry Trump or a more reasonable advisor is likely to determine policy. It is also worth noting that running economic policy like a TV game show does have a cost. Businesses like predictability when they look to make investment decisions. If they are trying to decide on expanding their capacity, it matters hugely whether items coming in from Canada and Mexico are mostly tariff free, or whether the U.S. is imposing large taxes. At the very least, the TV game show approach to economic policy is likely to delay some investments as businesses try to determine the ultimate course Trump will take. Pandemic II This one is totally speculative both since I have very little knowledge of epidemiology and also because the future course of prospective pandemics would be guesswork by anyone. There are a couple of things we can say. First, there are always various diseases being spread among domesticated animals as well as wildlife. For the most part, these diseases pose little risk to humans, but that can always change as a result of new mutations. This raises the second point, the Trump-Musk team have eviscerated our public health agencies so that they will be far less prepared to deal with any major threats to humans that might arise. (They have already delayed the circulation of a report on the spread of bird flu for no obvious reason.) The economic consequences of this tampering with the public health agencies is most likely to take the form of higher prices for eggs, meat, and chicken. This would also mean somewhat higher inflation, but probably not the sort of stuff that leads to big interest rate hikes and a recession. There is the risk that these viruses will spread to people, as has already been the case to a limited extent. This is bad news from a public health perspective, but not likely a major economic calamity unless a strain proves to be both highly contagious and also to pose a severe health risk. Based on my very limited knowledge, that seems unlikely, but the risk is surely higher with Elon Musk’s 'super-high IQ' DOGE boys calling the shots instead of people who actually understand the issues involved. Global Warming Disaster or LA Fire Sequel We have been seeing many more extreme climate events in recent years as a result of global warming. Trump has doubled down on a commitment to do everything he can to advance global warming as much as possible. He wants to eliminate all the Biden and Obama programs to promote EVs and clean energy, and to subsidize the use of fossil fuels. This is horrible from the standpoint of saving the planet, but fortunately Chinaand much of the rest of the world are moving aggressively to restrain greenhouse gas emissions. Still, the immediate issue from the standpoint of the economy is the damage to the environment that is already baked into the cards from past emissions. This should require us to take steps towards both mitigating potential damage and enhanced emergency preparation for the increasingly intense hurricanes, floods, and wildfires that we will see. This is not going to happen, both because of Trump’s determination to pretend global warming is not real, and also because he is firing most of the people competent to lead this effort. His efforts to punish people who didn’t vote for him are also likely to increase the economic damage from global warming. In terms of mitigation, we should be discouraging people from building in areas that are especially prone to damage from floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. There are some efforts at the state level to do this, but it’s a safe bet the Trump administration will not be encouraging it. Also, it is actively trying to destroy the agencies that gather the information that would facilitate this process. Private insurers actually would assist in this process, if regulators allow them. This is not out of benevolence, it’s simply due to the fact that they don’t want to insure a home that is likely to be destroyed in a wildfire or hurricane. However, state regulators often impose rules that block insurers from charging premiums that reflect true risk. Anyhow, Trump’s efforts are likely to make the human toll and property damage from future disasters considerable worse. This is especially likely to be the case when he decides that he knows best what to do and prevents competent people from conducting sound disaster management and relief efforts. The disasters themselves will be a hit to the economy but are unlikely to be recession-causing stuff. We could see tens or even hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed, businesses put out of operation for weeks, or even months, and hundreds of thousands of workers possibly without jobs. However, relief efforts actually provide a short-term boost to the economy, unless Trump refuses to do them to punish blue areas. The bigger hit is likely to be the longer-term response to disasters. Insurers are not in business to lose money. When they see enough disasters in an area, they will simply pull out of selling policies as many have done in Florida and California. If they see the risk as growing and/or decide they can’t gage the risk adequately because Trump has shut down good data sources, they are likely to pull out of more areas. If people can’t get insurance on a home, they won’t be able to sell it, since banks all require insurance to issue a mortgage. We could see the housing market shut down in large parts of the country. This can be a very serious blow to the economy and financial markets. I won’t try to etch out details here, but let’s just say it is serious bad news. Splurge of Spending Cuts I won’t spend much time on this one, just because I consider it highly unlikely. The point here is simply that Elon Musk and his team seem to have no idea of how the economy works. When he initially set off with his DOGE team he was boasting about finding $2 trillion to cut from the annual budget, as in not over ten years. This would be a bit less than one-third of the budget and close to 7.0 percent of GDP. If Musk actually did cut spending by 7.0 percent of GDP it would lead to a Great Recession type recession. Fortunately, this seems off the table for now, as Musk has learned a little bit about where government money actually goes. The Trump-Republican team still seem intent on big cuts, but these look to be roughly an order of magnitude smaller. And they are likely to come with tax cuts to rich people, whose spending will largely offset the economic (not the human) impact of cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Debt Limit Crisis This is one that would appear on almost everyone’s list. The story is that Democrats refuse to provide any votes to raise the debt ceiling, and the small number of Republicans who actually care about the debt block passage of the necessary legislation. This would mean that the government would be unable to borrow, and at least for a period of time unable to pay all its bills. This would clearly shake financial markets. Whether it leads to a full-fledged economic meltdown is more questionable and likely depends on how long the standoff lasts. This issue also involves even more speculation than usual since its not clear Trump feels bound by the rule of law, so his actions, even if not legal, could mitigate the impact. In any case, this is likely to lead to higher interest rates, as investors attach greater risk to holding U.S. debt. That is a needless cost to the economy, but we are most likely talking about tenths of a percentage point, not whole percentage points. Messing with Economic Data This is probably not on most people’s Trump crises lists but should be. The story here is that we have top quality statistical agencies, most notably the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), that provide us accurate data on a regular basis untainted by political interference. Both parts of this are hugely underappreciated. We often hear complaints about large revisions to the data (I’ve made them myself), but this is due to the complexity of trying to measure a $30 trillion economy with 340 million people. The data are never perfect, but these agencies do the best they can, based on their own research, and work done by academic economists and statisticians around the country and the world. This brings up the second and more important part, the people putting together the unemployment statistics, the Consumer Price Index, and other data that we depend on to know the state of the economy, are professionals who are committed to the integrity of the data. They do not lower the unemployment rate to make the president look better or make inflation go away by cooking the numbers. The MAGA crew, starting with Trump, often complained about the numbers being manipulated under Biden and Obama. This was utter nonsense. Unfortunately, it never got the push back from the media, or even the Democrats, that it should have. Comments from Trump or other prominent Republicans saying the data was manipulated should have been treated as being equivalent to declaring the Earth is flat, they are that crazy. Anyhow, as the MAGA crew will tell us, the President has the unquestioned authority to make the unemployment rate or inflation rate whatever he wants it to be. If Trump’s tariffs or his inept handling of the bird flu pandemic push the year- over-year inflation in March to 4.0 percent, he can just order BLS to report the inflation rate as 2.0 percent. The top people there will quit, or be fired, but Trump can force them to publish whatever inflation rate he wants. The same applies to our GDP numbers. If Trump’s policies of not paying out money owed and laying off tens of thousands of government workers and contractors, cause GDP to slump in the first quarter, he can just instruct BEA to report strong 3.5 percent growth. This may sell on Fox News and other right-wing media outfits, but it will be a disaster on financial markets and for the longer-term health of the economy. We should expect interest rates to soar and the stock market to plummet, since investors will decide that they no longer have any idea of the true state of the U.S. economy. Over the longer term, we will see both domestic companies scaling back investment plans and foreign companies looking elsewhere. The United States will have declared itself an untrustworthy nation, where rules mean nothing and can be changed for convenience. Hopefully, Trump, or the people around him, will have enough sense to keep him from undermining the statistical agencies, but at this point, we can not take that for granted. Recipes for Disaster Okay folks, those are my MAGA eight, come up with your own stories for how Trump can crash the economy. Also, I welcome people who know these issues better than I do expanding on or correcting what I wrote. Anyhow, looks like we might have some exciting times ahead of us.

Milestone For Wyoming Uranium Operation	Uranium Energy Corp's Irigaray Central Processing Plant has produced its first dried and drummed uranium concentrates since the resumption of in-situ recovery operations at the company's Christensen Ranch project. The Irigaray plant, in Wyoming, is the central hub to 11 satellite in-situ recovery (ISR) projects across the Powder River Basin. Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) took ownership of the plant and the orebodies through its 2021 acquisition of Uranium One Americas Inc from Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom. In January 2024 the company's board of directors approved the restart of the Christensen Ranch ISR operation, with recovered uranium to be processed at Irigaray, and in September the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality gave UEC the go-ahead to increase the plant's licensed production capacity from its current 2.5 million pounds U3O8 (96.2 tU) to 4.0 million pounds U3O8 per year. According to information from the US Energy Information Administration, Irigaray had last produced uranium in 2018. UEC President and CEO Amir Adnani said the milestone had been reached on schedule, six months into the phased ramp-up of its operations in Wyoming (operations at Christensen Ranch started in August last year). 'This marks the culmination of many years of planning and hard work from our entire team and is a testament to their expertise and dedication. UEC’s fully permitted ISR assets provide a cost-efficient foundation for sustainable growth, positioning UEC as a key player in the expanding nuclear energy sector,' he said. ISR - also known as in-situ leach, or ISL - recovers minerals by dissolving them from the orebody in the ground and pumping the resulting solution to the surface where the minerals can be recovered at a processing plant. UEC has two ISR hub and spoke platforms in South Texas and Wyoming, where a central processing plant forms the 'hub' with several ISR uranium projects providing 'spokes'. The uranium concentrates produced at Irigaray will be transported to the ConverDyn Conversion Facility in Metropolis, Illinois, UEC said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wjybF3yDhowdq	2025-02-20T16:04:29-08:00	
Burning Questions Over Indonesia’s Cooking Transition – Analysis	By Data Avicenna and Intan Permata Sari Indonesia’s shift to cleaner cooking fuels has seen notable success, particularly through the 2007 ‘Zero Kero Program’ which reduced domestic kerosene use by 92 per cent in less than ten years by transitioning households’ cooking fuel to Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG). While the program’s primary goal was reducing kerosene subsidy costs, it also resulted in positive health impactsthrough reduced indoor air pollution. But today, Indonesia faces a new set of challenges. With an annual LPG consumption of approximately eight million tons and a domestic production capacity of only 1.7 million tons, Indonesia’s reliance on LPG imports has driven the government’s LPG subsidy spending to as high as Rp 80 trillion (US$4.9 billion) per year. As President Prabowo Subianto’s administration looks toward achieving energy self-sufficiency, the current dependence on imported LPG and subsidies’ strain on government finances raise pressing questions about Indonesia’s path forward. Indonesia has taken some steps to address the financial burden of LPG subsidies. The Indonesian government aims to reduce imports of LPG to zero by 2030, partly by promoting electric cooking appliances, including induction stoves, in 700,000 households. Yet the adoption rate is currently low — only 0.76 per cent of Indonesian households in 2021 used induction stoves. The challenges of electric stove pilot projects in Denpasar and Semarang in 2022 came from low household electrical capacities which were unsuitable for high-wattage stoves. The push for induction stoves poses a trade-off — though it may reduce the financial burden of imported LPG, the country still depends heavily on fossil fuels for electricity. Unless there is a massive deployment of renewable energy, this shift could increase greenhouse gas emissions. For induction stoves to be an environmentally sustainable option, acceleration in the renewable energy transition is the first step. About 14 per cent of the country’s energy mix comes from renewable sources, much less than the 23 per cent target set for 2025. Expanding the renewable energy grid would also align with Prabowo’s broader goal of achieving energy independence. With an expanded renewable energy grid, the government could reallocate the LPG subsidies towards incentivising households that are ready to transition to induction stoves, addressing the financial burden of LPG subsidies while simultaneously promoting sustainable energy practices. Induction stoves can also be incentivised by implementing purchasing restrictions on subsidised LPG to ensure that it only reaches its intended beneficiaries — low-income households. These restrictions, combined with targeted incentives, could accelerate the adoption of induction stoves. In 2024, the government imposed limitations so that only registered, eligible people could purchase the subsidised 3-kilogram LPG tanks. While the implementation initially appeared inadequate due to subsidised LPG still being accessible to all consumers, the subsidy is largely reaching its intended beneficiaries — most subsidised LPG consumers come from the poorest 70 per cent of households. Higher demand for induction stoves could also promote domestic production by encouraging new manufacturers to enter the market and enabling existing producers to reduce per unit production costs through larger-scale production. Indonesia’s domestic production of induction stoves remains limited with only two manufacturers available and an annual production capacity of 317,000 units in 2022. To address the low electrical capacities of many Indonesian households, a possible initiative is to promote domestic production of lower-wattage models of induction stoves that are less costly and more compatible with household capacities. But there are costs and barriers associated with low-wattage stoves, including research and development costs and cultural barriers. Since low-wattage could mean slower cooking, Chinese-Indonesian dishes that rely on high-heat wok cooking might not be suitable, while the opposite applies for slow-cooking dishes like the West Sumatran ‘rendang’. Providing incentives in the form of lower costs to upgrade households’ electrical capacities can also be implemented. But some lower- to middle-income households might be more reluctant to adopt induction stoves due to higher electricity costs unless they receive continuous incentives such as electricity discounts. Ensuring that households upgrading their electrical capacities also adopt induction stoves — possibly through enforcement mechanisms — should also be factored into policy decisions to maximise the effectiveness of such incentives. The economic feasibility of switching to induction stoves also depends largely on the payback period — how long it takes households to recover their initial investment through energy cost savings. This investment includes not just the stove itself, but also new cookware compatible with electric cooking. Understanding these costs is crucial for policy design. Indonesia’s transition to induction stoves requires more than policy reforms and infrastructure improvements. It demands a fundamental transformation of the country’s energy mix. With renewable energy making up only 14 per cent of the current mix, sustainable adoption appears unlikely in the near future. Success hinges on a coordinated approach — expanding the renewable energy grid first, then gradually implementing household transitions and addressing infrastructure gaps while protecting vulnerable households. Only then can Indonesia achieve energy independence without compromising environmental objectives or household welfare.

South Korea And US Hold First Joint Aerial Exercise Of 2nd Trump ...	By Mok Yong Jae South Korea and the United States on Thursday conducted the first joint aerial drills of the current Trump administration, completing a 'simulated precision strike,' according the U.S. Air Force. The South Korean Ministry of Defense said that South Korean F-35 and F-15 fighter jets joined U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers and F-16 fighters, all of which took off from locations within South Korea. Four U.S. Marine F-35s launched from Japan also joined the exercise, the Air Force said in a report published on its website. 'This training was conducted to demonstrate the extended deterrence capabilities of the United States against North Korea’s evolving nuclear and missile threats and to strengthen the interoperability of the South Korea-U.S. combined forces,' a South Korean Defense Ministry official told Radio Free Asia. He said that together the two countries would cooperate to deter and respond to North Korean threats. The B-1B was also part of trilateral joint exercises with the U.S.-South Korea and Japan in December. 'Advanced training like today’s event ensures we’re able to maintain the high levels of readiness necessary for our combined defense posture,' Lt. Gen. David Iverson, the U.S. Seventh Air Force commander said in the Air Force report. 'Each time our aircrew plan, execute and debrief together, we build proficiency in our tactics, techniques and procedures to defend the Alliance, if required,' he said. South Korea and the United States have expanded military cooperation over the past few years in response to North Korean threats. Joint drills with South Korea and three way drills with Japan have recently included more advanced technology including submarines, long-range bombers, and aircraft carriers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj9HLR7dNQCii	2025-02-20T16:00:33-08:00	
Russia: St. Petersburg To Use CCTV Cameras On Streets To Identify...	In order to fight crime and prevent the emergence of ethnic enclaves, St. Peterburg plans to upgrade its CCTV cameras on its streets so that the authorities can identify passersby by ethnicity, Oleg Kapitanov, head of the nationalities committee in the city’s government, has announced. This kind of ethnic profiling is notoriously inaccurate, but other Russian cities are likely to follow St. Petersburg’s lead, yet another example of Russia’s moves toward totalitarian control of its people ( Moves toward such totalitarian methods of control are taking place at enormous speed in Putin’s Russia now. At the same time that the use of CCTV cameras to determine ethnicity was announced, the Russian government announced new requirements for doctors to share information about their patients. As of March 1, all Russian doctors will be required to share information with the police on patients with mental disorders who are deemed 'a threat to others' (publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202407220010?index=1). Activists say this order may soon be expanded to include data on other parts of patients’ lives (theins.ru/history/278606). In the last decades of Soviet power, for example, the state required doctors to share information about drug use, homosexuality, and other characteristics that the regime deemed improper. What Moscow is now demanding opens the door to the restoration of such requirements and a further restriction of doctor-patient confidentiality. That is likely to mean both that doctors will turn in the information the state wants and the state will take action against those so identified and that those in high risk groups will now avoid going to doctors and getting the treatment they need lest the doctors providing the treatment send information about them to state institutions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wjwg9aBW5zSbZ	2025-02-20T15:58:51-08:00	
Uzbekistan: Torturers’ Impunity ‘Is Mockery Not Justice’ – Analys...	By Mushfig Bayram Officials of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 repeatedly tortured Muslim prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov during 2023 and 2024, including threatening him with death. On one occasion, prison officer Davr Sottiyev severely beat Astanov and told him that before he leaves, 'he [Sottiyev] will give Astanov an injection which will soon kill him', a local Muslim who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. As a result of Sottiyev's severe physical torture, prisoner of conscience Astanov was placed in the prison medical unit. Prisoner of conscience Astanov, who is now 53, made multiple complaints about the torture he experienced to the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the Ombudsperson. Against the regime's legally-binding human rights obligations, officials have taken no action against prison officer Sottiyev or other suspect torturers. The regime's only response was to send an alleged forensic medical 'expert' to examine Astanov and then claimed there were 'no traces of wounds or bruises'. The Muslim commented: 'This is mockery not justice' (see below). In January 2025, Prison Governor Farrukh Ismatov, head of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1, called relatives of prisoner of conscience Astanov. He claimed to them that Astanov is fine and that they have no need to complain to the authorities about his situation. The relatives understood that they were being threatened with punishment if they lodge complaints (see below). Various officials of the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the regime-appointed Human Rights Commissioner or Ombudsperson's Office have refused to answer Forum 18's questions about the multiple cases of torture inflicted on prisoner of conscience Astanov (see below). The regime tries to stop its Muslim prisoners from praying the namaz, and frequently tortures those who do meet other Muslims for prayer. If prison authorities detect groups of Muslims praying together, they will put them in punishment cells for several days, Muslims who Forum 18 has talked to from October 2024 onwards have stated. Prison authorities may not detect or punish individual prisoners praying the namaz alone (see below). Officials are preparing to add a further prison term to that of 30-year-old prisoner of conscience Fariduddin Abduvokhidov. A Tashkent court jailed him in November 2020 along with six other prisoners of conscience for between 11 and four years. Their 'crime' was to meet in Tashkent to discuss Islam. On 5 December 2023, a court in Tashkent Region added 10 years to his existing 11 year prison term. His 'crime' was to be three minutes late for a prison roll call. In November 2024, Navoi Regional Police Criminal Investigation Department opened a new criminal case against him (see forthcoming F18News article). From summer 2024, the regime has apparently implemented a policy of putting Muslim prisoners of conscience in a punishment cell for several days each to prevent them being eligible for early conditional release, or to make it easier to transfer them to a harsher-regime prison. Prisoners of conscience Faryozbek Kobilov and Alimardon Sultonov are among those given such spells in a punishment cell. Officials then sent Sultonov to a harsher prison (see forthcoming F18News article). Repeated torture of prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov for praying In 2021, Tashkent City Criminal Court jailed prisoner of conscience Tulkun Tashmuradovich Astanov (born 25 April 1971) for five years for defending Muslims' freedom of religion and belief. In 2021, officials of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 repeatedly tortured him, in June for praying the namaz (Muslim daily prayer), and in October also. As a result his health seriously deteriorated. The regime tries to stop its Muslim prisoners from praying the namaz, and frequently tortures those who do meet other Muslims for prayer. If prison authorities detect groups of Muslims praying together, they will be put in punishment cells for several days, Muslims who Forum 18 has talked to from October 2024 onwards have stated. Prison authorities may not detect or punish individual prisoners praying the namaz alone. Against legally-binding international human rights obligations, no-one has ever been held to account for the torture of prisoners of conscience such as Astanov. In July 2021, Governor Farrukh Ismatov of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 refused to explain to Forum 18 why no-one has been arrested and put on criminal trial for torturing Astanov or other prisoners. As the United Nations Committee against Torture (CAT) noted in its Concluding Observations on Uzbekistan in January 2020 (CAT/C/UZB/CO/5): 'The Committee remains deeply concerned at reports that torture and ill-treatment continue to be routinely committed by, at the instigation of and with the consent of the State party's law enforcement, investigative and prison officials.' International human rights obligations Uzbekistan is a party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. This defines torture as 'any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.' Under the Convention, Uzbekistan is obliged both to arrest any person suspected on good grounds of having committed, instigated or acquiesced to torture 'or take other legal measures to ensure his [sic] presence', and also to try them under criminal law which makes 'these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature'. Impunity for Astanov's suspect torturers 'is mockery not justice' Again during 2023 and 2024, officials of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 tortured prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov on multiple occasions, including threatening him with death. During autumn 2023, prison officer Davr Sottiyev on multiple occasions severely beat, suffocated, and threatened Astanov with death. 'He told Astanov that he will not let him leave the prison alive. Before Astanov leaves, he [Sottiyev] will give Astanov an injection which will soon kill him,' a local Muslim who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18 in February 2025. As a result of Sottiyev's severe physical torture, prisoner of conscience Astanov was placed in the prison medical unit. The prison officer on duty (who refused to give his name) at Bukhara Region's General Regime Prison No. 1 refused to answer Forum 18's questions on 18 February about the torture of prisoner of conscience Astanov. He also refused to put Forum 18 through to Prison Governor Farrukh Ismatov. In 2024, prisoner of conscience Astanov made multiple complaints about the torture he suffered to the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the Ombudsperson. Officials have taken no action against prison officer Sottiyev or other suspect torturers. The regime's only response was to send an alleged forensic medical 'expert' to the prison in spring 2024. The 'expert' wrote a report claiming that prisoner of conscience Astanov had 'no traces of wounds or bruises on his body'. The Muslim commented: 'This is mockery not justice.' Prison governor threatens relatives if they complain In January 2025, Governor Farrukh Ismatov of Bukhara Region Prison No. 1 called various relatives of prisoner of conscience Tulkun Astanov. He claimed to them that Astanov is fine and that they have no need to complain to the authorities about his situation. The relatives understood that they were being threatened with punishment if they lodge complaints. Various officials of the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, who refused to give their full names, between 10 and 12 February refused to answer Forum 18's questions about the multiple cases of torture inflicted on prisoner of conscience Astanov. Damir (who refused to give his last name), who leads the international affairs section of the Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, refused on 12 February to answer Forum 18's questions. He asked to be called back in three hours when 'I will have time to answer you'. He did not answer his phone whenever Forum 18 called back. Various General Prosecutor's Office officials, who refused to give their names, also refused to answer Forum 18's questions. Press Service official Asadullo Fatkhullayev claimed he would answer Forum 18's questions in writing by the end of the working day on 12 February. Forum 18 had received no answer by the end of the working day of 19 February. Aziz Yuldashev in the regime-appointed Human Rights Commissioner or Ombudsperson's Office, who deals with complaints, claimed to Forum 18 on 12 February that he had not heard of prisoner of conscience Astanov. Yuldashev went on to claim that he would 'check in our system if indeed there were complaints' and by the end of the working day reply to Forum 18's questions. Yuldashev then contradicted himself by also claiming that he would provide the contact details of responsible officials in the Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments to which the Ombudsperson's Office had (allegedly) made enquiries about prisoner of conscience Astanov. Despite Yuldashev's promise to reply by the end of 12 February, Forum 18 had received no answer by the end of the working day of 19 February. Prisoner of conscience Astanov is being held in General Regime Prison No. 1 in Bukhara Region, over 440 kilometres (275 miles) from his home in Tashkent.

Trump Says He Has Not Seen Egyptian Counter To His Plan For Gaza	By Patsy Widakuswara U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday evening he has not seen the proposal being discussed by Arab leaders as an alternative to his plan to take over Gaza once the war between Hamas and Israel ends. 'I haven’t seen it,' Trump said in response to a reporter’s question on Air Force One. 'Once I see it, I’ll let you know,' he added. Trump said early this month he wants to forcibly relocate almost 2 million Palestinians from Gaza into neighboring Jordan and Egypt. He said the United States will 'own' the territory and turn it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East,' which prompted rejection by Arab countries. It’s unclear whether Trump is serious or merely threatening to extract concessions from Arab states. During a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that it could be the latter, urging regional leaders to make a counteroffer. The Saudi crown prince will host leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and other Gulf Cooperation Council states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates Friday in Riyadh to discuss options, including an Egyptian plan to raise up to $20 billion over three years from Arab and Gulf states for Gaza’s reconstruction. Under this plan, Gazans would not be forced out and the strip would be governed by Palestinians. Saudi connection Trump spoke en route to Washington after delivering remarks at a conference in Miami, hosted by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, the nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund – the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund led by the crown prince. His speech marked the first time a U.S. president addressed the annual gathering of global financiers and tech executives. It is a testament to how the Saudi crown prince, known by his initials MBS, has leveraged his connection to Trump, Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, said. The prince established close ties during Trump’s first term and continued business ties with the Trump organization while the president was out of office, including investing $2 billion to a firm belonging to Trump’s son-in-law and former aide, Jared Kushner. 'Trump believes in the Golden Rule, but not the Golden Rule from Sunday school,' Blumenfeld told VOA. 'It's if you're rich, you're right.' As Riyadh leads the charge to unify Arab nations to support postwar Gaza, there may be signs that Trump is softening his demand. In his wide-ranging remarks that lasted over an hour, Trump did not mention Gaza beyond repeating what he said was his role on the ceasefire signed January 19, during the last day then-President Joe Biden was in office. 'We've secured a ceasefire in Gaza, and we're bringing in the hostages, and we're bringing them home to their families,' Trump said, adding that some of the hostages 'are in pretty bad shape.' He lauded Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi wealth fund, and Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Jadaan. The White House did not immediately respond to VOA’s query on whether Trump met with any of the Saudi delegation during the event. During his Wednesday remarks Trump thanked the Saudi crown prince for hosting talks between U.S. and Russian officials Tuesday to find a way to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies have decried the meeting as an effort to sideline Kyiv. Egyptian proposal on Gaza Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said under the proposal, 'secure areas' equipped with mobile houses and shelters will be established as living areas in Gaza while Egyptian and international construction firms rebuild the devastated infrastructure. The proposal also calls for forming a national Palestinian committee of technocrats and community leaders unaffiliated with Hamas to govern postwar Gaza. It is unclear whether the plan has the support of the Palestinian Authority, the internationally recognized body that currently rules parts of the West Bank and administered Gaza until it lost the 2006 election to Hamas. 'What is needed now is a political solution to Gaza to make that reconstruction both physically possible and long term sustainable,' said Tariq Kenney-Shawa, U.S. Policy Fellow at the Palestinian Policy Network Al-Shabaka. The goal is that 'we don't return to a situation where Gaza remains under occupation,' he told VOA. On Monday Hamas indicated a willingness to cede any postwar governance role. 'It is not necessary for Hamas to be part of the political and administrative arrangements in the next phase for Gaza, especially if it serves the interests of our people,' Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasim told Al Arabiya TV. Hamas made the conciliatory statement as negotiations toward phase two of the ceasefire is set to begin in days, after weeks of delay. However, it fulfills only part of Israel’s and the United States’ key demand — the elimination of governance and military role for Hamas in postwar Gaza. So far Hamas has not shown it would disarm. Meanwhile Israel has not defined what it considers an acceptable alternative governing entity to Hamas and has rejected any involvement of the Palestinian Authority. The Egyptian proposal also does not solve a longstanding issue between the warring parties. Israeli leaders oppose any postwar plans that would pave the way to a two-state solution, while a sovereign Palestine remains a key requirement for Palestinians and Arab countries. Expedited hostage release A top Hamas official announced earlier this week that the group will return the remains of four deceased Israeli hostages and free six living ones in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including 47 senior Hamas members. Israel will also allow mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza. The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under phase one of the ceasefire that called for the gradual release of 33 hostages, eight of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas took about 250 hostages and killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel. Analysts said the expedited exchange of hostages and prisoners could mean that both parties are anxious to secure what they can now, due to concerns the truce will collapse before phase one expires next week. 'What we're looking at now is possibly — possibly a swifter resolution to phase two,' said Mirette Mabrouk, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'But if that happens, then that sort of signals near the end of the conflict,' she told VOA. 'And that's something that [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he's not going to want without Hamas being disarmed.' Hamas is believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. It insists it will only release them in exchange for a permanent end to fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Israel's counteroffensive to the Hamas attack has displaced more than 2 million Palestinians and killed more than 48,200, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants.

Guantánamo Needs To Be Shut Down, Not Expanded – OpEd	In a deeply disturbing and unprecedented move, the U.S. has begun transferring immigrant detainees to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. They’re being held without access to their lawyers and families. President Trump has ordered up to 30,000 'high-priority' migrants to be imprisoned there as part of his larger mass deportation and detention campaign. Trump claims these migrants are the 'worst criminal aliens threatening the American people.' But recent investigations of those detainees have already challenged this narrative. And a large percentage of immigrants arrested in the U.S. have no criminal record. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time our government has invoked 'national security' to deny marginalized communities their basic human rights. President George W. Bush created the infamous military prison at Guantánamo during the 'War on Terror' to hold what his administration called the 'worst of the worst.' The prison has since become synonymous with indefinite detention — 15 people still remain there today, over 20 years later. Notorious for its brutality and lawlessness, Guantánamo should be shut down, not expanded. Of the 780 Muslim men and boys imprisoned there since January 2002, the vast majority have been held without charge or trial. Most were abducted and sold to the U.S. for bounty and 'had no relationship whatsoever with the events that took place on 9/11,' reported the UN’s independent expert in 2023, who reiterated the global call to close Guantánamo. The Bush administration designed the prison to circumvent the Constitution and the 1949 Geneva Conventions, refusing to treat the prisoners as either POWs or civilians. This legal fiction resulted in a range of human rights violations, including torture. But the Constitution — and international law — still applies wherever the U.S. government operates. All prisoners, including immigrants, are still entitled to humane treatment, legal counsel, and due process. 'Never before have people been taken from U.S. soil and sent to Guantánamo, and then denied access to lawyers and the outside world,' said Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney in the ACLU case challenging Trump’s executive order. However, the U.S. does have a sordid history of detaining migrants captured elsewhere at the base. As legal scholar Jeffrey S. Kahn points out, the U.S. has detained Haitians at Guantánamo on and off since the 1970s. In the 1990s, thousands of Haitian refugees fleeing persecution following a military coup were captured at sea. The U.S. held them in horrific conditions at Guantánamo so they couldn’t reach U.S. shores to seek asylum — which is a fundamental human right long enshrined under U.S. law. Shrouded in secrecy, the U.S. continues to capture and detain asylum seekers fleeing Haiti, Cuba, and other Caribbean countries at Guantánamo. Last fall, the International Refugee Assistance Project reported that refugee families are kept in a dilapidated building with mold and sewage problems, suffer from a lack of medical care, and are 'detained indefinitely in prison-like conditions without access to the outside world.' Trump’s order would take these abuses to a horrifying new level. Currently, the base’s existing immigration detention facility can hold up 120 people. Expanding it to 30,000 will require enormous resources. The 'War on Terror' prison at Guantánamo already costs an estimated $540 million annually, making it one of the most expensive prisons in the world. Then there are the moral costs. The mass deportation and detention of asylum seekers is not only unlawful but cruel — and not a real immigration solution. Instead, our government should prioritize meaningful immigration reform that recognizes the dignity of all people. We should also shut down the 'War on Terror' prison at Guantánamo once and for all — and pursue accountability for its decades of abuses. Otherwise, it will only continue to expand. 'I can attest to the facility’s capacity for cruelty,' warned Mansoor Adayfi, who was subjected to torture and endured nearly 15 years at the prison. Guantánamo’s legacy of injustice must end.

UN Calls For Rapid Economic Recovery In Syria To Reverse Losses F...	By Ephrem Kossaify A newly published report from the UN Development Programme warned that at current growth rates, the Syrian economy will not recover to prewar levels until 2080, leaving the country stuck in a state of prolonged hardship and instability. It also underscored the urgent need for a rapid economic recovery to help reverse the decades of progress that were lost as a result of the 14-year civil war. The conflict shattered nearly four decades of economic, social and human development, causing irreparable damage to the nation’s infrastructure, economy and social fabric. The report, titled 'The Impact of the Conflict in Syria: A Devastated Economy, Pervasive Poverty, and a Challenging Road Ahead to Social and Economic Recovery,' offers a detailed analysis of the socioeconomic state of the country, and outlines a road map for rebuilding its economy and infrastructure. According to the UNDP’s preliminary socioeconomic impact assessment, gross domestic product in Syria has halved since the war began in 2011, representing a loss of $800 billion over the past 14 years. Poverty has reached alarming levels, with the national poverty rate soaring from 33 percent before the war to 90 percent. Extreme poverty has also skyrocketed, with 66 percent of the population now affected, up from just 11 percent prior to the conflict. Three out of four people in the country rely on humanitarian aid and are in urgent need of support for critical aspects of life such as healthcare, education, employment, food security and housing. The country also has one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, with one in four Syrians jobless. Achim Steiner, the administrator of UNDP, said that the requirements for Syria’s recovery extend beyond the immediate need for humanitarian aid. 'Restoring productivity for jobs and poverty relief, revitalizing agriculture for food security, and rebuilding infrastructure for essential services such as healthcare, education and energy are key to a self-sustaining future, prosperity and peace,' he said. The damage to Syria’s infrastructure, which has left many essential services nonfunctional, is among the primary obstacles to recovery. The report highlights a staggering array of damage: nearly 50 percent of schools are closed, one-in-three housing units have been destroyed, and nearly half of the nation’s water-treatment plants and sewage systems are no longer operational. Energy production has plummeted by 80 percent, with power plants and transmission lines heavily damaged. These failures in basic services exacerbate poverty levels and block any meaningful path toward recovery. The UNDP report also highlighted the devastating loss of life during the war, and the decline in health infrastructure. Nearly 618,000 Syrians died during the conflict, and 113,000 were forcibly disappeared, their whereabouts still unknown. Meanwhile, the collapse of the healthcare system has exacerbated the crisis; a third of all medical facilities have been damaged and almost half of ambulance services are no longer operational. The education sector was also hit hard, leaving 40-50 percent of children between the ages of 6 and 15 unable to attend school. The widespread destruction of housing has left 5.7 million people in need of shelter support. Essential infrastructure, including water-treatment plants, sewer systems and power plants, has been severely damaged, leaving millions without access to clean water, sanitation or reliable energy supplies. Syria’s position on the Human Development Index has plummeted to its lowest point since 1990, further illustrating the catastrophic effects of the war on the nation’s development. The economic outlook remains grim but hope can be found in the potential for robust growth if the correct strategies are implemented, the UNDP said. Its report calls for an ambitious approach to development, as growth rates will need to increase sixfold if they are to recover within a decade. At the current rate of annual growth, 1.3 percent, it would take more than 50 years to restore GDP to prewar levels. To recover within 15 years, Syria would need to achieve a growth rate of 5 percent, and a tenfold increase in growth would be required for the country to reach the level of development it could have attained in the absence of the war. Abdallah Al-Dardari, UNDP’s assistant administrator and director of its regional bureau for Arab states, stressed the important need for comprehensive reforms, and said: 'Syria’s future hinges on a robust development-recovery approach. 'This demands a comprehensive strategy addressing governance reform, economic stabilization, sector revitalization, infrastructure rebuilding, and strengthened social services.' He told Arab News that this strategy for recovery will rely on investments and on good management of those investments, as he underscored the institutional requirements Syria will need to meet to attract private investment in infrastructure. 'If you want to invest $100million or $200 million in (a) highway, you need to first of all be sure that you can go to the court, and the court will treat you equally if you have a litigation with your counterpart, which is the government,' Al-Dardari said. 'You need to make sure that there are internationally recognized arbitration systems. You need to make sure that your money can come in and leave the country. You need to make sure that your banking system respects the highest standards of banking. 'I can give you a very long list of things that need to be done and are not there yet. So this is an arduous journey. This is not an easy journey.' Al-Dardari also told Arab News about the effects of international sanctions, imposed on the Assad regime during the war, on the economy and the ways in which they are hampering recovery progress. 'I'll give you an example,' he said. 'Who is going to bring those investments of $36 billion while they are not really sure that the banking sector is free to bring in money, to use the SWIFT (banking system) to transfer funds and to invest? 'How do you make sure that your shipments into Syria of raw materials or semi-manufactured products are protected? How do you make sure that your exports from Syria can arrive at their destinations, and money will be paid for those exports? 'So at every step of the way in recovery, sanctions will play a role. The chilling effect of sanctions, what we call the ‘overload lines,’ will accompany those sanctions. So our core message (to countries) here is: Please understand the impact of sanctions and act accordingly.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeVu5nSlO1wj9p67zXoM_VI	2025-02-20T15:46:32-08:00	
Seven Weaknesses In ‘Fortress Switzerland’ – Analysis	The Swiss armed forces are grappling with significant challenges in a shifting geopolitical landscape. Experts highlight seven pressing problems that must be addressed by the next Swiss defence minister. By Balz Rigendinger The Swiss army is not up to the challenges of the present. Russia’s war against Ukraine has brought uncertainty to Europe and the need for enhanced defence capabilities. Swiss politicians from across the political spectrum recognise that need and parliament has already agreed to raise defence spending to 1% of GDP by 2032. But combat readiness has been a perennial problem for the Swiss army. There are seven other pressing issues demanding the attention of whoever succeeds Viola Amherd as defence minister. 1. Lack of strategy Historically, the Swiss army has adapted its resources to align with prevailing threats, hammering out new strategies in the process. These strategic frameworks were essential for communicating the rationale behind substantial expenditures to both the public and the troops. The last serious attempt at reform was initiated in 2010. Since then, the geopolitical situation has changed drastically – yet an adequate strategic vision to deal with it remains lacking. True, it is no longer necessary to ask 'what’s the point of the army?' after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the Swiss defence sector has lost any coherence it ever had as it scrambles to respond to a myriad of fresh challenges. Hybrid warfare, rapid advancements in digital technology, and the return of tank warfare – all need to be considered. 'We are being presented with numerous wish lists. But to set priorities right, we need an overall strategy,' says Priska Seiler Graf of the Social Democratic Party. She chairs the defence policy committee of the House of Representatives. Senator Werner Salzmann of the Swiss People’s Party adds: 'The current top priority is the defence capability of Switzerland in all areas. But we are not yet seeing any comprehensive defence concept from the government.' 2. Air defences are weak Most experts on the armed forces would agree that air defence is becoming more and more important. Yet Switzerland is weak in the air, because the two things needed – fighter jets and air defence systems – are outdated and require a major overhaul. In fact, they seem to be stuck in a never-ending overhaul phase. The 25-year-old F/A-18 fighter jets the Swiss air force uses are in a preventive maintenance programme to keep them going. Due to complications, this programme has had to be extended. Monitoring of Swiss air space is also a weak point. A system adequate to deal with serious incursions is only being developed now. The development process is troubled at best. Air defences for the middle-distance range are completely out of date. It is not known when a new system will become available. 'We are expecting it by the end of the decade,' says Kaj-Gunnar Sievert, spokesperson for the Federal Office of Defence Procurement. The replacement fighter jet, the F-35, has been ordered from US defence contractor Lockheed Martin. The first eight of the 36 planes bought are due for delivery in 2028. The tense security situation worldwide may lead to delays, however. The F-35 is already considered to be costly in terms of maintenance. 'We may be in for a few nasty surprises,' says parliamentarian Seiler Graf. 3. Procurement getting out of control In quick succession, Switzerland’s main financial oversight bodies both sounded the alarm about armed forces procurement. These are the finance delegation of parliament, which is responsible for the detailed examination and supervision of the national budget, and the Federal Audit Office. In December, parliament’s finance delegation warned that projects to a total value of CHF19 billion ($21 billion) were being affected by 'delays, increasing risks and insufficient resources'. Then in mid-January, the Federal Audit Office sharply criticised a CHF300 million procurement order for reconnaissance drones. The Hermes 900 drone, which is already established on the market, has been undergoing an elaborate customisation process to meet the special requirements of Switzerland. This Israeli drone needs to be able to fly around the Alps, necessitating the installation of a diesel engine and de-icing system – two long-standing problems. In addition, Switzerland wants to have an automatic evasion system built into the drone to prevent collisions with paragliders in the Alps. The result has been a debacle, with the first five delivered drones currently grounded and requiring helicopter escorts when they do return to service. The procurement of these drones has been significantly delayed. 4. Military IT projects in limbo The Swiss government is currently working on 22 digitalisation projects, all of which are strategically important, worth millions, and highly complex. Nine of these 22 projects are being run by the defence ministry. Hardly anything is going according to plan. 'We have identified seven projects that are causing us concern,' says army chief of staff Thomas Süssli. The jewel in the crown of these digital efforts is the development of a proprietary operating system to run military computers, essentially a 'Windows for the army'. It has been in the works for a decade. The list of requirements for this system is ambitious. There has to be a single platform for managing warfare across all operational terrains: on the ground, in the air, in cyberspace, in the electromagnetic (radio communications) and information space. All weapon systems should be compatible with it. And all data should reside in Switzerland, stored on secure servers, and independent of the normal power grid. There are further key projects in defence which the finance delegation of parliament finds to be at risk of failure. Has Switzerland bitten off more than it can chew? 'It remains a challenge to bring all these projects to a successful conclusion,' admits General Süssli. 5. Disagreements about international cooperation Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland came under pressure about its attitude to NATO. US ambassador Scott Miller said in 2023: 'In a way, NATO is a doughnut, and Switzerland is the hole in the middle.' What he meant was this. Switzerland benefits from the protection of the NATO states surrounding it. It doesn’t give anything back – it’s not even able to defend itself adequately. Defence minister Viola Amherd, during her time in office, took rapid steps to bring about cooperation with the Western alliance and with Europe. One decision that has been taken is to join the European air defence system called Sky Shield. Yet all such steps are controversial on the home front, for the People’s Party in particular sees Swiss neutrality as being endangered. 'Neutrality is what has protected us. That too is a part of the overall design of Swiss defence,' insists senator Salzmann. Going it alone militarily brings the risk of being left to stand alone in the event of war. 'One can only wonder how it can be in NATO’s interests to provide defence for a rich country which takes the liberty of making minimal efforts of self-defence and itself refuses to provide support in times of crisis.' This is what well-known strategy expert Mauro Mantovani said recently in an opinion piece in the newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung. The pressure from NATO and the EU for greater Swiss involvement is not likely to lessen. A new defence minister will therefore need to make Switzerland’s case abroad – and explain the position taken by other countries to the voters at home. This latter effort will have to be done as part of a referendum campaign. The Neutrality initiative of the People’s Party, due to be voted on soon, is intended to put a stop to any cooperation with NATO. 6. Lack of qualified people to fill jobs The lack of qualified people, a general problem in industry, also affects the Swiss defence sector. The Federal Intelligence Service alone reports it needs 150 more staff. Army planners are even more concerned about the overall demographic trends in the country. 'According to the army’s own projections, in the 2030s we will not be able to muster 100,000 recruits to serve,' says one. The existing obligatory national service system is about to undergo reform. There is a people’s initiative in the offing to require everyone with Swiss citizenship to carry out some service for the community, the 'Service citoyen initiative'. This initiative is also an attack on the traditional conscription framework, since opportunities to serve are to be more varied and a matter for freer choice. 'Staffing levels for the army are guaranteed with this initiative,' insists campaigner Noémie Roten. At the same time, two other new systems of national service are being developed. Both of these are likely to be subject to a nationwide vote as well. In Autumn 2024 a federal government studyExternal link found that a good half of those serving in the army stated that they had experienced discrimination or sexual abuse there. The leadership of the army committed to remedy this. The military knows that it will soon have to show clearly and convincingly what Swiss citizens are giving years out of their lives for. 7. A risky legacy of problems Then there are a number of legacy issues. One is the dumping of ammunition in mountain regions and lakes, which went on for decades without much thought being given to the consequences. The most notorious example is the little village of Mitholz in the Bernese Alps, which is unwilling host to 3,500 tonnes of old munitions buried in a vault in the mountainside. It will take until 2040 to clean up this dangerous mess. So far there have been a few surprises in this dossier as more information on the caches came to light. So it might take longer still. Another issue is the Swiss arms manufacturer RUAG. The company attracted some unwelcome attention in recent years due to a corruption scandal and cross-border lawsuits. The federal government has wanted to privatise this state-owned entity for quite a while. But there were a series of hitches. What is more, European customers began to lose interest when Switzerland forbade them to pass on Swiss armaments they had bought to the Ukrainians. The federal government has changed its mind on the future of the company. Now it is thinking of incorporating RUAG completely into the defence ministry. Yet, time and again, the company has been plagued by compliance problems. Switzerland is taking a big risk here.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfXeQON14vdX9-WdxIa1_WC	2025-02-19T16:55:20-08:00	
LAC Stalemate: Why China Fears Fighting In The Himalayas – Analys...	The towering peaks of the Himalayas form more than just a geographical barrier between India and China; they represent a formidable military challenge. The Line of Actual Control (LAC), where the two nations’ troops stand eye to eye, presents some of the harshest conditions known to warfare. For China, these mountains are more than a border—they are a battleground for which it remains unprepared. The Terrain That Tests Resolve The LAC’s rugged terrain and extreme altitude impose logistical nightmares. Sustained military operations here require highly skilled soldiers and a robust support infrastructure. At elevations where oxygen levels drop by 40 percent at 15,000 feet, combat effectiveness declines sharply. These conditions are an unfamiliar adversary for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), whose training largely focuses on plains and urban warfare. In contrast, the Indian Army’s history is steeped in high-altitude warfare. Decades of deployment in Siachen—the world’s highest battlefield—and the gruelling Kargil conflict at 16,000 to 18,000 feet altitudes have honed Indian soldiers into specialists in mountain combat. The Kargil War, fought on steep, rocky terrain under extreme weather, remains a testament to India’s unmatched resilience and skill in these unforgiving environments. Infrastructure: India’s Operational Edge A modern war is fought not just with weapons but with roads, bridges, and airstrips. India’s focused efforts to enhance border infrastructure have paid dividends. Strategic projects, from advanced airstrips to all-weather roads, have cut troop deployment times drastically. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has operational bases in Leh, Chandigarh, Bagdogra, Tezpur, and Hasimara—much closer to the LAC than China’s facilities. With Rafale fighter jets and S-400 missile systems now in its arsenal, India’s rapid-response capabilities are unmatched. Meanwhile, though expanding, China’s infrastructure in Tibet continues to lag. The absence of highways, railways, and airfields capable of sustaining large-scale military operations limits Beijing’s options. Heavy artillery and tanks—essential for prolonged ground operations—are of limited use in such inhospitable terrains, further diminishing China’s ability to mount an offensive. Acclimatised and Armed: India’s Military Readiness India’s advantage is not solely infrastructural. The Indian Army’s long-standing mountain divisions undergo rigorous acclimatisation and training, making them battle-ready at short notice. Strategic positions along key heights in eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh give India control over vital observation and mobility routes. Sophisticated surveillance systems—including drones, satellites, and advanced radar—ensure that Chinese troop movements are detected long before they pose a threat. Recent studies by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and the Center for a New American Security reaffirm India’s operational superiority in high-altitude warfare. These assessments underline that while China may possess numerical superiority, India’s defensive positioning neutralises this advantage. The Two-Front Predicament for China Beijing’s strategic calculus is further complicated by its focus on Taiwan. Taiwan represents not just a territorial claim but a core national interest for China—a geopolitical chess piece that could draw in global powers like the United States and Japan. Engaging in a prolonged Himalayan conflict risks diluting China’s military focus, leaving its flanks vulnerable in the Taiwan Strait. A two-front scenario would overstretch China’s resources and logistics. Balancing the demands of two geographically and strategically distinct conflicts is a challenge the PLA would struggle to manage. India’s steady military presence along the LAC ensures that any miscalculation by China could lead to an engagement it cannot sustain. Quad and Diplomatic Calculations India has cultivated robust strategic partnerships, unlike China, which finds itself increasingly isolated in the Indo-Pacific. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad)—comprising India, the United States, Japan, and Australia—has emerged as a significant deterrent to Chinese aggression. Regular joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and enhanced defence cooperation with Western allies position India as a linchpin in regional security. India’s influential role in the Indo-Pacific further limits China’s strategic manoeuvrability. A conflict with India risks galvanising this emerging coalition, opening up new diplomatic and military resistance fronts for Beijing. Economic and Diplomatic Repercussions The economic stakes are equally high. India-China bilateral trade surpassed $136 billion in 2023, underscoring deep economic interdependence. However, India has shown a willingness to leverage this relationship when national security is at stake. The ban on over 300 Chinese apps following the Galwan Valley clash inflicted significant losses on Chinese tech giants. A full-scale conflict would trigger further economic decoupling, with India restricting investments and operations of major Chinese companies. The diplomatic fallout would be equally severe, casting China as an expansionist power at a time when its global image is already under strain due to tensions in the South China Sea and human rights issues in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Resilience and Strategy: India’s Calculated Posture The LAC has been described by top military officials and experts as stable but sensitive. India’s sustained deployment along the border and proactive military-to-military dialogues ensure that tensions are managed and do not escalate inadvertently. India’s diplomatic finesse in maintaining global partnerships has further reduced its strategic vulnerabilities. By presenting itself as a responsible power committed to regional stability, India has not only strengthened its own position but also exposed the limitations of China’s strategic posture in the Himalayas. A Stalemate on India’s Terms China’s reluctance to escalate tensions along the LAC is rooted in a complex web of strategic, logistical, and economic considerations. The extreme terrain of the Himalayas, India’s superior high-altitude warfare capabilities, infrastructural advantages, and robust diplomatic networks make a full-scale conflict an unpalatable option for Beijing. By transforming the LAC stalemate into a scenario that exposes Chinese weaknesses rather than one that serves Beijing’s territorial ambitions, India has demonstrated that in the heights of the Himalayas, it holds the upper hand—on its own terms and in its own time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfXeQON14vdXxNo3LZveCh6	2025-02-19T16:53:53-08:00	
Family Politics: The Marcos-Duterte Feud And The Future Of The Ph...	By Pradeep Nadig The Philippine government is currently being led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the unpopular former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., and Vice President Sara Duterte, daughter of the controversial former President Rodrigo Duterte. They joined hands and were brought into power in 2022 but their fragile alliance is now in shambles and going through a very public breakup. The situation reached boiling point in November 2024, when Duterte made death threats against Marcos, the First Lady, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, adding that arrangements had been made to kill them in the event of her assassination. The outcome of this fracas is likely to have stark domestic implications. It will also affect the country’s foreign policy, including its relationship with India, in 2025. Election predictions The collapse of this alliance comes ahead of the 2025 midterm elections in which all 317 seats in the House and 12 of the 24 seats in the Senate will be contested. Both dynasties are fighting to create a favourable situation for themselves in preparation for the 2028 presidential elections. Marcos has proposed extending presidential term limits beyond the current six years, but to do so, he must retain control of the House. In November 2023, he released former Senator Leila De Lima, who was Rodrigo Duterte’s fiercest political opponent. She was widely believed to have been imprisoned due to her vocal criticism of his administration and his brutal war on drugs. Her release well ahead of the midterm elections in 2025, where her vocal opposition to the Dutertes could help Marcos consolidate power in the House, is strategic. Meanwhile, the Duterte family is working to gain electoral ground in the House and set up favourable odds for Sara Duterte’s presidential campaign in 2028. The family has nominated Senate candidates that are not part of the ruling coalition party and many independent candidates who are known Duterte allies. Rodrigo Duterte is also preparing to run for mayor of Davao City, a position he held prior to becoming president in 2016. Following Sara Duterte’s statements and death threats and the corruption charges against her, the House has filed for her impeachment. This investigation led Rodrigo Duterte to describe Congress as a 'rotten institution.' The Dutertes are aiming to shift the balance of power to avoid Sara Duterte’s impeachment while Marcos needs to ensure that impeachment happens so that he can extend the presidential term limit and prevent Duterte from becoming president in 2028. Foreign policy differences As president, Marcos has deviated significantly from Rodrigo Duterte on foreign policy. While Duterte was known for his pro-Beijing position, Marcos’ actions in the past year indicate a clear pro-Washington stance. Unlike the former president, who continued to appease Chinese territorial claims and military exercises in the West Philippine Sea (even after winning an arbitration case in 2016), the current president has gone on a diplomatic and even security offensive. Duterte assumed an anti-US position despite Chinese maritime aggression. In 2021, however, he finally reversed his decision to end the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) that allowed US access to military bases in the Philippines. Although the agreement was reinstated, trust between Washington and Manila remained low until Marcos’ victory in 2022. In April 2023 Marcos granted the US access to four additional Philippine military bases in an expansion of the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) that was signed in 2014. Marcos has claimed that this measure was taken primarily to boost disaster relief in the area in addition to defending its coastline on the South China Sea. Bilateral ties between the US and the Philippines have made great strides in Marcos’ tenure. The countries have jointly issued new bilateral defence guidelines that updated the 1951 Mutual Defence Agreement between the two. These new guidelines have resulted in greater defence cooperation, foreign military funding, expansion of military bases, and an increase in military equipment supplies. In 2024, when the Spratly Islands dispute boiled to open confrontations between China and the Philippines, Marcos doubled down on Manila’s claims, strengthening its ties with Washington. Implications for India Marcos’ position on China, unlike that of Duterte, has been better for New Delhi. Since 2022, trade relations between India and the Philippines have steadily improved with the total value crossing US$ 3 billion. The two countries have also made great strides in defence cooperation, resulting in the sale of the BrahMos missile system to the Philippines worth US$ 375 million. During the fifth India–Philippines Joint Defence Cooperation Committee meeting held in Manila on 10 September 2024, India’s Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane encouraged the defence partnership between the nations and advocated for the joint development of military equipment. Marcos’ foreign policy has bolstered defence against China’s expansion in the South China Sea, which aligns with both the US and India’s strategic agenda for the region, making way for greater bilateral and trilateral security cooperation. Outreach to the Philippines also provides India with an opportunity to showcase its reliability and power to others in the ASEAN region. This was the theme of the 20th India-ASEAN summit held in Jakarta in 2023, which aimed to boost maritime cooperation. Increased defence cooperation with the Philippines signifies the end of India’s reluctance to supply weapons to ASEAN in fear of China’s response. As New Delhi seeks to become a leader in defence exports and position itself as a strategic partner, its ties with Manila must continue to grow for the success of its future foreign policy in Southeast Asia. The current political climate combined with shared strategic interests and the positive relationship between Trump and Modi have created favourable conditions for stronger India-Philippines ties in 2025. Future dynamics While these opportunities exist, Donald Trump’s election as president raises certain questions. The Marcos administration has received support from the US in deterring China thus far, however, the newly elected Trump administration could decrease military spending abroad and adopt an anti-interventionist stance, which would leave the Philippines in a vulnerable position. The upcoming midterm elections are likely to rebalance power between the Marcos and Duterte families. With potentially greater influence in the House and Senate, the Dutertes could advocate for a return to more pro-China policies and make it difficult for the US to continue joint military operations and access military bases in the Philippines. This would also undermine New Delhi’s influence in the region and hinder growing military cooperation with Manila. The Dutertes would also be better positioned to oppose Marcos’s proposal to extend the presidential term limit, making Sara Duterte a favourite for the 2028 presidential elections. If this were to happen, it would greatly hurt both New Delhi and Washington’s foreign policy interests in the region for the better part of a decade.

Choppy Waters Continue In The South China Sea – Analysis	By Carlyle Thayer China escalated its aggression in the South China Sea in 2024, highlighting the ongoing struggle between maritime rights, sovereignty and security. Several confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have led Manila to engage in security efforts to curb China’s intimidation, while divisions within ASEAN continue to hamper efforts to establish a South China Sea Code of Conduct. In 2024, China stepped up its intimidation, harassment and coercion against the Philippine Navy, Coast Guard and civilian vessels and aircraft operating legally within the country’s exclusive economic zone. China deployed large numbers of People’s Liberation Army Navy, China Coast Guard (CCG) and People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM) vessels into the West Philippine Sea. China also passed Provisions on Administrative Enforcement Procedures for Coast Guard Agencies in June 2024 and issued coordinates for baselines around Scarborough Shoal in November to provide ostensible legal cover for its coercion against the Philippines. But Chief of the Armed Force of the Philippines General Romeo Brawner characterised China’s grey zone tactics as illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive. From February to June, CCG and PAFMM vessels repeatedly confronted Philippine rotation and reprovisioning (RORE) missions to the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal. Chinese coercion included dangerous manoeuvring, deliberate ramming and the use of high-powered water cannons. On 17 June, Chinese vessels conducted their most violent confrontation of a Philippine RORE mission. Armed Chinese sailors attacked a Philippine rigid hull inflatable boat and assaulted Filipino marines, smashed communication equipment, confiscated weapons and punctured the hull. The 17 June incident marked an inflection point. After a series of discussions, the two sides announced a provisional agreement to prevent similar incidents on 21 July. Philippine RORE missions were conducted without incident for the remainder of the year. But the agreement did not include Sabina and Scarborough Shoals. In April, after the discovery of crushed coral at Sabina Shoal, the Philippines deployed Coast Guard vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua to pre-empt Chinese construction, leading to a series of confrontations with Chinese vessels. On 19 August, 40 Chinese vessels blocked resupply and rammed the hull of the BRP Teresa Magbanua three times. On 12 September, as the BRP Teresa Magbanua withdrew due to ration, medical and ship repair needs, China surged 207 vessels to Sabina Shoal. Confrontations also escalated at Scarborough Shoal. In August, CCG military aircraft fired flares in Philippine air force flight paths. In December, China dispatched air and naval ‘combat readiness patrols’ around Scarborough Shoal, including a 12,000 ton CCG ship. In response to escalating Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, the Philippines announced a whole-of-government Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept in January 2024. The concept promotes greater interoperability between the tri-services and civilian agencies to conduct combined maritime and air defence operations. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr also approved the US$35 billion Re-Horizon 3 program to modernise the Philippines’ Armed Forces. In November, Marcos Jr signed into law the Philippines Maritime Zone Act and the Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act to bolster its sovereign jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea. The Philippines also participated in bilateral and multilateral land, sea and air military exercises with the United States, Australia, Japan and other security partners. While the United States offered to assist in resupply at Second Thomas Shoal, the Philippines declined, stating that they ‘will exhaust all means before seeking foreign intervention’. But the Philippines permitted the deployment of the US Typhon Strategic Mid-Range Fires System in April during Exercise Salaknib. China protested vehemently and declared that relations with the Philippines were at a crossroad. In November, it was revealed that a US military task force had been deployed to Palawan island to assist the Philippines in logistics and maritime domain awareness. Unlike the Philippines, 2024 was relatively quiet on Vietnam’s eastern front. In June, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative reported growing Vietnamese construction on the Spratly Islands through landfill, dredging harbours and constructing infrastructure, including a 1050 metre airfield on Barque Canada. But China has remained silent on Vietnam’s activities in the South China Sea. Within ASEAN, progress towards a South China Sea Code of Conduct has remained stalled. At the annual ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on 25 July, it was reported that Cambodia and Laos, the 2024 ASEAN Chair, blocked a proposal by the Philippines to include a reference to the 17 June incident. By the year’s end, various ASEAN diplomats privately reported that little progress had been made on the third reading of the South China Sea Code of Conduct because of divisions within ASEAN. Looking ahead to 2025, China will continue to assert its sovereignty over land features and adjacent waters within the West Philippine Sea and try to take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration. The Philippines will redouble its self-defence measures and seek reassurance from the United States that its alliance commitment is ironclad. Vietnam will continue to improve infrastructure on its land features. On the South China Sea Code of Conduct, China will continue to play a double game in negotiations with ASEAN by pressing for an early conclusion of negotiations as a diplomatic ploy while letting negotiations drag on, as both options prevent direct US involvement.

The New India-US Security Compact – Analysis	By Vivek Mishra As states transition in economic heft, power, and influence, so do their relationships. Most starkly, this is visible in the changing nature of their ties with great powers. On the contrary, the recalibrations by great powers themselves have implicit success stories about growing powers, not just one of accommodation but increasingly, compulsion. While the United States (US) has remained a constant paradigm of growth, influence, and both soft and hard power for over three-quarters of the last century, China and India have presented two very contrasting pictures of the kind of relationship rising states have with the preeminent power of the world. China’s growth in the last three decades, in many ways, was facilitated by the US’s role as the global security guarantor. Now, China and the US are fundamentally locked in a great power competition, with almost every aspect of the contest speeding towards a downward spiral. Three factors have intensified this trend. First, rapid shifts in American social and political choices and patterns domestically have altered how America thinks of its security and role in the world. Second, the US wants to retain its numero uno position even as China is hurtling from behind in the most critical of domains that underscore this great power competition. China’s transformation of its naval power brings unprecedented pressure onto the Indo-Pacific countries and in the tacit spread of its economic tentacles throughout the world, compelling a reassessment of the metrics of the global power dynamic. Finally, a new tech race, which is beginning to unravel and will likely shape the course of great power competition in the next few decades, has enforced an order of multilateral accommodation of rising powers upon the US. Together, these have led to a new utilitarian view of security, power and influence in Washington. India is at the helm in that reassessment of Washington. When the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, visited the US to meet with his counterpart, President Donald Trump, on 13-14 February 2025, camaraderie, nostalgia, optics, and pragmatism seemed to roll into one. Keen observers of the India-US relationship were expecting Trump to give a new imprint to the bilateral relationship and not simply conform to the existing paradigms of continuity in bilateral ties. The barely 40-hour trip saw a new US-India COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology) agreement, which aims to serve as the new broad framework for combining cooperation in defence, trade, energy security, technology and innovation, people-to-people ties, and multilateral cooperation. For the last two decades, the India-US defence ties based itself on the continued momentum provided by the 2005 Framework for the US-India Defence Relationship which promised 'setting the US and India on a path to increasingly broad, complex, and strategic cooperation' and the subsequent 10-year framework signed in June 2015 which provided 'avenues for high-level strategic discussions, continued exchanges between armed forces of both countries, and strengthening of defence capabilities.' The latest extension of the framework is reflective of the expansive nature of defence ties between the US and India, especially in its increasing importance for cooperation in the transfer of sensitive technologies and strategic trust. India and the US announced the signing of a new ten-year framework this year for the US-India Major Defence Partnership in the 21st Century, as the one signed in 2015 nears its culmination. Importantly, the new framework weaves in India’s Major Defence Partner (MDP) status to ensure that new technology access and supply guarantees in the area of defence and security can be part of a sustained process over the next decade. A path that was set for the India-US defence cooperation in 2005 has required a new thrust every 10 years to accommodate new priorities. The latest iteration has placed the expansion of defence industrial cooperation, coproduction, and interoperability at the heart of bilateral defence ties. Among key plans to speed up supplies for India’s defence requirements, India and the US have announced that they will pursue new procurements and co-production arrangements for ‘Javelin’ Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and ‘Stryker’ Infantry Combat Vehicles in India this year. Besides, the procurement of six additional P-8I Maritime Patrol aircraft is likely to boost India’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities in the expanse of the Indo-Pacific region. The second Trump administration has clearly taken a long view of the security ties with India, wherein the focus of the planned steps is to further integrate bilateral security ties by making them deeply structural. A wider leveraging of India’s MDP status through the Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 (STA‑1) authorisation; initiating negotiations for a Reciprocal Defence Procurement (RDP) agreement to enhance bilateral procurement channels and establish well-oiled reciprocal supply lines for defence goods and services; and reviewing arms transfer regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), are all geared towards fostering deeper integration, interoperability, and co-production. Given the lessons learnt over the past five years—both on and off the battlefield—it was rather incumbent upon Modi and Trump to outline a roadmap for the next decade. The importance of autonomous systems to the future of warfare and security is one such domain. India and the US announced the Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA), a new initiative seeking to augment industry partnerships and production in the Indo-Pacific region. Partnerships between Indian and US companies for coproducing maritime systems and AI-enabled counter Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) could be useful for both countering and establishing deterrence. Perhaps most importantly, India and the US have broken ‘new ground’ by announcing their intention to 'support and sustain the overseas deployments of the US and Indian militaries in the Indo-Pacific'—a significant joint security commitment to the region. These deployments could reshape how India and the US approach regional security in the Indo-Pacific by enhancing cooperation in logistics, intelligence sharing, force mobility for joint humanitarian and disaster relief operations, and, most importantly, for countering common threats from the Gulf to the Far East. There were several other announcements in the field of technology, innovation, energy security, space and people-to-people ties, which all feed into the new security compact between the two countries. However, three trends in the India-US bilateral as well as their multilateral cooperation framework stood out in the joint statement. The Indian Ocean will be a key domain in the Indo-US cooperation. The launch of the Indian Ocean Strategic Venture—a bilateral initiative to advance coordinated investments in economic connectivity and commerce—along with Meta’s ambitious 50,000-kilometre undersea cable project, underscores a long-term commitment to connect and strengthen global digital infrastructure and regional security. Second, Modi’s visit underscored that the commitment of both India and the US to the importance of the Quad framework in the Indo-Pacific remains resolute. And finally, a key convergence point in this new bilateral compact between India and the US is connectivity projects. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) aims to serve as the next transregional connectivity project which could reroute energy supply chains. However, its success remains contingent on the geopolitical externalities of the Middle East. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, US Vice President J.D. Vance emphasised that America expects Europe to take on a greater security role, allowing Washington to focus on other critical regions. The implicit message was clear: Indo-Pacific security and the challenge posed by China remain top priorities for the US. Despite concerns that a second Trump administration might scale back America's global security commitments, its strategic competition with China is set to continue. A confident Trump administration views India as a crucial partner in advancing its strategic objectives while recalibrating America’s role on the global stage.

Indonesia: With Next Election Years Away, Prabowo Already Eyes Se...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus Four months into his presidency, Indonesian leader Prabowo Subianto has already secured his party’s nomination for re-election, but analysts say the move is premature because of his untested leadership amid pressing economic challenges. While the announcement at the Gerindra party’s 17th anniversary celebration last week signaled confidence in Prabowo’s leadership, experts say it might also be a strategic move to consolidate power and pre-empt potential rivals, including his vice president. 'If his policies work, the people will see him as an effective leader and naturally re-elect him,' Ali Sahab, a political analyst at Airlangga University, told BenarNews. 'But right now, poverty and unemployment are our most pressing challenges. Addressing them requires deep, strategic policies to foster sustainable economic growth.' Indonesia’s poverty rate stood at 9% as of 2024, while unemployment is at 5%, according to government statistics. The coalition that helped Prabowo be elected last year, known as the Advanced Indonesia Coalition Plus, could also shift its allegiances before the next election, Ali said. 'In politics, there are no permanent alliances, only permanent interests,' he said. 'If Prabowo is perceived as underperforming, support could shift elsewhere. On Saturday, Gerindra Secretary-General, Ahmad Muzani announced that a special party congress had reached a unanimous decision to nominate Prabowo again. 'The entire Gerindra Party cadre has requested that we nominate Prabowo Subianto as the presidential candidate for the 2029 general election,' Muzani said. In addition to securing the party’s nomination, Prabowo was reappointed as Gerindra’s chairman and chief patron. Prabowo struck a cautious tone in his speech to the party on Saturday. 'If my programs fail, there is no need to nominate me again,' he said. However, in a move seen as an effort to consolidate his political influence, Prabowo on Friday proposed a 'permanent coalition' among his allies. The Presidential Communications Office declined to comment on the nomination, referring all inquiries to Gerindra. While major coalition parties such as Golkar, the National Awakening Party, the National Mandate Party, and the Democratic Party have voiced support for Prabowo, the National Democratic Party (NasDem) remains undecided. 'It’s too early to discuss this,' the news portal Tempo.co. quoted NasDem executive Willy Aditya as saying. Dominique Nicky Fahrizal, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Gerindra’s confidence in nominating Prabowo again was fueled by strong approval ratings for the new president’s performance in his first 100 days in office. A January survey by Litbang Kompas found that public satisfaction with the Prabowo administration stood at 80.9% – significantly higher than the roughly 60% approval rating former President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo had received early in his first term. Dominique attributed the high approval to Prabowo’s flagship program: free school lunches for students, a populist initiative that has resonated with many Indonesians. 'The free lunch program is a top-of-mind issue for Indonesians,' Dominique said. 'Populist programs tend to generate high approval ratings.' The early nomination also raises questions about Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka’s political future. Gibran, 37, Jokowi’s eldest son, is widely speculated to be a potential presidential contender in the next general election, in 2029. Ali, of Airlangga University, said Prabowo’s decision to accept the nomination might stem from concerns over Gibran’s ambitions. 'This could be Prabowo’s way of pre-empting a challenge from within his own ranks,' he said. Ambang Priyonggo, a political analyst at Multimedia Nusantara University, said that Prabowo’s early bid could also be a political strategy to project stability and commitment. 'This is likely an attempt to quash speculation that Gibran could take over the presidency before 2029,' Ambang told BenarNews. ‘Prabowo is logical choice for Gerindra’ Despite high approval ratings, the new administration has faced criticism for economic management and budgetary inefficiencies. A recent survey by the Center for Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS) that polled 95 experts and journalists gave Prabowo’s government an average performance score of 5 out of 10. Prabowo’s economic policies, including the free school lunch program, have also come under scrutiny. 'The program is proving inefficient in terms of budget allocation and coverage,' Ambang said. 'Reallocating funds to support it has had unintended consequences, creating dissatisfaction among other sectors of the economy,' he said, referring to the president’s controversial austerity measures. Arga Pribadi Imawan, a political analyst at Gadjah Mada University, said Prabowo’s early nomination reflects a broader trend in global politics: the centralization of power around individual candidates rather than political parties. 'In contemporary politics, it is the figurehead who matters, not the party,' Arga told BenarNews. 'Prabowo remains a dominant political figure in Indonesia, while his rivals from the 2024 election have seen their influence wane. This makes Prabowo the logical choice for Gerindra.' Trubus Rahadiansyah, a public policy expert at Trisakti University, said that Prabowo’s nomination also serves as a loyalty test for his ministers. 'This is a way for Prabowo to gauge who among his cabinet members is truly loyal to him,' Trubus told BenarNews. He pointed to recent policies introduced by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Bahlil Lahadalia, such as restrictions on the sale of subsidized liquefied petroleum gas that were later revoked after sparking public outrage. 'That policy benefited businesses more than ordinary citizens,' Trubus said, adding that such controversies could undermine Prabowo’s administration if not addressed properly.

Xi Jinping’s Bureaucracy In 2025: A Critique In The New Political...	Chinese Premiere Xi Jinping remains firmly in control of China's political landscape, with no visible plan for succession, barring extreme events like a lost war or economic collapse. Most opposition has fled the country, as fear prevents any serious challenge to his rule. Xi's firm control over the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is unprecedented in modern China, especially after abolishing presidential term limits in 2018. His lack of a clear successor suggests an intent to rule indefinitely, which may ensure stability in the short term but creates uncertainty for the future. Historically, authoritarian regimes without succession plans often face power struggles when the leader eventually leaves. The absence of a designated heir could lead to internal conflicts within the CCP when Xi is no longer in power. The only possible threat to his authority could emerge from within the security apparatus if internal disagreements become public. Furthermore, his grip on power is not static; it is continuously reinforced through persistent anti-corruption efforts and Party rectification campaigns. In other words, Xi Jinping's entrenched control over China's political system and the mechanisms he employs to maintain power is prominent since he started up until now (2025). Political Variables: Controlled and Not The lack of a clear successor suggests that Xi intends to rule indefinitely, breaking with the leadership norms established after Mao Zedong's era. This raises concerns about political stability in the long term, as the absence of a transition plan increases the risk of a power struggle when he eventually leaves office. Also, it means a weakness of political opposition that emphasizes that opposition within China has largely disappeared, with dissenters either forced into exile or silenced through political repression. This suggests a highly controlled political environment where resistance is ineffective. While this strengthens Xi's immediate grip on power, it does not necessarily eliminate discontent rather, it forces opposition underground. If economic hardships or political scandals arise, suppressed grievances could resurface, potentially destabilizing the regime. Meaning, it that discontent is potentially creating instability in the future. Meanwhile, there are potential internal challenges within his political fence. Although Xi appears unchallenged, the mention of the security apparatus as a possible source of opposition is significant. Security forces[1] are crucial to maintaining authoritarian rule, and if internal divisions emerge, they could pose a serious threat to his leadership. Thus, if divisions emerge within China's security forces whether due to policy disagreements, economic struggles, or leadership disputes Xi's position could be at risk. While there is no clear indication of this happening, it suggests that control over the military and intelligence agencies remains a key factor in his rule. To wit, in authoritarian regimes, the military and intelligence agencies are often the key enforcers of the leader's rule, but they can also become sources of internal opposition. However, so far, he has maintained tight control over the military and state security agencies through purges and loyalty tests. There is also a role of anti-corruption and party rectification campaigns in Xi's bureaucracy and leadership. Rather than merely consolidating power in a passive way, Xi actively reinforces his authority through continuous anti-corruption drives and ideological campaigns. These serve two purposes: eliminating political rivals and maintaining loyalty within the Communist Party. While these measures strengthen his rule, such campaigns may also create resentment among officials who fear they could become targets, potentially fostering hidden opposition. If discontent grows within the party, it could lead to hidden opposition or even factional struggles. Aging Political Leadership The top leadership has been tilted in Xi Jinping's favor. But, as previously noted, this top leadership is also aging. An aging leadership also means that many of Xi's key supporters may retire or pass away, potentially opening room for new political dynamics that he may not fully control. In 2027, the current Politburo will have an average age above sixty-eight (68). Should they be renominated then, the average age of Politburo members would be above seventy-three on the eve of the next Party Congress and Current Central Committee members are not far behind. Their time horizon will become shorter, and as long as no potential successor appears to have been groomed, their political position will become increasingly vulnerable. Again, a defining feature of Xi's leadership is the lack of a designated successor, breaking from previous CCP norms that aimed to ensure stability through planned transitions. Without a clear heir, uncertainty will grow among the party elite, increasing the risk of political maneuvering or factional struggles as different groups seek to position themselves for leadership roles. This uncertainty could weaken Xi's grip on power over time, especially as leaders begin to consider their own political futures beyond his rule. As the current leadership ages and their career time horizons shrink, their incentives may shift. Rather than unwavering loyalty to Xi, some officials might begin looking for alternative paths to secure their personal or factional interests. If no successor emerges, competition among different factions could intensify, creating a fragile political environment. Additionally, older officials may become less effective in governance, potentially exacerbating policy stagnation or mismanagement, further weakening the regime's overall stability. Unless Xi Jinping changes his basic formula to ensure support and discourage any line debate, his power will become brittle, and the likelihood of a succession crisis will increase. His leadership strategy is either by grooming a successor or adjusting his approach to elite management. While his current control appears strong, the absence of institutionalized succession mechanisms makes a future power struggle more likely. Historically, power vacuums in authoritarian regimes often lead to internal conflicts, and China could face a similar scenario if Xi does not prepare a clear transition plan. There are also nuanced views of Xi Jinping's governance style, highlighting both his consolidation of power and the underlying complexities within China's political and economic landscape. Despite Xi's centralization of power and strong grip on influence, Chinese bureaucracies remain highly fragmented, with institutional silos, rival factions, and competition among individuals. This contradicts the idea of a fully unified authoritarian system, suggesting that power struggles still play a role in policy decisions. From here, tt depicts a complex picture of Xi Jinping's governance, emphasizing the tensions between his centralization of power and the persistent institutional, factional, and economic dynamics within China. Clearly, there is Xi's ability to enforce policy shifts while maintaining ideological rigidity, as well as the role of elite competition in shaping China's future. Additionally, the influence of princelings (descendants of revolutionary leaders) remains significant, particularly in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and financial institutions. While the next leader may not necessarily be a princeling, elite clans could act as key power brokers, determining leadership transitions behind the scenes. At a deeper extent, there is a pattern in Xi's governance since his helm started; initial inflexibility followed by strategic reversals or rigidity then with certain pragmatic adjustments. When policies face resistance or cause unintended consequences, this would be addressed through a 'pullback pattern' or 'rear-view mirror approach' that are evident in key crises, including: The COVID-19 lockdowns, which persisted rigidly until a sudden reversal in late 2022. The 2015 stock market crisis, where interventionist policies failed to stabilize financial markets. The 2020 real estate crash, in which Xi initially rejected bailouts but later allowed targeted financial support. The U.S.-China trade war, where initial confrontational policies eventually gave way to selective economic adjustments; even up to the first quarter of 2025. This suggests that Xi is a risk-taker but not reckless. Meaning, he is willing to implement bold policies but is also pragmatic enough to change course when necessary. However, these reversals are often framed in a way that protects his authority, shifting blame onto subordinates or external factors. Xi's political capital plays in a 'selective policy flexibility versus ideological rigidity'. While Xi has shown pragmatism in adjusting economic policies, his core ideological agenda remains unchanged. His governance remains centered around: Reinforcing ideology, particularly through slogans and propaganda that elevate his personal authority. Promoting 'struggle' (斗争), which can mean striving for progress but also preparing for external conflicts or internal challenges. Maintaining a strong international posture, with an ever-present possibility of major geopolitical confrontations. Even in areas where Xi has shown flexibility such as real estate bailouts or fiscal stimulus, these shifts are constrained by his broader ideological commitments. This balancing act ensures that economic policies remain adaptable without undermining his centralized control. At the backdrop of this, Xi Jinping has been deepening policies that pre-existed his rule. A look at history indeed reveals an affinity with the Self-Strengthening Movement of the Qing empire, summed up by the famous maxim: 'Chinese learning as the essence, Western learning for practical use' (中学为体, 西学为用). Republican China sought help from Germany to modernize its arms industry and sent students on scholarships to the United States. The best-known case is that of the rocket scientist Qian Xuesen who, after leaving the United States in 1955, led China's ballistic development, and whose influence stretches to this day. After the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty was the basis for what has been called the largest technology transfer in history. Much of this focused-on industry and infrastructure, but it also involved education and the training of scientists, including in the nuclear field. The Sino-Soviet rift inaugurated a period of closure, but Mao Zedong nonetheless launched several 'big projects' during the Great Leap Forward. They are recalled nowadays to justify the present large-scale policies. At the end of the Cultural Revolution, 'Zhou Enlai, followed by Deng Xiaoping', hailed the 'four modernizations' (四个现代化) that put the accent on big science again. Since the early 1960s, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has never ceased from engaging in research and development on new weapons, serving as a harbor for scientists in times of political turmoil or during more recent anti-corruption campaigns. A chief aim of China's normalization with the United States was to acquire key technologies. From former US Presidents Richard Nixon to Jimmy Carter's presidency, which was the heyday of the US convergence with China against the Soviet Union, supercomputers (supposedly for climate predictions), nuclear knowledge, radar installations, and many other dual use technologies were shared. Large contingents of Chinese students underwent education and training abroad, mainly in the United States. Successively, we can observe that Xi's foreign policy adaptations are evident with strategic pauses. There is a pattern of assertiveness followed by recalibration. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), once a cornerstone of China's global strategy, has seen a decline in outward investments and loans, possibly due to economic slowdowns and concerns over debt sustainability. Additionally, in response to changing global dynamics, particularly under a potential Trump second presidency (2024–2028), China appears to be cautiously reassessing its relationships with key nations, including India, Japan, and the UK. This suggests that while Xi projects strength internationally, he is also willing to adjust diplomatic strategies to navigate shifting geopolitical realities. Implication and Conclusion Per its implication, while Xi's control appears secure for now, the long-term consequences of his rule remain uncertain. The suppression of opposition, lack of a succession plan, and reliance on internal purges could make the political system more fragile over time. If economic challenges or elite divisions intensify, his grip on power may face unexpected tests. Xi's leadership is characterized by strong, centralized control, but his dominance is not necessarily permanent. His reliance on security forces, ideological campaigns, and repression keeps him in power, yet these same factors could generate internal tensions. Whether his rule remains stable or faces future challenges depends on how well he navigates potential economic, political, and internal security risks. While Xi Jinping maintains firm control over the CCP, the aging leadership and the absence of a succession plan introduce long-term vulnerabilities. If these issues remain unaddressed, they could lead to political uncertainty, elite fragmentation, and a potential succession crisis. Xi's ability to navigate these challenges will determine the long-term stability of his rule and the CCP's future. Xi Jinping's leadership is characterized by a mix of ideological rigidity and strategic pragmatism. While he has consolidated power, elite competition, bureaucratic infighting, and security apparatus tensions remain underlying factors in China's political landscape. His policy approach follows a recognizable pattern: firm initial positions, followed by controlled reversals, when necessary, which helps him maintain authority while adapting to challenges. However, as China faces economic pressures, elite struggles, and an evolving international environment, the long-term sustainability of this governance model remains uncertain. *Ideas and/or views expressed here are entirely independent and not in any form represent author's organization and affiliation.

Sacrificing Truth On Leviathan’s Altar – OpEd	Last Sunday, 60 Minutes featured tyrannical German prosecutors boasting about persecuting private citizens who made comments that officialdom disapproved. Three prosecutors explained how the government was entitled to launch pre-dawn raids and lock up individuals who criticized politicians, complained about immigrant crime waves, or otherwise crossed the latest revised boundary lines of acceptable thoughts. In a craven slant that would have cheered any mid-twentieth century European dictator, 60 Minutes glorified the crackdown: 'Germany is trying to bring some civility to the world wide web by policing it in a way most Americans could never imagine in an effort to protect discourse.' Nothing 'protects discourse' like a jackboot kick aside the head of someone who insulted a German politician on Facebook, right? Mocking German leaders is punished like heresy was punished 500 years ago—though no one has been publicly torched yet. Do the priggish German prosecutors realize that they are the latest incarnation of nineteenth-century German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel? Hegel declared: 'Men are as foolish as to forget, in their enthusiasm for liberty of conscience and political freedom, the truth which lies in power.' Hegel bluntly equated government and truth: 'For Truth is the Unity of the universal and subjective Will; and the Universal is to be found in the State, in its laws, its universal and rational arrangements.' Hegel probably did more to propel modern totalitarianism than perhaps any other philosopher. Unfortunately, many Americans favor the US government becoming a Ministry of Truth like the German government. Fifty-five percent of American adults support government suppression of 'false information,' according to a 2023 poll. But other polls show that only 20 percent trust the government to do the right thing most of the time. So why would people trust dishonest officials to forcibly eradicate 'false information'? Did some people skip logic class, or what? A September 2023 poll revealed that almost half of Democrats believed that free speech should be legal 'only under certain circumstances'—perhaps only when a rascally Republican is president? Hegelian notions of 'Government = Truth' propelled censorship here in recent years. Three years ago, Americans learned they lived under a Disinformation Governance Board with a ditzy Disinformation Czar who boasted of graduating from Bryn Mawr University. A public backlash led to the board’s termination but federal censors quickly and secretly resumed their sway over the internet. Though American censors rarely invoke Hegel, their schemes tacitly presume that political power is divine, if not in origin, at least in its effect. The Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), created in 2018, has relied on 'censorship by surrogate,' subcontracting the destruction of freedom. CISA partnered with federal grantees to form the Election Integrity Partnership a hundred days before the 2020 presidential election. That project, along with the efforts of other federal agencies, created an 'unrelenting pressure' with 'the intended result of suppressing millions of protected free speech postings by American citizens,' according to a 2023 ruling by Federal Judge Terry Doughty. What standard did CISA use to determine whether Americans should be muzzled? CISA settled controversies by contacting government employees and 'apparently always assumed the government official was a reliable source,' Judge Doughty noted. Any assertion by officialdom could suffice to justify suppression of comments or posts by private citizens. But when did government I.D. badges become the Oracle of Delphi? During the 2020 presidential election campaign, CISA established a 'Rumor Control' webpage to deal with threats to the election—including rumors that the feds were censoring Americans. CISA targeted for suppression assertions by Americans such as 'mail-in voting is insecure'—despite the long history of absentee ballot fraud. Biden won the presidency in part thanks to Democrats exploiting the covid pandemic to open the floodgates to unverified mail-in ballots. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) declared, 'Twitter was basically an FBI subsidiary before Elon Musk took it over.' Censors act as if truth and lies are both self-evident. But as an investigative journalist hounding federal agencies, I have seen how government minimizes disclosures of its outrageous conduct. On April 19, 1993, 80 people died in a massive fire during an FBI tank assault on the home of the Branch Davidians. On that day, the FBI was adamant that they had nothing to do with the fire and also claimed to possess audiotapes proving the Davidians intentionally committed mass suicide. They never disclosed that proof. But anyone who suggested that the FBI was connected to the fatal fire was derided as an anti-government nut case, if not a public menace. A Los Angeles Times book reviewer practically blamed my criticism of the feds on Waco and other cases for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. But year by year, the FBI’s Waco storyline fell apart. Six years after the fire, a private investigator found proof that the FBI fired pyrotechnic grenades at the Davidians’ home before the fire, obliterating the FBI cover-up. The same pattern of delayed disclosures or leaks annihilated the US government’s credibility on the epidemic of Gulf War syndrome cases in the 1990s, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the glorious triumph for democracy and women’s rights after the US invaded Afghanistan. The 'trickle down' version of truth was also stark in the notorious Duke Lacrosse case. With his persistent, savvy analysis and investigations, Mises editor Bill Anderson heroically helped vanquish a media and prosecutorial lynch mob. Unfortunately, in Germany, and at least sporadically in the United States, 'truth' is whatever the government proclaims. 'Disinformation' is whatever contradicts the latest government pronouncements. It is irrelevant how many false statements politicians or bureaucrats make. Government retains a monopoly on truth and on the right to deceive. Recent censorship schemes vivify how democracy is being turned into a parody: voters choose politicians who then dictate what citizens are permitted to think and say. Censors destroy freedom of thought as well as freedom of speech. Censorship seeks to force each person to live in mental isolation, with no sparks for their thoughts from fellow citizens. Shortly before Hegel’s rise to prominence, German philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote, 'The external power that deprives man of the freedom to communicate his thoughts publicly, deprives him at the same time of his freedom to think.' By barricading individuals from each other, censors create millions of intellectual Robinson Crusoes, stranded on islands and trying to figure out everything for themselves. Prohibiting citizens from sharing facts of government abuses spawns a bastardized form of sovereign immunity. It minimizes opposition to political power grabs—often until it is too late to resist. Other European nations are as bad or worse than Germany. Britain is notorious for raiding the homes and arresting anyone who makes allegations about immigrants and crime. According to Irish Senator Pauline O’Reilly, government must 'restrict freedoms for the common good' when 'a person’s views on other people’s identities' makes them 'insecure.' Can I demand that government censor anyone who makes me insecure about my identity by mocking my vintage railroad engineer cap? By vastly expanding the definition of 'hate speech,' politicians justify suppressing any views they disapprove. Faith in officialdom to decree truth and punish error exemplifies growing political illiteracy. In earlier eras, Americans were renowned for heartily disdaining politicians who rose to power by making endless bogus promises. Why would any prudent person expect bureaucrats to deliver 'the truth, and nothing but the truth' like FEMA officials coming to the rescue after a flood? If the government can’t be trusted for reliable mail delivery, why in Hades would anyone trust government to judge and safeguard any thoughts citizens choose to share? Do people honestly expect that turning politicians into censors will evoke their inner sainthood? How can freedom of speech or any other freedom survive if so many people fall for so much BS from Washington?

How Hobbies Can Save Us From Over-Specialization – OpEd	By Peter Jacobsen As we roll through the middle of February, we’re getting to the point of the year where most people start to abandon their New Year’s resolutions. According to research by Dr. Michelle Rozen, 94% of people fail their resolutions within two months. However, this doesn’t mean resolutions are a bad thing. New Year’s resolutions make good economic sense. People want to improve, but monitoring whether you’ve actually improved in something is costly. As such, using the beginning (and end) of a year as a benchmark provides a low-cost way of ensuring self-monitoring. Maybe many fail, but New Year’s provides a good place to start either way. For many, New Year’s resolutions involve reading more or losing weight. However, I’m noticing an increasing number of people centering their resolutions around hobbies. New Year’s resolutions and hobbies often go hand in hand. Among my friend group, people are pursuing resolutions of improving woodworking skills, learning how to work with glass, and honing jiu-jitsu skills. Recent Pew Research data suggests that, of the people who make resolutions, 55% make resolutions about hobbies. I see hobby-culture as an important part of our increasingly specialized society. While specialization has obvious upsides, we can also find clear downsides to the tendency. Hobbies act as a perfect hedge against the downsides of specialization. The Benefits of Specialization and Why It Matters Specialization as an idea comes at the very beginning of economics as a science. In Adam Smith’s book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, he introduces the idea of a factory that manufactures pins. He argues that if each person learns to make a small part (1/10th) of a pin, they will be much more productive: Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day. Economists have recognized two reasons why specialization improves productivity. Armen Alchian and William Allen present these two arguments in their textbook Universal Economics. The first reason specialization improves productivity is that some producers naturally have a lower production cost. As such, specialization allows individuals to produce that which is the lowest cost for them. For example, a farmer in the US does not have an adequate climate to produce coffee for as low of a cost as a farmer in Honduras. Likewise, the Honduran farmers would have to sacrifice acres perfect for coffee growth in order to grow corn. To remedy these issues, the US farmer can specialize in corn while the Honduran farmer can specialize in coffee, and then the two can trade. The second source of the gains from specialization comes from learning by doing. People improve at just about any action via repetition. The same is true of production. If a tailor is responsible for producing all kinds of clothes, he will have relatively limited time to learn how to produce suit jackets well. If, instead, he only produces suit jackets, it seems reasonable to think this specialization will improve his skills. These benefits of specialization have made it commonplace in the modern world. Whereas historically everyone needed to know how to grow crops, mend clothes, chop down trees, and hunt for food, nowadays most people outsource these roles to experts who specialize in them. It’s unlikely that our society could have risen to its current heights of wealth without specialization. Hobbies: The Antidote to Over-Specialization Libertarian author Robert Heinlein provides a different perspective on specialization in his book Time Enough for Love: A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. What are we to make of Heinlein’s quote here—does this undermine the importance of specialization in society? I don’t think so. Nowhere does this quote imply that specialized jobs are without benefits. Rather, Heinlein appears to be arguing that people should be well-rounded regardless of their careers. Heinlein is saying that every man should be a Renaissance Man. So how can someone whose job it is to program computers learn how to design a building, write a sonnet, or build a wall? Put simply, many of the activities Heinlein lists above are hobbies. Admittedly, some of the things on the above list extend beyond the realm of hobbies (I don’t know any amateur bone-setters), but many people learn these things today through their own interests. One of the benefits of hobbies, then, is that they insure us against the biggest downside of specialization: fragility. If everyone only knows how to do the work associated with his or her own station, what happens if someone doesn’t show up to his station? The whole production process gets stalled. Imagine, for example, if delivery trucks stopped coming to your local grocery store. How would you get food? Likely, many people don’t have a good answer to this question. Those who have taken up hunting or forestry as a hobby likely do have a good answer because they’ve achieved diversification through hobbies. This is an extreme example, to be sure, but it is representative of the downside of specialization and the attendant upside of hobbies. We can imagine a milder example (one that is personally relatable). Let’s say a winter storm strikes and all your local auto repair shops are backed up. The snow causes something on the bottom of your car to become dislodged, and it occasionally scrapes on the pavement. Maybe, once upon a time in history, car owners would know the necessary information to diagnose the problem themselves. However, in the era of specialization, you are used to taking your car to a specialist. What’s the remedy here? Well, you could wait several weeks for an auto repair shop, or you could call on a friend who is a car hobbyist. Your friend might not be a professional, but his experience might be enough to make up for your ignorance. At least that’s how it worked out for me, and this example shows exactly how hobbies build resilience. So if you’re not sure what to do for a resolution this year, get yourself a hobby. Heinlein’s list provides a pretty good idea of where to start. About the author: Peter Jacobsen is a Writing Fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education.

The Deep State Wins Again: All The Ways ‘We The People’ Keep Losi...	Almost one month into the Trump presidency, and the Constitution and the entire section on the various branches of government and how they work together are still missing from the White House website. This is no small thing. This omission, deliberate or inadvertent, speaks volumes about the priorities of this current administration. It also explains a lot about the legal mindset that is driving the Trump train, which continues to push forward with a theory of unitary executive power. You know what is not driving the Trump government? Any sense that it is bound by the rule of law, i.e, the U.S. Constitution. As Trump recently declared, 'He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.' Then again, Trump has never made any pretense of his aspirations to rule as a strongman. As the Washington Post reports: In 2017, he claimed 'an absolute right to do what I want with the Justice Department.' In 2019, he claimed that Article II of the Constitution gave him 'the right to do whatever I want as president.' In 2020, he said he could override state and local public health orders related to the coronavirus pandemic by saying: 'When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total. And that’s the way it’s got to be. It’s total.' In 2022, he said that purported voter fraud in the 2020 election 'allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.' In 2023, he mused that he would be a dictator, but only on Day One of his presidency. And a year ago, he argued that presidents should have total immunity from criminal prosecution, even for 'EVENTS THAT ‘CROSS THE LINE.’ ' Listen, when someone shows you who they are, believe them. Then again, maybe the majority of Americans just don’t care about the Constitution anymore. Maybe, as journalist Zeynep Tufekci suggests, Americans want an authoritarian leader who embraces an 'ends-justify-the-means leadership style.' Maybe all they care about are the 'endless wins' that the Trump administration never ceases to claim for itself, but if we’re being brutally honest about the state of the country, 'we the people' are on a solid losing streak. While the team colors and the police state’s outward allegiances may have changed, from a constitutional perspective, we’re still losing in all the ways that matter, and the Deep State is still winning. Indeed, far from protecting our freedoms, the Trump administration is taking the Deep State’s unconstitutional disregard for civil liberties to new extremes. When you step away from the polarizing rhetoric and government spin long enough to look at the many ways in which the American police state is continuing to lockdown our freedoms, you’ll notice that not much has changed for the better. Has the Trump administration put an end to the police state’s use of surveillance on the American people? Has it scaled back the deployment of military forces domestically in violation of Posse Comitatus? Has it ceased the government’s war on cash? Has it stepped back from the NDAA’s threat of indefinite detentions? Has it de-militarized the police? Has it kicked the oligarchs out of the government’s inner circle? Has it been transparent and accountable in all of its dealings? The answer to all of those questions is a resounding 'no.' Rather than minimizing the power of the police state, the Trump administration appears to be doubling down on its commitment to police state tactics of fear, intimidation and brutality. Consider for yourselves. Free speech is still being undermined. The First Amendment prohibits the government from suppressing free speech activities by the public, the media, protesters, religious individuals, or by restricting the right of the people to assemble and associate with one another, yet we no longer have any real freedom of speech. We are moving fast down a slippery slope to an authoritarian society in which the only opinions, ideas and speech expressed are the ones permitted by the government and its corporate cohorts. In more and more cases, the government is declaring war on what should be protected political speech whenever it challenges the government’s power, reveals the government’s corruption, exposes the government’s lies, and encourages the citizenry to push back against the government’s many injustices. The ramifications are so far-reaching as to render almost every American who criticizes the government an extremist in word, deed, thought or by association. Although President Trump issued an executive order denouncing government censorship, primarily for speech with which he agrees, his administration has ostensibly engaged in a campaign of intimidation and coercion against news organizations that dare to disagree with or criticize his administration, as well as whistleblowers. Likewise, under the guise of fighting politically correct DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policies and cancel culture, the Trump administration is engaging in its own campaign to cancel out expressive activities and content of which it disapproves, including anti-war protests. We’re still being subjected to expansive surveillance. All of the monitoring tools and weapons in the government’s surveillance arsenal that are being used to identify, track and target those on the Trump’s administration’s enemies list—facial recognition, biometrics, license plate readers, fusion centers, cell phone location tracking, etc.—can and will be used against the American people. AI surveillance harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and widespread surveillance technology to do what the police state lacks the manpower and resources to do efficiently or effectively: be everywhere, watch everyone and everything, monitor, identify, catalogue, cross-check, cross-reference, and collude. Everything that was once private is now up for grabs to the right buyer. With every new AI surveillance technology that is adopted and deployed without any regard for privacy, Fourth Amendment rights and due process, the rights of the citizenry are being marginalized, undermined and eviscerated. The government’s police powers are still being weaponized. With Trump claiming the power to target anyone or any group he perceives as a 'threat,' i.e., an 'enemy from within,' anyone who disagrees with the government could be placed on a government watch list. Having transformed local law enforcement into extensions of the military, the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the FBI are turning the nation’s police officers into techno-warriors, complete with iris scanners, body scanners, thermal imaging Doppler radar devices, facial recognition programs, license plate readers, cell phone extraction software, Stingray devices and so much more. Government whistleblowers are still being persecuted. While claiming to be rooting out inefficiency, the Trump administration has been methodically dismantling all of the agencies charged with acting as nonpartisan watchdogs of government corruption. Americans are still being treated as suspects. The groundwork has been laid for a new kind of government where it won’t matter if you’re innocent or guilty, whether you’re a threat to the nation, or even if you’re a citizen. What will matter is what the government—or whoever happens to be calling the shots at the time—thinks. And if the powers-that-be think you’re a threat to the nation and should be locked up, then you’ll be locked up with no access to the protections our Constitution provides. Having launched a precrime programduring his first administration, the Trump administration would have no qualms about using AI predictive and surveillance technologies to classify, segregate and flag the populace. We’re still unofficially under martial law. We have what the founders feared most: a 'standing' or permanent army on American soil. This de facto standing army is made up of weaponized, militarized domestic police forces which look like, dress like, and act like the military; are armed with guns, ammunition and military-style equipment; are authorized to make arrests; and are trained in military tactics. With Trump having pledged to deploy the military domestically to work in conjunction with local police to address domestic threats, including political enemies, dissenters and immigrants, the American homeland is increasingly being transformed into a battlefield. We’re still being flagged based on our viewpoints, activities and associations. The government has a growing list—shared with fusion centers and law enforcement agencies—of ideologies, behaviors, affiliations and other characteristics that could flag someone as suspicious and result in their being labeled potential enemies of the state. Before long, every household in America will be flagged as a threat and assigned a threat score. It’s just a matter of time before you find yourself wrongly accused, investigated and confronted by police based on a data-driven algorithm or risk assessment culled together by a computer program run by artificial intelligence. Police shootings of unarmed citizens will continue. In the wake of Trump’s decision to reverse and revoke many of the policies intended to implement police reform and discourage police misconduct and stem the time of police brutality, we can expect the use of excessive force by police to continue unabated. We still don’t have a government of the people, by the people and for the people. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called 'economic elite.' Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. In other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism—a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. We still have an imperial president. Although President Trump has made no secret of his authoritarian impulses, he is not the first president to rule by fiat through the use of executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements. These unchecked powers enable all sitting president to operate above the law and beyond the reach of the Constitution. In other words, the seeds of chaos are still being sown, and it’s the U.S. government that will reap the harvest. My friends, if this is winning, I can’t imagine what losing will look like, but it won’t be pretty. All of this dismantling of government agencies, weakening of the economy, and fomenting of civil unrest feeds right back into the Deep State’s plot to destabilize the nation. Remember that Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command which anticipated that all hell would break loose by 2030? That’s barely five short years away now, but we’re being moved steadily in that direction. According to 'Megacities: Urban Future, the Emerging Complexity,' the U.S. military plans to use armed forces to solve future domestic political and social problems. What they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security. The training video is only five minutes long, but it says a lot about the government’s mindset, the way its views the citizenry, and the so-called 'problems' that the government must be prepared to address in the near future through the use of martial law. Even more troubling, however, is what this military video doesn’t say about the Constitution, about the rights of the citizenry, and about the dangers of locking down the nation and using the military to address political and social problems. Be warned: in the future envisioned by the government, we will not be viewed as Republicans or Democrats. Rather, 'we the people' will be enemies of the state. For years, the government has been warning against the dangers of domestic terrorism, erecting surveillance systems to monitor its own citizens, creating classification systems to label any viewpoints that challenge the status quo as extremist, and training law enforcement agencies to equate anyone possessing anti-government views as a domestic terrorist. What the government failed to explain was that the domestic terrorists would be of the government’s own making, and that 'we the people' would become enemy #1. We’re already enemies of the state. You want to bring about real change? Start by wresting back control of our government from the oligarchs, technocrats and Deep State operatives who are still running the show. Reject the propaganda and the polarizing rhetoric and the 'us vs. them' tactics that reduce the mass power of the populace to warring, powerless factions. Find common ground with your fellow citizens and push back against the government’s brutality, inhumanity, greed, corruption and power grabs. Be dangerous in the best way possible: by thinking for yourself, by refusing to be silenced, by choosing sensible solutions over political expediency and bureaucracy. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, the solution to what ails this country is really not that complicated: decency, compassion, common sense, generosity balanced by fiscal responsibility, fairness, a commitment to freedom principles, and a firm rejection of the craven, partisan politics of the Beltway elites who have laid the groundwork for the Deep State’s ongoing authoritarian coup d’etat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfXeQON14vdX7ZbZUArG_AE	2025-02-19T16:39:34-08:00	
The Trump-Musk Cultural Revolution – OpEd	The aging leader wanted to shake up his country, so he launched a second revolution with the help of a cadre of young people. Drunk with power, the leader targeted his enemies, remade his political party, and turned his own government into a self-destructing circus. Anyone with real expertise was sent far away from the political center. Intellectuals of all kinds came under suspicion. And the young people who rose up in support of the aging leader ran roughshod through society. They might not seem to have a lot in common, Mao Zedong and Donald Trump. The Communist leader, having come to power through a revolutionary war, harbored a visceral hatred for capitalism. The American businessman shirked military service, won the presidency (twice) through democratic elections, and harbors a visceral hatred for communism. And yet, Trump is currently involved in a cultural revolution as thoroughgoing in its ambitions and potential destructiveness as what Mao unleashed in China in the mid-1960s. You Say You Want a Revolution? At one level, what Donald Trump and his minions are doing is regime change, as Anne Applebaum has argued. They aren’t reforming U.S. government. They are transforming its operating system, courtesy of Elon Musk and his inaptly named Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Regime change is certainly part of the Trump game plan. He has borrowed this strategy from Viktor Orban, who turned Hungary’s political system based on liberal principles into a patronage system run along illiberal lines. The Orban transformation relied on a compliant legislature that allowed him to concentrate power in the executive. Once a leading liberal, the Hungarian leader knew how to deconstruct the Hungarian political system from the inside by stacking the courts, suppressing civil society, and controlling a right-wing media. You’d think that regime change would be enough for Trump. He is a man of unpredictable utterances but rather constrained ambitions. He wants to punish his enemies, reward his friends, stay out of jail, and secure his financial and political legacy. Those around Trump, however, are pushing for something more extreme. They have cast him in the role of the Great Helmsman—Mao’s favorite moniker—who steers American society into turbulent, uncharted waters. Team MAGA wants a 'second American Revolution' that roots out all vestiges of progressivism, liberalism, and secularism and that 'will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,' according to Kevin Roberts of the Heritage Foundation. By 'left,' Roberts means anyone who follows the Constitution, acknowledges the importance of international law, and has a moral conscience. This more revolutionary program owes much to Chairman Mao who, in 1966, decided that Chinese society was so infected with various strains of reformism (capitalism, liberalism, traditionalism) that it, too, needed another revolution. On top of that, Mao unleashed the power of populism—the 'masses' in the vernacular of that time and place—to eliminate his political enemies. 'It was a power struggle waged… behind the smokescreen of a fictitious mass movement,' writes Belgian scholar Pierre Ryckmans. In the 1950s, after the country’s first revolution, Chinese society remained fundamentally conservative. The economy was primarily agrarian and Confucianism was still strong, particularly in the countryside. China was also elitist, with a Communist leader like Zhou Enlai born into the mandarin class and Mao himself coming from wealthy landowning stock. The Communists didn’t just aspire to change China’s governance. They wanted to turn Chinese society into something considerably more urban, industrial, secular, literate, and egalitarian. The change would be violent, if necessary, because Mao believed that 'revolution was not a dinner party' (one wonders if Kevin Roberts has a copy of the Little Red Book on his bedside table). At first, Mao relied on the Party and its repressive institutions to effect change. By the mid-1950s, he launched an effort at reform, the Thousand Flowers Campaign, that spiraled out of the Party’s control, which generated the backlash of the Anti-Rightist Campaign. That was, in turn, followed by the disastrous economic experiments of the Great Leap Forward. These whiplash changes in policy created considerable anxiety among the Chinese leadership that the Party, and the revolution more generally, was losing its hold over the population, which understandably didn’t know where to turn. Mao ultimately decided that only another revolution could break the country’s ties with its past. The agents of Mao’s Cultural Revolution were the Red Guards, teenagers who heeded Mao’s call for transformation by taking the law into their own hands. They attacked capitalist-roaders, 'bourgeois' teachers, and ultimately each other. Chinese society descended into such chaos that some people even fled over the border into North Korea, which was seen as a place of relative sanity. That’s how violent, unpredictable, and apocalyptic China was during the Cultural Revolution, which lasted nearly a decade until Mao’s death in 1976. Trumpists have their counterpart to Mao’s desire for revolutionary transformation: a plan to destroy everything in the federal government except the royal presidency and the Pentagon, and privatize everything in the country that has a tinge of the public to it. The Trumpian equivalents of the Red Guards are a motley crew. There’s 'Big Balls,' 19-year-old Edward Coristine, a DOGE-employed hacker who, among other questionable ventures, administers 'an AI-powered Discord bot operating in Russia.' Then there’s 25-year-old Marco Elez, a DOGE staffer who resigned after the revelation of his racist tweets (but whom Musk has promised to rehire). The parallel with China is not precise, since there are plenty of non-teenagers who are involved in this insurrection, including the middle-aged January 6 rioter Peter Marocco, who is slated to head up USAID. Whatever their age, however, these Trumpists are true believers, enthusiastically feeding democracy into the woodchipper. Mao, of course, wanted to pull China into a modern future. Trump and company promise something more high-tech, but they are really more interested in dragging the United States back to an imagined past. Why Trumpians Take Culture Seriously The Trump administration’s attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are not just a response to some recent fad. They are, as in China, an effort to radically revamp the very culture. Since the 1960s, the United States has become a more inclusive country, which has necessarily meant that white men have lost some part of their privileged positions in education, employment, and entertainment. By the 2000s, the United States still had a long way to go, but in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, anti-racism books were on the best-seller list, major corporations were examining their hiring and promoting policies, and educational institutions were finally beginning to address structural racism. Cultural transformations always move two steps forward and one step backward. In this case, the backlash has been much more intense, with Trump and company eager to rewind the clock to before the various civil rights movements, back even before the Fourteenth Amendment that added birthright citizenship to the Constitution in 1868. The Trump administration has tried to impose gender categories that define the trans community out of existence. It is restricting abortion access at home and abroad, fulfilling the candidate’s promise to help women 'whether they like it or not.' In the same way that Mao tried to make everything in China public—business, meals, child-rearing—Trump wants to privatize everything from schools to the post office. He is opening up government to conservative Christians, and religious institutions are poised to claw back as much public power as they can get. Mao thought that he was pushing with history’s tide. China’s current capitalist trajectory suggests otherwise, even though the regime change implemented by the Communist Party has remained more or less intact. The Party remains in charge, but the culture shows few enduring influences of the Cultural Revolution. With far-right politicians on the rise around the world, Trump and Musk similarly believe that they are on the cutting edge of change. But mass deportations and boosted birthrates among 'tradwives' won’t prevent America from losing its white-majority status in about 20 years. DEI is no fad. It is an accurate reflection of demographics. And short of imposing totalitarian control and setting up concentration camps, the MAGA crowd won’t be able to alter this trajectory. Welcome Back to 2025 This is not the first time I’ve written about the parallels between Trump and Mao’s Cultural Revolution. In 2022, safely ensconced in the Biden era but plagued by nightmares of the future, I wrote an article entitled 'The Terrifying World of 2025' for TomDispatch. It was/is a world of mass deportations, where 'Social Security checks and Medicare benefits have been delayed because the federal bureaucracy has shrunk to near invisibility.' Here was my look into the future, which is now our present: On his first day in office, the president signaled his new policy by authorizing a memorial on the Capitol grounds to the 'patriots' of January 6th and commissioning a statue of the QAnon shaman for the Rotunda. He then appointed people to his cabinet who not only lacked the expertise to manage their departments but were singularly devoted to destroying the bureaucracies beneath them, not to speak of the country itself. He put militia leaders in key Defense Department roles and similarly filled the courts with extremists more suited to playing reality-show judges than real life ones. In all of this, the president has been aided by a new crop of his very own legislators, men and women who know nothing about Congress and actively flouted its rules and traditions even as they made the MAGA caucus the dominant voting bloc. My piece focused on one part of this nightmare scenario—the dispatch of all newly unemployed federal employees, academics, and journalists to take the jobs vacated by deported immigrants. That has yet to take place, but Musk’s acquisition of all federal data could serve as the basis for a MAGA Corps of workers that fill the gaps in the private sector. The Trump team is currently stress-testing U.S. democracy to see where and how it breaks. Perhaps if we can hold the line here, in these opening months of the Trump-Musk cultural revolution, we can avoid all the mayhem and destruction that China experienced in the 1960s. Back in 2022, I was not optimistic in my crystal-ball-gazing: I know this nightmare won’t end overnight. China’s Cultural Revolution stretched on for nearly a decade and resulted in as many as two million dead. Our now-captive media doesn’t report on the growing violence in this country, but we’ve heard rumors about mobs attacking a courageous podcaster in Georgia and vigilantes targeting a lone abortion provider in Texas. Things might get a lot worse before they get better. Things could indeed get a lot worse. The mass deportations haven’t begun in earnest. The courts have hit pause on a number of Trump’s more egregious moves. The worst of the new Cabinet members—Tulsi Gabbard, Pete Hegseth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—have yet to make their marks. But I’d like to believe that Trump and Musk, for all the power they currently deploy, are basically spitting into the wind. But it’s up to us, with every breath we take, to make sure that all that ugly spittle ends up back on the face of MAGA.

Excluded From Talks, Bruised By Trump, Zelenskyy Calls For ‘More ...	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- With the most consequential talks his country has faced in decades proceeding without his country’s involvement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy punched back -- at doubters, at Russia, and, most notably, at U.S. President Donald Trump. At a news conference in Kyiv on February 18, Zelenskyy tried to reclaim a narrative that has been spinning out of his reach this week, as senior U.S. and Russian officials met for the first time since before Russia’s launched its all-out onslaught on Ukraine three years ago. And he sharply criticized the Trump administration – an unusually pointed swipe directed at Kyiv’s biggest supplier of weaponry and military equipment. 'I believe that the United States helped Putin to break out of years of isolation,' Zelenskyy said. 'All of this has no positive impact on Ukraine.' Trump, he charged, is pushing 'a lot of information that is coming from Russia.' Anxiety is spiking in Kyiv – not to mention in many supportive European capitals – as Washington and Moscow moved forward this week to lay the groundwork for a possible peace settlement to end the war. Adding further to the angst: comments, a day earlier, by Trump, who falsely suggested that Ukraine had started the war and, also inaccurately, that Zelenskyy was deeply unpopular among Ukrainians. He also said that a new presidential election should be held. Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy again on February 19, calling him a 'dictator' and suggesting he must agree to a peace deal soon. 'A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Here’s what you need to know-- not only about Zelenskyy’s news conference but what is shaping up to be one of the most trying weeks of his wartime leadership. Zelenskyy: Outside Looking In Zelenskyy had been scheduled to fly to the Saudi capital of Riyadh on February 19 a day after top U.S. and Russian officials met face-to-face to lay the groundwork for peace talks. Those were the first formal high-level talks between Washington and Moscow since before the February 2022 invasion. Despite some assurances, and calls from European leaders, to make sure Ukrainian officials are involved in the negotiations, Ukraine has pointedly been left out – at least this initial stage. Hours after the U.S.-Russian talks wrapped up on February 18, Zelenskyy, on a previously planned trip to Turkey, made clear his position – and his displeasure. 'Decisions on how to end the war in Ukraine cannot be made without Ukraine, nor can any conditions be imposed,' he told reporters. 'We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us, I think for many others as well.' Trump Disses Zelenskyy If the launch of direct U.S.-Russian talks without Ukraine wasn’t disturbing enough for Zelenskyy, Trump’s blistering criticism likely was. 'Today I heard, 'Oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,' Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. 'They had a seat at the table for three years,' Trump said, referring to Ukraine. 'When they are worried about not being seated, they could have made a deal long ago.' 'I like him personally,' he said, referring to Zelenskyy, 'but it is the leadership that allowed the war to go on.' Russia in fact started the all-out war on February 24, 2022, sending tens of thousands of troops across the border after months of military buildup and threats aimed directly at Kyiv. They included ultimatums to shrink its army, commit to neutrality, and recognize Russia-backed forces who had seized power in the part of the eastern Donbas region in 2014 with direct military and other support from Moscow. It wasn’t entirely clear what talks or 'table' Trump was referencing, but there have been no negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow since the first few months after the February 2022 invasion. Those talks produced drafts of a potential deal but petered out late that April, as the sides wrangled over points of dispute after revelations of alleged Russian war crimes emerged in the town of Bucha. In his comments on February 18, Trump also asserted that Zelenskyy was now deeply unpopular, and he suggested that the country must hold elections. 'We have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law…in Ukraine,' Trump said. 'And the leader of Ukraine, I hate to say it, he’s down at 4 percent approval rating. In fact, a poll released earlier this month that compared possible candidates for the presidency found that Zelenskyy’s trust ratings remained in the double digits, though he lagged behind Valeriy Zaluzhniy, the former commander-in-chief who is now ambassador to Britain, and two other public figures. A separate survey released February 19 by the respected Kyiv International Institute for Sociology, showed that Zelenskyy’s trust rating had climbed to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in December. Zelenskyy used his Kyiv news conference to accuse Trump of parroting Russia’s positions on the causes and the conditions of the war. 'As we are talking about 4 percent, we have seen this disinformation, we understand it's coming from Russia,' Zelenskyy told reporters. 'We have evidence that these figures are being discussed between America and Russia,' Zelenskyy said, though he did not describe the evidence. 'Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect for him as the leader of a nation that we respect greatly, is living in this disinformation bubble.' The issue of new elections in Ukraine is complex. The country is indeed under martial law, declared by Zelenskyy shortly after the start of the invasion and prolonged repeatedly since then, which precludes holding voting. Moreover, the logistics of organizing balloting and voting precinct at a time of war – never mind in territories currently occupied by Russia – is near impossible. Russian President Vladimir Putin has used the issue to bash Zelenskyy; on the eve of the Riyadh talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov once again questioned the Ukrainian president’s 'legitimacy.' While Zelenskyy remains broadly popular, as Ukrainians have rallied around a wartime leader, Ukrainians are also exhausted and in some cases frustrated by government decision on issues like manpower. Some prominent political figures, such as former President Petro Poroshenko, have made signals that they might mount a challenge to Zelenskyy if an election were held. Zelenskyy said Trump’s comments parroted the Russian remarks. 'I would like President Trump’s team to have more truth,' Zelenskyy said. Kellogg’s In Town Zelenskiy’s news conference on February 19 came shortly before he was scheduled to meet with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. Kellogg did not attend the Riyadh talks, and it’s unclear how central he will be to Trump’s thinking as negotiations coalesce. However, he has voiced at times a relatively hard line toward Moscow. Arriving at a Kyiv train station, Kellogg said his visit was 'a chance to have some good, substantial talks.' 'We understand the need for security guarantees,' he said. 'It’s very clear to us the importance of the sovereignty of this nation and the independence of this nation as well,' he said. 'Part of my mission is to sit and listen.'

Nenad Nesic: The Rise And Dramatic Fall Of Bosnia’s Former Securi...	By Azem Kurtic Over two decades, Nenad Nesic went from police officer to politician to one of the most powerful cabinet ministers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His relentless rise and growing real estate portfolio were shadowed by allegations of corruption. As a young police officer, Nenad Nesic used to put people behind bars. Now, Bosnia’s former security minister is the one sitting in a cell. In just under two decades, the 46-year-old went from police cadet to the civilian head of Bosnia’s security agencies, while simultaneously amassing an impressive real estate portfolio worth millions of euros. Last year, he claimed never to have taken a bank loan. 'I bought everything legally,' he said. 'With my own earnings. I have a salary, you have all the records, I paid for everything legally through the bank where I receive my salary. I paid for everything without a loan.' The money might not have come from the bank, but prosecutors say it wasn’t from Nesic’s salary either. On December 26, Nesic was arrested on charges of corruption, abuse of office, money laundering and bribe-taking during his tenure as acting director of the public road company in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s predominantly Serb-populated Republika Srpska entity. He resigned in January, on 'moral grounds'. Prosecutors allege Nesic put pressure on road maintenance companies to buy materials from a private company called Legend. Six others were also arrested. Nesic’s Democratic People’s Alliance, DNS party, which he leads, condemned the case against him as 'politically motivated'. DNS senior official Darko Banjac said his arrest was 'part of a broader political pressure campaign against the Serb people'. In his resignation letter, Nesic said that 'I do not acknowledge the commission of the criminal offence for which I am in detention. I will prove my innocence in the court proceedings ahead.' Climb to power According to Nesic’s official biography, he graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Novi Sad in northern Serbia in 2005, becoming a police trainee in East Sarajevo, Bosnia, where he was born. Nesic climbed to the rank of inspector, though there is little available public information on his role or performance during the period up to 2014, when he swapped his police uniform for suit and joined the DNS. Again, he climbed the ladder, first becoming head of the East Sarajevo municipal branch of the party, before finally being elected party leader in 2020. In October 2022, Nesic ran unsuccessfully for the Serb post on Bosnia’s tripartite presidency. When the DNS joined the state-level government, he became security minister, the Bosnian equivalent of interior minister or Britain’s home secretary. Nesic’s appointment was not without controversy, after he failed security checks conducted by the State Intelligence Agency, OSA, and yet still enjoyed access to classified information in his role in charge of the police, border service, OSA and other agencies. It was around this time that Nesic went from critic of Republika Srpska strongman Milorad Dodik to outspoken defender, calling the entity president’s ongoing trial before the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina – for flouting the decisions of the international community’s Bosnia peace overseer – 'an attack on the Republika Srpska and the Serb people'. More controversy came in October 2024, when Nesic’s security detail was reported to authorities for allegedly breaking the arm of an off-duty Sarajevo police officer while trying to clear a path for the minister’s motorcade through the city’s rush-hour traffic. Corruption allegations The charges against Nesic stem from his time as acting director of Roads of Republika Srpska, between 2016 and 2020. According to prosecutors, during this period Nesic took a total of one million Bosnian marks in bribes, or roughly half a million euros. It started, prosecutors say, when a company called Romanijaputevi won a tender worth two million marks, and its director, Milan Pandurevic, was allegedly told 'to allocate ten per cent of the tender value to Roads of RS for their needs'. Prosecutors say the money was funnelled to Nesic. They also allege that firms contracted to maintain Republika Srpska’s road were instructed to buy materials exclusively from Legend, whose director was Mladen Lucic. 'The money was then funnelled back into the hands of Nenad Nesic through Lucic,' the prosecution said. 'This was carried out in cafés, offices, parking lots, rest stops, and restaurants in Jahorina [mountain area near Sarajevo]. This continued while Nesic was the director of Roads of Republika Srpska.' A five-year investigation, involving wiretaps and physical surveillance, culminated in the arrests of Nesic, Legend owner Lucic and the current acting director of Roads of RS, Milan Dakic, all of whom remain in custody. Three other executives at Roads of RS – Srdjan Mijatovic, Cvijetin Milivojevic, and Mladen Cajic – were also arrested. Pandurevic, of Romanijaputevi, was taken in for questioning the same day but released that evening. Real estate empire As acting director of Roads of Republika Srpska, Nesic’s salary was roughly 1,500 euros per month. As security minister, he earned some 2,800 euros per month. Yet somehow, he, his wife and his brother, Predrag, amassed a total of 17 properties or plots in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro, including two apartments in a luxury marina for superyachts called Porto Montenegro in Tivat, Montenegro, according to his official property declaration when he became a minister. Similar apartments in the complex are listed for sale at more than a million euros each. Nesic also owns properties in the Montenegrin coastal town of Budva, in East Sarajevo and Novi Sad, his property declaration revealed. His wife, Maja, owns 10,000 sqm of land in Serbia, while his brother, Predrag, owns an apartment in the Montenegrin coastal town of Herceg Novi and land in Sarajevo, East Ilidza and East Sarajevo. Nesic’s assets also include the companies N-Group d.o.o., led by his wife, N Trade d.o.o., owned by his brother, and DAR, owned by his father. He also has a BMW and a Mercedes. Of these companies, only N Trade is in the black. Its profits soared from 30,000 in 2021 to almost 1.2 million euros in 2022. Nesic was not at home when police came knocking on December 26. He handed himself in at the police station in East Sarajevo where he began his career. He told waiting reporters: 'I love you Republika Srpska, and I will never stop fighting for you.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LKrlxG7vNvOO	2025-02-19T16:34:53-08:00	
EU Forges Ahead With ‘Independent’ Russia Sanctions Policy Amid M...	By Thomas Moller-Nielsen (EurActiv) -- EU envoys agreed on a further round of sanctions on Russia on Wednesday amid conflicting signals from the United States about the future of Washington’s own regime of restrictive measures aimed at Moscow. The new sanctions package – the EU’s 16th since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – includes import bans on aluminium, export restrictions on chromium and other items used to produce factory equipment, and the removal of multiple Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system. It also includes additional measures to clamp down on Russia’s circumvention of the G7’s oil price cap, which limits the sale of Russian seaborne oil to $60 per barrel. The move, which came the day after US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia to discuss an end to the three-year-long Ukraine war, followed a meeting of EU finance ministers on Tuesday in Brussels at which officials reaffirmed their support for the bloc’s current sanctions policy. One European official familiar with Tuesday’s discussions said that it is 'very likely' that the EU’s sanctions policy 'could evolve independently' of the US over the coming months, as it remains unclear what course US President Donald Trump might steer after his initial steps toward patching up ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'I did not detect any reduction in commitment to the implementation of our sanctions package,' the official said. 'And therefore I don't see it likely that if the US was to go in a different direction we would follow.' US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had initially suggested after his meeting with Russian officials on Tuesday that Washington could ease sanctions on Moscow as part of any ceasefire arrangement – and hinted that the EU might be compelled to follow suit. 'Sanctions are all the result of this conflict,' Rubio said, noting that 'in order to bring an end to any conflict there has to be concessions made by all sides'. 'But there are other parties that have sanctions,' he added. 'The European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.' But Bloomberg subsequently reported that Rubio had privately informed several European counterparts that Washington would maintain its raft of sanctions on Moscow until the war is over, citing people familiar with the matter. A State Department spokesperson also confirmed on Tuesday that Rubio had briefed ministers from France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Kaja Kallas, the EU’s top diplomat, 'immediately' after the meeting in Riyadh. 'The group agreed to remain in close contact as we work to achieve a durable end to the conflict in Ukraine,' the spokesperson said. The EU's sanctions require unanimous support among the EU's 27 member states and must be renewed every six months. One EU diplomat noted that Trump's close relationship with Hungary's Viktor Orbán – who has repeatedly denounced the EU's sanctions – could lead to 'problems' if Washington pressured Brussels to lift sanctions on Moscow. 'If this scenario would happen [where] Trump asked EU to ease up with the sanctions, I'm pretty sure that there will be at least one head of state who will be willing to do that,' the diplomat said. A controversial confiscation Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domański, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU, also said on Tuesday that Warsaw is sticking with its controversial push to confiscate the €210 billion in frozen Russian assets currently held in the EU. Such a move has been fiercely resisted by Belgium, where the vast majority of the assets are based. Belgian leaders have argued that seizing the assets is legally dubious and could threaten the financial stability of the eurozone. Confiscation is, however, staunchly supported by many Eastern European countries and was also strongly endorsed by the previous US administration led by Joe Biden. The profits generated by these assets are currently being used to finance a $50 billion loanto Kyiv, following an agreement last year by G7 countries. 'Of course, we do believe that these assets should be used to benefit Ukraine and not only the profits, but also the assets [themselves],' Domański said at a Bloomberg-hosted event. 'Having said that, of course, there are countries that express their position which is different,' he added. 'So we are in ongoing discussions – it would be premature to say what could be the end for that.' European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis, who has also repeatedly refusedto rule out seizing the assets, also suggested yesterday that the EU’s sanctions policy could evolve independently of the US. 'I think it's very clear with the moves of the current Trump administration that EU will need to take issues related to its security more [into] its own hands,' he said, adding that this 'also concerns sanctions policy'. The EU has banned €91.2 billion worth of imports from Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as well as €48 billion in exports, according to the European Commission. The new sanctions package is set to be formally endorsed by EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LD_7JE5fHT_C	2025-02-19T16:32:01-08:00	
‘Time Is Running Out’ For Jailed Pro-Democracy Media Mogul Jimmy ...	By Alice Yam The son of jailed pro-democracy media magnate Jimmy Lai has warned that 'time is running out' for his father’s health, and called on Britain and the United States to push for his release. 'His body is breaking down ... It’s akin to torture,' Sebastien Lai told Reuters ahead of the Human Rights and Democracy summit in Geneva on Feb. 18. 'Time is running out for my father.' Lai, 77, has spent more than 1,500 days behind bars, and is diabetic. He is a British citizen. In jail since his arrest in December 2020, Lai is currently standing trial for 'collusion with foreign forces' under Hong Kong’s National Security Law. He has also been handed separate sentences for lighting a candle and praying for the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, for irregularities in the use of his newspaper’s office space, and for taking part in the 2019 protests. Sebastien Lai called on global leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump — who has pledged to help get Lai out of jail — and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, to take urgent action, as his father faces his fourth year of solitary confinement. 'We are incredibly grateful that [Trump] said that. It gives us a lot of hope,' Sebastien Lai said, but called for a stronger response from the United Kingdom. 'If (Britain) wants to normalize relations, they shouldn’t normalize citizens being arrested for standing up for democracy,' he said. The Hong Kong government told Reuters that Hong Kong 'strongly disapproves of and rejects misinformation and smearing remarks made by Sebastien Lai,' while China’s permanent mission in Geneva described the claims about Lai’s health as 'slanderous.' Sebastien Lai called on governments to 'champion' his father, who decided not to flee the city when Beijing imposed the first of two national security laws in 2020, despite knowing he’d be a target. 'He refused to leave,' he told Voice of America. 'Six decades after landing on the shore of this island in pursuit of freedom, he decided to stay and stand with his fellow protesters.' Human rights groups say Lai’s trial is a 'sham' and part of a broad crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong that has all but destroyed its reputation as the only place in Greater China where the rule of law and freedoms of speech and assembly were preserved. In November 2024, a Hong Kong court jailed 45 democracy supporters at the end of the city’s biggest national security trial to date. Those sentences drew international condemnation and calls for further sanctions on Hong Kong and the expansion of lifeboat visa schemes for those fleeing the political crackdown in the city.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LNXJS0wx9yAF	2025-02-19T16:27:12-08:00	
The Fall Of Eric Adams – OpEd	Eric Adams has a multitude of legal and political problems that have ended any political ambitions he may have had. Donald Trump may have kept him from going to jail, but in seeking a lifeline from a president hated by most New Yorkers, he has sealed his fate and will go down in history as the anti-Black, Black mayor. New York City residents are wondering if mayor Eric Adams will resign, or be removed from office by the governor, or be summoned to an Inability Committee , or limp along ineffectively until his term ends on December 31, 2025. The city’s mayoralty is hanging by a thread with four Deputy Mayors resigning, and top staff under indictment or leaving. Depending on a judge’s ruling, Adams may no longer be under indictment himself because Donald Trump interceded with the United States Attorney on his behalf. So egregious was the action that six prosecutors with solid republican bona fides resigned rather than sign onto the obvious travesty of justice. Adams denies agreeing to any quid pro quo with Trump but it is hard to believe him after his appearance on Fox and Friends with border czar Tom Homan. Homan felt quite comfortable beating up on the embattled mayor. 'If he doesn’t come through … I’ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city, the city that the people of New York love. Where the hell is the agreement we came to?' What was the agreement that caused Adams to humiliate himself on national television? He has promised to work with the Trump administration’s mass deportation plan and, in so doing, will end New York’s adherence to so-called sanctuary city status, which prevents city agencies from working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). No one should think of New York as being free from ICE enforcement because of sanctuary city virtue signaling. New York City is home to an ICE detention facility and New Yorkers can be and are deported on a regular basis. But those facts are inconvenient and the Trump administration obsession with deportation photo opportunities gives the appearance that he is the first president to ever deport anyone. Adams is charged with taking bribes and using straw donors , which included illegal donations from foreigners, to inflate his campaign contributions using New York City’s generous matching program, and netting his campaign a cool $10 million. While the judge hearing his case has still not officially dismissed it, Adams is believed to have escaped a trial and any jail time that might have resulted from a conviction. Others indicted on the same charges have already pleaded guilty . They will face conviction and possible jail time even if Adams succeeds in walking free. New York City’s second Black mayor is not only facing serious accusations, but he is no friend to the nearly 2 million Black residents he governs. The existence of ineffectual and compromised Black elected officials is not a new phenomenon. Adams stands out because of his policies which are so obviously harmful to Black people. Until recently the Adams administration took more than 30 days to process Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs (SNAP) and other public assistance applications, a violation of law and a cause of great suffering to low income people. Adams has also been slow to close the notorious Rikers Island jail, in defiance of the demands of a federal monitor. He did find time to be baptized at Rikers Island by none other than Al Sharpton in a Good Friday ceremony but he has stymied every effort at improving conditions there and eventually closing the facility. The New York Police Department (NYPD) remains a pet agency, allowed to violate the rules the mayor sets for others, including exceeding its overtime budget by $100 million . Adams fought against efforts to minimize the imposition of cash bail and worked with the governor to undo a process which impacted Black people more than any other group. Now under indictment himself, Adams bragged that other people presumed innocent should sit in jail because they lacked money to post a bond. When Luigi Mangione , the accused shooter of an insurance company executive was extradited to New York, Adams joined in the perp walk and trampled on Mangione’s presumption of innocence as he has done with others. 'I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city, the city that the people of New York love.' The right wing New York Post endorsed his 2021 campaign and the mayor made good on Rupert Murdoch’s seal of approval by constantly harping on crime as an issue even after major crimes decreased. He is so devoted to the state of Israel that he visits whenever that nation is in the midst of genocidal activity and in need of public relations campaigns to cover up its war crimes. Adams even mused about retiring to the occupied Golan Heights. Adams praised acquitted subway killer Daniel Penny who walked free after he choked a Black homeless Black man on a subway train. Adams said, 'You have someone [Penny] on that subway who was responding, doing what we should have done as a city.' The hopefully soon to be former mayor also brought back the stop and friskpolicies which victimized so many Black New Yorkers. Other Black politicians go through the motions of meeting the needs of their Black constituents and speaking to their issues of concern. But Adams made it clear that the needs of conservative white New Yorkers would be his priority. While others make phony progressive promises, Adams panders to a group unlikely to support any other Black politician. Amidst the drama of his legal woes he met with republican leadership, presumably to seek their endorsement to run on their party’s ballot line. While he ultimately decided against this ploy, Adams is completely discredited. A small coterie of clergy will show up at a press conference to show support, but politically speaking, Adams is a dead man walking. While current and past office holders have already announced they are vying to sit in the mayor’s office, it is wise to determine how to prevent another political debacle for the city. Despite not having announced that he is running, former governor Andrew Cuomo has both name recognition and a long list of rich people ready to contribute to a campaign. Despite not making his candidacy official, he is the front runner for the mayoralty. As governor of New York state, Cuomo governed as a neo-liberal, currying favor with rich conservatives and carrying on a years-long feud with then New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. Cuomo also attempted to undo a state ethics commission which this week ruled that he should not have received a $5.1 payment for writing his memoirs while in office. Cuomo is smoother and smarter than Adams but brings the same bad political baggage. No one is certain how long the Adams soap opera will go on, but he will not be missed by the Black New Yorkers whose political and material needs he ignored. Eric Adams will be a footnote in history as a clownish and quirky character with legal troubles but whenever he leaves office, he will not be missed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LE4N6JyS2bBV	2025-02-19T16:23:07-08:00	
Trump Assails Ukraine’s Zelenskyy As ‘Dictator Without Elections’	U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, calling him a 'dictator without elections,' after Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian-influenced 'disinformation space.' With settlement of Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine hanging in the balance, Trump took to his Truth Social media platform to attack the Kyiv leader, who has expressed the fear that the U.S. leader is trying to end the war on terms more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. Trump accused Zelenskyy of refusing to hold elections in Ukraine, which had been scheduled for April 2024 but were delayed after Russia invaded in 2022, three years ago next week. Trump disparaged Zelenskyy as 'a modestly successful comedian' who 'talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle.' The U.S. leader, who declined last year during a political debate to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war, said 'the only thing [Zelenskyy] was good at was playing [former U.S. President Joe] Biden ‘like a fiddle’' for more military assistance. 'I love Ukraine,' Trump said, 'but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues…..' Trump’s assessment of Zelenskyy came after the Ukrainian leader this week expressed his anger at Ukraine’s exclusion from Tuesday’s high-level U.S.-Russian diplomatic talks in Saudi Arabia, where the two countries after more than four hours of discussions said they had agreed to meet again soon on how to end the war. Earlier, Trump on Tuesday scoffed at Zelenskyy’s complaint about not being invited to the talks in Riyadh headed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 'Today I heard, ‘Well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' Trump said of Ukraine’s leaders, whom he accused of starting the war even though it was Russia that invaded Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday he was pleased with the outcome of the Riyadh talks with the U.S. but said his country needs to build trust with Washington before the war can be resolved. Putin rated the discussions 'highly,' declaring that they were a 'first step' in improving contentious relations between Moscow and Washington. But he added, 'It is impossible to solve many issues, including the Ukrainian crisis, without increasing the level of trust between Russia and the United States.' Putin said in televised remarks that he would like to hold a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, 'but it needs to be prepared so that it brings results.' The Rubio-Lavrov talks were the first significant discussions between the two superpowers in more than three years following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the U.S.-led Western effort to arm Kyiv’s forces to fend off the attack. 'I was briefed [on the talks]. I rate them highly, there are results,' Putin was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying at a drone factory in Saint Petersburg. 'In my opinion, we made the first step to restore work in various areas of mutual interests.' Neither Ukrainian nor European officials were at the table in a Saudi palace for the talks, but the U.S. said they would be involved in future negotiations to try to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II. Russia failed to take over all of Ukraine in the first stages of the war but now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory. Zelenskyy has said repeatedly his country will not accept a dictated U.S.-Russian dictated settlement of the conflict. While Biden provided tens of billions of dollars in arms for Kyiv, Trump has pushed for a fast end to the Moscow-initiated war. Speaking ahead of talks with Trump's Ukraine envoy in Kyiv, Zelenskyy told Ukrainian TV, 'President Trump ... unfortunately lives in this disinformation space.' The envoy, Gen. Keith Kellogg, said the United States understands the need for security guarantees for Ukraine in any negotiated end to the war. Kellogg said he was in Ukraine 'to listen,' hear the concerns of Ukrainian leaders and return to the United States to consult with Trump. Kellogg said the United States wants the war in Ukraine to end, saying it would be good for the region and the world. Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of the meeting with Kellogg that while U.S. officials have said there will be no U.S. troops deployed as part of any potential post-war peacekeeping mission, there are still other ways it can help, such as providing air defense systems. 'You don't want boots on the ground, you don't want NATO,' Zelenskyy said. 'Okay, can we have Patriots? Enough Patriots?' The discussions in Kyiv came amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts focused on the war, including French President Emmanuel Macron hosting European leaders Wednesday for a second round of talks about the conflict and European support for Ukraine. Kellogg also met earlier this week with European leaders. Rubio said Tuesday after meeting with Lavrov that both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to achieve peace. 'The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,' Rubio told reporters. Zelenskyy postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the U.S.-Russia talks. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement after the Riyadh talks that the U.S. and Russia agreed to 'appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible.' Bruce characterized the meeting as 'an important step forward' toward peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LMtqLzIIrLXT	2025-02-19T16:21:16-08:00	
Ukraine: Three Years Of War Reverses Progress For Women And Girls	Three years of war in Ukraine have reversed decades of progress for women and girls, leaving millions in urgent need of support, according to UN Women. Russia’s full-scale invasion has forced more than 1.8 million women to flee their homes within Ukraine, while nearly 6.7 million require humanitarian assistance. More than 3,799 women and 289 girls have been killed, though the real toll is believed to be significantly higher. 'The full-scale war has pushed an entire generation of Ukrainian women backwards,' said Sabine Freizer Gunes, UN WomenRepresentative in the country. 'They are facing heightened exposure to gender-based violence; rising unemployment; decreased decision-making power; greater domestic burdens; and a severe mental health crisis,' she explained. Stressed out Gender-based violence has surged by 36 per cent since 2022, driven in part by conflict-related stress, UN Women reported. In parallel, depression rates among women and girls have worsened. On the economic front, opportunities have shrunk. By 2024, less than half of displaced women had jobs whilst the gender pay gap doubled since the beginning of the war. Meanwhile, the burden of unpaid care, from cooking to caring for children, has intensified as childcare services centres have closed and services dwindled. Women spent an average of 56 hours a week on childcare in 2024, up from 49 hours before the war. Leaders of humanitarian recovery Despite these hardships, Ukrainian women are leading humanitarian responses and driving economic resilience. Women have assumed key roles as aid workers, community leaders and entrepreneurs. Today, one in every two businesses in Ukraine is founded by a woman. Women are also entering traditionally male-dominated sectors such as security, transportation and demining. 'Donors’ support to Ukrainian women-led organizations and programmes is crucial so they can continue promoting gender equality, women’s rights and leadership,' said Ms. Gunes. 'Women’s full engagement will be essential to rebuild Ukraine as a gender-equal and gender-responsive society,' she added. Support and call for action In 2024 alone, UN Women supported more than 180,000 women and girls affected by the war through initiatives under the Women Peace and Humanitarian Fund. The agency provides life-saving humanitarian aid, psychosocial and legal support, protection services and programmes to strengthen women’s economic independence. Four years on since the beginning of the war, UN Women is working to ensure that women are included in decision-making and recovery efforts, advocating for legal reforms to secure equal rights and representation. Overnight attack on Odesa The UN aid coordination office in Ukraine, OCHA, reported that an attack on Odesa City in the small hours of Wednesday morning had injured a number of civilians, including a child. Local authorities say the attack left a large residential area without electricity and heating, affecting at least 160,000 people – in the midst of winter. 'Multiple apartment buildings were damaged, as well as a children’s hospital, and a kindergarten. For our part, we are providing emergency shelter materials, hot meals, psychosocial support, legal aid, and child protection services,' said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric., Medical teams are conducting quick health checks and distributing medicines, while schools will remain closed until power and heating are restored. In the southern city of Kherson aid workers are continuing to respond to an attack that took place on 17 February, and damaged a critical energy facility. 2,500 residents were left without electricity, heating, and water.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LCmjJbI5_Rua	2025-02-19T16:19:03-08:00	
I Sympathize With Nehru’s Views On The Importance Of Industrializ...	We put a lot of money into industry in the hope that this input would accelerate our growth. Jawaharlal Nehru's idea of the public sector was very different from the way it has evolved through the years. Whether you have a socialist or a capitalist economy, profits have always been the principal source of accumulation' said Dr Manmohan Singh, two-term India’s prime minister from 2004 to 2014 Ever since the passing away of Dr Manmohan Singh on 26 December 2024 in New Delhi, much has been written about his contributions as the two-term Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014, his historic role as the Union Finance Minister from 1991 to 1996. In the politically-charged atmosphere of the Indian capital, there have been debates on a memorial site and Bharat Ratna (highest civilian honour) for the late former Prime Minister; these continue to make media headlines, resulting in political tug-of-wars where decorum is often thrown to the winds. It is only appropriate to bring to centre-stage the mild-mannered soft-spoken Oxford-Cambridge educated Dr Manmohan Singh whose seminal works on exports, world trade, the role of public sector, and Pt Jawaharlal Nehru's vision continue to shed light on the roadmaps for the Indian economy till date. Back in 1999-2000 when he was Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha (Upper House of Parliament) Dr Singh, in a conversation with development economist Prof VN Balasubramanyam of Lancaster University, shared his views on a spectrum of issues relating to India’s economy. 'Yes, I sympathise with Nehru's views on the importance of industrialisation, indeed until the 1960s, there was no questioning of that policy. Yes, I subscribed to it, infact most of us did. It seemed the right strategy at that time,' said Dr Singh, adding 'Everybody who came to India also advocated that policy. Those were the days of the take-off into self-sustained growth. Whosoever came to India advised us that increasing investment to the right level was the thing to do. It was considered right that India should run a large deficit and the world would finance it. I do not think that till the mid-1960s we did terribly wrong. I think we should have had the vision to shift gear once we knew that we had created the basic infrastructure. We should have taken full advantage of the opportunities offered by the international trading system to build a dynamic and efficient economy. We should have paid more attention to restructuring of public and private enterprises on the basis of efficiency and international competitiveness.' Earlier in an interview with World Affairs (January-March 1997), Dr Singh explained, 'We have not paid adequate attention to social sectors in our development strategy. We adopted a strategy where steel was the kingpin, whereas we live in a society where knowledge is power. In a country such as ours where you have a literacy rate of 53 per cent with a dubious quality, it is not surprising that our growth rate is so low. We put a lot of money into industry in the hope that this input would accelerate our growth. Jawaharlal Nehru's idea of the public sector was very different from the way it has evolved through the years. Whether you have a socialist or a capitalist economy, profits have always been the principal source of accumulation. Therefore, if you socialise profits through the public sector, you will kill two birds with one stone: first, you accelerate the rate of saving through the prevention of superfluous consumption by the rich and thereby accelerate the process of accumulation; second, by socialising profits you can reduce the inequalities of income and wealth. Nehru hoped that we would have a public sector that would generate large surpluses. But the public sector in our economy doesn't even yield a return to pay the interest on the capital the government has borrow.' Dr Manmohan often gave the Japanese example, looking at the trajectory of Japanese development since the 19th century. 'They created a large number of enterprises in the public sector and handed them over to the private sector. If we wish to industrialise quickly within a period of 15-25 years in a country where the private entrepreneurs are scarce, active state involvement in setting up industries is the only way to get things going. But if the process is to become self-sustaining, we need a progressive increase in productivity, improved capital productivity. Public sector and state instrumentalities are very inefficient ways of getting this productivity growth. You have to rely on the private sector to do this,' he explained to Prof Balasubramanyam. Undoubtedly Dr Singh’s handling of the balance of payments crisis of 1991 was truly historic, and remains a milestone in India’s contemporary history. He narrated the sequence of events, typically as an economics professor would: 'India was in the middle of a deep economic crisis. We were on the verge of bankruptcy as our foreign exchange reserves had been nearly exhausted. We converted that crisis into an opportunity to launch a wide-ranging programme of structural reforms. The traditional response to a balance of payments crisis is to compress domestic demand through a programme of fiscal retrenchment. However, in an economy characterised by wage rigidities and supply bottlenecks which prevent resources moving from one sector to another, the traditional stabilisation programmes end up by creating unemployment and idle capacity.' He then highlighted the strategy adopted, 'we devised a stabilisation programme which was expected to produce positive results in a fairly short period and additional we launched a programme of structural reforms to improve the supply side responses. The end result was that the duration of the recession resulting from the stabilisation programme was short enough to prevent a serious political backlash. By 1993-94, the Indian economy started growing at a fairly respectable rate. In this way, the political resistance to reforms was contained. Even then there were problems once the sense of crisis was over. This is partly because we did not have enough time to educate public opinion.' For economists wishing to learn from this lesson of history, the key points are – improving supply side responses, preventing political backlash, and educating public opinion. Dr Singh acknowledged the highly inward-looking economic policies, the strong distrust of foreign investment and private entrepreneurship which was prevalent till 1991. 'The distrust was a reflection of India's history whereby the East India Company, which came to India as a trader, ended up as a ruler. Our struggle against colonial rule also strengthened these sentiments. In this background, it was natural that the opening up of the economy to foreign investment and liberalisation of imports should invite opposition from businessmen, trade unions and even political parties both on the right and the left. However, the fact that ours was a policy of measured opening up, that our economic reforms did not lead to unemployment and idle capacity, and that the growth performance of the economy improved year after year after the initial setback in 1991-92 diluted the vigour of opposition to economic reforms. Now there is widespread appreciation that reforms of 1991 to 1996 on the whole were beneficial in their impact and there can be no reversal of these policies,' he said, obviously with an obvious sense of satisfaction. He referred to the opposition faced by the Congress-led government from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Leftist parties who were against the opening up of the economy. But after coming into power, 'both the United Front government and the BJP recognised that xenophobia is no answer to India's problems. However, the BJP government's soft line towards foreign investment and import liberalisation is being opposed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Swadeshi Jagran Manch. In fact all the political parties contain elements which are not favourably disposed towards reforms. Even the Congress Party is no exception to this statement,' he noted. When questioned him about the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) by Prof Balasubramanyam, Dr Singh’s reply is relevant and significant till date: 'As Finance Minister I put a halt to the automatic route through which the Reserve Bank was to fund the Government. I do believe that because of the close linkages between fiscal and monetary policies, we need a high degree of coordination between monetary and fiscal policies. I gave a lot of weight to the advice of the RBI Governor. But I do not believe that the Reserve Bank can be totally independent. To a large extent the autonomy of the Bank is a state of mind. It very much depends on the vision, knowledge and experience of the Governor of the Bank. If the advice is of high quality, it cannot be ignored by any government. But I do not believe that we can legislate the autonomy of RBI.' He explained, 'We are not in that position and when people talk of independence, they are all talking of economies where factor mobility is very high, where a large number of policy instruments are available, where frictions and rigidities in economic structures and operation of the economy are low. Here we are operating relatively rudimentary structures with a lot of rigidity built into the system. We do not know the lags between policy implementation and its impact. So, I believe that RBI must have as much autonomy as possible in the sense that it must be free to give advice and if the government does not accept the advice, it should be known to the public why that advice was not accepted. But to say that the Central Bank can operate in isolation of the overall economic environment, unmindful of other objectives of economic policy, is not possible.' Not just a Bharat Ratna, the towering gateway of the Reserve Bank of India building on New Delhi’s Parliament Street needs renaming as ‘Dr Manmohan Singh Dwaar’ (or Gateway) where his words may be inscribed on stone.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LAaIfTt6XUj0	2025-02-19T16:16:57-08:00	
Putin Praises US-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia As ‘First Step’ To ...	Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump could meet as early as this month, although a face-to-face meeting will take time to prepare, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday, according to Russian news agencies. Peskov said the US-Russia talks held on Tuesday in Riyadh were a 'very, very important step' toward reaching a settlement on the Ukraine war, nearing its third year. 'In order to carry out, figuratively speaking, resuscitation measures, diplomats will now begin to work in light of the agreement (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov reached yesterday with (US Secretary of State Marco) Rubio,' Peskov was quoted by state media as saying. 'But this is the first step...Naturally, it’s impossible to fix everything in one day or a week. There is a long way to go,' he added. The talks in Riyadh were the first time US and Russian officials met to discuss ways to halt the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two. No Ukrainian or European officials were invited. Kyiv has said it will not accept any deal imposed without its consent. Putin thanked the Saudi leadership, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, for creating a good atmosphere for holding the talks. The Russian president said he rated the bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia 'highly,' describing them as a 'first step' to restoring relations with Washington. 'In my opinion, we made the first step to restore work in various areas of mutual interests,' he told journalists while visiting a drone manufacturing plant in his native Saint Petersburg. He added that Russia and the US needed to 'trust' each other if talks were to be successful. 'It is impossible to solve many issues, including the Ukrainian crisis, without increasing the level of trust between Russia and the United States,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKEwihDS2-LGTOWeedvPHp	2025-02-19T16:14:06-08:00	
Peace In Europe Is Only Possible Under Trump – OpEd	After depending on America as its ally for decades, the European leaders at the Munich Security Conference this week now see first hand the continent's decades old norms and dogma of the American security umbrella now crumbling in front of them. The U.S. and Russia have begun talks in Saudi Arabia aimed at improving diplomatic ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, without the involvement of Europe and Ukraine. This is only made possible under Trump, and will signal a new path towards peace. If Biden defeated Trump in the elections, this conflict will only prolong with greater amounts of lives lost and money pumped in unnecessarily. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio sat down with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Riyadh, signaling a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations after years of tension following the Ukraine conflict, and after years of limited engagement thanks to Biden's old school approach. Trump criticised Zelensky for his disapproval of this direct meeting without Ukraine, and Trump is right when he argued that Zelensky has for three years been here but practically the war has seen no signs of abating. Only Trump has the capacity in the world now to halt this previous stalemate of the West's stubborn old school approach, and to end the war now. This first formal talk will set up nicely the upcoming meeting between Trump and Putin, which will mark a new chapter of ties between Moscow and Washington, where it will no longer be constrained by past status quo and conventional approaches of the Biden administration. This meeting is very much overdue, and this will pave the way for the end of the Ukraine conflict, and this also brings much certainty to long term bilateral ties and a reset of relationship with Russia, away from the past entanglements of traditional European factor and trap. Since the conflict started, America has been confined to two principles: that Ukraine's future should not be decided without the involvement of Ukraine; and that America and its Western allies must come together to face Putin. ⁠ In came Trump and this changed entirely. European leaders now face a scramble to reorient their security setting amidst the new shake-up and the risks of an American pullout or using that as a pretext to force Europe to ease on its conventional barriers to Ukraine peace talks. European leaders held an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday to align their position after they are left out of the talks for Ukraine. The outcome of the eventual Trump-Putin meeting also will transcend the impact on Ukraine alone, as a new set of improved ties with the US will lessen the necessity for Moscow to increase reliance on China and the DPRK as a trade off for higher bargaining chips with the US. Without external influences and forces and with Trump's new distinct mantra of self push for peace, with the doubling down on the reality that Zelensky will not be naively expecting the same territorial ownership before the war, and in shutting down any idea of Ukraine joining NATO, this meeting will mark a new beginning in long term peace deals for Russia. Europe will also now be left with a more self independent defence approach without the easy reliance on American power presence, which will further limit its potential for escalations or provocations with Russia. With Trump's warning that Europe will be left alone, the talks of the creation of the Army of Europe will not in any way embolden European powers to challenge Russia, knowing how without the US involvement, it is in no way able to sustain any aggressive confrontation. This direct meeting between Trump and Putin is the most beneficial and strategic in any ways, in keeping away the European forces that have for long been a main barrier. With Trump's own tariff strategy and reorientation of security ties with Europe, plus the new thaw of ties between Russia and the US, Europe will be forced to scale down on its Russian pushback, seeing how fragile cross Atlantic ties will further limit its trade and economic options, which it will now have to rely more on the Indo Pacific and China as a result, although both are still risky for Europe's shaky Indo Pacific push. Can Europe defend itself without American support? Not a chance. This will force Europe to spend more on its defence, including its NATO commitment. This will require a spike in defence spending and especially on targeted key defence areas and deterrence capacity, something which Europe lacks now with its stagnating economy coupled with the tariff threat from Trump. Last year, only 18 NATO allies just spent the target of 2% of GDP in defence. What Europe really lacks is the proper defence and deterrence capacity against Russia, and will be left as sitting ducks without the holistic American military deterrent capacity especially in nuclear and high technology missiles. What does Europe really lack? It is the basic military technology and capability that make armed forces credible, capable and most importantly, lethal. Europe has outdated and outnumbered ships and missiles. It has ships without the proper missiles, planes without the needed technological capacity including jamming capabilities, and even troops without adequate ammunition. The disparity of Western and Eastern European military capabilities and intra Europe power gap are glaring, and lacking the combined holistic military spectrum including intelligence, space security and satellite capabilities, cyber and digital warfare, and missiles and nuclear first and second strike capacities, Europe cannot afford to defend itself without America. But it has for decades been piggybacking on America's back, banking on the conventional and assured American military and financial support in securing its interests and security needs without the urgent need to bolster these capabilities. The nature of European arsenals cannot match with the overall nuclear and military umbrella that America provides. The American nuclear umbrella and nuclear forces have protected Europe for decades, serving as the ultimate assurance and guarantee against a Russian invasion. This easy ride on security assurances for Europe made it easier for it to focus deeper on its economic and trade needs, and pivoting to Africa and Asia. However, even this is ineffective, with its Global Gateway strategy and the Indo Pacific push all failed to pull Europe out of its stagnation,even in post Brexit recovery. With Trump now reversing decades of free ride, European security suddenly looks in shambles, even without the Ukraine pretext in the first place. Compare that to Russia, who enjoys higher volume advantage both in conventional and nuclear capacities. France and Britain both have a combined nuclear warheads of around 500, while the US has around 5000, and Russia has the highest number at approximately 6000. The Ukrainian experience portrayed how the conflict there should not have been started in the first place, and if Trump was in power at that time, in his own words and Putin's, this would not have started. Trump has chastised the decision for Ukraine to take the fight with Russia, despite knowing the huge and glaring disparity of firepower and military capacity between Moscow and Kiev, while hoping for Washington to continue to provide military aid in the hundreds of billions, all while Europe is happy to just contribute enough, albeit little. Trump's further tariff threat on Europe should it continue hijack Trump's direct Putin deal remains a strategic and brilliant pull off from Trump, and open are the doors to new economic, trade and security reorientation with Russia in a gradually positive tone, especially if new future sanctions are withheld or waived in tandem with Russia's own reciprocal sweetener in the Ukraine peace deal. This new shake-up in the European security sphere where it is now finding itself suddenly exposed and vulnerable will mean that it is left with no choice but to placate Trump, and to avoid further tariff and risks of entire pullout of US security. This will push Europe to accept that the Ukrainian peace deal will need to go through, and there will be no more barriers to continue the financial wastages on the war and the ever mounting toll of lives lost on both sides. Europe has always singled out Russia as the main threat to its security, and yet before Trump 1.0, has continued to rely heavily on Russian oil and gas for its energy security, while soliciting American military and nuclear support at the same time. It will take Europe at least ten years to properly defend itself without America, and it will need America more than ever. In future thaw of ties and the upcoming negotiations, Russia is expected to demand for more considerations from the West, including possible prisoner swap and also the ease of sanctions on Iran which will allow for more Iranian oil export that will ease oil prices, and eventually help with Russia's post recovery. The West in turn is expected to push Russia to be disassociate more with China and North Korea, and to lower its role in BRICS and other anti-West mechanisms, barring the potentiality of Trump to further lavish higher tariff and sanctions on Moscow and also the risks of a fallout in the peace talks. However, both have more to gain from an eventual peace and a thaw in ties, and even Europe will reap more benefits in the future. The peace plan might also include the resumption of greater energy flow into Europe from Russia, which it needs.Most gas deliveries ceased in 2022, when Russia closed down Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The EU now receives just 10% of its gas from Russia, down from 45% in 2021. This affected Moscow's supply chain as well, and a heavy financial toll. Europe is feeling the pinch from continuing high prices, and this year it will need to buy more than usual to fill its storage which is now only 48% full compared to 66% at the same time last year. The limit on the supply and flow by Russia also affected both sides, in both navigating through this barrier while others tried to circumvent it. Hungary and Slovakia still receive piped Russian flows from Turkey; while others also get regasified Russian LNG that flows through northern Europe. Ukraine is adamant it will not renew its deal with Russia, but turnarounds are being studied. The EU'S most Russia-wary members would strongly oppose greater dependence on the country's energy, but that hinges on the outcome of the peace deal. At the same time, Trump would have wanted Europe to buy more of American oil and gas, but if the peace deal goes through, Russia will be able to supply more, which will lower prices around the world that might put American oil drillers and capacities at a disadvantage.However, the peace plan is more pressing, and will bring greater financial and security savings for Washington and Brussels. It is time to stop this madness of the Ukraine war, with the common sense and sensible approach taken by Trump to begin talks and negotiations, which will benefit all nations. Like what Trump has long argued, this should not have started in the first place, and would not have started should he still be in power, a fact where even Putin concurred, but at least Trump has now kept his promise to end this, cleaning up Biden's mess. Hopes are high for the return of peace at long last.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwXM1X-0KuOaN	2025-02-18T18:40:39-08:00	
Fighting Continues In Ethiopia’s Amhara Region – Analysis	Clashes are ongoing in Ethiopia’s Amhara region, where an ethnically based militia known as the Fano is battling the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) for control. In January, fighting broke out in Debre Birhan, a town 120 kilometers north of the capital, Addis Ababa. Fano militants used conventional and ambush attacks against government forces, the website Borkena reported. Fighting also was reported in the towns of Wollo, Gojjam and Gondar. 'The conflict continues to escalate, with widespread violence and heavy clashes across the Amhara region and parts of Oromia,' Hone Mandefro, of the Amhara Association of America, and Henok Ashagray, of the Centre for Human Rights at the University of Pretoria, wrote in an article for Inter Press Service. 'Government forces have intensified their military campaigns and are now using airstrikes and drones, while Fano militias resist fiercely. The fighting is severe and prolonged, with territorial control frequently shifting.' The violence comes after the ENDF launched a major military operation in October 2024 to defeat the Fano. But observers believe the Fano still control as much as 80% of the region. The militia operates mostly outside large population centers and has only briefly controlled major towns or roads. The fighting affects nearly every aspect of life in the Amhara region, disrupting farming and trade, shutting down health clinics, and raising the risk of famine. More than 4.1 million children are out of school, and more than 4,000 schools are closed, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Analysts believe that despite the heavy toll, the Fano continue to enjoy widespread public support, particularly in rural areas. 'Local communities appear to be closely collaborating with the groups,' the Rift Valley Institute said in a 2024 analysis. 'This seems to include information sharing, logistical support, and the provision of safe havens. The structure of the Fano, which mostly involves small groups operating in or near their home areas, means that they are able to rely on close ties with local communities.' The Fano formed in 2016 as a protest movement and later became an armed group claiming to protect Amhara land rights and other interests. During the 2020 to 2022 war in the Tigray region, the Fano fought alongside federal government forces and reclaimed a disputed area known as Western Tigray. The Fano, as well as government and Tigrayan forces, were accused of widespread war crimes, including brutal attacks against civilians. Near the end of the conflict, the ENDF began disarming and arresting Fano fighters, and, in 2023, the Fano launched an insurgency. Amid the prolonged insurgency, there is some positive news. In the seven weeks ending on January 31, there was a 44% decrease in fighting in the Amhara region compared to the previous seven weeks, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) Ethiopia Peace Observatory project. ACLED analysts believe this decrease was due to a lull during the holidays and the fact that an estimated 4,000 Fano fighters surrendered. They also credit peace talks initiated by diplomats from the African Union, European Union, United States and others. However, the fragmented nature of the Fano makes it difficult to hold discussions with all parties to the conflict. There are at least nine Fano groups, including some that are feuding with each other. 'The two conflicting parties face a long road to sitting at the negotiation table, particularly due to a lack of unity among Fano militias,' according to a 2024 ACLED report. 'One-to-one peace talks with each militia would complicate negotiations and offer less guarantee of establishing and sustaining peace in the region. Additionally, without a unified Fano to join peace talks, the government’s efforts to end the conflict have come up short.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwZLVSL1FOAHP	2025-02-18T17:37:36-08:00	
Iatrogenic Influence In Information Operations: Lessons From The ...	By Daniel Eerhart Introduction (FPRI) -- In medicine, iatrogenesis is when a physician’s medical treatment or procedures unintentionally induce disease, harmful complications, or any other ill effect. This paper introduces the concept of iatrogenic influence. It parallels the medical term and refers to situations where information operations inadvertently produce adverse outcomes and unintentionally exacerbate the issue they aim to improve. While this phenomenon has existed as long as information warfare has, the nearly twenty years of conflict following September 11th, 2001, known as the Global War on Terror (GWOT), has produced numerous missteps and infringements from which we can learn lessons to improve future efforts. During the GWOT, U.S. military psychological operations units deliberately integrated various information-related capabilities and aimed to wage a mutually supportive war in the tactical and cognitive domains. However, inherent to the nature of terrorist organizations is the ability to weaponize fear and win information battles. Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic State, the Haqqani network, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, and the Lashkar-e-Taiba all weaponized the information environment to bolster recruiting efforts and spread propaganda. While U.S. forces aiming to compete in the information environment had to wrestle with bureaucratic processes and protect domestic trust and perceived legitimacy in the combat zones, GWOT adversaries pressed their advantage in the information space through decentralized execution and rapid dissemination. U.S. military commands do not have the luxury of cutting corners; when they do, they increase the risk of iatrogenic influence. Inoculation theory suggests that exposure to a weak argument increases resistance to its persuasive abilities. Therefore, attempting to match adversary performance measures is an exercise in futility and may lend itself to further adversary advantage. U.S. influence systems are best suited for 'central route focus,' as described by the elaboration likelihood model, which provides detailed, well-reasoned arguments designed to engage audiences cognitively. In rapidly changing environments, emotional responses are more influential for short-term gains. However, the GWOT was fought for nearly twenty years, not a short period in any model. This paper contends that iatrogenic influence in information operations poses a significant risk to the U.S. military’s ability to achieve strategic objectives. By analyzing case studies, indicators of iatrogenic influence are identified, providing operational leaders an opportunity to assess their presence within operations. This enables pre-execution modifications, reducing risks in future influence activities. Iatrogenic Influence Since September 11, 2001, information operations and irregular warfare have played a significant role in the GWOT. With the rise of ubiquitous social media and a readily available information environment in the pockets of every target audience, adversaries seized the initiative and adapted. As U.S. military and allied forces aimed to compete in the information environment, numerous campaigns yielded unintentional negative consequences, exacerbating the issues they sought to mitigate. This phenomenon, designated as 'iatrogenic influence,' parallels the medical term of iatrogenesis, where interventions cause harm rather than heal. The risk of iatrogenic influence grows as modern conflict evolves to integrate information strategies and apply hybrid warfare methods. Contemporary conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza demonstrate the necessity to understand the information environment and effectively deliver the influence message. Without understanding how iatrogenic influence occurs, forces operating in the information environment will likely succumb to similar outcomes in future operations. Understanding Iatrogenic Influence in the Context of the GWOT This section explores the literature on information operations during the conflict, ethical frameworks during information operations, and counterinsurgency doctrine to contextualize the concept of iatrogenic influence. It will examine how coalition forces approached information operations during the GWOT and explains how those operations were nested underneath the overarching counterinsurgency strategy. Then it will concentrate on the role of the U.S. doctrine and establishing an international coalition by invoking Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Information Operations During Conflict In their book Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt argue that conflict has transitioned from hierarchical frameworks to decentralized networks. During the GWOT, this concept came to fruition in 2001 following the overthrow of al-Qaeda, the Taliban’s surrender, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386 to establish the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. In 2003, the coalition used traditional military forces to defeat the Baath Party and overthrow Sadaam Hussein, but the conflict degraded to network warfare afterward. With traditional military hierarchies dominating ground conflict in the initial stages, adversaries transitioned to types of warfare that favored their strengths. A decentralized asymmetric form of warfare emerged that relied upon networks and information rather than battalions and brigades. Adversaries who were embedded in the population had the cultural understanding of the populace and an idiomatic understanding of the language to generate propaganda that resonated with their audiences. Unlike our adversaries, without established networks to spread messages through word of mouth, U.S. and allied psychological operations forces often relied upon loudspeakers and leaflets to communicate their messages. Conventional military forces were unable to effectively compete with the speed and efficiency of decentralized, culturally fluent networks. Dorothy Denning’s book Information Warfare and Security emphasizes the importance of cultural sensitivity and understanding the local context when performing information operations. However, despite having this academic understanding, the U.S. and allied ability to perform such activities on the ground was limited by the dissemination platforms, lack of availability of trans-cultural experts, and operational tempo. Counterinsurgency Doctrine In 2006, Gen. David Petraeus, USA, and Lt. Gen. James Amos, USMC, published Field Manual 3-24, the U.S. military’s first field manual on counterinsurgency. The manual’s 2014 rewritten version still defines the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy. The authors address information management by stating, 'To limit discontent and build support, the affected government and any counterinsurgency forces assisting it create and maintain a realistic set of expectations among the population, friendly military forces, and the international community.' This statement is a critical indicator of whether the information operations will devolve into iatrogenesis. If creating realistic expectations is critical to building support and legitimacy, then inherently, any information operation that is revealed to be deceptive, that exaggerates expectations, or that disconnects perception will result in adverse results. Field Manual 3-24 provides insight into cultures and reminds the reader that they should not assume foreign audiences will share the same values or perspectives as U.S. personnel. Even within audiences, contradictions and variations of behaviors and beliefs will impact the message’s ability to resonate. The key is to balance the requirements within the goal of the operation and the cultural beliefs within the area of operations. In statistics, variance increases when data points become more spread out from the mean of the dataset. This concept parallels information operations, where the influence actors perform a target audience analysis on the 'mean' of their dataset (i.e., the average member of their target audience). The farther their effort spreads from the average member, the more likely they will violate a cultural belief, creating discontent as described in Field Manual 3-24. Transparent and truthful information with a precise target audience ensures effective information operations during counterinsurgency. Case Studies The following three case studies provide concrete examples of iatrogenic influence during the Global War on Terror and build upon the theoretical and doctrinal background as a baseline. Examining these case studies provides insights into the areas where missteps unfolded and created tensions. Guantanamo Detainee Photos (2002) On January 11, 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense released a photo of twenty prisoners in Guantanamo Bay on their knees. The shackled prisoners were in orange jumpsuits with masks over their heads and were surrounded by razor wire. The photo was not a leak; the Department of Defense deliberately released it as part of an assignment to photograph the opening day of Camp X-Ray in southeastern Cuba. The photo has been broadcast throughout the world and used by news agencies as evidence of U.S. wrongdoing and torture during the war on terror. Even twenty years later, the photo frequently reappears alongside stories calling for transparency in military detainee operations. Rather than the international community viewing the photo as anonymous prisoners detained within the guidelines of the Geneva Convention, the photo brought about criticism regarding the willingness to subject prisoners to sensory deprivation and degradation. Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State both have used the photoas part of their propaganda efforts and recruitment messaging. The release’s original intent, to build trust in U.S. transparency, only led to further questions about prisoner treatment away from camera view. Iatrogenic influence indicators are again apparent in this case study, where a Western lens categorized the capture and distribution. Broad general audience photo dissemination occurred with inconsistent messaging. If the goal is to communicate that prisoners receive treatment with dignity and respect, then a display of hooded individuals on their knees surrounded by razor wire is incompatible with that goal. Furthermore, with a broad audience, there was no feedback mechanism from the target audience because the dissemination needed more specificity. Afghanistan Soccer Ball Incident (2007) In August 2007, protests occurred in Afghanistan after the U.S. military dropped soccer balls from a helicopter in Khost province. The soccer balls displayed flags from around the world, including Saudi Arabia, whose flag features the Islamic declaration of faith, the Shahada. For Muslims, the name of Allah is revered, and placing a verse from the Quran on a ball intended to be kicked by feet was a significant insult. The operation aimed to promote cooperation while engaging with Afghan youth and building unity to counteract insurgent influence. However, the cultural insensitivity of displaying a religious text on an item associated with the foot resulted in backlash and further exacerbated tensions, undermining the operational objectives. Furthermore, the incident allowed insurgents to exploit the misstep and message anti-coalition sentiment. The indicators of potential iatrogenic influence were present and likely evident before mission execution. First, there was a significant inconsistency between the delivery mechanism and the desired effect. Building rapport and cooperation occurs not by dropping objects out of a helicopter but through face-to-face communication. If the U.S. servicemembers had chosen to distribute the balls in person, they would have had an immediate cultural feedback mechanism. The first individual to respond angrily to receiving a ball with a Saudi flag would have been a clear signal of the messaging error and would have mitigated the backlash. If historical mistrust existed between the Afghans and coalition members in that region, it would have required consistent and persistent messaging rather than a solitary product to build trust. White Dog Leaflets (2017) In 2017, U.S. forces dropped leaflets in parts of Parwan province, Afghanistan, that depicted the image of a lion chasing a white dog with the Shahada printed on it. The operation intended to use the white dog to represent the Taliban flag, which is white with the Shahada. However, the printing of the Muslim profession of faith on an animal that many Muslims view as unclean was deemed deeply offensive and severely eroded local trust in coalition forces. Maj. Gen. James Linder, then the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, was forced to make a statement and apologize for the leaflets. Later, a Taliban suicide bomber detonated outside an American base, wounding four civilians, with the Taliban claiming it was retaliation for the leaflet. The use of religious content drastically increases the likelihood of iatrogenic influence by potentially oversimplifying the content or disseminating it through a false lens. The Taliban did not accidentally stumble upon the decision to have the white flag with the Shahada as their rallying symbol; it was a deliberate decision with ramifications in the information environment, and the U.S. military’s decision to oversimplify their assumptions about the Taliban resulted in severe consequences. The leaflets intended to inspire the local population to report the activities of Taliban members to coalition forces for elimination; however, because of iatrogenic influence, the credibility of U.S. forces was decreased instead. The leaflets needed to show evidence of a precise target audience, and there existed a disconnect between the delivery mechanism and the intended message. Since villages would have to find coalition members to communicate Taliban locations, disseminating this message through a leaflet does not make sense. With limited feedback mechanisms, this operation may have attempted to demonstrate performance measures within U.S. military hierarchies, which raise concerns about ethics. Analysis and Lessons Learned When examining instances where information operations in the GWOT had an iatrogenic effect, certain consistencies occur. By reviewing the publicly available case studies and through retrospective examination of a broader context, a trend arises of critical indicators that may signal an increased risk of iatrogenic influence. Table 1 summarizes the key indicators: Table 1: Iatrogenic Influence Indicators IndicatorDescriptionRiskBroad General AudienceThe operation targets a broad, general audience rather than a specific group, which makes performing target audience analysis difficult.The messages may be misrepresented or misinterpreted, resulting in rejection, resentment, confusion, or opposition.Inconsistent DeliveryMechanismThe dissemination method is inconsistent with the desired behavior or outcome.The target audience may question the nature of the messages and perceive them as superficial.False Cultural LensThe operation’s disseminators view products through their own cultural lens rather than the target audience’s perspective.Messages may inadvertently provoke backlash or negative emotions for violating the target audience’s cultural norms, beliefs, or values.Inconsistent Messaging/Information FratricideInconsistent or contradictory messaging among various stakeholders that is supposed to be mutually supportive.Undermines credibility and leads to skepticism or confusion about messaging and the messengers.Historical MistrustThe target audience has a history of mistrust or negative perceptions toward the source.Messages are more likely to be dismissed or viewed skeptically, exacerbating existing tensions.Deceptive TacticsThe campaign relies on deception, disinformation, or manipulation.Loss of credibility and trust if deception is uncovered; adversaries can exploit to discredit the campaign.Ethical and Moral ConcernsTactics or messages raise ethical or moral concerns.It provokes outrage and condemnation, undermining the operation’s legitimacy and enabling adversary propaganda.Insufficient FeedbackMechanismsThere are no mechanisms to gather and respond to feedback from the target audience.Adverse reactions may go unnoticed and unaddressed, allowing iatrogenic influence to grow.Oversimplification of IssuesCampaign oversimplifies complex issues.They are perceived as superficial or patronizing, failing to resonate and potentially reinforcing adversary narratives.Dynamic and RapidlyChanging EnvironmentThe environment is dynamic and rapidly changing.Messages can become outdated or irrelevant, perceived as incompetent or detached from current realities. Lesson Learned: As the Target Audience Size Increases, So Does the Risk In the three cases examined in this paper, the target audience was general and non-specific. When performing information operations, the smaller the target audience, the better the ability to perform target audience analysis and ensure the message is well received. As the target audience grows, so does the risk of iatrogenic influence. When disseminating messages to a large general audience, limitations on the options for delivery mechanism exacerbate the potential for a cascading series of uncontrollable responses. While face-to-face communication is slow and constricts an operation’s ability to have an extensive reach, Internet-based operations that involve the public release of photos have few decision points where commanders can correct the course of events. In the case of soccer balls in Afghanistan, dropping objects from a helicopter enables rapid dissemination. Still, it limits the ability to recover products following violating iatrogenic influence indicators. In future operations, commanders should limit general audience distribution and concentrate on targeted influence operations that limit risk while simultaneously increasing the likelihood of the message resonating. Lesson Learned: The Messenger Matters In each case study, official Department of Defense communication channels delivered the messages as an official release or from a military helicopter. The difficulty of information delivery occurs when the target audience realizes they do not identify with the messengers, increasing the barriers to resonation within the target audience. The special operations community made this realization in 2010, deciding to integrate all-female cultural support teams into special operations missions. Unsurprisingly, special operations soldiers conducting combat missions were having difficulty communicating with women and children and building trust among the local populace. As a result, the U.S. Special Operations Command issued a tasking order specifying five critical cultural support team tasks, including supporting information operations messaging to the female population and minimizing civilian interference with military operations. Commanders lauded the cultural support team concept as a resounding success and demonstrated that the messenger is at least as important as the message in all aspects of information operations. In future operations, commanders must strive to have the messenger meet all the traits of their target audience, just as Radio Sahar, the all-female Afghan radio station, did. It is important to emphasize that selecting a reflective messenger is not an action of deception; the messenger must remain truthful about their message and transparent about its attribution. Instead, it is simply an effort to allow the message to be heard among the target audience and given a chance to resonate. Lesson Learned: Legitimacy Before Influence In each case study, coalition forces attempted to utilize legitimacy shortcuts to influence their audiences. In the case of the white dog leaflets, U.S. servicemembers desired an increase in reports of Taliban locations. However, civilians need someone to report to—a person, or at least a method of communication they trust would not be used by malicious actors to punish people making reports. Likewise, in the soccer ball and Guantanamo prisoner case studies, the activities demonstrated a coalition self-perceived sense of superiority. In contrast, events like the 2006–7 Anbar Awakening demonstrate the effectiveness of establishing legitimacy before attempting influence. When Col. Sean MacFarland and 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division, arrived in al Anbar province, Ramadi was one of the most dangerous cities in Iraq, with more than three times more attacks per capita than any other area. Colonel MacFarland led the brigade in engaging directlywith tribal leaders, respecting their culture, and addressing the root causes of the population’s grievances. Once it established legitimacy, the brigade used a face-to-face dissemination mechanism consistent with its message. Through town halls, tribal councils, and direct communication, the soldiers built popular support. They worked with Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha to unite the tribes against al-Qaeda and stabilize the region. Conclusion The twenty-year GWOT provides numerous case studies to examine missteps in the information environment and recognize missed opportunities. Iatrogenic influence occurs where the consequences of information operations efforts are harmful and counterproductive. While this article used case studies of iatrogenic influence to identify indicators of high-risk operations, examining successful case studies will improve organizational success by recognizing when iatrogenic influence is appropriately mitigated. In the modern era, where adversaries rapidly aggregate influence capabilities, U.S. forces must recognize the lessons of iatrogenic influence. Contemporary conflicts are increasingly occurring in the cognitive domain, further demonstrating the necessity of U.S. civilian and military organizations to have cultural literacy when working in the information environment. Learning lessons from past GWOT operations and recognizing the possibility of iatrogenic influence will go a long way in America’s ability to use influence activities to our advantage in the future.

Outrage At Munich – Analysis	By Amrita Narlikar Following the World Economic Forum that convenes at Davos, another jamboree takes place in Munich. There is usually a fair overlap of key protagonists in the two settings, plus an additional, safe familiarity of reliable faces that have been invitees for years (and sometimes, decades) in the respective forum. For all the resources guzzled in organising these events and the media coverage surrounding them, they tend to be tame affairs involving men and women in expensive suits who speak politely of reforming the system and then return home to business as usual. So the speech by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on 14 February at the Munich Security Conference has shaken many of the global elite to the core. The anger is undisguised, especially among the Europeans. The German Defence Minister, Boris Pistorius, described Vance’s critique as 'not acceptable'. For the European Foreign Policy Chief, Kaja Kallas, the speech sounded as if '… they try to pick a fight with us…'. The German Chancellor pushed back firmly and said that neither Germany nor Europe would accept outside interference, especially not from friends and allies. Social media platforms are alight with indignation against Vance. Why has the speech ruffled so many feathers? First, Vance, delivering his speech with aplomb, had the temerity to articulate a view that few dare to voice publicly: democratic backsliding (not in the Global South, as is common practice for Western actors to bemoan), but in Europe’s heartland. While Europe’s political establishment is unreserved in criticising the state of democracy, pluralism, and liberalism in the rest of the world, it resents being at the receiving end of similar scrutiny and commentary. Second, Vance went a step further: he framed his speech in terms of shared Transatlantic values. There is legitimate concern that Trump’s transactionalism may result in a sidelining of global norms; that his Vice President embraces the language of values should have been welcomed with open arms. But 'normative power Europe' seems to think it is the sole proprietor and representative of values. Third, Vance made only one passing reference to Russia and Ukraine in his speech in the context of reaching a 'reasonable settlement' between the two, and urged Europe 'to step up in a big way to provide for its own defence'. While many European leaders acknowledged the importance of burden-sharing as part of their NATO membership, the MSC audience at large seemed shocked and disappointed that Vance’s speech had incorporated such a cursory reference to the war on Europe’s borders. These are typical European double standards at work, already called out by the Indian Minister for External Affairs, Dr S. Jaishankar in 2023: Europe has the mindset that its 'problems are the world’s problem, but the world’s problem are not Europe’s problem.' Now that we finally have an administration that wants to ensure a division of labour between Europe and the US, with the latter focusing on the China challenge in the Indo-Pacific, Europe finds itself in a deeply uncomfortable position. Finally, Vance poked a hornet’s nest by referring to the challenges of 'mass migration' in Europe and made himself an easy target for the moral outrage of self-righteous, self-styled liberals. His speech could have certainly done with more nuance on this question of existential importance to many—including the emigrants who endure great dangers in the hope of reaching countries of safety and opportunity and then end up facing xenophobia and worse. But a much more serious discussion is needed on both legal and illegal immigration in Europe. Simply pretending that the problem does not exist and demonising Vance for his critique helps no one. Vance’s comments on the fragilities of European democracy hit too close to home. The great and the good of Europe seem to resent Vance’s 'physician, heal thyself' approach, doubly so perhaps because it makes it difficult for a governing elite to deflect attention away from serious domestic problems. Viewed from outside Europe, Vance’s speech offered some refreshing perspectives. Instead of a Transatlantic club of mutual admiration, with the rest of the world excluded from the party, something more interesting could be in the offing. This is not a US that is trying to destroy Europe or NATO (contra what some of the social media frenzy has suggested), but a mature power that recognises both the worth and the limitations of the Transatlantic partnership. If the EU opens up to some self-reflection, which it often demands from the Global South, it could build a more honest and lasting Transatlantic alliance that also welcomes other like-minded partners (including India). Vance’s speech told us something reassuring about America’s continued attachment to values. This will be one of several reasons why the US is likely to want to deepen its relationship with the world’s largest democracy. But the speech, and the reaction it generated, also ended up revealing a great deal about Europe’s political landscape. Vance, through his MSC speech, held up a mirror to Europe. The indignation exploding in Europe and beyond is simply the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in the glass.

Indonesia’s Probable Foreign Policy Shift From The West Under A P...	By Melinda Martinus The inauguration of Prabowo Subianto as Indonesia’s president and the appointment of Sugiono, a former military officer, as foreign minister mark a potential recalibration of Indonesia’s foreign diplomacy. This transition is expected to modify the foreign policy framework established during Joko Widodo’s decade-long presidency, which sought to serve domestic economic objectives over projecting regional or global leadership.[1] The new administration is anticipated to adopt a more assertive international stance, influenced by Prabowo’s personal experiences,[2] rapidly evolving geopolitical dynamics, Indonesia’s rising economic prominence, and a growing consensus among Jakarta’s policymakers on the need for a more proactive global diplomatic role.[3] While the country may project stronger global leadership, Prabowo’s presidency is likely to gradually shift Indonesia’s alignment further away from Western alliances—a trend that had already gained traction among Jakarta’s foreign policy elites during Jokowi’s administration. Under Jokowi’s leadership, Indonesia developed closer economic ties with China, which has emerged as Indonesia’s major trade partner, and with Singapore, which is its largest provider of foreign direct investment (FDI). The previous administration also made some efforts at strengthening alliances within Asia, particularly through cooperation within ASEAN and with key economies like Japan and South Korea, including defence cooperation with Russia[4] and India.[5] Key drivers behind this shift include the need to bolster economic growth, reinforce the principle of non-alignment, and diversify international partnerships beyond traditional Western powers. A few weeks after his inauguration, Prabowo’s administration signalled a reinforcement in this foreign policy direction, notably by deciding to become a BRICS partner. His first overseas trip was to China, where he met with President Xi Jinping to discuss economic and security cooperation. A surprise came with the joint statement issued after the bilateral meeting, which included an agreement on joint development in areas of the South China Sea where Indonesia and China have overlapping claims. This marked a significant departure from Indonesia’s previous stance on the South China Sea. With this statement, Indonesia appears to be the first ASEAN member state to implicitly recognise Beijing’s nine-dash line.[6] This article seeks to further analyse four critical dimensions that influence Indonesia’s foreign policy pivot under the new administration, namely adapting to the US’ protectionism, managing the EU’s conditionality, advancing the Palestinian cause, and strengthening ASEAN resilience. The analysis provided in this article draws on insights from the multi-year data from the State of Southeast Asia surveys[7] conducted by the ASEAN Studies Centre of ISEAS –Yusof Ishak Institute to highlight emerging trends and anticipated shifts away from Western-led initiatives. Rather than making specific predictions, this article showcases long-term perception trends among Indonesia’s foreign policy elites through the use of data and evidence to elaborate on the changes in strategic alignments. ADAPTING TO US PROTECTIONISM Under Prabowo’s leadership, Indonesia is likely to sustain its focus on natural resource-driven and infrastructure developmental policies to meet an 8 per cent annual growth target—an essential step to reach high-income status by 2045.[8] The 'downstreaming'[9] strategy initiated under Jokowi, which restricts exports of raw minerals like nickel and bauxite, aims to strengthen domestic industries and move Indonesia further up the value chain in electric vehicle (EV) battery production, something that has become a key economic policy. However, the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) enacted in 2022 to bolster US industrial competitiveness, mandates domestic sourcing and assembly requirements, which many partners view as protectionist. The IRA’s tax credits for clean energy production, such as electric vehicles (EVs), favour materials sourced domestically or from countries with free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US. Since Indonesia lacks an FTA with the US, these policies effectively obstruct its ambition to integrate into the EV supply chain.[10] Additionally, the IRA restricts involvement from 'foreign entities of concern,' notably targeting Chinese entities, who are instrumental in providing capital investment for Indonesia’s battery sector. The current political environment might complicate Indonesia’s ability to negotiate mineral and battery exports to the US. Consequently, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), a US-led initiative aimed at strengthening regional economic cooperation, has received only lukewarm interest from Indonesia. Indonesia perceives that the IPEF falls short of meeting its economic needs, especially as US policies like the IRA undercut the framework’s goal of enhancing connectivity with Asian partners. This disconnect reinforces Indonesia’s doubts about the framework’s benefits, particularly in light of restrictive US trade requirements that clash with its economic priorities. More so, the IPEF, focused on trade, supply chain resilience, clean energy, and economic fairness, does not include tariff reductions, which limits its appeal as a trade-enhancing agreement that is needed by most US trading partners in Asia. According to the State of Southeast Asia survey, most Indonesian elite respondents initially expressed uncertainty about the IPEF’s benefits (see Chart 1). In 2023, 52.1 per cent were uncertain, while 34.7 per cent viewed it positively and 13.2 per cent negatively. However, by 2024, perceptions had shifted. Although the majority (41.9 per cent) of Indonesian respondents remained uncertain, the proportion of those with a negative view almost doubled to 25.7 per cent. Indonesia may perceive that joining the IPEF would not help to lift restrictions brought by the IRA. Under Prabowo’s leadership, Indonesia is expected to remain wary of US protectionism, particularly following president-elect and now President Trump’s election and his pledge to increase tariffs on Asian imports. This concern is further heightened by the likelihood that his party will depart from Biden administration policies, downplaying the IPEF, and reducing focus on ASEAN engagement. This may prompt Indonesia to reduce its reliance on the US as an export market and to seek broader trade cooperation with less protectionist partners such as BRICS, which could offer alternatives to Western standards, and also with Asian countries like China, Japan, and South Korea. Additionally, Indonesia may deepen ties with the Gulf states, especially to generate new sources of FDI. Chart 1 Growing Pessimism on the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) The overall impact and effectiveness of the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) (according to Indonesian respondents), is likely to be: The State of Southeast Asia: 2024 Survey Report (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2024) MANAGING THE EU’S CONDITIONALITIES Amid rising US protectionism, Indonesia’s scepticism toward Western trade conditionalities is mirrored in its diminishing perceptions of the European Union (EU). As Indonesia’s fifth-largest trading partner and a major source of foreign direct investment,[11] the EU has traditionally been valued as an alternative partner for export market, particularly as global trade adapts to the intensifying US-China trade war and China’s domestic economic turbulence. However, Indonesia increasingly views EU regulatory stances, on standards such as sustainability, labour protection, and human rights, as restrictive. This adds challenges to the forging of functional relationships and tampers enthusiasm for deeper economic alignment. The EU’s efforts to assert global leadership in carbon reduction, as pledged in the Paris Agreement and operationalised through the EU Green Deal, has increasingly incorporated extraterritorial regulations affecting trade partners. Policies like the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) require trade partners to meet elevated environmental standards. These have generated negative sentiments, with Jakarta viewing them as forms of economic coercion[12] that infringe on its sovereignty and development ambitions; this complicates relations between the EU and Indonesia broadly. The situation has further diminished perceptions of the EU among policymakers in Jakarta (See Chart 2). According to the State of Southeast Asia surveys, Indonesian respondents initially held favourable views of the EU’s role in promoting global free trade. In the 2021 survey, 29.5 per cent of respondents viewed the EU as a primary leader in this area, ahead of China (20.9 per cent), ASEAN (19.4 per cent), and the US (15.5 per cent). However, by 2024, perceptions had shifted dramatically, with only 8.3 per cent of Indonesian respondents regarding the EU as showing leadership, placing it in fourth place alongside the US. Chart 2. Confidence in the EU’s leadership in championing the global free trade agenda has been dwindling, 2021 versus 2024 Who do you have the most confidence in to champion the global free trade agenda? (This is according to Indonesian respondents) The State of Southeast Asia: 2021 and 2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021 and 2024) The Prabowo administration is likely to intensify Indonesia’s stance against EU trade conditions by promoting partnerships with countries imposing fewer constraints. In seeking alternative alliances, Prabowo aims to reinforce Indonesia’s economic sovereignty, advocating trade frameworks that support domestic industries free from restrictive external pressures.[13] This approach underscores Indonesia’s commitment to a global economic order that accommodates diverse development paths, thus protecting its own strategic interests amid shifting international dynamics. ADVANCING THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE Indonesia’s trust in the Western alliance has been strained due to the latter’s perceived partiality in the Israel-Gaza conflict and double standards. Western nations, including the US and EU members, often advocate for human rights, international law, and civilian protection, most recently when they were rallying support for Ukraine. However, in the Gaza context, Indonesians see the West’s support for Israel as blatant ignoring of the humanitarian crises faced by Palestinians; this fuels perceptions of selective enforcement by the West of international norms based on political interests rather than universal principles. This sentiment resonates deeply with Indonesian public opinion. According to the State of Southeast Asia 2024 Survey, about three-quarters (74.5 per cent) of Indonesian respondents viewed the Israel-Hamas conflict as the top geopolitical concern for their government while 77.7 per cent believed that Israel’s attack on Gaza had gone too far. Trust in Western alliances, particularly the US and EU, has trended downward among Indonesian respondents in the State of Southeast Asia Surveys over the past six years (see Chart 3). This decline was especially sharp for the EU in 2024, reaching an all-time low, largely due to the West’s stance on the Gaza conflict. Trust in the US was initially low in 2019–2020 under Trump’s leadership but improved under Biden’s administration, with the latter emphasising US re-engagement with Asia. However, the trust in the US has been tempering again over the past two years. This could be attributed to the US’ lack of concrete functional cooperation in Asia, and the worsening situation in Gaza. Chart 3. Declinig confidence in US and EU leadership How confident are you that the US and the EU (respectively) will do the right thing to contribute to global peace, prosperity, and governance? (This is according to Indonesian respondents who indicated confident and highly confident) The State of Southeast Asia: 2019-2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021-2024) To complicate matters, amid ongoing US-China geopolitical tensions in Southeast Asia, Indonesia is often viewed as a country capable of maintaining a strategic balance. Since the 2020 survey introduced a question on ASEAN’s strategic preference between the US and China, Indonesian respondents have shown a consistent approach towards balancing the two powers. In 2020, by a slim margin at 52.0 per cent, Indonesians chose China over the US (which garnered 48.0 per cent) (see Chart 4). Between 2021 and 2022, most respondents had leaned toward the US. However, by 2023, preferences had shifted significantly, with 53.7 per cent favouring China compared to 46.3 per cent for the US. In 2024, the gap substantially widened, with 74.2 per cent favouring China and only 26.8 per cent choosing the US. This significant shift signals that the US’ stance on the Gaza conflict has undermined its reputation in Indonesia. Chart 4. Future of ASEAN amid China-US rivalry If ASEAN were forced to align itself with one of the strategic rivals, which should it choose? (This is according to Indonesian respondents) The State of Southeast Asia: 2020-2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021-2024) REVIVING ASEAN-CENTRIC REGIONALISM Amid today’s global uncertainties, Indonesia must find a pathway to navigate the escalating geopolitical competition. Enhancing its leadership within ASEAN and reinforcing regionalism may provide a cushion in case of future conflicts. Consequently, Prabowo is likely to project a more proactive regional role. While Prabowo may insist that his administration must adhere to a 'free and active' foreign policy and maintain balanced ties with both the US and China, he is expected to adopt a more assertive stance within ASEAN, particularly on security and economic matters.[14] This strategy corroborates well with the views of foreign policy elites in Jakarta. According to The State of Southeast Asia surveys, Indonesians increasingly view ASEAN as an essential counterbalance to China’s dominant economic role in the region (see Chart 5). Although China continues to be regarded as the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia, Indonesia’s confidence in ASEAN is gaining momentum. When the first survey was conducted in 2020, only 10.4 per cent of Indonesian respondents viewed ASEAN as the most influential economic force in the region; by 2024, this share had nearly tripled (28 per cent). Amid geoeconomic uncertainties, ASEAN has upheld its multilateral trade frameworks, most notably through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and continues to negotiate trade agreements and investment facilitation with major dialogue partners. This openness and commitment to multilateral systems have led Indonesians to place high hopes in ASEAN. Chart 5. China remains the most influential economic power, while confidence in ASEAN continues to rise In your view, which country/regional organisation is the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia? The State of Southeast Asia: 2019-2024 Survey Reports (Singapore: ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, 2021-2024) A similar trend is observed in perceptions of global leadership. In the same surveys, respondents were asked which country or regional organisation they had the strongest confidence in to provide leadership in maintaining the rules-based order and upholding international law. Among Indonesian respondents, ASEAN has increasingly been seen as the leader in this regard over the past three years, surpassing the EU, which held that position in 2021 (see Chart 6). ASEAN has consistently advocated for a rules-based multilateral system, both regionally and globally. It has promoted dialogue, cooperation, and the peaceful resolution of disputes through frameworks such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the East Asia Summit (EAS). ASEAN also played a critical role in advocating the implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and the ongoing negotiations for a Code of Conduct (COC) to manage regional tensions. Although progress has been slow, ASEAN continues to emphasise the importance of international law in resolving conflicts. Chart 6. ASEAN increasingly seen as the leader in maintaining rules-based order and upholding international law Who do you have the most confidence in to provide leadership to maintain the rules-based order and uphold international law? (This is according to Indonesian respondents) Looking at this trend, Indonesia could advocate a stronger regional security architecture, and emphasise the defence of maritime sovereignty amid Chinese incursions. On the economic front, the Prabowo administration may focus on improving intra-regional trade, strengthening supply chains, and boosting investment within Southeast Asia. However, structural challenges within ASEAN, such as divergent interests and strategic misalignment among member states, will likely constrain progress toward a collective regional security framework. Despite these challenges, Indonesia is expected to remain committed to ASEAN centrality, and to use that as a platform to balance external powers and promote autonomy.[15] CONCLUSION In conclusion, Indonesia’s foreign policy under Prabowo Subianto is poised to mark a significant shift away from its traditional Western alliances, reflecting both changing domestic priorities and evolving geopolitical dynamics. The administration’s focus on economic growth, regional security, and international diplomacy is likely to reinforce Indonesia’s strategic autonomy, with particular emphasis being put on deepening ties within Asia and diversifying its partnerships. With the appointment of several former military personnel to his Cabinet, including as foreign minister, Indonesia is expected to adopt a more security-oriented lens in its economic policies and international diplomacy. Indonesia’s growing scepticism towards Western trade conditionalities, such as those imposed by the US and EU, will likely continue to influence its foreign policy direction; it is expected to seek alternatives to economic frameworks that are perceived as restrictive. At the same time, Indonesia’s commitment to ASEAN as a central platform for regional cooperation and leadership, particularly in upholding a rules-based order, reflects the nation’s desire to enhance its regional influence while navigating the complex US-China rivalry. As the Prabowo administration seeks to recalibrate Indonesia’s international posture, the evolving trends in regional and global leadership suggest that Indonesia’s foreign policy will increasingly be driven by a vision of economic sovereignty and multilateral engagement, with ASEAN and potentially BRICS playing a pivotal role in this transformation.

How China Is Weaponizing Its Dominance In Critical Minerals Trade...	By Keith Rockwell Export curbs applied to technology or critical raw materials are often justified by the need to promote downstream industries, the raising of revenue and environmental protection. But there are other motivations, including the desire to gain an upper hand on a geopolitical rival. Governments justify export restrictions as necessary for national security, an ill-defined concept often used to defend trade-distorting actions. During the 2007 food crisis, countries hoarded rice and maize. During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments applied export bans on vaccines and medical diagnostic products. The war in Ukraine saw Russia restricting agricultural, mineral and energy exports. An average of more than 110 export restrictions were introduced each yearbetween 2021–23. China’s December 2024 ban on exports to the United States of critical raw materials was predictable, given their strategic value in the production of semiconductors, electric batteries and armaments. The number of restrictions on the export of critical raw materials applied by governments grew more than five-fold between 2009–20 to 13,102. But this move represents a dangerous step which will further damage US–China relations. Gallium is used in semiconductors, germanium in both semiconductors and infrared technologies, antimony in the production of everything from bullets to missiles, while graphite is critical for electric batteries. China dominates the world market in all of these materials, producing roughly 60 per cent of the world’s germanium, 80 per cent of global gallium production and 78 per cent of antimony. The perceived utility of export curbs was underscored when China replied to Donald Trump’s decision to hit Chinese goods with 10 per cent tariffs. In addition to its imposing import duties on automobiles and filing a dispute settlement case at the World Trade Organization, Beijing imposed another layer of export restrictions on 4 February, this time on materials used in the production of military, information technology and clean energy products. Beijing’s muscle flexing signals to Trump that it will respond aggressively to Washington’s cascade of trade restrictions. In the past, China’s actions have been a direct response to the cavalcade of technology sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies. In 2018, the Trump administration banned Huawei and ZTE telecommunications equipment for government use. US allies later adopted similar prohibitions. Under former president Joe Biden, the United States banned exports to China of advanced semiconductors, quantum computing equipment and lithography equipment, also barring Japanese and Dutch companies using US technology from exporting to China. Reciprocal sanctions have driven up costs for both US and Chinese tech companies and fuelled national security concerns. Washington’s fear of being shut out of supply chains led the Biden administration to completely rethink its approach. Sustainability and ‘friendshoring’ became the principal objectives. In 2006 and 2010, China imposed export restrictions on rare earth minerals that are important components in defence technologies, clean energy products, smartphones, digital cameras and computer hard disks. China is the dominant global producer of rare earths, mining 240,000 tonnes in 2023. Chinese reserves at the end of 2023 amounted to 44 million tonnes. By contrast, the United States — the second largest producer — extracted 43,000 tonnes and had reserves of 1.8 million tonnes. Alarmed at the prospect of being cut off from rare earth supplies, Washington, Brussels and Tokyo all brought cases against China to the World Trade Organization in 2012. The United States argued that the artificial shortage of these minerals constituted a national security threat. In 2014, dispute settlement panels ruled in their favour and the Chinese measures were withdrawn. Trade restrictions have been unsettling and costly, but have also inspired companies to adapt, either with alternative technologies or by exploring new sources of materials. Despite US sanctions, Chinese companies have shown surprising resilience. Cut off from imports of advanced chips, Huawei developed its own advanced semiconductor for its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. Barred from using technologies like Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android in the production of its smartphones, the company unveiled in August 2023 its own operating system, HarmonyOS NEXT. Price surges for scarce minerals — gallium has risen 212 per cent from its 2020 price of US$298.20 per kilogram — have also driven new entrants to the mining business, threatening China’s dominant position. This mirrors the rising global production of rare earth metals since 1995, jumping from 75.7 kilotons to more than 350 kilotons in 2023. It is impossible to predict whether Trump will ramp up sanctions against China or seek a deal for greater access to the vast Chinese market. He is a dealmaker, but has also pledged to levy tariffs as high as 60 per cent on all Chinese goods and has surrounded himself with China hawks who will encourage a hard line. Distrust of Beijing in Washington is deep and cuts across party lines. Many US commentators see China weakened by slowing economic growth, demographic challenges and few real allies. But it would be a mistake to take China lightly. The January announcement that Chinese tech company Deepseek has developed an artificial intelligence model at a fraction of the cost of Western companies is further proof of this. President Xi Jinping is determined to preserve and augment China’s greatness and has made clear that any future aggression will be dealt with promptly and formidably. Even before Trump’s decisive victory in November, the US–China relationship was volatile. As he retakes the White House, there is a real risk that relations will deteriorate further. Keeping a lid on trade tensions will be a tall order. About the author: Keith M Rockwell is Senior Research Fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and Global Fellow at the Wilson Center.

Elections Won’t Save Haiti – OpEd	By Caleb Mills In a recent interview with TV5 Monde, Haiti’s transitional council president Leslie Voltaire told a nation on the brink of collapse that tentative elections would be scheduled for mid-November. It’s been nearly a decade since the small island’s last democratic contest, and understandably so. The guardrails for democracy have all but collapsed in the years since, and in its place, anarchical gang warfare has swept across a broken state. It begs the question; can a country where half the inhabitants currently face starvation support an election? Is Haiti’s violent political climate right for a democratic transition? The situation on the ground is critical. In the two years since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, Haiti has crumbled under the weight of local competing gangs and warlords. By 2023, roughly 60% of the capital city, Port-au-Prince, was occupied by non-governmental factions, with violence openly tearing into the streets and bringing everyday life to a standstill. For many, like musician Jean Jean-Pierre, simply leaving the house was a dauntingly dangerous task. 'When you do go out you are so aware of everything – a car behind you, a motorcycle behind you. You never know if a vehicle just wants to pass you, or pass you and force you to stop for a kidnapping because it happens so often,' Jean-Pierre toldUSA Today in March 2023. The situation has not improved almost two years after he made that statement. As a result, mass displacement of local residents has become a pressing issue for authorities in Port-Au-Prince. 'The gangs forced us out. I lost my parents – my mother and father. The gangs burned them alive in the house, and now we can’t go back,' one refugee told Reuters. Besides the recent introduction of an 800-strong UN peacekeeping force, little else has been done to quell the violence that has ravaged the island. In December, gang leader Micanor 'Mikanò' Altès was accused by the Haitian government of carrying out a massacre of nearly 200 people, following accusations of witchcraft in regard to his child’s illness. 'The massacre was triggered by the severe illness of his child. Micanor sought advice from a voodoo priest (‘bókò’) who accused elderly people in the area of practicing witchcraft and harming the child,' a report referenced by CNN said. 'On Friday, December 6, Micanor shot and killed at least 60 elderly individuals. On Saturday, December 7, he and his group killed at least 50 more using machetes and knives. Despite his actions, his ill child passed away. In addition, violence and political instability have brought the island to the brink of all-out famine. According to a report from the Food Security Phase Classification, over 5 million Haitians in September were at risk for starvation, with 18% facing emergency-level hunger. From a logistical perspective, holding elections in this environment may not even be possible. The amount of investment required by the state to organize such a polarizing event would require a level of both hard and soft power which Haiti severely lacks. Furthermore, even if elections were successfully held, the legitimacy of such a contest would immediately be called into question, considering that Port-au-Prince lacks territorial sovereignty over its own country. Will competing gangs allow Haitians to even vote? Could polling booths become the next victim of the unmitigated violence that these gangs have wrought over the island? By almost every facet at thus juncture, holding elections in Haiti would not only prove irresponsible, but perhaps impossible altogether. Ballots can’t feed the hungry. Nor does campaigning and electoral posturing do much to stabilize a failed state. While the consistent pursuit of the democratic tradition is ultimately in Haiti’s best interest, the timing for that noble experiment may be slightly off. Voltaire’s push to form a democratically elected government is admirable, but it does little to solve the very pressing issues currently facing his country. Achieving democratic representation must be the final step in a long, drawn-out process towards rejuvenation. Elections won’t save Haiti; only a concerted, national program for recovery can do that.

What We Learned From High-Stakes US-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia ...	By Reid Standish (RFE/RL) -- Top U.S. and Russian officials have finished their first talks on ending the war in Ukraine, with the Kremlin voicing new demands as Washington and Moscow agreed to move quickly to normalize their ties and begin negotiations around the nearly three-year conflict. The more than four-hour meeting in Riyadh -- which was attended by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov -- is part of a major diplomatic push by the United States to bring the war to an end. The discussions were framed by U.S. officials as exploratory talks that could pave the way for a potential in-person meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rubio told reporters after the February 18 meeting in the Saudi capital that the talks were 'the first step of a long and difficult journey' over ending the war in Ukraine and that the U.S. and Russian delegations agreed on four principles during their discussions. These comprise fully restoring their diplomatic missions in Washington and Moscow after years of sanctions and expulsions, appointing a high-level team to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, exploring further 'geopolitical and economic cooperation that could result from an end to the conflict in Ukraine,' and ensuring that the U.S. and Russian delegations present in Riyadh will remain engaged in discussions moving forward. Lavrov called the meeting 'very useful' and said Moscow would aim to appoint a special envoy as soon as possible. 'I have every reason to believe that the American side understands our position,' Lavrov said. Russia's chief foreign policy adviser, Yury Ushakov, who was part of the country's delegation, added that the two sides briefly discussed the conditions needed for a Putin-Trump summit. However, he added that the decision to begin deeper talks with the United States about Ukraine would ultimately rest with Putin himself. 'It's useful for the Trump administration's senior national-security team to hear these Russian positions and they can take them back to the president,' John Deni, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told RFE/RL. 'It's still too early to know what the Russians might be willing to give up or hold onto.' Key Takeaways From Saudi Meeting (Diplomatic) Boots On The Ground. The two sides agreed to re-staff their diplomatic posts in Washington and Moscow. It's a diplomatic spat that predates the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, stretching into the first Trump administration (dozens expelled on both sides), and even the Obama administration, which also shuttered two diplomatic compounds in the States. Putting more diplomats on the ground is, by all accounts, fairly noncontroversial. For its part, the Kremlin signaled prior to Riyadh it wants those compounds back. Give Peace A Chance. The delegations agreed to create a high-level team to focus specifically on the Ukraine conflict. But the devil is in the details: Is NATO membership off the table? European peacekeepers? More weapons for Kyiv? Fewer sanctions for Moscow? We won't get any hints of what's on the table for weeks. Something else to watch: a side comment made earlier by Putin in the Kremlin readout of his call with Trump, which referenced 'root causes' of the Ukraine war. If it pops up again, it may augur bad news for Ukrainian independence or autonomy. 'Closer Relations And Economic Cooperation.' That can mean pretty much anything, but one bit of low-hanging fruit for closer relations is space cooperation. Russia and the United States for years largely succeeded in shielding their joint space work from politics. That's atrophied in recent years. Signing a new agreement between NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, would be an easy, noncontroversial move. What Came From The Meetings? The meeting appears to have laid the foundation for future talks between Moscow and Washington, with both Rubio and Lavrov saying each side will restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow to create missions to support Ukraine peace talks, bilateral relations, and cooperation more broadly. In a statement, the U.S. State Department said delegations from both countries have agreed to 'address irritants' in their ties with the goal of normalizing diplomatic relations after years of tensions. Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said both countries will explore 'future cooperation' but cautioned an exact timeline still remains unclear, noting, 'One phone call followed by one meeting is not sufficient to establish enduring peace.'She added the Riyadh talks are an early step in a longer process. Lavrov said the two sides 'practically agreed' that they need to resolve issues concerning the functioning of diplomatic missions. On Ukraine, he said there was 'a mutual desire' to find solutions and Russia will wait for the United States to appoint its representatives. 'After that, relevant consultations will begin and will be regular,' he said. The Russian foreign minister added the potential of any deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine -- which has been floated by some Western governments -- would be a 'completely unacceptable' proposal for the Kremlin. Separately, Russian officials said a long-term peace deal in Ukraine will not be possible without addressing a wider range of security concerns across Europe. 'A comprehensive long-term settlement is impossible without a comprehensive consideration of security issues on the continent,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on February 18. Peskov also said Putin would be open to talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'if necessary.' Putin had previously said he was unwilling to negotiate with Zelenskyy because his rule is 'illegitimate,' in part because Ukraine has not held elections since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly three years ago. Speaking in Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow wants NATO to disavow its 2008 promise to one day give Ukraine membership of the military alliance, and for Kyiv to agree to neutrality. What Happens Next? Both sides all agreed to appoint envoys and continue talks moving forward. Rubio also hinted at a role for the EU further down the line, saying that 'there are other parties that have sanctions, the European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point, because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.' Jana Puglierin, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said both Kyiv and its European allies have watched anxiously from the sidelines as U.S. and Russian officials met in Riyadh and worries are high in Ukraine and European capitals that Trump could cut a hasty deal with Moscow that ignores their security interests. She says European leaders are currently grappling with multiple 'turning points' set off by Russia launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 as well as recent comments by top U.S. officials suggesting Europe will need to play a larger part in security issues. 'February 2022 destroyed our faith in a collective security order with Russia and showed us the dark side of our fundamental dependence on Russia and China in critical areas,' she said. 'February 2025 shows us that the Americans no longer feel responsible for European security -- and that their interests are fundamentally different from ours.' European leaders held emergency talks in Paris on February 17 to discuss the war in Ukraine and European security matters but were unable to reach any agreement. Following the meeting in Saudi Arabia, U.S. national-security adviser Michael Waltz said any postwar peace guarantee would have to be 'European-led,' echoing calls by U.S. officials for European allies to increase defense spending and praising Britain and France for 'talking about contributing more forcefully to Ukraine's security.'Zeleneskyy has criticized the talks due to their lack of a Ukrainian representative and he called for 'fair' peace talks about ending the war, arguing they should also involve the European Union, Turkey, and Britain. The Atlantic Council's Deni said any potential settlement that can be reached is still likely far off and will require further discussions with Ukraine and European governments. He added the meeting in Riyadh should be seen as the latest U.S. attempt to reset relations with Russia, following similar efforts by former President George W. Bush in 2001 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Each of those diplomatic pushes ended with strained ties and new geopolitical flashpoints in Georgia and Ukraine. 'At a certain point you need to speak to your adversary and diplomacy needs to be in the U.S. toolbox,' Deni said. 'Reset efforts make sense, but in the past they've ended in disappointment.'

US Energy Department Offers Fresh Figures On Caspian Basin Energy...	(Eurasianet) -- A new US Department of Energy survey provides updated data on oil & natural gas production in the CaspianBasin. It shows that four regional states – Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – collectively account for 3 percent of global energy production. The Regional Analysis Brief: Caspian Sea additionally provides an overview of regional coal production, power generation and energy export routes, as well as a breakdown of regional refinery operations. Azerbaijan possesses oil reserves in 2025 of about 7 billion barrels and gas reserves of about 60 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), according to the US Energy Department report. Virtually all production is generated offshore. Oil production has fallen from nearly 1 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2010 to an estimated 600,000 b/d currently. Natural gas production, meanwhile, achieved a record high in 2023 (the last year for which data is available), totaling 1.3 Tcf. Azerbaijan is maximizing gas production to meet ambitious EU supply commitments. Kazakhstan’s proven oil reserves topped 30 billion barrels in 2025 and gas reserves were pegged at 85 Tcf. About 1.5 million b/d of crude oil and 400,000 b/d of petroleum liquid fuels were extracted in 2024. The country produced 1 Tcf of natural gas, most of which was used for domestic consumption. About a third of the gas extracted 'was reinjected to increase oil production,' according to the Energy Department survey, which adds that 'natural gas produced at [the] Tengiz and Kashagan [fields] generally is high in sulfur and so, requires special handling and additional expense to process.' Turkmenistan possesses the world’s fifth highest proven natural gas reserves, 400 Tcf in 2025, the report states. Dry natural gas production reached 3.0 Tcf in 2023, the highest annual total since records started being kept in 1992. Most exports presently head east to China, but Ashgabat is looking to expand export options, including southward via a trans-Afghanistan route. The Energy Department highlights an obstacle to expanding Turkmen gas exports to Europe. 'High methane emissions from its oil and natural gas fields threaten Turkmenistan’s prospects to enter the European natural gas market via a potential Trans Caspian Pipeline,' it notes. Turkmen oil reserves are comparatively minor, totaling 600 million barrels, with annual production reaching 275,000 b/d in 2024. Like Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan’s oil reserves are relatively negligible at 594 million barrels, with production of 63,000 b/d in 2024, about one-third the level of the country’s peak production 25 years ago. Proven Uzbek gas reserves are 65 Tcf, with production reaching 1.5 Tcf in 2023. Uzbekistan is the only one of the four states covered in the Energy Department report that cannot meet its own energy consumption needs. Kazakhstan is the eighth leading coal producer in the world and the only major producer among the four Caspian states surveyed. About 130 million short tons of coal were extracted in Kazakhstan in 2023, with almost 40 million tons exported. Most of the extracted coal, including exports, was used for electricity generation. Coal is additionally 'a major energy source for the mining and smelting industries,' the report states.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwWb1z8jIBcnT	2025-02-18T17:01:09-08:00	
EU’s Top Diplomat Kallas Warns Peacekeeping Is A Putin Trap – Int...	By Alexandra Brzozowski Top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas warned in an interview with Euractiv that Europe's discussion over a possible peacekeeping force in Ukraine risks playing into a 'Russian trap'. Just one day after an emergency meeting of European leaders in Paris, Kallas cautioned that attempts to find a coalition for a peacekeeping mission was premature, as the Russians 'don't want peace, there is no peace.' Before those discussions, she said, Europe's focus should be on putting Ukraine in a position where they are 'able to say no to a bad deal', and that 'the stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiation table.' What follows is an edited transcript. What are your takeaways from how the American 'shock therapy' has been developing since last Wednesday? It's clear that Europe is not at the table in the US-Russia talks in Riyadh... KALLAS: Of course, the Americans can meet with whomever they wish to, but for any peace deal regarding Ukraine to work, it has to involve the Europeans as well as the Ukrainians. What options do we have if Trump refuses to include Europeans in the talks, even at a later stage, as his Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg has suggested? KALLAS: If some deal is agreed that we don't agree to, then it will just fail, because it will not be implemented. Washington seems to have drawn its red lines last week; what should Europe's red lines be when it comes to security guarantees for Ukraine specifically? KALLAS: They walked back from the red lines, because of the reaction they received. It is important that before the negotiations have even started, you don't give away all the main asks that Russia has. Otherwise, Russia's aggression really pays off: not only have they occupied some territory – so they have additional territory and mineral resources – but then on top of this, they get all these promises from the other side as well. I don't think it's a good negotiation tactic, nor is it strong. We have, from our side, put in place conditions that need to be there. But first, we really need to put pressure on Russia – that is the first element here. Right now, if you also look at the images from Saudi Arabia, the Russians are the winners. Their posture is: 'Everybody is coming to us now and offering us what we want'. Let's not walk into the Russian traps. What assurances have you received from the American side that the peace talks will not include any broader restructuring of Europe’s security architecture? The Russians will undoubtedly try to go in that direction... KALLAS: We had meetings with a lot of Americans, and, in general, we got different messages, even from the same people, in different meetings. How to understand it all is, of course, a question. What they are saying to us in the meetings is that they will not agree on anything like this. As there are many interlocutors on the American side, we need to accommodate ourselves to the new ways of working with the new administration to understand all the messages. The Americans assured us in every meeting that they were committed to Europe and working together. They're committed to NATO and understand the security concerns of Europe. It is clear that Europeans will be the ones asked to secure any kind of future deal, but the Paris summit has not produced concrete plans. How fast can we come up with a plan? And why didn't we have one in place in the first place? KALLAS: Again, if we are talking about peacekeepers, then we are walking into the Russian trap because they don't want peace; there is no peace. If you read the comments of the Russians, they were quite happy; they had already won everything. First, we have to put pressure on Putin so he wants to move towards peace. The Ukrainians say presence for the sake of presence is not feasible. Under what mandate could such a force work? KALLAS: If the discussion comes to this, then we can discuss it, but we are not at this point. Right now, we should focus our strength on supporting Ukraine and the stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiation table. We should put Ukraine in a position [of strength] where they are able to say no to a bad deal. Arguably, we had three years to do that, to put them in a 'position of strength'? KALLAS: You can't imagine how frustrated I am that this is three years now. Yesterday someone was telling me, 'but the defence industry needs time'. I mean, they have had time. They have had time for three years when the war has been a full-scale war. It's not only a question of the sovereignty of Ukraine. It's a question of our sovereignty, of the global world as we know it, where might does not make a right. Yes, we have had a lot of time, but on the positive side, I remember the shock of 24 February 2022 when things started to happen. I feel that now we are in the same position. I am relatively optimistic that we will get our act together. But do you see the danger that now that peace talks have officially started and there is a perspective of the war ending, the urgency will disappear? KALLAS: In many societies, there is this will to pack things up, and go back to business as usual. We also have to understand that any kind of bad deal is just a deal for Russia to regroup and attack again. With every hesitation, the price just goes up. Making investments in defence right now requires painful decisions from all societies, but not making them would come at a higher cost later. If we draw the parallels with history, then we are in the situation of 1938. The difference now is that, unlike Czechoslovakia, Ukraine has now decided to fight. The only ask for us is to reallocate our resources and help them to defend themselves so there will be no Second World War. I don't know how to convey this to the public of different member states. What will you do if the US lifts sanctions? It seems that this could be part of the mix at some point. What do we do then? KALLAS: It is not wise to give up the strong card that we have in our hands. Why do the Russians want the lifting of sanctions? Because they hurt them and they want to go back to business as usual. This is the strong card that we have in our hands, and we shouldn't give it away. We shouldn't underestimate our own power because what we see is that their economy is in a very bad situation: Their national fund is almost completely depleted, and their national bank interest rate is over 20%, which is, by the way, worse than Haiti's. They can't raise capital outside because of the [Western] sanctions. They don't get the same revenues from oil and gas that they used to, and their employment market is in a really bad place. They want us to believe that they are the strong ones here, but actually, it is not true, and we should not walk into that trap.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwR4bg70trmc9	2025-02-18T16:57:03-08:00	
Donald Trump’s Two-Pronged Strategy To Gut The ‘Deep State’ – OpE...	By Alfredo Toro Hardy US President Donald Trump is convinced that the 'deep state' thwarted his first term, robbing him of the 2020 election. Expunging it seems to have become his main priority of this second term. But, is there such a thing as a deep state? There certainly is. It would be enough to read the memoirs of former US presidents or secretaries to discover their frustration in face of the bureaucratic resistance confronted while in office. In this regard, those of former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, written a few decades ago, were particularly enlightening. The following excerpts from his Memoirs speak volumes. They referred to the interaction between the White House and the Pentagon: 'Orders were given in that respect, but our military bureaucracy resists intromissions in strategic doctrine even if they come from the White House (…) When I assumed my functions, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara told me that he too had tried to give more options to the President in strategic matters, but he finally desisted given the bureaucratic resistance (…) A 1969 presidential request demanding a reasoned explanation on the naval programs was never satisfactorily answered during the eight years that I served in Washington. The responses given were always close to insubordination and far from being useful.' The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis had also much to tell in this regard. One of the main reasons that led Nikita Khruschev, the Secretary General of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party, to install missiles in Cuba was the presence of American missiles in Turkey, bordering the Soviet Union. US President John F. Kennedy understood the risks involved therein. Several months before the crisis, he had ordered that the US’s missiles be removed, as they represented an unnecessary provocation. However, bureaucratic resistance both within the State Department and the Department of Defense thwarted the implementation of such orders, which were never carried out. Moreover, during the infamous 13 days of the crisis, the US Navy was reluctant to obey the president’s orders with regard to the Cuban naval blockade. While Kennedy wanted to give Khruschev time to see, think and blink, bureaucracy within the Navy did all it could to circumvent those orders and put in place its own book of procedures. Additionally, when tensions between both countries peaked, and war could have ensued at any moment, an American spy plane crashed in Siberia. The Air Force bureaucracy had kept its regular procedures in place, notwithstanding Kennedy’s insistence on acting with the utmost prudence. The deep state, indeed, exists. It represents the natural impulse of the federal bureaucracy to act in accordance with its own institutional aims, set of rules and particular subculture. Seeing presidents and secretaries as simple snowbirds, bureaucratic loyalties are entrenched within their own institutions. For someone like Trump who, more than requiring loyalty for his agenda demands fealty to his person, this represents the worst of sins. Indeed, 'he demands personal loyalty—or what John Bolton, Trump’s longest-serving national security adviser in his first term, has called ‘fealty, a medieval concept implying not mere loyalty but submission.’' The interaction of complete opposites such as these can only lead to a trainwreck. Trump’s pincers: destabilizing federal departments from both sides In his second term, Trump aims to bend the federal bureaucracy into submission through a pincer strategy. One jaw pursues its destabilization from the inside by putting federal departments and offices under the control of well-known disrupters. The other jaw harasses and destabilizes these organizations from the outside. The avowed intention of this dual process is taming bureaucrats by making them feel vulnerable and insecure, by demolishing their sense of entitlement and career safety. In the words of Russell Vought, the new Director of the Office of Management and Budget: 'We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.' The first jaw, thus, is entrusted to people that have 'sworn' personal allegiance to Trump. Experience or knowledge regarding their assigned area is not an employment requisite, though. An important historical precedent in this regard dates back to 12th-century England. Faced with the Church’s resistance to his rule, Henry II of Plantagenet decided to appoint his closest friend, the conspicuous dissolute Thomas Becket, as Archbishop of Canterbury. The problem ended up being that Becket realized that his true base of power resided in the Church that he was supposed to 'rule,' and not in the king that had put him in charge. As the king’s man, he was fated to be institutionally resisted, thus becoming feeble and ineffectual. Contrariwise, by submitting to the Church’s interests and organizational subculture, he could personify the political might of that institution. Hence, he sided with the Church. This phenomenon is well known in contemporary US politics. For a political appointee, siding with the bureaucratic organization is known as 'going native.' When a secretary becomes a 'native' of the Department that they were chosen to lead, they acquire real power. Otherwise, the risk of remaining as an inefficacious figurehead is always present. Conscious of that reality, US presidents tend to choose figures with knowledge of the subjects involved, but at the same time with sufficient personal standing and integrity. The former is to avoid manipulation from the inside of the organization. The latter is for them to promote workable compromises between bureaucratic and political objectives. Although an imperfect solution, it is a pragmatic one. Trump, however, searches for absolutes. He not only wants personal allegiance from his barons but for them to forcefully control their fiefs. This is why he places so much importance in choosing disruptive figures, people susceptible of exacting obedience under the continuous threat of chaos. This translates into management by fear. However, installing fear from the inside may not be enough. That is why the second jaw of the pincer searches to project it from the outside as well. It does so through a blistering shake-up of federal bureaucracy: shutting down or dismantling agencies, ousting federal appointees before their term has ended, planning large-scale layoffs, reviewing the elimination or combination of bureaucratic divisions or entire agencies, transforming civil servants’ failure to implement the president’s will into cause for disciplining and separation. All this and more. Much of the above is being done in overt violation of the US Constitution’s separation of power. Since the inception of the Republic, indeed, it has always been the legislative branch that decides how to structure the executive branch, creating departments, giving them functions and providing their funds. Not anymore. So far, though, judicial authority in this field has been respected. However, a furious rhetoric on challenging the judiciary builds up in the president’s camp. All of this, of course, must be sending shock waves of fright upon federal bureaucrats, who feel that they may no longer be protected by the rule of law. Trump’s strategy may damage the US No doubt about it, this pincer strategy could be utterly effective in domesticating the deep state, rendering it docile. The problem is that it can disassemble the State itself in the process. It can, indeed, make a big mess of federal institutions, procedures and civil service, degrading the capacity for policy implementation and distorting institutional memory and governance know-how. Additionally, it can dangerously meddle with the Constitutional separation of power. Hammering the foundations upon which the federal government and the branches of government depend for their functioning, is indeed a risky business — one that could turn a global superpower upside down and set in motion a spiral of decline. Frankly speaking, though, a good dose of pure deep state doesn’t seem like such a bad thing, when faced with proposals such as turning Gaza into an American Riviera while permanently expelling the Palestinian population, retaking the Panama Canal or absorbingGreenland. And what about Trump’s repeated questioning of Canada’s viability as a nation and his threats to annex it through economic force? Indeed, the US might need its deep state.

US Government’s Excessive Spending Scandal Grows Bigger – OpEd	Members of the Biden-Harris administration went on a massive spending bender during their final four months in office. By that, I mean they figuratively blew a hole in the U.S. government’s budget as they headed out the door. This assessment is not included in the January 2025 Monthly Treasury Statement, which provides data on the U.S. government’s spending and revenues during its 2025 fiscal year to date. The statement covers the period from October 1, 2024, through January 31, 2025. During these four months, the U.S. government spent $2.44 trillion and collected $1.60 trillion in taxes. The difference between the amount spent and the federal government’s revenues is $840 billion. That deficit represents the biggest fiscal hole ever dug by any presidential administration during the first four months of any fiscal year. The chart below reveals how the U.S. government’s spending compares with the previous two fiscal years. Looking at revenue first, the federal government’s tax collections through January 2025 are slightly ahead of what they were a year ago. That’s good because the U.S. government collected a record amount of taxes in its 2024 fiscal year. It is on track to beat it in 2025. A lack of revenue is not the problem. The Real Problem The improvement in revenue is almost unnoticeable because it is dwarfed by the massive increase in spending. Cumulative spending through the first four months of FY 2025 is 15% higher than it was at the same point in FY 2024. It is also over 26% higher than FY 2023’s cumulative spending. The excessive spending is clearly unsustainable. It is so unsustainable that it raises the very good question of how they were spending it. The news in recent weeks was filled with horror stories about the role of USAID in contributing to the Biden-Harris administration’s flood of spending. But that’s just a drop in the bucket of government waste. The real problem is much bigger. This realization leads to more questions. How many other federal government agencies were also involved in the Biden-Harris administration’s growing spending scandal? Where has the money entrusted to their control gone? A full accounting of the excessive spending of U.S. politicians and bureaucrats is long overdue. They owe nothing less to the American people.

Trump’s Revival Of Lincoln’s ‘Colonization’ Plan – OpEd	By Thomas J. DiLorenzo Now that the US and Israeli military has bombed almost all of Gaza into a smoldering ruin and killed tens or hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, President Trump has proposed getting Jordan and Egypt to house the remaining Palestinians. He has threatened to withdraw US taxpayer 'aid' to these countries if they do not accept his proposal. This is essentially a revival of Lincoln’s lifelong dream of deporting or 'colonizing' all of the black people out of the United States. Roy Basler, the editor of The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, wrote that as of 1857 Lincoln had no policy regarding slavery 'except the colonization idea which he inherited from Henry Clay.' When he was asked what was to happen to the slaves should they ever be freed he said, 'Send them to Liberia, to their own native land.' As president Lincoln held a White House meeting with free black men and implored them to lead by example and resettle in Africa. They wisely declined his offer. He did develop plans to send every last black person to Africa, Haiti, Central America, anywhere but in the US. As Phil Magness and Sebastian Page documented in their book, Colonization after Emancipation, Lincoln and his administration were hard at work until his dying day counting how many ships it would take to deport or 'colonize,' as they said, all the black people. Henry Clay was Lincoln’s professed political idol and role model. In his 1852 eulogy to Clay Lincoln praised him as a founding member of the American Colonization Society and said that 'colonization' was one of his 'most cherished objects.' Lincoln approvingly quoted Clay in the eulogy as having said that 'there is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to Africa her children.' It would be 'a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe,' he said. Lincoln himself said that sending all the black people to Africa would be 'the ultimate redemption of the African race' and that every year 'had added strength to the hope of its [deportation] realization. May indeed it be realized!' In his December 1, 1862 message to Congress Lincoln reiterated that 'I cannot make it better known that it already is, that I strongly favor colonization.' One major benefit of 'colonization,' Lincoln said was that 'their places [i.e., jobs] be . . . filled up by free white laborers.' At the time, only adult white males or 'free white laborers' had the right to vote. Lincoln was the manager of the Illinois Colonization Society before becoming president, and the Society got the Illinois legislature to allocate tax funds for the purpose of deporting the small number of free blacks out of the state. As president Lincoln appointed Senator Samuel Pomeroy to supervise 'resettlement effort.' Pomeroy recommended deporting black people to a new Central American colony that would be named 'Lincolnia.' The Lincoln administration paid a businessman named Bernard Kock to establish a colony in Haiti but Kock turned out to be a crook and an embezzler so nothing came of it. All of this caused the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to declare that Lincoln 'had not a drop of anti-slavery blood in his veins' and called him 'The President of African Colonization.' Of course the Lincoln Cult has dozens of excuses for Lincoln’s Ku Klux Klanish attitude towards black people. They claimed for generations that Lincoln somehow gave up on the idea in 1863 but the book Colonization after Emancipation proved that to be untrue. The well known Civil War historian Gabor Boritt wrote in his edited book, The Lincoln Enigma, that Lincoln’s colonization proposals were 'noble.' He concocts numerous rationales and excuses, which after all is what makes one a 'Lincoln Scholar.' The most entertaining excuse is his statement that Lincoln’s lifelong advocacy of colonization is 'how honest people lie.' A perfect example of what makes one a 'Lincoln Scholar.' President Trump’s proposal to colonize Palestinians in Jordan or Egypt is hardly different from Lincoln’s colonization fetish. Both men treat a group of people as lepers who should be eradicated from society and who should be denied property rights in their own country no matter how many generations their family has lived there. Lincoln’s rationale was the subtitle of Lerone Bennett, Jr.’s book Forced into Glory: 'Abraham Lincoln’s White Dream.' (Bennett was the long time editor of Ebony magazine and an author of several books). As for Trump, his rationale seems to be payback for the $100 million campaign donation from Miriam Adelson and the prospect of participating in the Mother of All Real Estate Developments in the Middle East.

To Bomb Or Not To Bomb Iran – OpEd	By Jonathan Power The talk is talk. Or will it walk? President Donald Trump has raised the stakes once again, repeating the threats against Iran in his first term. It all goes back many years. Mitt Romney, the US Republican candidate for the presidency, said that on his watch Iran would not be allowed to build a nuclear weapon but that on his watch, if elected, the future president, Barack Obama, would let it happen. In an issue of Foreign Affairs, a mouthpiece of the American foreign affairs establishment, Mathew Kroenig penned soon after Obama took office an article, 'Time to Attack Iran. The time for talk is over', he wrote. Foreign policy analysts seem to overlook that it was the US who encouraged the Shah 75 years ago to begin Iran’s nuclear programme. The first discussion I attended on whether Iran was wanting a bomb was at the International Institute for Strategic Studies some 40 years ago. Experts were saying we should expect a bomb within a decade. Time passes but the argument barely change and no bomb has been made. All one knows is that in all this time many opportunities for a sensible negotiation have been ignored. 'Enormously difficult' to destroy Iran’s nuclear plant Kroenig wrote that, 'If Iran begins enriching its uranium to weapons grade levels of 90% or installs advanced centrifuges at its uranium-enrichment facility in Qom the US must strike immediately.' While admitting that it would be 'enormously difficult' to destroy Iran’s nuclear plant, Kroenig argued it could and should be done. New bunker-busting bombs would take care of underground facilities. They can penetrate through 200 feet of reinforced concrete. However, he admitted that the one at Qom would be a challenging target since it is built into the side of a mountain. He tried to knock down those critics who point out that Iran could retaliate, launching missiles at US military installations in the Gulf, closing the Strait of Hormuz, the relatively narrow (but not that narrow) water that tankers pass through at the opening to the Persian Gulf, firing missiles into Israel and activating proxies abroad. The US, he argues, could retaliate with devastating military action. Iran won’t be able to resume progress after its entire nuclear infrastructure is reduced to rubble. He discounts much—that this would strengthen Iran’s hardliners as it did in Germany after the blanket bombing of Dresden. Thankfully, the pro bomb faction has been undermined by many observers including Israeli’s ex-prime minister, Ehud Barak, who has long said that any decision on an Israeli attack on Iran was 'very far off'. Many experts believe that Iran has not yet decided whether to make a nuclear bomb. Perhaps too one should not overlook statements made by the hierarchy of Iran in this very religious country that it goes against the Koran to build a weapon of mass destruction. Could they justify lying to God? Another Middle Eastern war? Added to that, Koenig underestimates how Iran is building safer and safer hideaways. It can match any bomb by digging deeper. Does the US want to get drawn into another Middle Eastern war which would have serious spill-over effects in further radicalising Pakistan, Afghanistan, Palestine and big chunks of the population throughout the Middle East? Interestingly, some Israeli policymakers appear to have got the message some time ago. According to a poll conducted by the American Brookings Institution and the Israeli Dahaf Institute only a minority of Israeli Jews support a military strike even though 90% of them think Iran will eventually acquire nuclear weapons. When asked whether it would be better for both Israel and Iran not to have such weapons 65% of the Jews said 'yes'. Support for the idea of a nuclear-free zone A remarkable 64% support the idea of a nuclear-free zone. Moreover, a freeze has been supported by such unexpected characters as the former Mossad (intelligence) chief, Tair Pardo, a former Mossad chief, Ephraim Halevy, and a former chief of staff of the military, Dan Halutz. Could Iran refuse the proposition of a nuclear-free zone, if it came from Israel? The Israeli government has always put the cart before the horse. It says a nuclear-free zone cannot be considered until there is peace between Israel and its neighbours. But the answer to that, argues Harvard professor, Nicolas Burns, is there will be no peace as long as Iran and Israel are at loggerheads. Since Israel is the one who possesses an arsenal of nuclear weapons it must be the first to take steps towards reconciliation. He quotes the former Israeli spy chief, Meir Dagan, who has argued that Israel’s current stance might accelerate Iran’s quest for nuclear weapons and encourage other Arab states to follow suit. Under President Barack Obama the US accepted that talking with Iran was the best option, and after gruelling negotiations a deal was signed. Iran’s enrichment program was halted and the US lifted sanctions. But then his successor Donald Trump tore up the agreement and for 7 years nothing has been done on the diplomatic front, although sanctions have continued. Trump in his first term and now again has threatened war if Iran shows signs of moving towards 90% enrichment. That truly would be a nose-to-nose confrontation. I think there is a better way for America to do it—stop trying to pull Iran down. But with Trump in office, we must prepare for the worst. Trump might well want to walk the talk.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwUy1G_ajCdhn	2025-02-18T16:43:11-08:00	
Kremlin Tells Russia Media To Play Down Trump Lest He Upstage Put...	After US President Donald Trump telephoned Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12, the Russian Presidential Administration instructed state-run and pro-government media to 'downplay Trump’s role and mention the US president less often – lest it appear as though Trump is achieving the results Putin failed to deliver,' according to the Meduza news agency. The independent Russian news portal based in Riga says that the Kremlin is 'concerned that Russians might start seeing Trump as a more pro-active and decisive leader than Putin.' And 't prevent this, officials directed journalists to emphasize that the outcome of any talks depends entirely on Putin' (meduza.io/feature/2025/02/14/sozvon-putina-i-trampa-kazhetsya-otlichnym-informatsionnym-povodom-dlya-prokremlevskih-smi). 'A political strategist working with the domestic policy team told Meduza that the Kremlin doesn’t want Trump to be perceived as ‘a strong leader capable of changing the situation.’' That could create a situation in which Putin might 'appear passive – in other words, weak – in comparison.' The news outlet’s source said that Moscow had 'also instructed Russian media outlets to scale back the numbers mentioning Trump, not only with regard to foreign policy but also concerning US domestic policies.' Meduza said that it already sees that some of the Russian government outlets have already adjusted their coverage of the US president.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwXX1Nypx-VYH	2025-02-18T16:39:20-08:00	
Real Corruption That Could Meet Republican Cost-Saving Targets – ...	The news has been filled with stories in recent days about Republicans desperately hunting for $2.0-$2.5 trillion (2-3 percent of the budget) in budget cuts over the next decade to cover the cost of extending tax cuts to the rich. While Elon Musk and his DOGE team have been screaming about corruption all through the government, they actually have found little that can be helpful here. They appear to have found virtually nothing by way of actual corruption. Most of what they have been screaming about are small-budget allocations having to do with race, gender, or sexual orientation that they don’t like. Individually these programs are nickel and dime stuff, and even collectively they won’t come close to covering the cost of the tax cuts that Elon Musk and his billionaire friends need so badly. Instead, the committees in the House and Senate working on designing a budget have focused on cutting Medicaid and SNAP, two programs that largely serve low and moderate-income families. The cuts being debated, if implemented, would deny tens of millions of people access to health care and reduce nutritional support that has meant a huge difference for millions of low-income children. The cuts to Medicaid would also have a devastating impact on rural hospitals since it is a major source of revenue. Many would probably have to close. But if the Republicans really want to find savings by eliminating government corruption, there is an obvious place to look. We pay twice as much for our drugs and other pharmaceutical products as people in other wealthy countries. The reason is that the government grants them patent monopolies. While other governments also grant patent monopolies, they also negotiate drug prices or have some other mechanism that limits the ability of pharmaceutical companies to exploit these monopolies. The United States is alone in granting drug companies monopolies and then telling them to charge whatever they feel like. It’s true that patent monopolies give the industry an incentive to develop new drugs, but we can provide that incentive through other mechanisms, like direct public funding. We had been providing over $50 billion a year in direct funding through the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies. In the longer term we can increase this funding and let the new drugs that are developed be sold as cheap generics. This would also end the incentives to lie about the safety and effectiveness of drugs that led to the opioid crisis. (I discuss this in chapter 5 of my book, Rigged [it’s free].) If we began to follow the practice of France, Germany, and everyone else, we could cut our drug bill in half or more. We are on a path to spend over $700 billion this year on pharmaceutical products. If we cut that in half by negotiating prices, that would save us more than $350 billion this year, well over the Republicans’ saving target. It’s true that not all of this spending is done by the government, so the government would not directly be able to pocket all the savings, but it would likely get pretty close to its saving targets through this channel. In addition to the roughly half of spending that is paid by directly the government, the government subsidizes much of the rest through tax deductions. People don’t pay taxes on employer-provided health insurance. If lower drug prices led insurers to reduce annual premiums by $100 billion, this is likely to lead to an increase in taxable income of roughly the same amount. And that would mean higher tax revenue. In short, the Republicans and the DOGE crew are staring at an obvious place to save big bucks by slashing corruption, if they are prepared to go after the pharmaceutical industry with the same vigor that they have gone after programs they labeled as 'DEI' or individuals who have tried to enforce the law when Donald Trump violated it. Unfortunately, the Republicans in Congress are probably as scared of the pharmaceutical industry as they are of Donald Trump. This means we shouldn’t hold out breath waiting for lower drug prices. They will probably look to take away food and health care from low and moderate-income people. It is their way.

Trump International Hotel And Tower, Gaza – OpEd	Donald Trump spoke to reporters for over three hours on Air Force One on his way to see the Super Bowl in New Orleans on 9 February 2025. It was not clear to the reporters who broadcast his comments whether Trump was speaking as the President of the United States, a member of the United Nations, or as a real estate magnate. Gaza, he said, is a 'demolition site' that needed to be 'leveled out' and 'fixed up'. Since Gaza is on the Mediterranean Sea, Trump said, it could be developed into a new French Riviera. According to him, it is not the crime scene of a genocide but 'a big real estate site'. The United States, he said with his presidential smile on, 'will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too'. Palestinians from Gaza listening to this commentary could have imagined that the United States would be funding the reconstruction of Gaza, which has been estimated by the United Nations to be – at a minimum – $53 billion (the cost after the 2014 pulverization of Gaza by Israel was $2.4 billion). In 2023, total US Overseas Development Aid was $66 billion, and, with the cuts proclaimed by President Trump, it is unlikely that the US can muster anything near the bill for the reconstruction of Gaza. There was nothing humanitarian in Trump’s comments about the making of the Gaza Riviera (or since this appears to be a gift to Israel, it is more likely that Trump imagines it to be the Azzah Riviera, using the Zionist name for Gaza, meaning 'strong city'). The Israeli establishment has, from the start of this genocidal campaign, said that it wants to annex Gaza, which seems to be aligned with the Trump vision to make Gaza American or to develop Gaza as a beachside resort for U.S. tourists and Israeli settlers. Knowing Trump, he will likely want to reserve a section of the beachfront for himself and to build a Trump International Hotel and Tower that has a casino attached to it for good measure. Zionist Gentrification None of this is a surprise and nor are these ideas original to Trump. The entire Zionist project imagines an Eretz Israel that stretches from the borders with Egypt to that of Iran. The real estate deed for this is a line in the Bible, 'To your descendants, I have given this land, from the river of Egypt as far as the great river the Euphrates' (Genesis 15:18). It is not clear which river in Egypt this line refers to, whether the Nile or Wadi el-Arish (in the Sinai Peninsula). But if the Euphrates is taken as its border, then the land that Zionists claim includes the entire West Bank and Jerusalem, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and the western half of Iraq. There are maps of this kind that can be seen in the offices of far-right Israeli politicians (on 19 March, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich spoke in Paris from a podium that displayed an Israeli map that included Jordan). This is utterly normal in the world of the illegal settlements in the West Bank (part of the UN-mandated Occupied Palestine Territory), which the settlers call Judea and Samaria. Their geography has been different since at least when their spiritual guide Ze’ev Jabotinsky wrote in The Iron Wall(1923) that Zionists must build Eretz Israel behind an 'iron wall, which is to say a strong power in Palestine that is not amenable to any Arab pressure'. Trump is not much of a reader. He probably has never heard of Jabotinsky or of Theodor Herzl. He probably cannot define Zionism. But he knows a real estate opportunity when he sees one, and that is how he has understood his solution to the problems facing Israel. In his first term, Trump made the 'deal of the century', the Abraham Accords, which brought a series of states to normalize relations with Israel: Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (September 2020), Sudan (October 2020), and Morocco (December 2020). With Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994) having already made peace deals with Israel, the map had begun to shift away from the Palestinians and toward the Israelis. The new governments in Lebanon and Syria are not far from making their own separate agreements, and Saudi Arabia has already said that it would normalize with Tel Aviv. Trump is a 'bazaari' (marketplace) politician, one who tosses outlandish agreements in the air (for Morocco, the acceptance of its illegal occupation of Western Sahara) in utter disregard for international law. He is now doing the same with Gaza. 'I think that it’s a big mistake to allow people – the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza – to go back yet another time', he said on Air Force One. 'We don’t want Hamas going back', Trump said. 'The United States is going to own it'. It did not take long for all the UN Special Rapporteurs to sign a strong lettercondemning Trump’s comments. They made the correct argument that his idea, if implemented, is a war crime. Trump does not understand international law. He thinks like a gentrifier. This is what he has been doing across the United States: evicting ordinary people and building hideous buildings as a monument to the fabulous wealth of the few. Trump, like the illegal settlers, conducts Zionist gentrification. Silence Marwan Bardawil is an engineer with the Palestinian Water Authority. At a little-noticed press conference in Ramallah, Palestine, Bardawil said that 85% of the water and sewage facilities in the Gaza Strip were destroyed by the Israeli genocide. It will cost $1 billion to repair and replace the water and sewage facilities in Gaza. Polio, which was eradicated in Gaza a quarter of a century ago, has returned because of the collapse of the water system. The Palestinians are being silenced as the debate around Gaza unfolds. If they want a Trump International Hotel and Tower, that is up to them, not up to Trump or Netanyahu. But they are not clamouring for a golden tower. What they want are their homes. And their universities. And their hospitals. And the photographs of their family members who are now all dead.

Myanmar: Arakan Army Closing In On Capital Of Rakhine State	The rebel Arakan Army is closing in on Sittwe, the capital of Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, firing artillery on military junta outposts outside the city and preparing for an assault, residents told Radio Free Asia. Residents have been fleeing from Sittwe’s outskirts since January, but now aren’t able to escape because junta forces have blocked all exit routes, said Wai Hin Aung, an aid worker in the city. 'The blockade has led to this fighting, with the use of heavy weapons,' he said. The rebel ethnic Arakan Army, or AA, has made significant gains over the past year in its bid to root the military out of Rakhine state in its bid for self-determination. Of the 17 townships in Rakhine state, 14 are under the control of the AA, leaving only three still in the hands of the military junta – Kyaukphyu, Munaung and Sittwe, where the junta’s regional headquarters is based. Sittwe is crucial for the junta – which seized control of Myanmar in a 2021 coup d’état – not only as a source of much-needed revenue and foreign currency, but also for its role in Myanmar’s oil and gas trade via the Indian Ocean. If Sittwe falls, it would be the latest and one of the most significant defeats for the junta, which has been pushed back across the country by various ethnic armies and armed citizens who have formed militias called Peoples Defense Forces, or PDF. Junta forces have countered with artillery attacks and airstrikes on areas in Sittwe and two nearby towns where they believe that AA troops are stationed, a resident said, speaking anonymously for security reasons. Firing on naval vessels The Arakan Army also fired on junta vessels at a river naval base, a Sittwe resident told Radio Free Asia. The AA began firing at around 5 p.m., and junta fighter planes responded by dropping bombs on AA positions at about 9 p.m., he said. Several junta soldiers were wounded in the AA attack and were taken to a Sittwe hospital. 'The explosions were quite strong,' he said. 'The junta dropped about three big bombs. Then they started firing with a series of missiles.' The junta has recently reinforced its forces in and around Sittwe, and has also provided military training to thousands of Rohingya – a stateless ethnic group that predominantly follows Islam and resides in Rakhine. A Sittwe resident and military analyst from Rakhine state told RFA that neither the AA nor the military junta will easily abandon Sittwe. 'The AA is unlikely to halt its attacks on Sittwe, and the military will not abandon the city,' he said. 'That’s why intense fighting cannot be ruled out.' Rakhine State’s junta spokesperson, Hla Thein, didn’t answer his telephone when RFA tried to contact him for comment about the situation in Sittwe. AA spokesperson Khaing Thukha also didn’t immediately respond to a message left by RFA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwVku2CsMlKP_	2025-02-18T16:22:27-08:00	
Waste, Corruption And Foreign Meddling – And On Our ‘Nickel’ – Op...	President Donald Trump has frozen funding for the National Endowment for Democracy and proposes to shut down USAID funding. The US president’s spending cut reportedly leaves the organizations unable to pay staff and grantees. Well, it's a start anyway. In one of his first executive orders after taking office, President Donald Trump suspended all foreign aid ($68 billion), pending a review of its alignment with US national interests. Pursuant to these orders, President Trump’s administration has frozen all funding to the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). The move is said to have caused what some have called a 'bloodbath' within the organization, leaving it unable to pay staff or fulfill financial commitments. The NED, established in 1983, is officially a nonprofit organization that, ostensibly, provides grants to support democratic initiatives worldwide. However, over the years, it has faced allegations of covertly influencing political outcomes overseas, with critics arguing that it has taken over covert functions previously handled by the CIA, particularly those aimed at undermining and in some instances overthrowing foreign governments. Earlier this month, Elon Musk, who heads Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was given responsibility for finding ways to cut federal spending. Musk singled out NED immediately, calling it a 'scam' and an 'evil organization' that needs to be dissolved. Since then, this organization and others have reportedly felt 'under siege' from Musk’s DOGE. 'It’s been a bloodbath,' one NED worker told the Daily Mail, explaining that the organization has been unable to meet payroll and pay basic overhead expenses. It has an allocation budget of $142 million for the current fiscal year and has already allocated $70 million for distribution to various NGOs. The NED has faced longstanding criticism over its role in supporting political movements to undermine sovereign governments. The Center for Renewing America, a research organization founded by Russell Vought, Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, released a policy paper on February 7, accusing the NED of functioning as the 'tip of the proverbial spear for heightened CIA and State Department efforts to foster political revolution in Ukraine.' The report claimed that the NED had funneled tens of millions of dollars to a myriad of Ukrainian political entities and anti-Russian interests and 'advanced both the ‘Orange Revolution’ (2004) and ‘Maidan Revolution’ (2014) that paved the way for the current Ukraine-Russia war.' The NED has also faced accusations of sponsoring 'color revolutions' in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan and of funding opposition groups in Belarus, Serbia, and Egypt. The funding freeze on the organization comes as part of broader measures by the Trump administration to cut foreign spending. Trump’s 'executive pen' has also included a crackdown on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Washington’s primary vehicle for funding political projects abroad. Trump earlier called for the agency to be shut down, claiming it is run by 'radical lunatics.' Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico has formally requested that Elon Musk disclose detailed information about American grants allocated to Slovak NGOs and media outlets through Washington’s primary agency for funding political projects abroad -- USAID. In a letter to DOGE chief Musk – who previously branded USAID a 'criminal organization' – Fico voiced concerns over what he described as 'gross interference' in Slovakia’s political landscape. 'It is undeniable that funds originating from USAID were also used for political purposes in Slovakia to distort the political system and favor specific political parties,' Fico wrote in a letter shared on X on Tuesday. He urged Musk to disclose which NGOs, media outlets, and individual journalists had received US funding. Last week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban similarly announced that his government would seek full transparency regarding USAID grants to NGOs and media outlets critical of his administration, emphasizing the need to 'eliminate these foreign networks' that interfere in the country’s domestic affairs. In late 2023, his government created the Sovereignty Protection Office to monitor and address the risk of political interference in the country. Foreign financing for parties or groups running for office are banned in the country, with penalties of up to three years in prison. On Tuesday evening, USAID staff received an email saying that starting Friday, 'all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership, and specially designated programs.' The email added that essential staff would be notified on Thursday afternoon and that the agency would begin moving international staff back to the US within 30 days. Data for fiscal year 2024 shows that USAID distributed nearly $32.5 billion (its entire budget) in aid that year, much of it to Africa and the Middle East. The US spends more on humanitarian aid than other countries by wide margins, though foreign aid spending is under 1% of the federal budget. The US provides some amount of aid to most countries, including nearly every country in Africa and Asia. Many polls have found a majority of Americans believe the US is spending too much on foreign aid, including for Ukraine. But here’s the thing: How much of the spending cuts will Congress (regarding the NED and USAID) permit and which cuts will federal courts rule exceed President Trump’s authority? This is a drama that will surely play out in the midst of Trump 'taking Gaza,' the Ukraine proxy war with Russia and the global array of punitive tariffs orchestrated between the US, Canada, Mexico, China and the EU – so far.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PweoS0YcuoUPp	2025-02-18T16:15:16-08:00	
In Southern Thailand, Vintage US Items Drive Market Boom For Used...	By Asmadee Bueheng Piya Dueramae makes a living selling secondhand clothes, and spends much of his time hunting for rare finds in markets across Thailand’s Deep South. The 43-year-old’s connection to the business runs deep – his parents introduced secondhand markets to him when was a child. 'In Yala, we grew up going to the Maprao Market for clothes,' Piya told BenarNews, referring to a popular used-clothes market in Yala province. 'While city kids shopped in malls, our parents took us to secondhand markets. It became a way of life, a culture.' Used clothes shipped in from the United States – such as blue jeans and t-shirts featuring Marvel Comics’ action heroes – are among the 'treasures' that can be found among piles of old apparel at secondhand markets in the Deep South. The mainly Malay Muslim border region is more known for a long-running separatist insurgency than its booming secondhand clothing market. But used clothing is deeply ingrained in the local culture. By buying secondhand clothes, people with low incomes in this economically underdeveloped region could afford popular brand name apparel. The secondhand markets in southern Thailand grew bigger with the global trend of vintage clothing gaining popularity, as these markets became well-known for the rare items they sold. 'The beginning of second-hand clothing sales in the southern border areas started in 1973, when villagers from Yaring district, Pattani, who worked on fishing boats in Malaysia, brought second-hand clothes and goods from Malaysia back to sell at home,' Thitaree Srisurat, editor of the Rusamilae Journal at Prince of Songkla University in Pattani, another province in the Deep South, wrote in a 2021 article. 'It gained popularity, and many families took it up as a business, with about 20% of the community working in second-hand clothing sales. Some families still continue this to this day.' The main factor is affordability. 'People here cannot afford expensive goods, and since these are second-hand clothes, they don’t feel bad about wearing them to work in the fields,' Thitaree said. Soliha Ayohsae, a veteran secondhand clothing vendor, switched from running a regular clothing store in Bangkok to selling used clothes in southern Thailand because of the higher demand in the region. 'It’s easier and faster to sell here than in Bangkok because it’s cheaper. I used to sell in Bangkok, and although the profit per item was higher, the sales were fewer. Here, people buy a lot and often. Since it’s second-hand, they can easily replace it without feeling guilty,' Soliha told BenarNews. 'People here prefer secondhand because they are branded, high-quality, and affordable…. The demand has always been strong.' The secondhand fashion industry has witnessed explosive growth worldwide. According to ThredUp, a United States-based resale marketplace, secondhand clothes’ share of the total global apparel in 2025 is expected to be 10%, or U.S. $246 billion. This used clothes market is projected to grow at an annual rate of 12% between 2024 and 2027, reaching an estimated value of $350 billion by 2027, with Asia expected to account for 41%. Thailand’s secondhand market is expanding alongside. The Thai secondhand fashion market in 2023 was valued at 1.8 billion baht ($53.4 million), reflecting a 20% growth from the previous year, according to a report by SCB Economic Intelligence Center. It is expected to continue growing at a rate of 15% annually through 2027. However, no studies have specifically examined the market in Thailand’s Deep South, where buying used clothes has been the norm for decades. Data for 2024 was not available. Secondhand clothing in southern Thailand is mostly available in key markets like Yala’s Maprao Market, and Pattani’s Rusamilae and Yaring markets. A diverse clientele shops at these places including locals and collectors, seeking vintage American apparel, such as blue jeans. ‘Discarded in America but are treasures here’ Most of the secondhand clothing available in Thailand comes from the U.S. via Malaysia. The clothing is transported from America to Malaysia via cargo ships. Foreign vendors in Thailand then purchase some of these clothes to resell in their countries. Soliha, the veteran secondhand clothing seller from Maprao Market, said secondhand American apparel was in high demand. 'These were once discarded in America but are treasures here. People buy them for work, farming, the office, and even as fashion. The quality is good, the price is low, and vintage never goes out of style,' she said. 'Maprao Market is a shopping paradise. We get shoppers from Malaysia’s border areas, Pakistan,and Western tourists also shop here. I make over 100,000 baht [$2,966] a month.' A single bale of secondhand clothing imported from Malaysia, which could consist of 200-220 T-shirts or 150-180 jackets or trousers, costs around 1,000 baht ($29.6). At Maprao Market these clothes could then sell for anything from 5 baht (U.S. 14 cents) an item to tens of thousands of baht per item, depending on their rarity and brand. The popularity of secondhand clothing has led to eye-catching sale prices at auctions. For instance, a vintage (1997) T-shirt featuring Marvel Comics’ characters Spider-Man, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer from Maprao Market sold for 220,000 baht ($6,526) in an online auction. 'Collectors from Japan, in particular, love U.S. made T-shirts, especially ones made of thin cotton fabrics, and [music] band T-shirts,' he said. Piya, the Yala vendor, said he bought a vintage T-shirt from the 1970s from Maprao Market for 80 baht ($2.37) and sold it for 22,000 baht ($654) in the same market. Secondhand military apparel, workwear, denim, jerseys and Hawaiian shirts also fetch high prices. Military garments from World War II, and the Korean and Vietnam wars are considered especially valuable, particularly if they feature unit-specific prints. Lately, unofficial band merchandise, which is usually sold outside concert venues, is becoming trendy as well. 'Some of these items sell for over 100,000 baht ($2,800) each, more than what official band merchandise sells for,' Piya said. 'You have to know what’s valuable and what’s not.' Competition is rising, though, with a growth in demand. Some vendors buy high-value pieces from southern markers to resell them in Bangkok. More are being filtered before they reach Thailand, as the popularity of vintage clothing has risen. And more Japanese collectors too are traveling to Thailand to hand-pick rare finds. As demand grows, sellers must continuously expand their knowledge to remain competitive in an increasingly globalized market, vendors said. For vendors in southern Thailand secondhand clothing is about more than just fashion or a hobby – it’s a livelihood. 'This business is not just a passion anymore; it supports our families and our children’s education,' Piya said. 'We have to adapt. The secondhand market is changing fast, and only those who learn and evolve will survive.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejkj1v4u4PwVEdSd4og-sX	2025-02-18T16:11:32-08:00	
Spyware As A Service: Challenges In Applying Export Controls To C...	By Kolja Brockmann and Lauriane Héau For all their legitimate law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering uses, cyber-surveillance tools are prone to abuse. Among other things, they can be used by states to target political opponents or to oppress certain ethnic or religious groups, or to steal an adversary’s data or attack critical infrastructure. States have increasingly sought to use export controls to help prevent transfers of cyber-surveillance tools, including software, that could enable human rights violations or pose a threat to national security. Controls covering transfers of cybersurveillance hardware, software and technology have been introduced through the Wassenaar Arrangement, the European Union and national control lists and by way of a catch-all control in the EU dual-use regulation. However, the growing use of the ‘software as a service’ (SaaS) model—in which a software application is hosted and used on a cloud server but not downloaded by the end-user—poses a particular set of challenges. States differ in how they apply export controls to cloud computing, including SaaS, and their interpretation of relevant legal provisions informs their application of licensing requirements and enforcement measures. This divergence opens potential loopholes and gaps that could be exploited for illicit procurement. It also creates a confusing landscape for companies that want to remain in compliance with the controls on cyber-surveillance tools and other software. This blog aims to highlight the export control compliance and enforcement challenges posed by SaaS and offers some thoughts on how states can close these gaps and achieve more effective oversight of the trade in cyber-surveillance tools. The software as a service model and cyber-surveillance products SaaS is a type of cloud computing in which the software is uploaded to a cloud server—which could be owned and operated by the software provider or by a separate cloud service provider—and made available for use without the end-user being able to download the software to a local device or storage medium. Familiar examples of SaaS include cloud-based collaborative work and e-mail solutions or design and engineering tools that are available directly via the internet without the need for download. One type of cyber-surveillance tool that may be offered via the SaaS model is intrusion software. Controls on intrusion software were added to the dual-use control list of the Wassenaar Arrangement in 2013 and apply to software ‘specially designed or modified to avoid detection by 'monitoring tools', or to defeat 'protective countermeasures', of a computer or network-capable device’ in order to remotely extract or modify data and, in some cases, take control of the device. Some companies also offer facial recognition software via the SaaS model. This may, under certain conditions, be subject to control in EU member states by way of the EU dual-use regulation catch-all control for unlisted cyber-surveillance items or potentially via national control lists. In July 2024 the United States also proposed adding facial recognition software to its national dual-use control list. Challenges for export controls if cyber-surveillance tools are offered via the SaaS model When software is made available through the SaaS model, there are three main actors: the software provider, the cloud service provider (who may also be the software provider) and the recipient end-user of the software (see figure below). There are several actions in this model that may constitute an export. First, the software provider uploads the software to a cloud server, which may be owned by the software provider or by a separate cloud service provider. Second, once it is on the server, the party controlling access to the software (usually the software provider) grants access to the recipient, thus making the software available. Third, the cloud service provider may also (at least potentially) grant access to the software for maintenance purposes. And finally, the recipient end-user downloads the data gathered using the software. To determine whether any of these actions constitutes an export and who would be considered the exporter, an export licensing authority may need to establish a number of things, including the locations of the server and the three actors; who had effective control over granting access to the software during each of these steps; and whether the software was made available to the cloud service provider, the end-user or both. Screenshot Key differences in states’ interpretations of controls on SaaS States’ interpretations differ on some key points: whether making controlled software available through SaaS is considered an export; and if it is considered an export, who is the exporter and which parts of the transaction trigger licensing requirements. These differences are found even within the EU, where member states share a common regulation for dual-use export controls. Some states appear not to have settled on a consistent national interpretation thus far. As well as creating potential loopholes and gaps, this divergence makes compliance more difficult, particularly for companies that operate in several states with different interpretations. For example, according to guidance published by the German export licensing authority, BAFA, the cloud server being located in a state outside the EU is sufficient to trigger a licensing requirement for uploading controlled software. Granting access and thereby making the controlled software available to a user in a third country may also constitute an instance of export or brokering and therefore trigger a separate licensing requirement. Other states, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom focus instead on the location of the person or entity accessing the software—rather than the location of the server—when determining whether it is a controlled export. The United States has indicated that granting or gaining access to controlled software via SaaS does not constitute an export per se if the software provider uses a certain industry-standard level of end-to-end encryption that prevents the cloud service provider or any of its agents (for example those performing maintenance on the server infrastructure) from accessing the software. However, this only applies if the software is unclassified and neither destined for a recipient that is a party of concern on the entity list—a tool used by the USA to list foreign persons and companies to which specific restrictions or licensing requirements apply—nor stored on a server in a country under an arms embargo. What the different interpretations mean for oversight, controllability and enforcement Different interpretations of key concepts, including ‘export’ and ‘exporter’, determine the level of oversight and the ability to impose controls and—where necessary—prohibit transfers using export control legislation. States need to consider whether their current legal interpretations and provisions regarding making software available through SaaS satisfies their need for oversight, including for sensitive transactions involving cyber-surveillance software. Whether their desired level of oversight is reached also depends on whether they have complementary legal measures other than export controls at their disposal that enable oversight or provide means of intervention. However states frame their export controls, they need to think about how to enforce the controls, which requires having the appropriate capacities to respond when they suspect that unlicensed transfers have taken place or are imminent. There are also practical detection and enforcement challenges that make it difficult for states to claim jurisdiction and to collect the evidence required for establishing intent, who had effective control over granting access and whether controlled software was made available to a specific end-user. Some states, including the USA, require a certain level of encryption to be applied for transfers of controlled software instead of a licensing requirement—an approach that is favoured by industry actors. However, relying only on the use of encryption could mean less attention is paid to the end-users and end-uses. It could also risk creating additional hurdles for enforcement investigations, particularly if states do not have the required digital forensics capabilities available to retrieve required information and retrace transfers and access. Striking the right balance The use of cloud computing and the provision of software via SaaS are both set to increase. As with all dual-use export controls, states need to find the right balance between ensuring regulatory control over potentially risky cyber-surveillance exports and limiting the burden on legitimate trade. Industry representatives have called for harmonization across states in how export controls apply to software in order to facilitate compliance. This currently appears unlikely to happen, even in the EU, given states’ continued disagreement on key aspects of how controls apply. However, states should clarify their national interpretations concerning how export controls apply to cloud computing, including SaaS, and provide guidance and conduct outreach to companies to support their compliance efforts. At the EU level, the current process of drafting common guidelines on intangible transfers of technology provides a welcome opportunity to do this. It is not yet well known how and to what extent companies are offering different types of cyber-surveillance tools via SaaS. National authorities should thus engage regularly with both domestic and multinational companies to stay on top of this development and ensure that their legal interpretations and enforcement capabilities are appropriate for controlling the trade in cyber-surveillance software. More exchange between states’ licensing authorities and enforcement agencies on the detection, investigation and prosecution of cases involving SaaS could also be useful to this end. One way this could be achieved is through broader multilateral initiatives—such as the ‘Pall Mall Process’—that seek to regulate the trade in cyber-surveillance tools and could improve understanding of both the technical aspects of the trade in these tools and how export controls can complement other regulatory mechanisms. Considering the threat that cyber-surveillance tools may pose to civic freedoms, open societies should strive to ensure, despite the technical and legal difficulties, that cyber-surveillance tools do not fall into the hands of actors who seek to misuse them.

Purchasing Power And The International Demand For Dollars – Analy...	By Frank Shostak Often various factors are perceived to be important in determining a currency rate of exchange. For instance, for some commentators an increase in the government foreign debt is regarded as pointing to a likely deterioration in economic fundamentals ahead. This provides the rationale for the selling of the currency of concern. For many economists, the state of the balance of trade is a key factor in the currency exchange rate determination. On this way of thinking, all other things being equal, an increase in imports, which leads to a trade deficit, causes an increase in the demand for foreign currency. To obtain the foreign currency, importers sell the domestic currency for it. As a result, this causes a strengthening in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the domestic currency (i.e., more domestic money is sold per unit of a foreign currency). Conversely, all other things being equal, an increase in exports leads to a trade surplus. Once exporters exchange their foreign currency earnings for domestic money, this leads to a strengthening in the domestic money exchange rate against the foreign money (i.e., more foreign money is sold per unit of domestic money). Alternatively, consider the case when the central bank tightens its interest rate stance. The increase in the domestic interest rate, all other things being equal, attracts foreigners’ demand for domestic money. The holders of the foreign currency are now exchanging it for the domestic currency which is going to be placed in the domestic currency deposits in order to earn higher interest rates. Consequently, this lifts the price of the local currency in terms of foreign currency. It would appear that various factors such as the government debt, the interest rate differential, the state of the economy, and the balance of trade are important factors in the currency exchange rate determination. We can also add to these various psychological factors that would appear to be important in the currency exchange rate determination. Thus, a change in individuals’ perceptions regarding the state of the economy is likely to influence the currency rate of exchange. Rather than focusing on these many factors, it would make more sense to identify the key or the essential factor that determines the currency rate of exchange, that is, to identify the essence that dictates the currency rate of exchange determination. The Relative Purchasing Power of Money (PPM): The Essence of the Exchange Rate The essence of the currency exchange rate is the relative purchasing power of various monies. In a non-monetary barter economy, the 'price' of goods has to do with what trades individuals are willing to make in terms of units of goods or services (e.g., 100 apples might be exchanged for shoes). A price of a good, in monetary terms, is the amount of money exchanged for it. The 'price' of money is determined in what units of goods and services will be exchanged for it. We can also say that the amount of money exchanged for goods is the purchasing power of money (PPM) with respect to goods and services. If, in the US, the price of a good is one dollar and in the Eurozone an identical good is sold for two euros, then the rate of exchange between the US dollar and the euro is likely to be two euros per one dollar. An important factor in setting the purchasing power of money is the supply of money. Now, let us say that, over time, the growth rate in the US money supply exceeds the growth rate of European money supply, all other things being equal. Since a price of a good is the amount of money per good, this now means that the prices of goods in dollar terms will increase faster than prices in euro terms, all other things being equal. As a result, an identical good is priced now, for example, at two dollars against the one dollar previously, while in the Eurozone, 2.5 euros against 2 euros previously. This would imply that the exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro should be now 1.25 euros per one dollar and not 2 euros per one dollar. Another important factor in driving the purchasing power of various moneys and the exchange rate is a change in the demand for money. For instance, with an increase in the production of goods, the demand for money is likely to follow suit. The demand for the services of the medium of exchange is likely to increase since more goods are now going to be exchanged. As a result, for a given supply of money, the purchasing power of money will increase, all other things being equal. Less money will be chasing more goods now. Arbitrage Any deviation of the exchange rate from the rate implied by the relative purchasing power of money is likely to generate profit opportunities, which tends to undo the deviation. For instance, the deviation could emerge because of the market response to the trade account data or because of a change in the interest rate differential in the domestic economy versus other economies. Such deviations are likely to open profit opportunities for entrepreneurs. This rearranges the market toward the elimination of the underpricing. However, let us say that the Fed raises its policy interest rate while the European central bank (ECB) keeps its policy rate unchanged. If the price of a good in the US is one dollar and in the Eurozone the price of an identical good is two euros, then, according to the purchasing power framework, the currency rate of exchange should be one dollar for two euros. Because of a widening in the interest rate differential between the US and the Eurozone, an increase in the demand for dollars pushes the exchange rate in the market towards one dollar for three euros. (The holders of the euros are now exchanging more euros for dollars that are going to be placed in the dollar deposits in order to earn higher interest rates). The dollar is now overvalued versus the exchange rate as implied by the relative purchasing power of the dollar versus the euro. (It should be two euros to one dollar and not three euros to one dollar). In this situation, it will pay to sell goods for dollars, exchange dollars for euros, and then buy the goods with euros, thus making an arbitrage gain. For example, individuals could sell a good for one dollar, exchange the one dollar for three euros, and then exchange three euros for 1.5 units of the good, gaining an extra 0.5 of a good. The fact that the holders of dollars increased their demand for euros in order to profit from the arbitrage is going to make euros more expensive in terms of dollars (i.e., more dollars per euro, pushing the exchange rate in the direction of one dollar for two euros). Arbitrage is set in motion once the rate of exchange deviates—for whatever reasons—from the rate of exchange as dictated by the relative purchasing power of monies. Conclusion The key factor in the currency exchange rate determination is the relative purchasing power of various monies. If, for whatever reasons, the market currency exchange rate deviates from the exchange rate as implied by the relative purchasing power of various monies this activates an arbitrage, which works towards the convergence of the exchange rate towards the relative purchasing power of monies.

Can Australia Stay Resilient In An Unpredictable 2025? – Analysis	By Melissa Conley Tyler and Viet Dung Trinh After a positive 2024 in which Australia successfully encouraged China to reverse remaining trade restrictions, everyone expects 2025 to be a difficult year for Australia’s economy. Leading economists have predicted that the most likely impacts of US President Donald Trump’s second administration on Australia will be negative, including slower progress to net zero emissions, higher US inflation and weaker Chinese economic growth. How is Australia positioned to cope with what 2025 might throw at it? The current state of Australia’s economic statecraft is illustrated by two developments at the end of 2024. The Australian Parliament passed the ‘Future Made in Australia’ Act, setting out industry policy to build competitive new industries for the clean energy economy. At the same time, Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also launched the ‘Trading Nation’ report on how open trade and investment contribute to Australians’ prosperity. These developments show a country trying to walk a fine line between intervention and openness. For Australia, more active government involvement in markets through the Future Made in Australia plan is a significant ideological departure from the recent past. With a global retreat from open economics and a reemergence of nationalist approaches to trade, countries like Australia have had to adapt. As Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers noted, ‘it would be preposterously self-defeating to leave our policies unchanged in the face of all this industry policy taking shape and taking hold around us’. Australia is responding to these geostrategic forces by competing with industry incentives offered by other countries, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, Canada and the European Union to nurture the development of new industries. A Future Made in Australia is investing AU$22.7 billion (US$14.3 billion) into Australia’s workforce, renewable energy, supporting investment in Australia, technological and industrial renovation and utilisation of natural resources and critical minerals. It aims to produce more goods domestically, creating more job opportunities for Australians. In contrast, the Trading Nation report emphasises the role of free and open trade in Australia’s prosperity. Around 31 per cent of Australian economic output is supported by trade activity and one in every four jobs are linked to trade. Global trade regulation, such as through the World Trade Organization, is described as one of the pillars of Australians’ prosperity, supporting the stability of the trading environment and providing Australian exporters with access to markets. Australia’s 18 bilateral and regional free trade agreements on average boost trade by 13 per cent and covered around 78 per cent of Australia’s two-way goods and services trade as of 2022. New, creative accords like the Singapore–Australia Green Economy Agreement encourage trade, open business opportunities and facilitate investment in industries that promote the net zero transition. The report also makes the case for foreign investment to facilitate access to more capital and investment, with Australia’s openness to foreign investment contributing to the country’s development, job creation and improvement of living standards. Sectors like banking, energy, infrastructure, resources and agriculture — essential to achieving the goal of net zero — are largely dependent on foreign investment. Placed side-by-side, the two reports illustrate a country trying to find a balance between different imperatives. This is in line with a report by the Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy & Defence Dialogue (AP4D), which argued that it is in Australia’s interests to promote a transparent, predictable and rules-based global trading system alongside industry measures. This is an important message to keep in focus in 2025 with the likelihood of another US–China trade war and tit-for-tat protectionism in response to US tariffs. It is worth remembering that an open global trading system is a vital counter to attempted economic coercion, allowing targeted industries to seek out alternative markets. Following China’s 2020 trade restrictions, Australia’s ability to withstand China’s economic coercion by redirecting targeted commodities was a factor in Beijing deciding to reverse remaining trade restrictions. During the period of attempted economic coercion, there were advocates focused on ‘friendshoring’ — selling more to countries perceived as allies and friends, particularly collaborating on supply chains and foreign investment. But this can be difficult and expensive, working against economic logic. Diversification is better achieved by agnostically increasing the number of markets, reducing the risk of disruption in any one market. It is also important for Australia to keep sight of the importance of the global economic system and its significant role within it. Australia has actively supported and played a leading role in the creation of global rules that underpin the rise of global trade, even being one of the founding members of the World Trade Organization. Particularly during the second Trump administration, Australia should focus on cooperating with like-minded states to ‘save the furniture’ of the global trading system. Despite the challenges that 2025 will bring, Australia’s economic statecraft cannot focus only on domestic industry policy — it must also promote open trade and investment. In an unpredictable global economic environment, Australia’s policy responses need to continue to strike the right balance. This means that in 2025, Australia needs to continue its approach of supporting the global trading system alongside industry measures.

China’s LAC Infrastructure In Xinjiang: A Colonial Perspective – ...	By Ayjaz Wani In a tactical move to reduce the travel time between northern and southern Xinjiang from seven hours to three hours while protecting goods from harsh winter conditions, China completed excavating the world’s longest roadway tunnel in the Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang in December 2024. The 22.13 km tunnel, set to open in 2025, is crucial to China’s ambitious 319.72 km Urumqi-Yuli Expressway. Around the same time, China’s Central Committee of the Communist Party (CCCP) and State Council approved the creation of two new counties, He’an and Hekang, in the Aksai Chin region of India, which was unlawfully ceded to China by Pakistan through a border agreement in 1963. The illegal creation of new counties in the Aksai Chin region, close on the heels of the recent rapprochement with India, shows Beijing's colonial mentality, adding to the complexities of Sino-India bilateral relations. The new counties managed by Khotan prefecture and the establishment of counties in the uninhabited region close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) represent an effort aimed at building infrastructure and increasing the Han population along the border, reminiscent of actions taken during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. However, China has maintained that the tunnel will enhance connectivity and support the socio-economic development of southern regions predominantly inhabited by Uyghurs, thus strengthening unity among ethnicities. China’s Xinjiang border policy post-1949 Xinjiang’s history is marked by conflicts over its autonomy and independence. Chinese imperial rule lasted only 400 years, until 1949. In 1720, the Qing dynasty extended its control into the area for the first time since the Tang dynasty, but sustaining authority was challenging. This historical context is crucial to understanding China's current Xinjiang border policy. After 1760, Qing leaders began relocating Han criminals from the mainland to Xinjiang, providing them subsidies and loans to settle and farm. After 1950, Beijing initiated the mass migration of the Han people to the province to leverage its natural resources, establish political dominance, and integrate the local population into Chinese culture. Following 1949, this migration aimed to exploit resources and safeguard the frontier from external influences, particularly those of the erstwhile Soviet Union. Following 1958, 60,000 Kazaks moved to the former Soviet Central Asian Republics. Beijing responded by sealing the border and forcibly relocating thousands of non-Han families from the border area, replacing them with Han citizens. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), established in 1954, facilitated all these population transfers. Comprising primarily of demobilised troops, XPCC functions as an economic enterprise and military force, wielding considerable governmental authority that impacts the region’s socio-political and financial dynamics. The organisation aimed to relocate Han individuals outside existing cities by establishing colonies, promoting the slogan of ‘transforming nature and reforming man’ to reclaim land, build industries, explore natural resources, and construct strategic roads and railway lines. XPCC assisted Beijing in extracting oil and gas from Xinjiang. Estimates indicate the region has 23.4 billion tonnes of oil reserves and 13 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves. The XPCC constructed the Xinjiang-Xizang highway through Aksai Chin. By 1958, over 6,000 miles of roads had been built. The highway network expanded from 17,830 km in 2015 to 20,920 km in 2020. After 2021, Beijing commenced the construction of new roads towards the LAC from the G219 highway, which runs along the border. Beijing has prioritised building strategic roads and highways in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) to upgrade the LAC infrastructure in Tibet and Xinjiang. Similarly, China is also constructing the rail networks in Xinjiang, which have expanded from 5,900 km in 2015 to approximately 7,800 km in 2020. Colonial rationale behind the new counties and infrastructure Most Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang reside in the southern regions, particularly in Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, and Kurla, where they have managed to resist the Chinese Communist Party's enforced sinicisation, a process of assimilating non-Chinese communities into Chinese culture. Beijing’s growing security and economic interests in neighbouring Central and South Asia and concerns about potential unrest within southern Xinjiang have forced China to create new counties and increase its push for infrastructure. Despite its draconian policies in Xinjiang, Beijing is increasingly concerned about the rising security dilemmas along the Pakistan border, making enhancing security measures there and along Uyghur-dominated regions a priority. The new Han migrants are mostly retired army personnel and work as a security force wielding administrative powers. Additionally, due to the rising demand for lithium and the estimated presence of 2 million tons of lithium in the vicinity of these new counties, XPCC intends to promote mining in the area. The Tianshan Shengli Tunnel will enhance Xinjiang’s connectivity and boost Chinese trade and commerce with Central Asia, especially after the completion of the China- Kyrgyzstan- Uzbekistan railway line. Enhanced connectivity will attract more Chinese companies and further integrate the south of Xinjiang with Eurasian nations under the Belt and Road Initiative. Similarly, establishing two new counties in the parts of the Aksai Chin region of India will facilitate the transfer of Han migrants to the area through XPCC to develop new infrastructure and logistics to support the Chinese army in the region, which will have geostrategic implications along the LAC for India. India’s response After 1991, China capitalised on Central Asia's economic and political instability to extend its influence into the tumultuous Xinjiang region. Beijing exploited the economic and political upheaval in the Central Asian countries bordering Xinjiang, securing 22 per cent, 32 per cent, and 3.5 per cent of land claimed from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, respectively. Beijing tried the same towards India after 2020, which heightened tensions along the LAC and increased standoffs. Unlike other neighbouring countries in restive Xinjiang, New Delhi has intensified its infrastructure initiatives in Kashmir and Ladakh. It has built the impressive Chenab Bridge, recognised as the tallest cable-stayed bridge in the world, alongside the 12.77 km T49 rail tunnel. Additionally, the ongoing construction of the 13.5 km Zojila Tunnel showcases India’s exceptional engineering feats and strategic edge over its rivals. Since 2019, India’s Prime Minister has personally overseen many of these geoeconomic and geostrategic projects. On 13 January 2025, the Prime Minister formally opened the Z-Mohr tunnel on the critical Srinagar-Leh highway. The Zojila Tunnel is anticipated to be finished by 2026, further boosting New Delhi's strategic influence in Eastern Ladakh and along the LAC. India has also expanded its road and bridge infrastructure along the LAC in Ladakh. In 2021, 87 bridges were completed, while in 2022, the Defence Minister inaugurated projects costing INR 2,180 crores, including 18 solely dedicated to Ladakh. Following the successful rail connection with Kashmir, New Delhi should prioritise the 489 km Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway line to swiftly deploy forces and equipment along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh. To maintain its pace and strategic advantage over Beijing along the LAC, India requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes expedited infrastructure development, enhanced defence capabilities, and collaborative international efforts with allied nations to counter Chinese deceptive tactics.

Kadyrov’s Efforts To Create Chechen Muftiate In Ingushetia Threat...	Chechnya’s leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has never made his hopes a secret to absorb Ingushetia (a neighboring republic within the Russian Federation) and perhaps portions of Dagestan into his republic, both of which were part of the Chechen-Ingush republic in the past (see EDM, September 27, 2018, February 28, 2023). In 2019, he compelled Magas to hand over 10 percent of Ingushetia to his control (see EDM, December 1, 2021). More recently, Kadyrov has supported the Batal-Haji Sufi order in Ingushetia, a group that is now in open conflict not only with Magas but Moscow as well (Fortanga.org, November 4, 2022; Window on Eurasia, December 8, 2022, January 28; see EDM, January 24, 2023). Now, Kadyrov has launched an indirect effort to subordinate Ingushetia to himself and his republic through the use of Islam (see EDM, March 24, 2022). According to the independent Fortanga news agency, he has organized meetings in Cairo with Ingush Muslims to create a new muftiate for Ingushetia that will supervise Muslim parishes there, giving him yet another basis for exercising leverage over the government in Magas as well (Fortanga, January 31). On January 31, Fortanga reported, based on conversations with two informed sources, that Chechnya’s mufti, Salakh Mehiyev, with Kadyrov’s backing, began talks in Cairo with a group of instructors of the Ingush Islamic University about the possibility of forming a new muftiate in Ingushetia (Ibid). Many federal subjects of the Russian Federation have more than one such organization, also known as Muslim spiritual directorates (MSDs). The Chechen-backed move, however, appears intended not to become yet another of these institutions there but rather to replace the existing MSD with a Chechen-controlled one, something Fortanga suggests has the support of some in the Magas government (Ibid). According to one of Fortanga’s sources, participants in the talks have the support of Salakh Mezhiev, the chairman of the coordination center of Muslims of the North Caucasus Federal District, and Adam Shakhidov, an advisor to Kadyrov. Moreover, this source claims, 'Mahmud-Ali Kalimatov [head of the Ingush Republic] is also aware of the plans. Representatives of the local clergy carry out consultations on further actions between the heads of the two regions. [But] participants in the process are afraid of leaks and public discontent and act as quietly as possible' (Fortanga, January 31). This is an indication of just how explosive such a development could be. Another sign of the sensitivity of these talks is how the most recent round occurred not in Magas or Grozny but in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. According to Fortanga’s second source, Grozny officials decided on this radical step after failing in their earlier efforts to win over Isa Khamkhoyev, the former mufti of Ingushetia (Ibid). Earlier, Chechen officials tried to win over the head of Ingushetia MSD. That failure highlights what is likely to be widespread opposition among Muslims in Ingushetia to what the Chechens are trying to do, however much money Grozny may be willing to spend and however much support those who go along with the Chechens may receive from Kalimatov. In Fortanga’s words, all this clearly indicates that 'the goals being pursued by Ingushetia’s neighbor are power and the creation of their own team, which will give them influence over the republic and its internal processes' (Fortanga, January 31). Three aspects of this development make it far more significant than it might appear at first glance. First, the Chechen effort to create a new MSD in Ingushetia may very well succeed, at least initially, because the Ingush governor has long had a troubled relationship with the republic muftiate and now appears ready to work with the Chechens (APN.ru, November 26, 2021). Thiswill reduce the authority of the current governor and may even lead to a new round of protests against him if a new muftiate is created or even if Ingush residents become aware that Kalimatov is working with the Chechens. Many Ingush residents will likely view this as an act of betrayal, just as they viewed signing of an accord in 2019 by Kalimatov’s predecessor Yunus-Bek Yevkurov which transferred 10 percent of the smallest non-Russian republic to Chechen control when he (see EDM, September 27, 2018, April 9, 2019). The accord sparked the largest protests in Ingush history, with tens of thousands taking to the streets and numerous arrests, trials, and imprisonments that have lasted in some cases until now (Window on Eurasia, October 11, 2021, December 7, 2024). Second, the border issue in Ingushetia is heating up again. On the one hand, members of the Ingush Seven, as the leaders of the protest became known, are now being released from prison. The Ingush are welcoming them as heroes, but some Russian officials want them to be drafted and sent to fight and possibly die in Ukraine, suggestions that have outraged many in Ingushetia (Fortanga.org, February 5). On the other hand, Moscow officials have expressed support for further changing the border between Ingushetia and Chechnya in Grozny’s favor (Fortanga.org, December 11, 12, 2024). Many Ingush will view talk of a Chechnya-controlled muftiate in their republic through these optics, and some may decide that they need to take to the streets again lest their republic be further reduced to a shadow of its former self, something that is more likely if news of Chechnya’s role in creating a new muftiate spreads. One activist responded that Grozny will not stop until it controls all of the Ingush Republic (Fortanga.org, December 18, 2024). Third, Grozny’s move to create a muftiate in Ingushetia that Chechnya controls is going to echo across the North Caucasus, especially in Dagestan, where Kadyrov has also made territorial claims. The meeting of any of them in Dagestan would likely trigger more violence in what is rapidly becoming the most unstable republic in the Russian Federation (Window on Eurasia, March 13, October 12, 20, 2024; Kavkaz Uzel, August 12, 2024). The danger that what Kadyrov is doing will destabilize the North Caucasus more generally may cause Moscow to try to prevent Kadyrov from taking action on a new Ingush muftiate. In the past, however, the Kremlin has often found it hard to rein in the Chechen leader given his ability so far to keep Chechnya quiet and provide support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agenda. Both the dangers of more destabilization in the North Caucasus more generally, as well as the radicalization of Islam among Chechens in the Republic of Georgia and the revival of secular Chechen nationalism in the emigration and among Chechens fighting against Moscow in Ukraine, may lead some in Moscow to conclude that they need to rein in Kadyrov, despite the risks that any such moves would have (Window on Eurasia, January 24, February 12). Consequently, what might appear to some as a minor administrative shift in the governance of the Muslims of Ingushetia could have enormous consequences not only in the North Caucasus but in Moscow as well.

From Tariffs To Turmoil: Trump’s Protectionist Playbook – Analysi...	US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports on February 10, doubling down on his protectionist agenda to 'boost' the U.S. economy through import taxes, a move that could disrupt trade with key partners. Set to take effect on March 4, the tariffs will impact the 25 million tons of steel the U.S. imports annually. This follows a White House decision to delay tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the largest steel exporters alongside Brazil and South Korea. The move marks another step in Trump’s aggressive trade policy, coming just days after the administration imposed a sweeping 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, escalating tensions with global trade partners. The policy enforces tariffs 'without exceptions or exemptions,' ending carve-outs previously granted to certain nations and raising aluminum duty rates. This mirrors Trump’s 2018 tariffs during his first term, which triggered global retaliation. By rejecting multilateral trade norms, the move risks escalating trade disputes while prioritizing economic nationalism over diplomatic engagement, despite warnings of market disruptions and strained international relations. Trump has also hinted at reciprocal tariffs on countries imposing duties on U.S. imports, though specifics on exemptions or targeted nations remain unclear: 'If they charge us, we charge them.' Given that Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and South Korea are major steel and aluminum sources, the policy may worsen critical trade ties and increase international trade tensions. Fears of a perfect storm in world trade have already been triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of wide-ranging tariffs on products from Mexico, Canada, and China. Enacting executive authority to tackle the 'major threat' of illegal immigration and drug trafficking—including fentanyl—Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico as well as 10 percent on Chinese imports. Additionally, he promised trade restrictions on European goods and intends to introduce 'reciprocal tariffs' on other nations very soon. Historically, Trump has always argued that focusing on countries having trade surpluses against the United States would boost the American economy and has even mentioned tariffs as a possible substitute for an income tax. Once again Trump has supported a protectionist economic plan despite acknowledging their potential economic damage on the United States and calling it a required price. America’s three biggest trading partners—China, Mexico and Canada—reacted immediately. While China imposed countermeasures aimed at U.S. exports including crude oil, LPG, and farm machinery, Canada and Mexico reacted with punitive tariffs. Beijing has also started a Google antitrust investigation and threatened to bring suit against the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Investors in Asia and Europe are preparing themselves for the consequences of an escalating trade conflict. The interruption of global supply networks, increased stock market volatility, and worries of lasting financial instability highlight the wide-ranging effects of Trump’s tariff-based approach on the international economic system. Far from providing the unilateral advantages he contends, Trump’s tariff war will exact a great cost on the American economy. Given that rising business expenses are passed on to consumers, the most immediate outcome would be accelerated inflation, which provides a sharp contrast to Trump’s pledge to control rising costs. Greater tariffs will interrupt global supply chains, stifling growth and investment, lowering borrowing costs, and even hurting U.S. exports. The measures are predicted to hit particularly hard leading industries such as agriculture and the car sector. Should Trump expand this tariff conflict to Europe, the financial consequences for the United States would amplify, lowering growth and aggravating internal issues. Far from what Trump claims, the expenses of this protectionist approach more than exceed any potential advantages. History shows clearly how Trump’s trade initiatives have faltered. Under the pretense of lowering the U.S. trade deficit, he started a trade war with China during his first term by means of $400 billion in tariffs. Six years later—even as President Biden continued with this protectionism—the deficit has hardly shifted. Indeed, this trade war has never really been about the deficit. Rather, it is part of a general U.S. policy to restrain the ascent of China. Trade restrictions and attempts to limit China’s access to sophisticated technologies, notably semiconductors and AI development, have been part of this plan. The United States has been trying everything to slow down China’s economic rise. The attempt to contain the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek for it not only showcases China’s resilience but also reveals the weaknesses of American attempts to block its technological and economic advancement. The ultimate outcomes of Trump’s tariff policies remain uncertain, but one consequence is undeniable: the United States is steadily dismantling the rule-based international order established after World War II, a system anchored in free trade and globalization. By withdrawing from international treaties and organizations and doubling down on protectionism, the United States is undermining the very framework that has sustained global stability. This shift risks creating greater chaos and instability at both global and regional levels. Moreover, a transactional approach to trade wars alienates allies and fails to significantly curb China’s rise, while simultaneously destabilizing the global economic order. In pursuing short-term gains, the United States risks long-term damage to its interests and the foundations of the international system it once championed.

Donald Trump’s Tariffs: Bad Economics And Maybe Illegal, Too – Op...	Amid the flurry of unconstitutional or illegal executive orders from President Donald Trump—for example, the freezing of congressionally approved spending, the end of constitutionally stipulated birthright citizenship, and the mass firing of prosecutors—lies another one that, unfortunately, he is more likely to get away with. Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, Trump, who earlier had questionably declared a 'national emergency' at the U.S. border, is using this law to threaten to impose 25 percent tariffs (import taxes) on Canada and Mexico and 10 percent on China 'because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.' Drug flows and illegal immigration are certainly problems, though the extent to which they rise to the legal definition of a 'national emergency' is debatable. Other means of solving them exist short of threatening to start a wider trade war with the largest U.S. trading partners and possibly threatening the post-war open-world trading system. Trump’s threatened use of tariffs seems especially punitive given the minimal level of illegal immigrants and fentanyl flowing over the border from Canada—in fact, the net flow of drugs seems to be in the reverse direction. Yet, Trump believes that because the United States has the largest market in the world, such import taxes will hurt other countries more than the United States, thus making available a valuable instrument of threatened coercion. However, countries and companies trade because it is mutually beneficial for them to do so. Therefore, threatening or imposing import taxes—paid by the American consumer—is an economic murder-suicide. Other countries may be hurt more than the United States, but the people of all countries are hurt by bilateral or multilateral trade wars. Slower economic growth and higher prices result when the flow of trade and market conditions are uncertain or impaired. Sometimes, this effect can be catastrophic. Many economists believe that the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 and foreign retaliation deepened the economic downturn into the Great Depression. As a result of economic disruptions caused by the Great Depression and World War II, the United States was instrumental in creating (and greatly benefited from) the post-war system of free trade and free markets. Ironically, Trump’s threatened import taxes and possible trade war likely will benefit China by positioning that communist country as the new guardian of free trade worldwide. The bad economics of import taxes was succinctly summed up by Senator Rand Paul(R-KY), one of the few Republicans to criticize Trump’s tariffs: 'Tariffs are simply taxes. Conservatives once united against new taxes. Taxing trade will mean less trade and higher prices.' Another question that has gotten far less attention is whether imposing import taxes under the IEEPA law is constitutional. Make no mistake, other presidents have used IEEPA many times since 1977 to retaliate for other countries’ behavior—in sixty-nine 'national emergencies,' to be exact—but these all placed U.S. restrictions on financial transactions in target countries rather than imposing taxes on Americans for their imports. This misuse of IEEPA will probably result in legal challenges. Furthermore, most of the sixty-nine declared 'national emergencies' in which IEEPA was invoked were hardly that. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 was designed to reduce presidential misuse of this overwrought designation for everyday non-catastrophic problems. Yet that act failed—probably on purpose—to constrain presidential use of such emergencies since it didn’t define them. Instead, it allowed the president to declare one as long as a specific reason was given. One recent example of the abuse of the designation of national emergencies was Barack Obama’s economic sanctions against foreign computer hackers. An even more important problem is the past delegation of Congress’s constitutional responsibility 'to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations' and 'to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises' via laws allowing broad discretion by the president. In addition to initiating war, treaties, and budgeting, Congress has also forfeited its power in international trade and taxation to an imperial presidency. In the almost inevitable legal challenges to Trump’s tariff policy, a primary one should be via the non-delegation doctrine, which maintains that Congress cannot cede legislative powers to the executive. This occurs often enough in order to blame the president for bad policies. However, the Supreme Court should view presidential abuse of trade policy with a jaundiced eye and force Congress to exercise its rightful powers.

Canada’s Ailing National Healthcare Is Not A Model For America – ...	By Nikolai G. Wenzel Earlier this month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau began a US-Canada economic summit designed to improve his country’s economic climate. Canada’s political landscape is shifting. After nearly a decade in office, Trudeau has announced his resignation, with the Party leadership election scheduled for March 9. He will leave behind a country that has been grappling with a decade of disillusionment. Trudeau’s legacy will be marred by soaring taxes and a Canadian economy that many now describe as being on 'life support.' The country’s healthcare provision is the weakest part of its economy. For years, American reformers have idolized Canadian healthcare, touting it as the gold standard for universal care, and a model to replace an American system that is also broken. But the reality tells a starkly different story. In Canada, wait times are unmanageable, access to services is dwindling, and public trust is eroding. Recent data indicate that one in six Canadians lacks a regular family physician, and fewer than half can secure an appointment with a primary care provider within a day or two. This shortage has led to overwhelmed emergency rooms and significant delays in care. In 2023, more than 1.3 million Canadians abandoned emergency room visits due to excessive wait times. Some hospitals have even exceeded 200% capacity, forcing patients into hallways and onto floors. As Americans reckon with record deficits and runaway government spending, some voices are once again touting the Canadian example as cheaper and more effective than the US system. One of the loudest cheerleaders for Canada’s model is Wendell Potter, a former healthcare executive turned activist, who has lately been painting a utopian vision of Canada’s government-run healthcare in op-eds and interviews. But like all advocates of socialized medicine, Potter is peddling an illusion rather than reckoning with the harsh realities Canadians face daily. Consider the data. Patients in Canada often wait months for critical procedures. According to the Fraser Institute, the median wait time for medically necessary treatments in 2022 was over 27 weeks—nearly double what it was in 1993. For many Canadians, timely access to care is not a guarantee but a gamble. For patients with life-threatening conditions, these delays can mean the difference between recovery and irreversible harm. The deterioration of Canada’s healthcare has not gone unnoticed by its citizens. Recent polls show that dissatisfaction with healthcare is at an all-time high, with many Canadians now exploring private care options to bypass the public system’s inefficiencies. Some 75% of Canadians now believe their nation’s healthcare is in crisis. 'Free' healthcare costs the average citizen nearly $9,000 a year in taxes, and people who once championed Medicare are acknowledging its shortcomings. The problems plaguing Canadian healthcare are deeply rooted in its design. A single-payer arrangement relies on the government (i.e., the taxpayer) as the sole payer for healthcare services, ostensibly ensuring universal access. But basic economics predicts two problems. First, as sticker prices fall (because a portion of the cost is subsidized by taxpayers), demand will increase. Second, as the government does not respond to market forces, there is no incentive for supply to grow. When demand outpaces supply, as it has in Canada, the limitations become glaringly obvious. Hospitals face chronic underfunding, staffing shortages are widespread, and technological investments lag behind those of other developed nations. Despite a population of 40 million, there are only 432 MRI machines in the country. The US has more than 13,000. These structural issues lead to the long wait times and reduced access that have become hallmarks of Canadian healthcare. Another alarming consequence of these failures is the rising use of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID). Reports have emerged of patients feeling pressured into considering euthanasia due to inadequate access to care. Since its legalization in 2016, MAID has accounted for 4% of deaths in Canada, and some fear that systemic healthcare failures are influencing these decisions. Scarce resources must be allocated somehow; if markets can’t encourage increased supply, rationing will take place through waiting. Or worse. Meanwhile, advocates of Canada’s model argue that the American system is broken because it prioritizes profit over care. There is certainly room for reform in the US. But US healthcare is anything but a free-market wonder (or the market dystopia condemned by its detractors). Before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ('Obamacare'), more than half of US healthcare expenditures were already funded by various government sources. If we add a tangled web of regulations and distortions, it’s no wonder that prices are so high. No country’s healthcare is without flaws, but Canada’s current crisis should serve as a cautionary tale rather than an aspiration. By romanticizing Canada’s healthcare system, advocates of fully nationalized healthcare gloss over the lived experiences of countless Canadians struggling to access essential care. Their narrative does little to address the failures that have led to this crisis, offering a one-sided view of American healthcare that conveniently ignores the shortcomings of the alternative. Whether the US-Canada summit delivers meaningful solutions or simply serves as a political farewell tour remains to be seen. In any event, Trudeau’s resignation signals a new chapter for Canada, and it is an opportune moment to confront the mythologies surrounding its policies—particularly its healthcare system. Canada offers a cautionary tale of what happens when lofty ideals collide with practical realities. The cracks in Canada’s healthcare model are too large to ignore. The lesson is clear for Americans still enamored with replicating Canada’s single-payer arrangement—be careful what you wish for. Promising universal access but failing to deliver timely care is not a model worth emulating. Canada’s healthcare crisis is a wake-up call for its citizens and anyone who believes in the promise of universal care. As Trud­eau’s political legacy fades, the urgent task of addressing Canada’s failures remains. Advocates of full nationalization of healthcare would do well to shift their focus from selling dreams to confronting realities. Only then can the conversation about healthcare reform—on both sides of the border—begin to move in a meaningful direction. Healthcare in Canada, the US, and beyond needs more consumer choice, less regulation, and better-aligned incentives—not more socialism. About the author: Nikolai G.

Anthony Fauci Museum Exhibit Cancelled – OpEd	The federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has canceled a $168,000 grant for an exhibit on Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in suburban Silver Spring, Md. The cancellation might prompt people to 'muse' on the career of Dr. Fauci, who in 2021 claimed that 'attacks on me, quite frankly, are attacks on science.' That’s a rather bold claim for a non-practicing physician whose bio shows no advanced degrees in molecular biology or biochemistry, vital disciplines in the field of virology. So it was doubtless a purely bureaucratic move when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) made Dr. Fauci head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in 1984. Kary Mullis, who earned a PhD from UC Berkeley, and won a Nobel Prize for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, was on record that Dr. Fauci didn’t understand medicine and 'should not be in a position like he’s in.' Fauci went on to prove Mullis right. Dr. Fauci’s drug of choice to treat AIDS was AZT (azidothymidine, zidovudine), rejected for cancer treatment because of high toxicity. In the early 1990s, Fauci’s NIAID forced AZT and other toxic drugs on foster children in New York City, with deadly results. For further information see the BBC’s Guinea Pig Kids and The Real Anthony Fauci by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Dr. Fauci’s prediction that AIDS would ravage the general population never came to pass, and it wasn’t even close. As Michael Fumento showed in The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS, the syndrome remained most prominent among male homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and intravenous drug users. Despite the error, Dr. Fauci remained at the helm of NIAID. In 2019, Dr. Fauci funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) to perform gain-of-function research, once banned in the United States, that makes viruses more lethal and transmissible. The NIAID boss maintained that the COVID virus was 'zoonotic,' arising naturally in the wild. Scientists more qualified than Fauci, including CDC Director Robert Redfield, found evidence of a laboratory origin. Dr. Fauci branded them 'conspiracy theorists' and Dr. Redfield even got death threats. The NIAID boss imposed a lockdown regime that was particularly hard on families with children in school. That prompted the scientists of the Great Barrington Declaration to push for a more humane approach. NIH Director Francis Collins tasked Fauci with a 'devastating takedown' of those 'fringe epidemiologists,' most if not all more qualified than Fauci and Collins. Dr. Fauci proclaimed there was no need to wear a mask, then said to wear one maskbefore advocating two masks. The NIAID boss imposed distancing rules and urged vaccines even for children, the least vulnerable group. It later emerged that the masks were useless, and the distancing rules were simply made up and not based on any science. Fauci’s vaunted vaccines failed to prevent infection and transmission, which the fully boosted NIAID boss confirmed by coming down with COVID. After more than 50 years as a government bureaucrat and nearly 40 years as head of NIAID, Dr. Fauci retired in 2023 but continued to receive taxpayer-funded transportation and security services. In November 2024, Fauci authored a paper claiming that HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, was 'zoonotic,' just like the COVID virus. That reversed his position from the 1980s when he smeared the scientists who challenged him, all more qualified than himself, as 'AIDS denialists.' On Jan. 20, on his way out of the White House, Joe Biden issued a pardon for Dr. Anthony Fauci. Whatever the pardon was for—Sen. Rand Paul, author of Deception: The Great Covid Coverup, made a criminal referral to the Biden Department of Justice—wasn’t likely to turn up in Fauci’s museum exhibit. His network remains in place and that calls for deep reform. At the very least, the NIAID director should be limited to a single four-year term, with all grants posted online in real-time. Never again must a single person control public health policy and spending on medical research. Absent these and other reforms, white coat supremacy could well mount a comeback. In 2021, Dr. Fauci explained the WCS concept: I think what people have to appreciate is that indeed, you do have personal liberties for yourself and you should be in control of that. But you are a member of society, and as a member of society—reaping all the benefits of being a member of society—you have a responsibility to society. And I think each of us, particularly in the context of a pandemic that’s killing millions of people, you have got to look at it and say there comes a time when you do have to give up what you consider your individual right of making your own decision, for the greater good of society.

Ralph Nader: Trump/Musk Dictatorship Is Galvanizing The American ...	Madmen Trump and Musk are moving with warp speed to illegally and dictatorially wreck America and enrich themselves in the process. Forget the use of the terms 'autocracy' and 'constitutional crisis.' This is a savage dictatorship, getting worse by the day. Trump is attacking the courts, ignoring Congress run by a cowardly GOP, pushing to cut off critical assistance for tens of millions of Americans, devastating health, safety, food (Meals on Wheels), education (Head Start), and Medicaid insurance protections. The rabid, ravaging, unstable Musk and his Chief Musketeer Trump are shutting down whole agencies, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Agency for International Development (only Congress can do this). The CFPB is the federal cop enforcing laws against corporate crooks stealing your money in myriad ways, and returning many billions of dollars back to you. As for shuttering illegally the U.S. Agency for International Development, consider what is happening in these direly poor countries, as reported in the New York Times: 'Funds from the world’s richest nation once flowed from the largest global aid agency to an intricate network of small, medium and large organizations that delivered aid: H.I.V. medication for more than 20 million people; nutrition supplements for starving children; support for refugees, orphaned children and women battered by violence.' ('Chaos and Confusion Reign as U.S. Cuts Off Aid to Millions Globally' by Apoorva Mandavilli, February 12, 2025). Trump is also cutting monitoring for the emergence of deadly epidemics such as Ebola, drug-resistant Tuberculosis, Malaria and other lethal viruses and bacteria, which could come to the U.S. like COVID-19 did. The cost of all these vital protections is less than one percent of the federal budget. These safeguards have been supported by both Republican and Democratic Presidents – until Trump’s brutal reign of terror. Children, women (maternal health assistance) and men are dying now in places like Africa. Americans are just starting to suffer with the unlawful cutoff of funds (only Congress can do this) and the firing of thousands of dedicated civil servants ministering to their fellow Americans in need. U.S.A.I.D. is the humanitarian face of America, and Republicans like Marco Rubio once called it necessary for our country’s national security. American businesses are starting to feel Musk’s poisonous tusks. Just with closing A.I.D., this South African racist ordered the sign on its headquarters taken down. 100,000 positions have been cut overseas, an estimated 52,000 Americans in 42 states have lost their jobs. Agricultural food supplies ready for export are starting to rot in warehouses and ports, according to the Times. The Trump/Musk machetes are swinging wildly striking beyond bullying the poor, defenseless, and powerless, and also upending the business community. Much of our government is contracted out to millions of businesses – small and large. Their contracts are being ripped up by this lying, corrupt President who many business leaders helped elect last November. However, voters electing Trump didn’t mean that they elected a fascist dictator betraying his campaign boasts and 'Day One'promises with the first flurry of executive orders or dictates violating our Constitution, statutes, and international laws. There is a systemic cunning behind the wild rioting that Trump and Musk are causing. First, their actions are not about efficiency. Here is their broad scheme. First fire the cops, the law enforcers against corporate violators of worker, consumer, environmental, and small investor protections. Many federal agencies have current investigations into Musk’s companies (SEC, NHTSA, EPA, FAA, etc.). Second, establish a kleptocracy to enrich both Musk and Trump personally. (See the February 13, 2025, New York Times article by Eric Lipton titled 'Under Trump Shake-Up, Benefits for Musk Empire'). Third, smash programs assisting people, while protecting huge waste, fraud, and abuse from corporate crime harming taxpayers (e.g., fraud on Medicare/Medicaid) and vast outlays of corporate welfare – giveaways, subsidies, bailouts, and endless tax escapes by big business. After all, Trump and Musk are both corporatists. The military/industrial complex’s unauditable Pentagon budget is untouchable. Far from squeezing the enormous waste, redundancy, and corporate fraud, Trump gives every sign of supporting an additional $150 billion, which should go for domestic necessities, to this years’ Defense Department’s swollen taxpayer appropriations. After all, Trump and Musk are militarists. What of the resistance, presently mounting, but still outrun and over-run by the Trumpster gangsters? Americans don’t like to be told to shut up; they don’t like to have things rightfully theirs taken from their families; they don’t like to be fired en masse without cause; they don’t like government contracts for vital services being arbitrarily broken. They also don’t like their government being overthrown by fascistic gangsters. Street demonstrations are spreading from Washington to California, from Oregon to Florida. Government employees and their unions are filing lawsuits in federal courts. Half of the country’s state Attorneys General are filing numerous court challenges. The mainstream media, under direct attack by Trump, and being frivolously sued by Trump, is still reporting and investigating. The campuses will start rumbling as Trump/Musk cuts to medical research and other aids to education corrode these institutions. Retired military personnel are voicing their objections to the devastation of the kind of America and the freedom they fought to defend. (See veteransforpeace.org.) Veteran benefits are on draft-dodger Trump’s cutting table. The American Bar Association (ABA) has finally spoken out. On February 11, 2025, the ABA assailed the disregard of the judiciary and threats to judges by Trump/Musk/Vance, which 'threaten the very foundation of our constitutional system.' The ABA calls for every lawyer and legal organization to speak with one voice and to condemn the efforts of any administration that suggests its actions are beyond the reach of judicial review.' Soon the business community, unable to tolerate the chaos, inflation, instability, and recklessness of Trump’s regime’s contracting violations, will speak out as economic indices fall, including stock markets. It will take a few weeks or months, with heightened inflation, for this disruptive pipeline to reach critical mass as it will everywhere including the Red States where Trump supporters are concentrated. As one example, one of Biden’s enacted laws 'is projected to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into low-carbon energy technologies.' Most of these benefits are in Republican-voting communities in Red States 'where they are creating a once-in-a-generation manufacturing boom.' (The New York Times). Recall, Trump’s 'drill, baby, drill' mantra of climate violence was linked with downgrading efficient solar energy and shutting down wind power projects under construction, along with the EPA’s work. Once Trump’s voters and his business base start turning against him, with wide media coverage and dropping polls, the stage will be set for surging demands for his resignation and impeachment that starts with 'impossible,' then 'possible,' then 'probable,' then conviction. If the GOP sees either its political skin at risk in 2026 versus Trump’s destructive, daily delusions and dangerous daily damage, politicians will put their political fortunes first. That is what Congressional Republicans did when they told Nixon to resign in 1974 over the Watergate scandal – a peapod by comparison with Trump’s wholesale subversions of our government to one man rule who has said 'With Article II, I can do whatever I want as President.' Call the White House switchboard 202-456-1414 and tell Trump to stop the destruction of America and go back to Mar-a-Lago.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adESSDNs-XzyJ	2025-02-17T15:44:40-08:00	
Maldives: Treading Cautiously – Analysis	By Sanchita Bhattacharya Maldives recorded no terrorism-linked fatality in 2024. The abduction and killing of blogger Yameen Rasheed by a local affiliate of Al-Qaeda on April 23, 2017, was the last terrorism related incident of the country. There have, nevertheless, been at least nine terrorist attacks in the country since the Rasheed killing, including three in 2019, four in 2020 and one each in 2021 and 2022. Further, there have been no incidents of terrorism-linked arrests in Maldives in 2024, continuing with the trend of 2023, as against 26 such arrests in 2022. Nevertheless, as reported in January 2024, according to the country's intelligence sources, Maldives not only remains a hub of Islamic State (IS) operatives but also of Pakistan-based terrorist groups, as well as of narcotics smugglers with international linkages. Sources indicate that a Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) base has also been identified in Maldives in the past. Maldives faces a major problem from radical Islamist fundamentalists who fund local governments, with the involvement of some big business houses. These business houses have also been drawn towards China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Moreover, key Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP) operative Umar Nisar Bhat alias Qasim Khorasani, who was arrested in 2021, stated in his confession that he was in regular touch with the Bangladesh and Maldives-based Islamic Ameer (chief), who could have used this link to expand terrorist propaganda networks. However, at the official level, on October 1, 2024, Maldives participated in the 10th Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh/ISIS (D-ISIS) hosted by then U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, D.C. and reiterated Maldives' unwavering belief that terrorism must never be associated with any religion, nationality, or ethnicity. With the Maldives engagement at the Ministerial Meeting, Malé also reaffirmed its commitment to fostering global security, promoting dialogue, and advancing the shared aspiration for a peaceful and prosperous world. This marks Maldives' inaugural participation in the D-ISIS Ministerial, following its formal membership of the Coalition in August 2023. In 2024, the Ministry of Homeland Security and Technology undertook strategic initiatives targeting four challenging areas that needed to be addressed to ensure the country's internal security and safety, including persisting drug issues. On November 24, the President of Maldives, Mohamed Muizzu, stated that it is one of the highest priorities of the government to transform Maldives into a drug-free environment. Muizzu's statement came in a post on 'X', after the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) seized 468.6 kg of illicit drugs from a Sri Lankan vessel that illegally entered into Maldivian waters. Maldives have been dealing with various narcotics-related issues that have plagued the archipelago for many decades, and adequate reform has not been brought about to date. Nevertheless, as reported on December 9, President Muizzu disclosed that his government has stepped up efforts to combat drug trafficking, and six times more drugs were seized in 2024, as compared to 2023. President said the drugs seized so far this year are estimated to have a street value of around USD 84 million. He added that over 150 expatriates linked to drug trafficking have been deported so far this year (2024), which is twice that of 2023, and that the Police had raided over 13,435 establishments in 2024, amid a nationwide crackdown on trafficking, as compared to around 8,500 raids conducted in 2023. Further, as reported on January 9, efforts have been commenced to detect the Maldives' main gateway, Velana International Airport's (VIA's) camera blind spots and increase security to address the smuggling of drugs via air. Efforts are also ongoing to install vessel tracking devices to tackle drug trafficking via sea. The archipelago is also grappling with an increased rate of cybercrime. The number of reported cybercrimes in Maldives nearly doubled in 2024, as compared to 2023, as revealed by Police Commissioner Ali Shujau on December 11, 2024. Shujau emphasised the urgent need to curb the spread of cybercrime and expand cyber security measures across the nation. 'In 2023, the Maldives Police Service recorded 99 cybercrime cases. This year, the figure has risen sharply to 173,' Commissioner Shujau disclosed. In a positive direction, Maldives has enacted legislative amendments to criminalise cybercrime. On December 17, the amendments to the Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Act on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, were ratified by President Muizzu. The amendments to the Penal Code formally recognise cybercrime within the legal framework and categorizes 10 activities as cyber offenses: Unauthorized access to computer systems Accessing unauthorized computer systems with the intention of committing a crime Intercepting unauthorized data on computer systems Interfering with unauthorized computer systems Misuse of computer systems or similar devices Acts of cyber violence Computer-related forgeries Acts of fraud and misrepresentation related to computer systems Infringement of copyright and associated rights People found guilty of such offenses will be subject to upwards of one year in prison. Comprehensive economic reforms are urgently needed in Maldives, to address fiscal and external imbalances, build investor confidence, and reduce debt over the medium-term. On October 10, 2024, a World Bank report titled Maldives Development Update: Seeking Stability in Turbulent Times, underlined heightened external and fiscal vulnerabilities that required the urgent implementation of comprehensive economic reforms. While overall inflation remained low at 0.5 per cent in the first half of 2024, food prices rose by 6.7 per cent in the same period, as compared to the previous year. Foreign exchange reserves are also low, enough to cover only 1.5 months of imports. Dollar reserves fell from USD 590.5 million at the end of 2023 to USD 443.9 million in August 2024. Further, in the month of December 2024, the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) reported that the inflation rate, which was at 0.3 per cent during the second quarter, had risen to 1.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2024. The Central Bank released its Economic Quarterly Bulletin, in which it emphasized that this increase in inflation could mainly be attributed to price changes in the energy sector. President Muizzu of the People's National Congress (PNC) party won the September 2023 presidential elections, with a 54.06 per cent of the vote in the run-off contest, defeating incumbent President Ibrahim Solih. In April 2024, the PNC won a super-majority in the People's Majlis (Parliament), with 66 seats, while its allies won 9 seats, giving Muizzu the support of 75 of the 93 members of the Majlis. It won't be wrong to say that the economic disturbances of the country are the reason for Muizzu's tip-toeing between India and China. With his 'India Out' campaign at the forefront, Muizzu visited Beijing in January, 2023, signing infrastructure and climate deals with China - but he has not burned bridges with New Delhi. He described India as a 'valued partner' and in the aftermath of his Indian visit in October, 2024, India approved a USD 400 million currency swap agreement, to support the cash-strapped Maldivian economy. With a string of domestic issues and economic challenges, Maldives needs to tread cautiously to sustain itself under Mohamed Muizzu's leadership. The archipelago is in dire need of better management of regional players, of economic crises, of the challenge of radicalization, and of the increased narco-threat.

India: Reinforcing Gains In Maharashtra – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On February 11, 2025, the inspector of a special commando unit C-60, Mahesh Kavadu Nagulwar (39), died, succumbing to injuries sustained during an anti-Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) operation in the Bhamragad Tehsil (revenue unit) of Gadchiroli District. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis confirmed the Police inspector's death during an exchange of fire at Bhamragadh, where the Police team was dismantling a Maoist camp. Following the encounter, the Police team conducted a thorough search of the area and recovered significant Maoist materials, including an approximately 100 feet of Cordex wire, 15 Gelatin sticks, four detonators, solar plates, walkie-talkies, and other equipment used in daily operations by the rebels. On February 1, 2025, ex-panchayat samiti (local governing body) chairman Sukhram Madavi was killed by CPI-Maoist cadres at Kiyer village in the Bhamragad Tehsil of Gadchiroli District for allegedly helping Security Forces (SFs) set up permanent posts in the region. The Maoists left a pamphlet near the body stating that Madavi earned the Maoists' ire for assisting the Police in opening posts to facilitate mining operations by private companies. The Maoists were also angered by Madavi's alleged role in helping disenchanted cadres surrender to the Police. However, Superintendent of Police (SP) Neelotpal claimed that the Maoists falsely accused Madavi of being a 'police informer' and of assisting the Police set up new camps, including one at Pengunda. Two persons have thus been killed (one SF Inspector and one civilian) in the two incidents of Left Wing Extremist (LWE)-linked violence in Maharashtra in 2025, thus far (data till February 16). According to partial data collated by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), three civilians were killed through 2024 in Maharashtra. There were five such killings in 2023. Since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE-linked violence across the country, a total of 205 such killings have been documented in the state, including a high of 36 civilian fatalities in 2011. Significantly, SFs did not suffer any loss in Maharashtra through 2024, as well as in 2023. The state recorded no loss in this category through 2022 and 2021. The last SF fatality recorded was on August 14, 2020, when a Police constable was killed and another constable sustained injuries, when a CPI-Maoist 'action team' opened fire on them in a market at the Kothi village under the Bhamragad Tehsil of Gadchiroli District. In remaining part of the year, another two fatalities were recorded in 2020, bringing the count of SF fatalities to three through 2020. The SF category recorded a high of 52 fatalities in 2009. A total of 171 such killings have been recorded since March 6, 2000. Meanwhile, SFs neutralised at least 24 Maoists in 2024, in addition to six in 2023. A maximum of 51 Maoist fatalities was recorded in 2018. A total of 351 such killings have been recorded in the state since March 6, 2000. Significantly, the last SF:Maoist kill ratio recorded was 1:3 in 2020. There were no SF fatalities between 2021 and 2024. Meanwhile, the favourable kill ratio for the SF was 1:25.5, recorded in 2018. Significantly, the overall SF:Maoist kill ratio in the state since 2000 has been 1:2.05, in favour of the SFs. In 2024, SFs arrested nine Naxalites (LWEs), in addition to seven such arrests in 2023, according to the SATP database. Since March 6, 2000, 490 Maoists have been arrested. Mounting SF pressure also resulted in the surrender of 19 Naxalites in 2024, in addition to five in 2023. Since March 6, 2000, total surrenders stand at 333, including 21 such surrenders already recorded in the current year (data till February 16). In the most recent surrender, on February 10, 2025, four wanted CPI-Maoist cadres, collectively carrying a bounty of INR 2.8 million, surrendered before the Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Gadchiroli District. The surrendered Maoists include Ashok Pochya Sadmek aka Balanna aka Chandrashekhar (63), a 'divisional committee member (DVCM)', Vanita Dohe Zore (54), 'area committee member (ACM)', Sadhu Lingu Mohanda aka Shailesh aka Sameer (30) and Munni Podiya Korsa (25), both Platoon Members of Platoon No. 32. Other parameters of LWE-linked violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation in the state. There was no major incident (resulting in three or more fatalities) involving the Maoists in 2024, as well as in 2023. The last major incident was recorded on May 1, 2019, when at least 15 SF personnel of the special commando unit C-60 of the Maharashtra Police, and one civilian driver, were killed in an ambush by CPI-Maoist cadres, who triggered an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosion on the Dadapur Road near Lendali Nullah in Jamburkheda village under Kurkheda Police Station limits in Gadchiroli District. The Maoists failed to carry out any incident of arson in 2024, as against one such incident in 2023. On March 2, 2023, a group of CPI-Maoist cadres set three road construction machines on fire between Pursalgondi and Alenga in the Etapalli Tehsil in Gadchiroli District. Further, the Maoists did not issue any bandh (shut down strike) call in 2024, as against one such call in 2023. On November 23, 2023, the CPI-Maoist called for a 'Gadchiroli bandh' on November 30 in protest against Police action in dispersing anti-mining protesters from Todgatta village in Etapalli Tehsil, Gadchiroli District. The CPI-Maoist 'western sub-zonal bureau' called for the bandh. According to the SATP database, all Maoist-linked fatalities Maharashtra in 2024 were reported from Gadchiroli District alone. Likewise, in 2023, all fatalities were reported from Gadchiroli. Meanwhile, an analysis of underground and over-ground activities of the Maoists in 2024 indicated that, while Gadchiroli remained highly-affected, Gondia and Pune were considered marginally affected. By comparison, in 2023, Gadchiroli remained highly-affected, while Gondia was marginally affected. An analysis of the overall fatalities recorded in Maharashtra since March 6, 2000, indicates that, out of 738 fatalities (205 civilians, 171 SF personnel, 351 Naxalites and 12 Unspecified), at least 722 (196 civilians, 167 SF personnel, 348 Naxalites, and 12 Unspecified) were recorded in Gadchiroli alone, followed by seven (five civilians and two SF personnel) in Gondia, three (one civilian and two SF personnel) in Bhandara, two (one civilian and one LWE) in Nagpur, and one civilian in Aurangabad. The location of three fatalities (one civilian and two Maoists) remains unspecified. Maharashtra has a total of 35 districts. The last fatality outside Gadchiroli was recorded on October 18, 2019, in Gondia District, when CPI-Maoist cadres shot dead a civilian, Bhagchand Dhurve (50), suspecting him of being a 'police informer'. Against the backdrop of the declining impact of the CPI-Maoist, especially in Gadchiroli district, the epicenter of Maoist violence in Maharashtra, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken several steps against LWE elements in Maharashtra. Most recently, on January 2, 2025, NIA chargesheeted four CPI-Maoist cadres for the abduction and brutal killing of a youth in Gadchiroli District. The accused, Doba Wadde, Ravi Pallo, Sattu Mahaka, and Komati Mahaka, were charged with the abduction and murder of Dinesh Pusu Gawade in November 2023. Tha NIA stated, 'They had kidnapped and killed Gawade on suspicion of being a police informer and a member of RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh].' In its chargesheet filed before the NIA Special Court, Mumbai, Maharashtra, in case RC-03/2024/NIA/MUM, the agency stated that the accused were active members of CPI-Maoist and had committed the crime in furtherance of the outfit's conspiracy to spread terror in the minds of the local villagers. The case was initially registered at Dhodraj Police Station by Gadchiroli Police, which arrested the accused and seized a Bharmar gun, along with explosives and other incriminating materials. Meanwhile, according to a November 8, 2024, report, security and intelligence agencies joined forces to increase surveillance on around 180 pro-CPI-Maoist private (front) organisations spread across Maharashtra. These frontal organisations project various socio-political agendas, but their main aim is to ensure that no parties inimical to the Maoist cause come to power in Maharashtra. The end goal is to prevent the formulation and implementation of plans to eradicate Maoism from the region. The frontal organisations are reportedly active in many Maharashtra cities, including Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Nanded, Yavatmal, Akola, Buldhana, Chandrapur, Wardha, Bhandara, and Gondia. Moreover, Union Home Minister (UHM) Amit Shah has urged Maoist-affected states such as Maharashtra to set a deadline for the complete elimination of Maoism. The Maharashtra government, which is planning a law against front organisations of the banned CPI-Maoist, titled the Maharashtra Security Act, has reportedly set a deadline of April-December 2025. The Maoists are failing in their appeals to secure the support of the local masses. On June 14, 2024, seven tribal hamlets of Bhamragadh Tehsil in the foothills of Abujhmadh, which houses the People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) headquarters on the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, banned the CPI-Maoist from entering their hamlets under the government's 'gaonbandi' scheme of rewarding villages for not giving support or providing assistance to Naxalites. The tribal hamlets of Paraynar, Nelgunda, Kucher, Kawande, Gongewada, Midadapalli, and Mahakapadi are escaping Maoist influence after four decades of forced indoctrination in the ultra-Left ideology. On June 14, 2024, they took a historic vow during a 'krishi melava' or agricultural congregation at the Dhodraj Police outpost, to shun the Maoists and extend support to SFs, in lieu of government benefits which form the bulwark of the 'gaonbandi' scheme. They promised to shut out Maoists, boycott their meetings, and ban their entry into villages, which are often used as launchpads for guerrilla operations, as well as to propagate LWE ideology, or organise political and military training camps. To bolster security against the rebels and curb their activities, a new Police Station was inaugurated on January 30, 2025, at Nelgunda in the Bhamragad sub-division of Gadchiroli District, to strengthen security and promote overall development in the remote and inaccessible parts of the district, which has long been affected by Maoist activity. On January 1, 2025, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis inaugurated the 32-km-long Gatta-Gardewada-Wangeturi Road and bus services of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation on the Wangeturi-Gardewada-Gatta-Aheri route in the Gadchiroli district. The road link will connect Maharashtra directly to Chhattisgarh. On December 11, 2024, a new Police Assistance Centre was opened at village Pengunda under Bhamragad Sub-Division, with the objective of providing security and overall development to the citizens of the extremely remote Pengunda and surrounding villages, to bring them into the mainstream of development. Meanwhile, according to a January 3, 2025, report, Chief Minister Fadnavis reintroduced the Maharashtra Special Public Security Bill, 2024, during the winter session of the State Assembly, asserting that the proposed law does not attempt to suppress genuine dissenting voices, but to close down the dens of 'urban Naxals' instead. The Bill has been sent to a Joint Committee and will be brought up again during the monsoon session later this year. Despite important security and developmental components, Maharashtra continues to suffer critical gaps of strength and quality in the State Police Force meant to fight against any kind of internal challenge. According to the latest Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) data, as on January 1, 2023, the sanctioned strength for the States' Police was 232,965, but only 172,382 personnel were in position, yielding a vacancy of 60,583 (26 percent). Police personnel per 100,000 population in Maharashtra currently stand at a sanctioned 184.92, while those actually available are 136.83. Further, the Police/Area Ratio (number of policemen per 100 square kilometers) for Maharashtra is just 56.02, as against the national average of 65.14. Both the State and national averages on the Police/Area ratio are well below their sanctioned strength, at 75.71 and 82.82, respectively. Further, of a sanctioned strength of 317 apex Indian Police Service (IPS) Officers in the State, 41 posts, i.e., 12.93 per cent, remained vacant, substantially weakening executive command of the Force. At least two out of 1,191 Police Stations had no telephones. The Maharashtra Police has been able to ensure a relatively safe environment on the ground, and has substantially contained the Maoist challenge. This is an opportunity for SFs to further consolidate their gains and eradicate Naxalism from the state.

People Survive On Less Than $1.9 A Day In A District Of Atyrau Pr...	According to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 2024, developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Human Development and Poverty Initiative, 1.1 billion people live in acute poverty worldwide, meaning they dispose of less than $1.90 per day as living expenses, with 40 percent living in countries experiencing war, fragility, and/or low peacefulness. The Zhyloi district, with its center in Kulsary, an oil workers' town in the Atyrau province of Kazakhstan, is not experiencing war, fragility, and/or low peacefulness, yet there, as it turns out, are people there, too, who live in such poverty that they dispose of far less than $1.90 a day per person as living expenses while being at the heart of the Kazakh State's gas and oil producing industry, that provides the very basis of economic and social well-being of the republic's 20 million-strong population considered an upper-middle-income nation. The paradox of that situation doesn't end there. What's more, the Zhyloi district definitely is the richest district in the country. As of October 1, 2022, the population of the district was 86,118 people, and the town of Kulsary accounted for more than 70 percent of them (65,964 people in 2023). That is, the Zhyloi district is, first of all, the oil workers' town of Kulsary. Being just a part of the Atyrau province, it is potentially richer than any province of Kazakhstan, except maybe the Atyrau province itself. It is potentially richer than many individual post-Soviet States, as this is the largest oil-producing district in Kazakhstan, with over 40 oil fields with total reserves of 2.5 billion tons. But this all has seemingly been of little use to Kulsary, where more than two-thirds of its population is concentrated. On February 10, 2025, residents of the town of Kulsary took to the streets, asking for employment opportunities. They said unemployment had reached a critical level, with many able-bodied citizens left without income and forced to live on [state] benefits that would end in six months. 'What should we do next? Here is what we ask: the local companies should provide people with work on a 14/14 system (shift work). Now, we are being laid off. And we have come here to be heard. This is not a rally or a provocation. We just want to show how many people have been left without work', - said the protesters. Among the participants of the action was Zhanargul Sagynbai, a district activist, who noted that there had been about 100 people gathered for the rally, although there are actually more of them [unemployed ones in Kulsary]. She referred to a situation in one family where four able-bodied members are forced to live on the income of the daughter-in-law, who earns only three thousand tenge [around US$6] a day from trade. If this sum is divided by the number of able-bodied family members, each would get US$1,5. Surely, there are also children in that family. So, one can just imagine living like that. It would seem that such a protest action was due to be an event of general importance in the country as its social and economic well-being is, among other things, built on the Zhyloi district's oil and gas industry. However, it remained largely unnoticed in the Kazakh mainstream media. The central authorities of the country, as far as is known, paid no attention to it. In this sense, official Astana seems to be putting their trust merely in the State and pro-government Kazakh media and bloggers. The latter ones, as far as can be judged, largely follow the classic models of Soviet propaganda before the perestroika period. That is, they mainly display the achievements of the country and speak negatively about those who criticize the ruling regime and its policies, and sometimes, about, say, striking oil workers in Western Kazakhstan, asking for employment opportunities, or demanding higher salaries and better working conditions. Here’s how Miras Nurmukhanbetov, а Kazakh journalist, described one such case a while ago: 'In short, those ‘opinion leaders’ focus on several aspects. These are ‘dependency attitude’ [i.e. ‘parasitic attitude’, ‘parasitic way of life’, or ‘parasitism’], ‘repatriates’, ‘already high salaries’ and so on, with a direct or indirect conclusion that ‘it is beneficial for someone to rock the boat’… But it is obvious that those opinion leaders to a greater extent promote the latent position of official bodies and the no less official KazMunayGas [national oil and gas company]. The authorities, for obvious reasons, cannot voice it, so as not to worsen their already shaky image. However, they believe that they were able to form a negative opinion about the strikes among at least part of society. By and large, the formula ‘divide and conquer’ is again set in motion, dividing Kazakhs into ‘ours’, who are supposedly objective and earn their bread (with caviar), and into ‘troublemakers’ who strive to stand out from others. Here, it must be emphasized that part of the audience of those public opinion leaders needs this to calm down and find excuses for themselves because almost all of them have nothing to do with Mangystau province and the oil-producing West [Western Kazakhstan] as a whole. This has always been the case, and it has been repeated after almost any socio-political excesses. But in this case, we are witnessing a real escalation of the situation, when such bloggers, as conductors of the authorities’ opinions, ‘appoint’ those to blame instead of looking for ways for dialogue'. Kazakhstan’s revenues from Western Kazakhstan’s oil and gas fields feed the national budget and are being used for supporting the subsidy-dependent provinces, which are composed of the country’s all other regions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Southern Kazakhstan. At the same time, people in the oil-producing region are increasingly getting bogged down by social, economic, and environmental problems, exacerbated by persistent drought and water scarcity. Not without reason are the richest provinces of the Republic of Kazakhstan, with an average per capita GDP comparable to that of some EU Member States, have now been called by Russian experts ‘the destitute West’ of Kazakhstan. It should seem astonishing for West Kazakhs to be called by Russian experts ‘destitute’, and ‘Barbarians’ by Chimkent Kazakhs in conditions when, say, in 2008, per capita income in the Atyrau province of Western Kazakhstan was almost 15 times higher ($23.6 thousand) than in the South Kazakhstan province ($1.8 thousand), which then included Chimkent. It is clear that people there (in Western Kazakhstan) mostly can’t be happy with such a state of things. That seems to be the reason there are often demonstrations and strikes over there. The situation in Kulsary described above is pretty strange on its own. It seems to be even weirder when you take in that here, we speak of a district on the territory of which over one-third of the budget revenues of the Kazakh state were generated in, say, 2018. And that is no exaggeration. Over a third or more than 35% of the Kazakh republican budget revenues planned for 2018 (without transfers) for 5 trillion 528.4 billion tenge fell to share of the Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) alone. It’s easy to verify if one wants to. The TCO operates a license that includes the unique, supergiant Tengiz field and the adjacent, smaller but still significant, Korolevskoye field. Both fields are in the Zhyloy district territory, the center of which is Kulsary, a town that, less than a year ago, has been badly hit by the devastating water floods. In 2023, the TCO produced 28.9 million metric tons of oil. That is more than the peak figures of Kazakhstan as a whole in the Soviet years and just a little less than what Azerbaijan produced in 2023: 30.2 million metric tons of crude and gas condensate. However, even with all this, some people have to struggle to survive on less than $1,9 a day in the Zhyloi district of the Atyrau province, which is richer than the whole rest of Kazakhstan. This is the way things are.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adD9fCSZuBI_-	2025-02-17T15:37:20-08:00	
Trump’s Ukraine Envoy ‘Clarifies’ What Europe’s Seat At The Table...	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- European views will be taken into account and Ukraine will not be pressured into a deal, the US envoy for Ukraine and Russia told a group of reporters at NATO HQ. Keith Kellogg's two-day visit to Brussels comes amid growing unease among European allies that a future Ukraine peace deal would be struck over their and Kyiv's heads, as neither of them is expected to participate in the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, tomorrow. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said over the weekend that Kyiv would not agree to a deal that would be detrimental to his country or that resulted from negotiations in which he didn't participate. Kellogg said 'nobody' would impose decisions on Zelenskyy as the 'elected leader of a sovereign nation' and the decision about striking a deal would ultimately be the Ukrainians'. Trump’s Ukraine envoy is expected to travel to Kyiv tomorrow night for a three-day visit, where he is scheduled to meet with the Ukrainian leader. He will then return to Washington and continue a tour of NATO capitals in the next few weeks. At the table Asked by Euractiv about his comments made on stage in Munich that 'Europeans would not be at the table,' Kellogg clarified that this would not mean European concerns would not be taken into account. 'If you believe there are going to be thirty-three people sitting at the same table – exactly the same table – during the discussion, in all probability, the answer is no, not at all,' Kellogg said. 'If 'at the table' means that your views are heard, understood, transmitted, the answer is absolutely,' he said. Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals earlier last week to determine what resources they would be ready to contribute to a possible future peacekeeping force. 'Before any type of discussion and security guarantees is finalised, of course, those discussions are going to take place,' Kellogg said. 'Answers to those questions will be determined as you come up with the final process,' he added, throwing the ball back to the Europeans' court. Status concerns Kellogg's absence from the US negotiating team travelling to Riyadh raised questions over his leverage on Trump's efforts to draw up a peace proposal – and how European input will find its way into them. Responding to concerns about his status in the process, Kellogg said, 'That doesn't mean that the team is not fully synced.' 'They are going to come out of the Middle East, I will come out of Ukraine – we will go back to being synched up,' he said, adding he had a joint conference call with the negotiating team over the phone after Munich. The team includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adJ71pDTO5Ouj	2025-02-17T15:34:11-08:00	
China Warns Philippines Of ‘Red Line’ In The South China Sea	Maritime tensions between China and the Philippines were in the spotlight at the Munich Security Conference, with former Chinese vice foreign minister Fu Ying calling the occupation of disputed features in the South China Sea 'a red line.' Speaking at a forum at the annual international security conference at the weekend, Fu said that China had a very strong position on ownership over territories and 'we cannot lose them.' The former vice minister said China would not agree to the Philippines occupying the Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal, where Chinese and Philippine ships have been confronting each other over the past two years. Both are within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. Fu, who served as Chinese ambassador to the Philippines from 1998 to 2000, spoke of how Manila deliberately ran aground an old naval ship on the Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 to use as an outpost. It attempted to do the same at Scarborough Shoal, which is classified as a rock under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS. 'If the Philippines can take new rocks how can you stop others?' Fu asked. 'How can you stop China from taking more?' 'We’re capable, there’s no problem, but we are exercising constraint,' the former diplomat said, adding that China was committed to the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea that urges claimants to handle their differences in a constructive manner. 'That’s a red line no one should be allowed to cross … that kind of naughtiness shouldn’t be encouraged,' she said. China’s domestic law at sea Philippines foreign secretary Enrique Manalo, meanwhile, said his country was 'following international law.' 'But when another country … applies its own domestic laws to certain areas within our exclusive economic zone then it really does create the kind of tension that we have been experiencing especially over the last two years,' Manalo said. All the disputed features mentioned by Fu are miles away from the Chinese coast, Manolo pointed out. The foreign secretary added that Manila had received support from like-minded nations. 'I haven’t heard of any country really coming out against what we’ve been doing except for one,' he said, referring to China. Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven developed countries, or G7, who also met at the Munich Security Conference, 'reiterated their commitment to a free, open and secure Indo-Pacific region, grounded in respect for the rule of law and sovereignty,' they said in a joint statement. 'They strongly opposed China’s attempts to restrict freedom of navigation through militarization and coercive activities in the South China Sea.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met separately with his Philippine counterpart, Enrique Manolo, and 'not only reaffirmed U.S. commitment to the United States-Philippines Alliance, but noted his enthusiasm for building an even more invested and enduring relationship,' the U.S. State Department said. US-China strategic competition For her part, Fu said, 'what concerns China now is the shadow of the U.S. behind the claimants.' Singapore’s defense minister, Ng Eng Hen, said that China’s stance on the South China Sea was that countries outside the region should not get involved. But the question 'when China is strong enough what would it do?' is what strikes fear in countries in the region, Ng said, 'It’s up to China to assure its neighbors,' he said. The Singaporean minister noted that China wanted to show deterrence by strength as the U.S. does and the strategic competition between the U.S. and China 'is still in play' in the South China Sea. Speaking of the U.S.-China rivalry, Chinese top diplomat Wang Yi, after delivering a keynote speech at the Munich gathering, said that the two countries 'must not come into conflict, otherwise, the world will suffer.' 'China is full of confidence in the future of China-U.S. relations, but if the United States insists on suppressing China, China will have no choice but to fight to the end,' Wang said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adLbxGkpaS-gs	2025-02-17T15:32:14-08:00	
Ukraine Won’t ‘Recognize’ US-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia, Zelens...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukraine will not participate in the upcoming talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters in Abu Dhabi, where he was visiting as part of a Middle East tour, which also includes Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Zelenskyy on February 17 said Ukraine was unaware of the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia and considers any negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine to serve no purpose. 'We cannot recognize any agreements about us without us,' Zelenskyy told reporters in the capital of the United Arab Emirates. 'And we will not recognize such agreements,' added Zelenskyy, who traveled on to Turkeyafter his U.A.E. stop. Meanwhile, the U.S. presidential envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, told reporters that no one will force a peace deal on Zelenskyy, and that he and the people of Ukraine would make that call. 'Nobody will impose [a peace agreement] on an elected leader of a sovereign nation,' Kellogg said. He earlier caused a stir when he said Europe may not be 'at the table' if the United States brokers negotiations to end Russia's war against Ukraine. He later clarified to say that even if Europe were not 'at the table,' its views would be taken into account. Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed those remarks, saying Ukraine and other European nations would be included in any meaningful negotiation sessions, if and when they take place. 'Ultimately, it will reach a point -- if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet -- but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved because they're the ones that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they have sanctions on [President Vladimir] Putin and Russia as well,' Rubio said. 'We're just not there yet.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy aide, Yury Ushakov, arrived in Riyadh late on February 17, set to take part in bilateral talks with their U.S. counterparts in Saudi Arabia on February 18. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the meeting will focus on restoring relations between Moscow and Washington, while Ushakov told Russian state TV that the delegation would be approaching the talks with a 'businesslike' attitude. Upon arrival, Ushakov said that 'the main thing is to achieve a real normalization of relations between us and Washington.' The United States will be represented by Rubio, who is already in Riyadh, national security-adviser Mike Waltz, and special envoy Steve Witkoff, the State Department confirmed. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow with his Serbian counterpart ahead of the Saudi talks, Lavrov claimed that Europe had already had several chances to be involved in a settlement on Ukraine but that he didn't know how European politicians could contribute given that they want the war to continue. While there are different views on Ukraine among European politicians, most agree that they want 'a just and lasting peace' to be settled with Ukraine at the table. U.S. President Donald Trump on February 16 insisted that Zelenskyy 'will be involved' in any peace negotiations to end the Russian war, while he also stated that he could meet 'very soon' with Putin. Trump did not specify details. Bloomberg, citing unnamed officials, reported on February 16 that Trump wants to secure a cease-fire by Easter, which falls on April 20 this year both for Western and Orthodox churches. Trump told reporters his team has had 'long and hard' talks with Russian officials and that Witkoff had spoken with Putin for three hours recently. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine on February 20, Zelenskyy said at a virtual press conference with Ukrainian reporters. 'I want him to visit the front line with me [...] We will meet [Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr] Syrskiy and maybe some brigade commanders,' Zelenskyy said. Kyiv said Zelenskyy's visit to the region was aimed at boosting economic ties and that there were no plans to meet with U.S. or Russian officials. Zelenskyy late on February 17 said he had arrived in Turkey for talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkish presidential spokesman Fahrettin Altun said Zelenskyy will meet with Erdogan on February 18 to discuss 'regional and global' issues. Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Saudi Arabia on February 19, although specific details were not disclosed. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelenskyy, said that 'there are no negotiators who will represent Ukraine in Saudi Arabia' in peace talks. 'Today, there is nothing on the negotiating table that could be discussed. Russia is not ready for negotiations,' he told Ukrainian TV. Zelenskyy has said he would not engage in negotiations before meeting with allies, including European leaders, to develop a strategy. 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine, never,' Zelenskyy told NBC's Kristen Welker on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. He said there cannot be a legitimate peace plan in the works because 'they can't have it without us.... Maybe there are some ideas.' In the same interview, Zelenskyy told Welker that Ukraine had suffered '46,000 killed soldiers' and approximately '380,000 wounded' since February 2022 in the war. Russia hasn't disclosed losses, but Western sources have put the death and wounded toll at more than 600,000, not including losses suffered by North Korean soldiers involved in the fighting. Meanwhile, some 4,600 kilometers away, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted European leaders on February 17 in an emergency summit on the Ukraine war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adGSGgqUU2Ifs	2025-02-17T15:30:19-08:00	
Criminal Complaint Filed Against Ex-President Duterte For ‘Threat...	By Jason Gutierrez The Philippine National Police (PNP) filed a criminal complaint against former president Rodrigo Duterte over his alleged threat to kill incumbent senators, some of whom were campaigning under the ticket of his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Duterte made the remark on Thursday when he introduced senators he was campaigning for in the May midterm polls. Brig. Gen. Nicolas Torre III, chief of the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, said the former president allegedly violated laws against incitement to sedition and unlawful utterances. 'I am filing this as a citizen. And you know, I’m a policeman. It’s part of the PNP to make sure that we protect the citizenry from criminal activities like this,' Torres told reporters on Monday, noting that Duterte has many 'blind supporters' who could actually take him seriously. He filed the complaint before the justice department and asked prosecutors to study it. 'You know, this is beyond politics. Don't think that this is politics and that I’m doing this to favor politics. We don’t have politics there. What is stated in the statement is a clear enumeration of violations of laws written in our laws. It cannot be ignored just like that,' Torre said. On Thursday, the former president told supporters about using a bomb to kill 15 senators to create vacancies for the senatorial bets he is supporting. 'Now, there’s many of them,' Duterte said on Thursday, referring to the incumbent senators. 'What should we do? Let’s kill the senators now to create vacancies.' 'If we can kill around 15 senators, we can all go in,' the ex-president sent, referring to the senatorial bets he was campaigning for. He said that the 'only way to do it is to use a bomb.' Five incumbent senators, including President Marcos’ sister, Imee, were running for reelection under the administration ticket. Duterte’s lawyer, Salvador Panelo, said he was confident the case would be dismissed because the former president’s remarks should not be taken seriously. He said the senators would find the joke 'just as amusing and (a) laughable remark.' But Torre said Duterte’s jokes 'are no longer acceptable.' 'He wants to kill the 15 senators he wants to bomb (them),' Torre said. The police are urging 'the public to respect the legal process and avoid speculation that may mislead or create unnecessary division,' Torre said. President Marcos touched on Duterte’s remarks during Saturday’s rally for his administration-backed senatorial candidates in the southern Davao del Norte province. 'We just heard the other day, maybe they felt they stand no chance, that they will just kill 15 senators,' he said. 'That’s the problem when people think that the only solution is for them to kill their fellow Filipinos.' While Duterte’s officials often say the former leader’s utterances were never serious, thousands of suspected addicts and dealers had been killed during his six years in power from 2016-2022. Analysts said the Duterte family was using the political race to shore up support for the ex-president’s daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, who may face an impeachment trial in the Senate in July for an alleged threat to assassinate Marcos Jr., his wife and the House Speaker. The Dutertes support the reelection bids of incumbent Sens. Ronald dela Rosa, who served as a police chief under the Duterte administration, and Christopher Go, the former aide of President Duterte. They are joined by Duterte’s spiritual adviser Apollo Quiboloy and outgoing Congressman Rodante Marcoleta, a staunch supporter of the Duterte family. Dela Rosa was the chief enforcer of Duterte’s controversial drug war while Quiboloy commanded the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC), a religious group that had grown in prominence and influence during Duterte’s presidency. He is campaigning from jail, where he is fighting sex trafficking charges, including minors. If they win in the May midterm elections, they are expected to protect Sara Duterte amid the impeachment process, analysts said. Earlier this month, Sara Duterte – the running mate of Marcos in the 2022 national elections – was impeached by the House of Representatives, who had accused her of violating the constitution, graft and corruption, plotting to assassinate Marcos as well as other high crimes. In response, the vice president said she won’t resign from her post as vice president and denied making an assassination threat against her former political ally. The Marcos and Duterte families are two of the country’s leading political families. They entered into an alliance to defeat the opposition in 2022, with Sara Duterte agreeing to run as a Marcos’ deputy. In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately, part of a system of checks and balances built into the constitution. The alliance subsequently soured amid mounting pressure for Marcos to allow international prosecutors to investigate the former president on his drug war. The president initially said he would block International Criminal Court (ICC) investigators from entering the country to investigate, but later said they could carry out their own investigation here as well.

European Leaders Discuss Being Left Out From US-Russian Talks On ...	French President Emmanuel Macron hosted European leaders Monday for talks focused on the U.S. push to start Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, seemingly set to proceed without the involvement of European officials. The leaders of Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, along with NATO chief Mark Rutte, European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen began arriving in Paris for the hastily called meeting. The discussions came in the aftermath of last week’s phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the two leaders agreed to start immediate talks to end Russia’s three-year war on its neighbor, but at least initially without the involvement of Ukrainian or European leaders. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Saudi Arabia where he is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Russian officials for discussions about the war. Rubio is being joined in the talks by two other key U.S. officials, Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce described the Riyadh discussions as 'a follow-up' to the Trump-Putin call but said, 'I don't think people should view this as something that is about details or moving forward in some kind of a negotiation.' It does not appear that any Ukrainian officials will join the talks, even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he will not accept a U.S.-Russian dictate on Ukraine’s future and that Ukraine must be involved in any settlement of the conflict. Russia now holds about 20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that Moscow unilaterally annexed in 2014 and much of eastern Ukraine. After arriving in Paris, von der Leyen said on X, 'Europe’s security is at a turning point. Yes, it is about Ukraine — but it is also about us. We need an urgency mind-set. We need a surge in defense. And we need both of them now.' European officials have expressed fear that Trump might pull U.S. troops out of Europe or negotiate an end to the Russian war on Ukraine on terms more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. and European allies uniformly supported Ukraine and supplied them with billions of dollars’ worth of weaponry. Additionally, European officials were shocked last week by U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s speech in Munich in which he assailed Europe for excluding far-right groups from power and what it might portend for future U.S.-European relations. Meanwhile, Trump last year at a political debate declined to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war. More lately he has suggested that Ukraine hand over some of its rare earth minerals needed for U.S. technology manufacturing as compensation for the military aid Washington has supplied it. European leaders have in recent days pledged continued support for Ukraine, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying his government was ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force. 'I do not say that lightly,' he wrote Sunday in the Daily Telegraph. 'I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way.' Starmer said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter Putin from further aggression. Sweden’s Prime Minister Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Monday his country would not rule out contributing troops to a peacekeeping force that has a 'clear mandate.' The European Council’s Costa said last week’s Munich Security Conference showed the clear message that the security of Ukraine and the European Union 'cannot be separated.' 'There will be no credible and successful negotiations, no lasting peace, without Ukraine and without the European Union.' Costa said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday the Russian delegation at the Riyadh talks with the U.S. would include Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy adviser to Putin. Even though the Riyadh talks are the first effort at ending the war since shortly after it began in 2022, Rubio told CBS’s 'Face the Nation' in an interview that aired Sunday, 'A process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing.' 'We'll see in the coming days and weeks if Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, in a way that is sustainable and fair,' Rubio said. Whatever occurs this week in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said that once 'real negotiations' begin, then Ukraine 'will have to be involved.' In an interview with NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that aired Sunday, Zelenskyy said, 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. The war in Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses.' Zelenskyy said he told Trump in a call they had last week that Putin is only pretending to want peace. 'I said that he is a liar. And [Trump] said, ‘I think my feeling is that he's ready for these negotiations.’ And I said to him, ‘No, he's a liar. He doesn't want any peace.’' Zelenskyy said that without continued U.S. military support, 'Probably it will be very, very, very difficult' to defeat Russia. 'And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance — low chance to survive without support of the United States.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adMxiu-GT8KMd	2025-02-17T15:25:58-08:00	
India’s Christians Splinter As Persecution Rises – OpEd	By John Singarayar (UCA News) -- The often-quoted phrase, 'Who will tie the cat?' aptly encapsulates the crisis of ecumenism in India today. Amid an increasing anti-Christian atmosphere under the shadow of Hindu majoritarianism, the body of Christ in India bleeds, not only from external wounds but also from self-inflicted fractures. Indian Christians, though a minority of 2.3 percent in a population of 1.4 billion, represent a mosaic of traditions: the ancient St. Thomas Christians claiming Apostolic history, Roman Catholicism shaped by Portuguese mission, Protestant denominations introduced by Western missionaries, and the 20th-century Pentecostal movements. The question is no more about Christian diversity or unity nor the threat to their survival amid Hindu majoritarianism. The vital question is about their moral accountability: If the Church is the embodiment of Christ, how does its fragmentation compound His suffering in a time of crisis? We need to critically examine the historical, theological, and socio-political dimensions of ecumenical failure in India, arguing that without confronting internal divisions, the Christian community risks further marginalization. Christianity’s arrival in India is traditionally dated to the St. Thomas mission in 52 AD. The ancient Syrian Christians, based in present-day Kerala, integrated into local caste structures and maintained distinct liturgical practices until Portuguese missionaries imposed the Latin rite system on them in the 16th century, sparking rebellion. More than five decades of rebellion resulted in the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653, pledging to reject Western missionaries and splitting the Church. Those joined to oppose the Portuguese further divided, now forming at least seven Kerala-based churches claiming St. Thomas tradition. The Catholic-Protestant theological mudslinging, their competition for converts among lower castes and tribal people, further fractured the Christian landscape. The Evangelical, Baptist, and Pentecostal movements arrived in the early 20th century, often funded by foreign agencies. Their proselytizing efforts among already Christian communities led to accusations of 'sheep-stealing.' These historical fissures, compounded by sociological identities such as caste, language, and ethnicities within churches, laid the groundwork for an often delayed and almost always divided response, or none at all, to issues Christians face. Since the rise of a common Hindu identity during pre-independence India, Hindu groups have been demanding laws against conversion saying Christian conversion destabilizes Indian society as it undermines the Hindu caste system. The Hindu-leaning Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), coming to political prominence and power with a thumping majority in 2014, has intensified anti-Christian rhetoric, framing conversions as a threat to national identity. The Hindu groups supporting the BJP took the election victory as a mandate to push their ideology of establishing a Hindu nation. Attacks range from mob violence — burning churches, assaulting worshippers — to bureaucratic harassment via anti-conversion laws in 12 states. These laws, requiring state approval for religious conversion, are weaponized to criminalize humanitarian work and communal worship. For instance, in Chhattisgarh, Pentecostal pastors face arbitrary arrests under false 'forced conversion' charges. The Uttarakhand High Court’s 2024 ruling mandating state scrutiny of religious practices further erodes constitutional freedoms. Persecution is also societal: tribal Christians or Dalit converts in Odisha face economic boycotts and social ostracization. Yet, the Christian response remains fragmented, reflecting theological and strategic divides. India’s ecumenical movement, embodied in the National Council of Churches in India (NCCI) and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI), has struggled to bridge denominational gaps. While the CBCI, representing 20 million Catholics, emphasizes dialogue with the government, mainstream Protestant bodies like the Church of North India (CNI) advocate legal resistance. Pentecostals, often independent, prioritize evangelism over institutional alliances, viewing persecution as spiritual warfare. This dissonance was obvious during the 2008 Kandhamal riots, where over 100 people were killed, mostly Christians. While Catholic institutions provided refuge, evangelical groups criticized the CBCI for 'compromising' with authorities. Similarly, during the 2023 Manipur violence, where Kuki tribals (mostly Christians) were targeted, denominational NGOs competed for relief funds, diluting advocacy. Theological differences and caste divisions continue to bleed the Body of Christ with a thousand cuts. External perceptions further complicate unity. Hindu nationalists paint Christianity as a 'foreign' faith despite its ancient Indian roots. In response, groups like the Syro-Malabar Church emphasize their swadeshi (indigenous) identity, distancing themselves from newer denominations. The 2008 Kandhamal anti-Christian riots exemplify ecumenical failure. After Hindu mobs targeted Christians, destroying 300 churches and 6,000 homes, the CBCI worked for rehabilitation. But evangelical bodies like the Global Council of Indian Christians (GCIC) publicized atrocities internationally, angering the federal government. Ecumenical bodies themselves are plagued by bureaucratic inertia and hierarchical rigidity. The NCCI, comprising 30 Protestant and Orthodox churches, struggles with denominational rivalries. The CBCI, though more centralized, prioritizes Catholic interests, often side-lining interfaith initiatives. Women and laypeople remain under-represented in leadership, stifling grassroots perspectives. The cost of fragmentation is stark. Politically divided, the tiny Christian community spread all across India cannot form a voting bloc. Socially, the absence of a unified narrative allows Hindu nationalists to stereotype Christians as either violent converts or foreign agents. Vulnerable groups, like Dalits and tribals, suffer disproportionately from their dual marginalization by caste and faith. The Body of Christ, segregated by caste, bleeds in silence. Internationally, India’s Christians fail to leverage global networks effectively, as seen in the muted response to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) downgrading India to the lowest tier in 2024. Yet, even in the valley of dry bones, hope flickers. The 2021 formation of the United Christian Forum (UCF) for human rights monitoring marks a tentative step toward collaboration. In Jharkhand, ecumenical coalitions successfully challenged anti-conversion laws in court. Theologians like Father Felix Wilfred urge re-imagining ecumenism beyond institutional mergers, focusing on shared ethical imperatives: defending democracy, aiding the poor, and promoting interfaith harmony. Grassroots movements, such as ecumenical prayer vigils during attacks, model solidarity. Digital activism, exemplified by the #NotSilent campaign during the Manipur violence, bridges denominational gaps among youth. Even the CBCI’s 2023 synod acknowledged caste as a 'sin against communion.' As Jesus Christ bleeds in the persecuted, the Indian Church faces a reckoning. Ecumenism cannot remain a polite dialogue among bishops; it must become a radical solidarity that dismantles caste, shares power and embraces vulnerability. The Hindu nation project of the BJP parental organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or national volunteers’ corps) thrives on Christian division; every denominational rivalry, every caste hierarchy, becomes a weapon against the Cross. To 'tie the cat,' the Church must confront its complicity in oppression — spiritual, casteist, and colonial. This demands more than joint statements; it requires a costly kenosis, a self-emptying model by Christ, who bled not for a faction but for all. The choice is clear: unity or irrelevance. In the shadow of the gallows, the Body of Christ must decide whether to heal — or to let the bleeding continue. In a nation where majoritarianism seeks to erase pluralism, Christians’ survival may hinge on their ability to rekindle the ecumenical spirit — not as a lofty ideal but as a pragmatic necessity.

Arabs Know Their History And Won’t Let It Be Repeated – OpEd	Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, said in a 2020 interview that he had 'read 25 books' on the Middle East. Such intellectual bravado would not matter if it were not for the fact that Kushner served as the president’s Middle East adviser during his first term and was essentially the main architect of Trump’s policies in the region. Trump’s successor did not fare any better, as the Biden administration largely adhered to Trump’s major mistakes and ultimately sustained the Israeli genocide, which killed — as per the latest estimates — more than 55,000. Joe Biden, too, proved to be a reader; although, unlike Kushner, he did not publicly brag about his intellectual prowess. On Nov. 29, a photo emerged of him holding a book by Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi entitled 'The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917-2017.' Though American leaders and officials claim to base their decisions on a thorough understanding of the complexity of the Middle East, they are repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Trump has repeatedly insisted that the US will take ownership of Gaza, displace its population and turn their destroyed homeland into a real estate opportunity, while threatening them with 'hell' should they not follow his diktats. Trump is using such language based on the misguided idea that these threats will allow him to restore the political leverage that Washington lost over the course of its 15 months of blind support for the Israeli genocide in Gaza. No rational thinker, in the Middle East or beyond, would actually imagine a scenario in which Palestinians leave en masse due to Trump’s threats. They refused to do so after more than 85,000 tonnes of mostly US-supplied explosives were dropped on Gaza, destroying nearly all of the Strip. Empty threats will certainly not change that. Even though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his extremist government have taken advantage of Trump’s words to repair, however temporarily, their struggling coalition, turning Trump’s supposed new doctrine on Gaza into a reality is impossible. Israel has, in fact, tried to create the circumstances that will lead, in the words of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, to the 'voluntary emigration' of Palestinians out of Gaza. Instead, on Jan. 27, nearly 1 million displaced Palestinians who had been driven to southern Gaza began their awe-inspiring march back to the north. It behooves the US administration to stop discounting history, as any wrong move or policy could lead to disastrous outcomes. Historically, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians has been the main objective of all Israeli policies, even before the establishment of the Israeli state on the ruins of historic Palestine in 1948. Aside from the immorality of that act, the pain of which continues to be felt by generations of Palestinian refugees, the event was catastrophic to the Middle East region as well. Aside from millions of refugees displaced in Palestine itself, millions more live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, other parts of the Middle East and around the world. Currently, there are nearly 6 million registered Palestinian refugees, according to UNRWA, though a large number remain unaccounted for. That political earthquake of 77 years ago remains one of the most decisive events that shaped, and continues to shape, the Middle East to this day. Its reversal will remain elusive unless justice finally prevails in Palestine — justice that is dictated by international and humanitarian laws, not impulsive statements from American officials. Jordan, Lebanon and Syria were the Arab countries that hosted most Palestinian refugees and whose political dynamics, as well as conflicts, were shaped by the mass displacement of Palestinians. Palestinian groups became part of the political fabric of these societies, sometimes becoming involved in internal struggles and sometimes being used to balance out existing demographic conflicts. Hardly a major event in the Middle East did not involve Palestinians, or the price of which was not disproportionately shouldered by them. Anyone who knows the fundamentals of modern Middle Eastern politics ought to know this. One can only imagine what would happen if 2.2 million more Palestinian refugees were pushed into Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries, as per Trump’s proposal. It would arguably be the most earth-shattering event in the region since the Nakba. No Arab government can possibly entertain such a scenario under any circumstances. While the prospects of another Gaza Nakba were born dead, the real worry is the fact that nearly 50,000 Palestinians have already been internally displaced in the West Bank. This ongoing ethnic cleansing is no less dangerous than the US-Israeli designs in Gaza. The uninformed US policy on Palestine, which continues to be led by the extremely dangerous policies of the politically bankrupt government of Netanyahu, is once again unifying the Arabs around a common cause. The Arabs know their history very well. It is time for them to prove to Israel that the lessons of history have been learned and will never be repeated.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfnIzOTsw9adG02XAMeMq0t	2025-02-17T15:20:34-08:00	
Assessing Trump’s Aggressive Deportation Goals: How Many Migrants...	One of the main themes of Donald Trump’s electoral campaign in the recent presidential elections has been immigration. Following his victory, Trump has begun implementing his action plan. One of his key proposals was the execution of mass deportations of immigrants. By Rut Bermejo Casado and Eric Sigmon Analysis 1. Introduction During the 2024 electoral campaign, Trump not only promised to restore some of his previous immigration policies, such as the creation of a ‘great wall’ on the southern border, but he also introduced new proposals to combat irregular immigration to the US. One of the most repeated claims was that he would carry out ‘the largest deportation operation in American history’. Thus, his plan is not only to work on the external dimension of migration control (particularly border controls or, in his words, ‘sealing the border’) but also to address the internal dimension, that is, to reduce the number of immigrants already within the country’s borders.[1] Although the concept of mass deportations appears to conflict with the very historical identity of the US as a nation of immigrants (Cornelius, Martin & Hollifield, 1994; Martin & Orrenius, 2022),[2] from the day of his inauguration, he began signing executive orders to implement a restrictive immigration policy designed by his trusted advisor, Stephen Miller, and to fulfil the promised deportations. Two main aspects of his immigration policy, particularly his deportation plan, are discussed below. First, the potential numerical scope of his plan is examined to answer the question: how many people are likely to be deported? Secondly, which individuals will be included in the operation? Although the well-known Republican policy platform, ‘Project 2025’, clearly states that his immigration policy objectives are to ‘secure the border, complete the construction of the wall, and deport illegal immigrants’, the lack of clarity regarding these aspects or even the contradictory statements were frequent during the electoral campaign. These grandiose, yet detail-lacking proposals, combined with an avalanche and overlapping of measures in the first two weeks of his Administration, make it difficult to ascertain the specifics. Both elements appear to be deliberate to ‘declare victory’ regardless of the outcome of his so-called ‘Operation Aurora’, as the lack of precise objectives prevents the assessment of his achievements. However, his response to how many and which ‘illegal’ immigrants are deported will determine not only the economic cost –which is expected to be high– but also the human cost for the immigrants themselves and the impact on the fundamental values and liberties of US democracy. This paper distinguishes, for analytical purposes, the questions of how many and which. However, both aspects are interconnected, and the response to one has an influence on the other. The total number of deported individuals is clearly linked and also determined by the second aspect: which ones will be deported? If the focus is placed on criminals, as Trump has occasionally said and as suggested by the first ‘detention operations’, that number will be lower than if it includes the entire population residing illegally in the US. 2. Deportations in the US immigration system President Trump’s statements regarding ‘Operation Aurora’ have recalled –indeed, he has explicitly referenced– President Eisenhower’s 1954 ‘Operation Wetback’ (García, 1981; Astor, 2009; Langham, 1992; Hernández, 2006). It is not clear how familiar he is with the operation or to what extent he considers it a model to follow; it may also simply be a nod related to his MAGA slogan, referencing the era that his movement holds as exemplary: the 1950s.[3] ‘Operation Wetback’ is, for many, one of the most shameful episodes in US democracy. This historical event has been described as follows: ‘Eisenhower’s mass deportation policy was a tragedy. Human rights were violated. People were transported to distant locations without food or water. Many unnecessary deaths occurred. On some occasions, even US citizens of Hispanic origin were deported. It was absurd. It was terrible. The immigrants were humiliated’. That operation involved the use of the military and was led by retired military officer Joseph Swing, who implemented it in the summer of 1954. One million young Mexicans were deported (Hernández, 2006), yet its effects in reducing irregular migration appear rather minimal, as many of those deported soon attempted to re-enter, some illegally and others legally. ‘Operation Wetback’ was not only aimed at deporting undocumented immigrants but also at redirecting their entry through legal channels, such as the ‘Bracero’ programme. The latter was designed to meet the demand for labour in specific sectors, requiring workers to meet established conditions to obtain temporary contracts. However, while the operation facilitated the return of some migrants through this system, it failed to curb irregular immigration, as many deportees continued to enter unlawfully. Thus, the operation can be assessed as a costly form of immigrant regularisation and an inefficient method for reducing irregular migration. As previously indicated, the primary target of the deportation operation was young, recently-arrived undocumented Mexican immigrants. Mexico cooperated closely with the US government, to the extent that it has been described as a ‘binational’ operation (Hernández, 2006). The reason for this intense and extensive cooperation was due to Mexico’s labour shortages and its desire to recover its young workforce (predominantly men). In addition to stopping the influx of undocumented Mexican workers, the operation also sought to dissuade employers from hiring them. However, resistance arose from certain legislators and agricultural and livestock industry groups that lobbied Congress. Many legislators opposed one of the initiative’s fundamental principles: penalising employers who hired undocumented workers, arguing that proving their knowledge of their employees’ immigration status would be difficult. Furthermore, some legislators were wary of Brownell’s militaristic approach, which proposed executing the plan as if it were a military invasion. Ultimately, Congress failed to pass legislation sanctioning employers who hired illegal workers but did approve increased funding for the Border Patrol. In summary, ‘Operation Wetback’ encountered legal and operational complications, as well as systematic violations of rights by authorities, including inhumane and degrading treatment, as well as torture. These factors, along with high costs and logistical difficulties, led to its swift termination. There is no doubt that Trump is no Eisenhower, nor is the context the same. Furthermore, certain details of the US immigration system, particularly deportation, have changed since then. Understanding how the system functions is crucial to grasping the new President’s capacity and possibilities for implementing his deportation programme. In the US the deportation or removal system generally requires obtaining a judicial decision for violating immigration laws. To refer to individuals returned to their country of origin following such a judicial resolution, the terms deportation, removal or return are used. It is estimated that in 2022 around 1,200,000 individuals had a final removal order that had not been executed because immigration authorities were unaware of their whereabouts or due to the government’s prosecutorial discretion not to enforce it. In cases where an immigration judge is involved, legal safeguards are clear. Even if the judge determines that a non-citizen may be deported, denies some kind of ‘relief from removal’ and issues a removal order or grants voluntary departure, the individual still has the right to appeal. The deportation order is only considered final if the 30-day period for filing an appeal expires without one being lodged, if the individual expressly waives the right to appeal, or if the Board of Immigration Appeals dismisses the appeal or upholds the deportation order.[4] This general system also includes expedited removals, which are primarily applied to individuals who have just crossed the border and entered the country, executed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Under the system established in 1996, these expedited removals bypass judicial authorisation if the deportation occurs within 14 days of entry for individuals apprehended within 100 miles of the land border unless the individual applies for asylum. These expedited removals, without judicial intervention, can also be applied to those who have been previously expelled (reinstatement of the removal order). The 2020 reform, under Trump’s first term, allowed the DHS to expel such individuals without a formal deportation order. That year expedited removals accounted for 41% of total deportations, while reinstated removal orders constituted 40%. The remaining 19% were determined by an immigration judge. The Trump Administration has once again modified expedited removals. The DHS has reversed the limitations imposed by Biden in 2022. With the new notification, the DHS has regained its authority to apply this procedure more broadly. The new regulation allows individuals without legal status to be subject to expedited deportation if they cannot prove they have been in the country for the previous two years, regardless of where they are found within the US. This measure has raised concerns among human-rights advocates and pro-immigrant organisations. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has criticised the expansion of expedited deportation, stating that this policy ‘leads to the deportation of individuals without due process and without the opportunity to demonstrate their eligibility to remain in the country’. Similarly, the American Immigration Council has warned that the lack of adequate judicial review could increase wrongful deportations, affecting immigrants with legitimate asylum claims or community ties in the US. Title 42 expulsions were also used during the pandemic, from March 2020 to May 2023. This legal provision allowed for swift expulsions of irregular immigrants seeking to enter the US based on public-health risks without requiring a formal interview, thus preventing individuals from seeking asylum. Trump initiated the use of Title 42 and Biden used it more than initially expected until he finally terminated it (Sigmon, 2024). The increasing use of expedited removals, including during the latter part of the Biden Administration, is linked to the termination of Title 42, as it seeks to ensure that immigrants can be deported swiftly without a court hearing if they do not apply for asylum. If immigrants processed under expedited removals apply for asylum, they must pass an initial screening interview with an asylum officer to avoid deportation and proceed with their case in the immigration system. 3. How many people can be deported under the new ‘Operation Aurora’? Although President Donald Trump has begun implementing his planned deportation programme immediately after taking office, one undetermined aspect is the numerical objective of his deportation initiative. In fact, during his campaign, Trump spoke of deporting 15 million or even up to 20 million people, despite estimates from the Pew Research Centerindicating that between 11 and 12 million undocumented immigrants reside in the US. In the case of ‘Operation Wetback’, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the legacy US immigration agency, reported deporting 1,100,000 individuals, though there is no consensus on the actual number, with some sources citing 200,000 people (Langham, 1992), others 1,000,000 (Hernández, 2006) and some suggesting as many as 1,300,000. In the US immigration system, over recent decades, resources for the enforcement of immigration laws have steadily increased, both at the border and within the interior, leading to a rise in deportations. Figure 1 shows the average annual deportations under the last five Administrations. The annual average of deportations increased from the Clinton Administration through Obama’s presidency. However, during Trump’s first term, deportations decreased due to reduced cooperation between state and local jurisdictions with ICE officials, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the government’s ability to detain and remove immigrants. This downward trend continued under the Biden Administration, which prioritised the deportation of immigrants with criminal records, as Obama had also done. Screenshot According to ICE data (see Figure 1), Obama deported more immigrants on average per year (385,000) than Clinton (143,000), Bush (252,000), Trump (299,000) and Biden (174,000). If these figures are broken down annually (see Figure 2), it is evident that during his previous term, despite promising to deport millions of immigrants, the highest number Trump achieved in a single year was 347,250 in fiscal year 2019. ICE’s highest one-year total was 432,228 in 2013 under President Obama. This figure helped to earn him the nickname ‘Deporter-in-Chief’. If Title 42 expulsions and expedited removals are included, Trump reached 393,000 deportations/expulsions in 2020, while Biden’s total reached 1,083,000 (adding up the three years –2021, 2022 and 2023– during which Title 42 remained in effect, reflecting his Administration’s reliance on Title 42. In total, from March 2020 to March 2023 more than 2.8 million immigrants were expelled from the US pursuant to Title 42. Screenshot Considering both these averages and the annual figures, even Vance’s estimate of deporting one million people per year seems quite difficult to achieve. Although it is still very difficult to determine how many people Trump will deport during his term, and how many he has effectively deported during his first week in office, some sources point to approximately 7,300 individuals. Of these, Mexico received 4,094 deportees from the US, the majority of them Mexican nationals, although individuals of other nationalities were also included. Undoubtedly, the operation that has received the most attention has been that of Colombia, which refused to receive two US military planes with approximately 200 Colombian deportees. However, military flights have been a minority thus far –around six– while deportations via commercial flights have been far more frequent. These deportations are attracting particular attention not so much due to their numbers, which some do not find abnormal, but rather because they are accompanied by raids[5] in sanctuary cities such as Miami or Chicago. ICE is also requiring state prisons to notify them before releasing detainees. This allows ICE to take custody of individuals and then place them in formal proceedings. 4. Who is being deported? A mass deportation, as anticipated under ‘Operation Aurora’, would be highly divisive, leading to family separations and potentially devastating effects on communities. It is estimated that, on a national level, more than 16.7 million people have at least one family member living with them in an irregular immigration situation. In fact, there are 5.9 million US children citizens who could potentially be at risk if these measures target their undocumented family members. The imagery of arrests within communities and family separations would be difficult to justify for a democracy like the US and would provoke strong opposition, such as the outcry during Trump’s first Administration against his ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy, which resulted in the separation of immigrant children from their parents.[6] Trump has spent months –if not years– laying the groundwork for this opposition, using rhetoric suggesting an invasion or a massive wave of immigration that would justify mass deportations,[7] drawing parallels with ‘Operation Wetback’ (Hernández, 2006). Mass deportation could even affect individuals with legal immigration status. Some expect that the operation will not indiscriminately include ‘any immigrant without legal status’ but will instead focus not on ‘how many’ but on ‘which ones’. There is a significant difference between prioritising the deportation of individuals serving criminal sentences or those in immigration detention –or, as the President insists, individuals in mental asylums– and deporting people who have been living in the US unlawfully for 20 or 30 years, with spouses or children who are US citizens. Trump has talked about targeting immigrants who entered via the humanitarian parole programme the Biden Administration implemented for certain Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans because he believes the programme was illegal. By this logic, he could also target the so-called ‘DACA children’ and individuals granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS). It is worth remembering that, during his first term, Trump sought to end the DACA programme and eliminate TPS designations for certain nationalities. During his first week in office, Trump has emphasised the need to deport criminals, dangerous offenders and members of organised gangs. However, this could be merely the beginning: ‘the worst ones first’. Consistent with his focus on immigrants who have committed crimes, the first law he signed as President during his second term was the Laken Riley Act, approved the day after his inauguration, which expands the DHS mandate to detain any individual who is in the US illegally or lacks the necessary documents upon requesting admission and who has been accused, arrested, convicted or admitted to having committed acts that constitute the essential elements of burglary, theft, larceny or shoplifting. The Trump Administration has provided overall arrest figures for its first two weeks, but has not provided enough details to determine what proportion of the arrests were criminals or other details to help evaluate the kinds of operations ICE is conducting or the profiles of its targets. However, at the same time, reports of warrantless arrests have begun to emerge following the raids conducted during the first weekend in sanctuary cities such as Chicago and Miami. In this regard, Homan, known as Trump’s ‘border czar’, has reiterated that undocumented individuals apprehended during raids targeting criminals will also be deported. As with ‘Operation Wetback’, the majority of individuals being deported are of Mexican nationality. However, unlike that operation, this one will also include citizens from other countries, mainly Latin American. Additionally, while ‘Operation Wetback’ was primarily concentrated in the south-western US –starting at the California and Arizona borders before expanding to Texas’s southern border and later including Chicago (Langham, 1992)– the current US operations will be nationwide. Conclusions ‘Operation Aurora’ presents various challenges, which are examined in the second part of this paper –budgetary, operational, diplomatic, political and legal–. However, the first two weeks of President Trump’s Administration has already clarified some aspects regarding ‘how many people will be deported’ and ‘who will be affected’. The comparison with 1954’s ‘Operation Wetback’ highlights numerous similarities, whether intentional or coincidental, and underscores the risks of repeating historical mistakes. That policy not only resulted in significant human and economic costs but also proved ineffective in reducing irregular migration as it focused solely on mass deportation without offering viable pathways for regularisation. In the present context, where Trump has restricted legal migration pathways, a policy that combines ‘enforcement’ with regularisation could avoid these pitfalls and align with the principles of justice and humanity that should guide a democracy like the US. At present, it is not yet possible to describe this as a ‘mass deportation’. For some, the initial figures do not indicate an exceptional level of deportation activity. However, it remains to be seen how events unfold as the Administration’s efforts to pursue a mass deportation campaign present significant challenges, which will be analysed in the second part of this paper. Nevertheless, if the promised numbers are to be reached, the campaign will deeply impact social cohesion, employment in certain sectors (like agriculture and construction), human rights and the democratic values of the US. Moreover, images of family separations and mass arrests, detentions and deportations would be difficult to justify and support for an extended period of time in any 21st century democracy.

Donald Trump And North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Program – Analysis	By Ranjit Kumar Dhawan Introduction The Donald Trump administration after coming to power on 20 January 2025 expressed its desire to improve relations with the Kim dynasty regime in North Korea.[1] Notably, on the day after his inauguration as the 47th President of the United States, Trump termed North Korea a 'nuclear power' state, which caused apprehensions in South Korea.[2] However, during his meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba on 7 February 2025, Trump called for 'complete denuclearisation' of North Korea.[3] On the other hand, the North Korean regime has not yet responded to Trump’s gesture for restarting dialogue between the two countries. In the backdrop of the newly inaugurated second Trump administration, the Kim regime has been bolstering its nuclear weapons programme and has tested a more sophisticated cruise missile system. According to some analysts, Pyongyang will remain hostile towards the United States in 2025.[4] Also, contrary to the expectations of President Trump, North Korea would probably not give up its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Programme and the United States The enmity between North Korea and the US dates back to the Cold War period of intense ideological rivalry between capitalism and communism. The US played a key role in the division of the Korean Peninsula in 1945, and also militarily supported South Korea during the Korean War (1950–1953), which ended only with an armistice. The brutalities committed by the American army and threat to use nuclear weapons during the Korean War shaped North Korea’s approach towards the US. The American military bases on the Korean Peninsula and stationing of tactical nuclear weapons by the US in South Korea during the Cold War were also opposed by North Korea. In the post-Cold War period, North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme gained momentum. The nuclear programme was guided by Pyongyang’s goal for achieving self-reliance or Juche in the field of national defence.[5] Despite being a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), North Korea secretly pursued the development of nuclear arsenal. In its pursuit of developing nuclear weapons technology, North Korea received some help from Pakistan.[6] Since 2006, North Korea has tested various kinds of nuclear devices, and has been developing long-range ballistic missiles which are apparently capable of reaching North America and could target the mainland US. The US has been strongly opposed to the North Korean nuclear weapons programme and has imposed severe economic sanctions against this reclusive regime. However, the fears of massive causalities and escalation of the conflict had deterred various administrations in the US to take pre-emptive strikes against the North Korean nuclear facilities. Remarkably, the previous Donald Trump administration in 2017 had even threatened to 'totally destroy' North Korea. But the three rounds of meetings between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during 2018–2019 remained unsuccessful. Notably, the current Trump administration has again pledged for North Korea’s denuclearisation. Why North Korea Will Not Denuclearise? A few days after the inauguration of the second Trump administration, the North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong-un made a visit to a secret weapons-grade nuclear materials manufacturing facility in North Korea, where he called for the reinforcing of the 'nuclear shield of the country'.[7] The North Korean state media also stated that the nuclear weapons of the country should not be regarded as a 'bargaining chip'.[8] Further, Kim Jong-un on the occasion of the 77th founding anniversary of the (North) Korean People’s Army on 8 February 2025, spoke about the threats from the US as the reason for bolstering North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.[9] Therefore, it appears that North Korea is not interested in negotiations with the US to curb its nuclear arsenal. Firstly, the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war since 2022 has provided useful lessons to the Kim dynasty regime in Pyongyang against denuclearisation. Also, North Korea and Russia signed a treaty on ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ for mutual defence in June 2024. As a result, the military engagement between Pyongyang and Moscow has increased significantly. Reportedly, North Korea has dispatched thousands of troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine, and has also provided Moscow with several tonnes of conventional weapons. In return, North Korea has apparently received rice, money and cutting-edge military reconnaissance satellite technology from Russia.[10] North Korea has also been treating Russian soldiers wounded in combat operations against Ukraine.[11] Also, there is a possibility that Moscow may even accept Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons development programme.[12] Secondly, the Trump administration’s approach for peace with North Korea has not been accompanied with any significant effort for reduction in tensions between the two countries. Evidently, the military exercises between the US and South Korea have continued unabated since Trump took office in January 2025. On the other hand, North Korea has continued to be critical of the US–South Korea military alliance, including sale of weapons to Seoul by Washington.[13] Also, the visit of an American nuclear-powered submarine to Busan in South Korea in February 2025 triggered angry response from North Korea.[14] Moreover, the comment by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio regarding North Korea as a 'rogue state' was also vehemently criticised by Pyongyang.[15] Thirdly, North Korea’s relations with South Korea have undergone profound changes since 2024. The Kim dynasty regime in North Korea has abolished the idea of reunification of the Korean Peninsula, and has probably amended its constitution to regard South Korea as a 'hostile state'.[16] North Korea has also destroyed roads and railway links with South Korea as part of Pyongyang’s ‘two hostile states’ policy.[17] Therefore, South Korea is now a ‘separate and enemy’ country for North Korea. Arguably, this strategy of Pyongyang towards Seoul is to push South Korea to compromise and accept North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.[18] Conclusion The rapidly developing nuclear capabilities of North Korea have been an issue of deep concern to the US. This also reflects the failure of all previous American administrations to get rid of the North Korean nuclear arsenal. The advent of the second Trump administration has raised hopes for a solution on this issue. However, there has not been any major shift in Trump’s policy towards the North Korean nuclear weapons programme. For its part, the Kim dynasty regime in Pyongyang has been strengthening its nuclear weapons capabilities and has been critical about the policies of second Trump administration. Therefore, it appears that North Korea’s denuclearisation shall remain only a propaganda campaign for the US and Pyongyang would not abandon its nuclear weapons programme.

Syria: A Larger Lebanon Or A Signal For Major Geopolitical Change...	By General (Rtd) Corneliu Pivariu I. Brief History Syria, under French mandate after World War I, gained independence in 1945, subsequently experiencing a highly turbulent political and social period marked by numerous military coups until 1970, when General Hafez Al-Assad seized power through a coup. A referendum in the spring of 1971 legitimized his leadership, establishing an autocratic rule based on the military and secret services, widely supported by his Alawite coreligionists (a minority), who held the most important positions in the power structures. The natural passing of Hafez Al-Assad in 2000, one of the longest-serving heads of state in the Middle East, was linked by many analysts to the beginning of Syria’s decline in regional influence. His successor, his son Bashar, assumed power instead of his elder brother Basel, who had been groomed for leadership but died in a tragic car accident in Lebanon. Retaining his father’s loyal supporters, Bashar managed to stay in power for nearly 24 years, until December 8, 2024, when he fled to Moscow. Ultimately, the London-trained ophthalmologist failed to effectively manage the external and internal challenges he faced, exacerbated by severe mistakes made by his close circle and the shifting geopolitical landscape. The phrase popular in Damascus in the 2010s—'The West needs Bashar al-Assad more than Bashar needs the West'—gradually lost its validity due to the regime’s serious errors and changing international attitudes toward Damascus. II. Syria and the Arab Spring In Syria, the Arab Spring (or rather, the Arab Winter) emerged later than in North Africa, where protests and political upheavals began in 2010. The onset of Syrian unrest, which gradually escalated into a long and bloody civil war[2], is traced to March 15, 2011, following earlier protests in Dara, a southern Syrian city near the Jordanian border. The Assad regime mishandled these protests, employing heavy-handed repression, particularly through the Republican Guard led by Bashar’s brother, Maher Al-Assad. Popular discontent was further fueled by the presence of several hundred infiltrators from abroad, carrying passports from a neighboring country, between January and March 2011. This signaled an external decision to remove Assad, reinforced by substantial financial and material support from Arab states such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Despite the regime’s powerful secret services, which recruited followers from an early age, protests became violent across nearly the entire country. Armed intervention against demonstrators led to the radicalization of the movement. Due to Syria’s unique social situation and the government’s intelligence operations, opposition groups fragmented into various factions, including armed groups like the Free Syrian Army, which failed to unify into a single force. Extremist organizations such as Daesh (ISIS) exploited the ensuing chaos to seize control of different regions. The situation was further complicated by the involvement of international actors such as Russia (from 2015), Iran (from the beginning, both militarily and through Hezbollah), Turkey, and the U.S.-led coalition, each pursuing distinct geopolitical interests. Mass desertions weakened the Syrian army, which, except for its elite commando units and the Republican Guard, was generally poorly trained. Alongside foreign military presences—Russia and Iran being crucial in securing strategic areas—the regime also established local paramilitary formations such as the Shabiha ('ghosts'), primarily composed of Alawite minorities who maintained control, especially along the coast, where their population was significant. To survive, the regime employed all available means, from airstrikes using fragmentation bombs to chemical weapons. Prisons became overcrowded with opposition members detained for the slightest act of defiance. From a demographic perspective, the war was catastrophic, causing over 500,000 deaths, more than 6 million external refugees, and around 4 million internally displaced persons. Material destruction is difficult to estimate, with figures reaching approximately $300 billion. Between 2011 and 2023, the Syrian economy shrank by 85%. The regime survived largely due to Iranian support, estimated at $2-6 billion annually. Another financial lifeline was the production of Captagon, an illicit drug known as the 'jihad drug,' generating over $10 billion for the Assad regime. In late November 2024, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham[3] (HTS) – Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, which controlled Syria’s northwestern Idlib region, launched an offensive against key strategic points, capturing Aleppo within days, followed by Hama, Homs, and finally Damascus. The Syrian Civil War formally ended on December 7, 2024, following a meeting in Doha involving Arab foreign ministers and the Astana Process for Syria. They signed a Joint Declaration [4] endorsing a ceasefire based on UN Security Council Resolution 2254. On December 8, 2024, Bashar al-Assad fled from Damascus to Latakia and was evacuated to Moscow from Russia’s Hmeimim military airbase. III. The Fall of the Assad Regime, Current Developments, and Perspectives The fall of the Assad regime was driven by a combination of internal and external factors that reached a critical point towards the end of 2024. Nevertheless, the regime demonstrated remarkable resilience, though the worsening economic and social crisis heightened the risks of regime change. Key external factors included Israel’s desire to capitalize on developments in Gaza and Lebanon to minimize Iran’s influence in Syria, as well as the situation of the Russian Federation, which, being engaged in the conflict in Ukraine, was unwilling to intensify its military support for Bashar al-Assad, thereby accepting his departure within a broader geopolitical context The Assad family was not entirely caught off guard[5], having taken precautions from the early years of the civil war to secure a comfortable life in Russia. Bashar shared his plans to flee Syria with almost no one, misleading his advisors, officials, and even relatives about his real intentions. His brother, Maher—commander of the Republican Guard—departed by helicopter to Iraq and then flew to Moscow. On December 8, the armed opposition announced the fall of the regime, and the acting Prime Minister, Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, declared his willingness to hand over power to a transitional government. On December 10, Ahmed al-Sharaa[6], the emir of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who became the de facto head of state, appointed Mohammed al-Bashir as Prime Minister of the Salvation Government. Initially consisting of 12 members from the previously established government in Idlib, the cabinet was expanded by six members on December 21, and the first female minister was appointed a day later. On December 30, Maysaa Sabreen was appointed as the first female governor of the Central Bank of Syria, having previously served as the first deputy governor of the bank during the latter part of the Assad regime. On January 29, 2025, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) held the 'Victory Conference' in Damascus, officially naming Ahmed al-Sharaa as interim president. He was tasked with forming an interim legislative council to draft a new constitution. In a five-minute speech, Sharaa outlined his five priorities: resolving the power vacuum; maintaining civil peace and preventing acts of revenge[7]; rebuilding state institutions, particularly the military, security, and police forces, to ensure public safety; revitalizing the economy by rebuilding human resources, agriculture, industry, and the service sector; and regaining Syria’s regional position by establishing foreign relations based on sovereignty, respect, and mutual interests. Aware of the difficulties ahead, al-Sharaa remarked, 'The first moment of victory can be the first moment of defeat.' In defense, initial steps were taken as 18 larger and around 50 smaller armed factions agreed to dissolve and integrate into the new army. However, two armed factions in the south, from Suwayda and Daraa, as well as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which control a significant area in northeastern Syria, have not yet accepted integration. The SDF, of Kurdish origin and allied with the U.S., maintains ties with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, which seeks to eliminate it. Economic reconstruction is estimated to take at least ten years for Syria’s GDP to return to its 2010 level ($80 billion), compared to just $10 billion in 2023. In 2019, reconstruction costs were estimated at approximately $400 billion, likely exceeding $500-600 billion today. The new Minister of Economy has promised a transition to a free, competitive economy, abandoning the centralized control model. Although the U.S. and the EU are expected to lift most, if not all, economic sanctions, massive investments will be required for reconstruction, making it a fundamentally political issue. Countries financing reconstruction will play a crucial political role in Syria’s future. Despite expressing interest, Iran and Russia are unlikely to play a dominant role due to their internal and geopolitical circumstances. Given Syria’s new power dynamics, Turkey is in the most advantageous position. Turkish exports to Damascus were worth $2 billion in 2023, and given Ankara’s support for HTS, Turkey is likely to become the primary investor in reconstruction. The Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan’s visit to Damascus on December 22, 2024, signaled not only political-military but also economic intentions. By late January 2025, President Erdogan stated that Turkey alone could eradicate terrorist groups in Syria, implying its desire for a leading role in the country. In this context, the revival of the Turkey-Qatar gas pipeline project, first proposed in 2009 and abandoned due to political difficulties, including the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, is worth noting. The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani’s visit to Damascus on January 30, 2025—the first by an Arab head of state since Assad’s fall—further underscores Qatar’s interest in Syria’s future. Apart from general discussions on post-war collaboration, Qatar provided 200 MW of electricity, with plans for gradual expansion. Another crucial issue is securing Syria’s oil supply, which was 90% dependent on Iran before deliveries ceased following Assad’s fall. Additionally, Hezbollah’s oil trafficking routes from Lebanon were bombed by Israel, forcing Syria to seek alternative sources. Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and even Iraq are being considered for this purpose. Iran evacuated its personnel from Syria shortly before the regime’s fall but remains open to cooperation with the new authorities. Iran still has significant influence through its supporters in Syria, which it can leverage to advance its interests. Although initially stating its intention to maintain good relations with Moscow, the new Syrian government has annulled Russia’s 49-year lease of the Tartus naval base. A visit by Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister to Damascus in late January failed to resolve the issue, and Russian military equipment has begun to be evacuated by sea. However, Syria will need to maintain some level of normal relations with Russia, considering their historical ties and future dependencies. Syria’s external debt to Russia exceeds $15 billion, primarily for military procurement, and its armed forces rely on Russian technology, making a shift to alternative suppliers a long-term process. Moreover, Russia’s long-standing advisory presence in Syria’s security and defense sectors remains a strategic advantage for Moscow. The U.S. has shown interest in Syria’s developments, evidenced by a State Department delegation’s visit to Damascus shortly after Assad’s fall. The U.S. maintains around 2,000 troops in northeastern Syria, supporting the SDF, a stance opposed by Turkey. After December 8, 2024, the U.S. reportedly expanded Ain al-Assad airbase in western Iraq to serve as a logistics hub for American bases in the region. Additionally, it allegedly secured agreements for three new bases in Damascus, Daraa, and Quneitra, while expanding the Hasakah base. I personally believe that the regime change in Syria was linked to the changes underway in the Washington Administration, in order to align with the new intentions of the Trump administration in the Middle East, with Syria potentially playing an important role in the security architecture envisioned by the new American administration for the region. Israel was an active participant in the evolution of the situation in Syria and took advantage of the circumstances that emerged after December 8, 2024, to carry out over 400 air strikes against Iranian targets, Hezbollah, and the Syrian military—destroying missile and ammunition depots, striking the most important points of Syria’s anti-aircraft defenses and radar installations, and sinking a large part of the Syrian military fleet. Israel justified its actions as preventive, to ensure that the respective weaponry and military equipment would not be captured by terrorists. Furthermore, immediately after December 8, it proceeded to completely occupy the heights of the Golan as well as Mount Hermon (2,814 m), the highest in the area, overlooking Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. 'It is extremely important from a strategic point of view. There is no substitute for mountains,' explained Efraim Inbar, Director of the Institute for Strategy and Security in Jerusalem (JISS). Although Israel officially declared that it would not retain these territories, I doubt that it will not, in the not-too-distant future, proclaim the annexation of the entire Golan plateau and maintain control over Mount Hermon, where it could install specialized equipment for military electronic reconnaissance (if such equipment has not already begun to be installed). At present, I do not believe that Israel has established a long-term policy towards the new regime in Syria, given the multiple possible political scenarios regarding the developments in that country. Potentially, a normalization of relations between Syria and Israel could open new economic prospects, particularly in the energy sector for Israel. Ahmad al-Sharaa and the interim government established in Damascus face particularly heavy and complex challenges both domestically and internationally. The transition period is estimated to last around three years, after which a new constitution must be approved by referendum, followed by elections in the fourth year. The issues that the new government will confront are very different from the administration of a region such as Idlib, where errors were also made. Regarding the medium- and long-term evolution of the situation in Syria, I believe it can be grouped into two main scenarios, each with several variants: either Syria remains within its current territory—with some modifications in the Golan area that will be entirely annexed by Israel—or Syria is partially or completely divided (the latter being the least likely variant), depending on the evolution of the internal situation and the negotiations between various regional powers and global actors. In the event of a division, Turkey is best positioned, as it would like to bring under its control the area in the north, from immediately north of Latakia, through Aleppo and along the Euphrates to the border with Iraq. The coastal area, where the Alawite minority is predominant, could declare independence and come under the umbrella of Moscow, thereby saving its maritime bases in the Mediterranean. Jordan, as a maximalist plan, might lay claim to expand its territory even as far as Damascus, taking into account the historical traditions of the Hashemite dynasty, or only as far as Daraa and Suwayda. This, too, will depend on developments in Gaza. Of course, Israel will take the entire Golan as well as Mount Hermon. Will Ahmad al-Sharaa, at the age of 43, be able to successfully lead Syria through the transition period and subsequent reconstruction? Determination alone is not enough; the way in which internal and external factors will interweave, as well as how he will seize emerging opportunities, will determine the final outcome of Syria’s evolution in the first half of the 21st century. IV. Brief Conclusions The fall of the Assad regime in less than a month after nearly 14 years of civil war is a clear indication that regional and global geopolitical shifts in the second quarter of the 21st century will be more significant than before. The possibility of border modifications worldwide is no longer far-fetched. In the Middle East, Israel and Turkey emerge as the main winners, though each faces internal and external challenges. Syria’s situation remains highly complex and open to various possibilities. The new government must tackle a deepening economic and social crisis while preventing a descent into factional conflict, reminiscent of Lebanon’s historical turmoil. Syria’s developments will shape new regional and global power balances, potentially becoming the new litmus test for Middle Eastern and even global geopolitics.

[3] Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is a Sunni Islamist politico-military organization that emerged in January 2017 through the merger of several Syrian Sunni opposition military factions. Previously, in 2011, HTS was known as Jabhat al-Nusra and was affiliated with Al-Qaeda. It also had ties with the Islamic State, but these affiliations were severed with the formation of HTS. The organization has been designated a terrorist group by the UN, the US, Turkey, the EU, and other states. HTS controlled the northwestern region of Syria, known as the Idlib region, as well as parts of the Aleppo area, including the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. It established a Salvation Government composed of 10 ministers. The organization has received increased support from Turkey over the past year, including drones, military instructors, and weaponry. Additionally, it benefits from support from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, other Arab and non-Arab countries, and wealthy opponents of the Assad regime who have taken refuge abroad.

The US State Department estimated in 2022 that the Assad family’s wealth was approximately $2 billion, spread across numerous accounts, shell companies, real estate portfolios, and tax havens. A Syrian intelligence officer told a Turkish publication that, before his departure from Syria, Bashar al-Assad had transferred $135 billion out of the country. His eldest son, Hafez, now 22 years old, is currently preparing for his doctorate in Moscow [6] Ahmed al-Sharaa, known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani (born October 29, 1982), was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to a Syrian Sunni family from the Golan region. At the age of six, he returned with his family to Damascus. Shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he joined Al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he fought for three years before being captured by American forces and imprisoned in various locations from 2006 to 2011. His release coincided with the start of the Syrian civil war, during which he established the Al-Nusra Front to support Al-Qaeda's fight against Bashar al-Assad’s Ba'athist regime. In 2013, he was placed on the US State Department's terrorist list, and four years later, a $10 million reward was set for information leading to his capture. In December 2024, the reward was canceled following his meeting with a US State Department delegation visiting Damascus.On July 28, 2016, al-Sharaa announced that Al-Nusra was severing ties with Al-Qaeda and renamed the organization Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS). In January 2017, he formed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) by merging with other groups. He prioritized combating Al-Qaeda and Daesh to improve relations with the West, particularly with Turkey, and succeeded in controlling most of the Idlib region, which he governs through the Syrian Salvation Government. [7] Reports have already surfaced of summary executions of approximately 35 people in central Homs and another 10 people in the Alawite area, from which the Assad family originates.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRRTRL8PLYtsU	2025-02-16T17:20:54-08:00	
Why India Matters To Singapore – Analysis	By Fiona Raval President of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam concluded a four-day state visit to India on 18 January 2025. The first Indian tour by a Singaporean president in a decade, it commemorated the 60th anniversary of India and Singapore establishing bilateral ties. This high-level visit follows the one made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Singapore in September 2024, when the two countries elevated ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP). India and Singapore have maintained amicable relations with strong economic and trade ties over the years. Singapore has been one of India’s foremost trading partners and its top Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) contributor. As of 2023-24, Singapore was India’s largest trade partner in ASEAN, with petroleum products, electronic machinery, coal, and ships being the most traded items. The two countries also have a sound defence partnership which manifests through joint drills, exercises, regular ministerial dialogues, and association in equipment manufacturing. 2024 onwards New Delhi and Singapore have seen a still further uptick in bilateral ties. From a Singaporean perspective, this growing partnership results from a combination of national and regional considerations that reflect its evolving strategic interests. What are the specific factors driving this robustness? Bilateral Incentives India-Singapore ties are primarily based on trade, commerce, and people-to-people linkages. In 2023-24, bilateral trade reached around US$ 35.62 billion. The annual compound growth rate of total trading volume since 2019-20 has been around 10.75 per cent, with the balance in Singapore’s favour. This relationship has been facilitated by the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), a Free Trade Agreement signed in 2005. The CECA reduces tariffs, protects FDI, and boosts market access. Additionally, it enhances cooperation in areas like knowledge-sharing, education, and skill-building, while also easing visa restrictions and recognising qualifications to allow easier exchange of professional talent. The relationship recently progressed to a CSP following CECA’s success. This endeavour reaffirms existing collaborations but also opens doors to new and emerging areas like healthcare, semiconductors, digital technologies, and sustainability. There is also hope that the CSP can help address the problem of reduced FDI flow into India. Although Singapore is the top contributor, its overall investments have seen sharp decline in the past year. Collaborative skill development and exchange of skilled labour further strengthens bilateral relations between India and Singapore. Singapore has long depended on foreign workers due to its small population size and shortage of native manpower. As of 2024, around 6,50,00 Indians were living in Singapore. Indians are a major source of the low wage migrant workforce in Singapore, with Indian Employment Pass holders nearly doubling between 2005 and 2021. This workforce also contributes to the rising demand of finance and tech-centric jobs at multinational companies that have set up shop in Singapore. Without this labour, the Singaporean economy, which depends on multinational corporations for 73 per cent of its corporate tax, would take a significant hit. This is why technical education and skill development are important areas of collaboration. In fact Singapore has associated with several Indian states for such initiatives, such as setting up the North-East Skill Centre in Guwahati, Assam, and the World Skill Centre in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. These efforts allow Singapore to capitalise on India’s demographic dividend by making people more employable. For example, the winners of the Singapore India Hackathon were incentivised by potential job opportunities at the Singaporean DSB Bank. While advantageous to its economy, the rise in foreign workers has also caused strains within Singapore. Singaporean natives have grown to resent foreigners for allegedly stealing professional opportunities. Indians face racial and xenophobic abuse in Singapore, where ‘CECA’ is used as a slur for Indian workers. In the absence of punitive action, the discrimination has not stemmed. The Singaporean government has however made statements saying that this nature of abuse won’t be tolerated, that economic agreements, including the CECA, don’t grant favour for employment. Singapore’s ongoing investments in Indian skill-building and the induction of Indians into its workforce underscore how vital this sector is to its economy. On the flipside, local hostility towards foreign workers from India continues to be a significant concern, though the Indian government is yet to raise the issue with Singaporean counterparts. Regional Drivers As a small country, Singapore’s success and stability depend on its partnerships and ability to adapt to major power competition. Despite Singapore’s longstanding and meaningful relations with both the US and China as well as deft attempts to walk the foreign policy tightrope, some problems persist. Regional flux has manifested in the form of protectionist trade practices, which create exclusion and hurt Southeast Asian economies. It has also increased competition in areas of key and emerging technologies. Always a proponent of regional collaboration, Singapore has highlighted the need to create diverse multilateral partnerships so as to not get caught in geopolitical crossfire. Singapore has adapted to the flux created by major power competition by diversifying and strengthening other relationships. In this light, expanding areas of collaboration with India is a strategic move to create dependable ecosystems in the region. For example, the India-Singapore semiconductor deal tries to bridge supply chain gaps created post the COVID-19 pandemic and to insulate from the impacts of China's stance against Taiwan. This not only adjusts to regional changes but also creates new opportunities by giving Singapore greater market access. Other areas of collaboration include setting up a green energy corridor to cooperate on critical and emerging technologies. This will achieve India and Singapore’s joint goal of sustainable development, and facilitate greater visibility for Singapore as a regional lead in clean technology. As a strong supporter of multilateralism, Singapore had thrown its weight behind ASEAN’s Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). India’s sudden decision to opt out of RCEP negotiations in 2019 was thus met with concern. This concern was reportedly exacerbated when India was perceived as repositioning itself away from ASEAN. Singapore’s strategic position as a gateway to Southeast Asia plays a key role in ensuring ASEAN remains a priority for India. Given the unceasing crisis in Myanmar, this partnership as well as India’s active involvement in ASEAN become even more urgent. New Delhi and Singapore have significant investments and economic interests in Myanmar and share a common goal of maintaining peace in the ASEAN region. India’s participation is needed for developing a comprehensive and durable solution to the crisis, especially when ASEAN’s 5-point consensus has failed to make a difference. India’s Ministry of External Affairs confirmed that Myanmar was a topic of discussion during this presidential visit. Conclusion In their 60 years of partnership India and Singapore have maintained steadfast relations. The past year has seen a positive escalation in the relationship, with a deepening of ties through a blend of bilateral and regional strategic considerations. Bilaterally, CECA has helped further bolster trade and economic linkages and opened new pathways to cooperation, such as digital technologies. While racial tensions are an active concern, the high volume of labour and expertise flowing into Singapore also emphasises a critical interdependency. Regionally, Singapore's efforts to diversify partnerships due to major power competition further drive its engagement with India. This new phase in their partnership is not just to foster mutual growth and stability but is an acknowledgement of shifting global dynamics and an effort to navigate them jointly.

Sri Lanka Struggles To Deliver A New Era Of Post-Crisis Growth – ...	By Ganeshan Wignaraja Sri Lanka’s National People’s Power (NPP) government, led by the charismatic President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, entered office in late 2024 at a turning point in the country’s economic history. Sri Lanka experienced its worst post-independence economic crisis in 2022–23. While the economy is now stabilising, the challenges are far from over. The new government is struggling to balance economic growth with debt sustainability. Sri Lanka’s economic outlook offers cause for cautious optimism. The combination of prudent monetary and financial stability policy by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, fiscal policy reforms, a US$3 billion International Monetary Fund program and US$4 billion of Indian assistance appears to have steadied the economy after severe macroeconomic turbulence. A debt restructuring deal of US$17.5 billion reached with private bondholders and China gave Sri Lanka the breathing room it desperately needed, while earnings from tourism have accelerated, contributing to the recovery of foreign exchange reserves. The October 2024 World Bank growth forecasts point to growth slowing from a forecast 4.4 per cent in 2024 to 3.5 per cent in 2025. Despite a stabilising economy, over half the country’s population is experiencing what the UNDP terms multidimensional vulnerability to their standard of living. While the economic outlook is positive, there are risks that the new government will need to tackle head-on. One of the most pressing issues is the outflow of skilled professionals. Sri Lanka has seen a significant brain drain with over 300,000 people leaving Sri Lanka for foreign employment in 2024 alone. The country faces an ever-shrinking talent pool — talent which is desperately needed to propel growth. The newly elected parliament has little experience, as the country struggles with the repercussions of the brain drain. Of the 225 members of parliament, about 150 are untested first-term representatives. This raises questions about whether Sri Lanka’s politicians have the legislative and technical capacity needed to enact the economic reforms Sri Lanka so desperately needs. The government will need to focus on improving service delivery, retaining key talent within the state sector and developing expertise in governance and public administration. Sri Lanka will have to rejuvenate the elite cadre of the civil service by establishing a top-quality public policy school akin to The Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy or France’s Sciences Po. Tourism — which has long been a critical sector for Sri Lanka — is showing strong recovery, with significant potential to boost foreign exchange reserves and spur growth. Over 2 million touristsvisited Sri Lanka in 2024, a 38 per cent increase over 2023. But the government has to do more to ensure that the tourism industry is sustainable and its economic benefits extend beyond the capital, Colombo. Marketing Sri Lanka as a multicultural destination, coupled with targeted development of less-visited regions in the north and east of the country and small tourism businesses, will help create a more balanced and decentralised tourism industry. Fiscal sustainability is one of the most contentious issues facing the new government. While revenue has increased due to higher taxation, further reducing government spending and exposure to corruption risks are powerful means of reducing fiscal imbalances. Despite ruling out privatisation, the government plans to turn around state-owned enterprises through better management. But some of the larger loss-making state-owned enterprises — such as SriLankan Airlines and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation — should be reconsidered for privatisation or restructuring, as their drain on public funds threatens Sri Lanka’s long-term fiscal stability. With the support of international financial institutions, the government should pursue a strategy that right-sizes the state, encourages private-sector growth and ensures fiscal health in the coming years. Sri Lanka’s foreign policy choices are vexed. The geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific are dramatically changing after US President Donald Trump resumed office, with India emerging as a key player in Sri Lanka’s economic future. The government must strengthen economic ties with India and its southern states, ensuring that Sri Lanka benefits from Indian investments and partnerships. President Dissanayake will have to live up to his promises of non-interference in India’s security concerns, particularly given China’s increasing commercial presence in Sri Lanka. President Dissanayake’s visit to India in December 2024 was a promising foundation for stronger bilateral relations. The government must now focus on making concrete progress, particularly in business-to-business links, digitisation, cross-border energy projects and the deeper bilateral free trade agreement now under negotiation. Sri Lanka faces a serious risk of having to make capital repayments on its external debt in mid-2027 if it cannot increase its foreign exchange reserves through trade-led growth. In partnership with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, India should stand ready to help if Sri Lanka falters a second time. The new Sri Lankan government will need a comprehensive growth plan that addresses both immediate risks and long-term opportunities. Navigating these choppy waters will require pragmatic leadership, bold policy decisions and a clear vision for Sri Lanka’s future prosperity. The publication of the national budget in mid-February 2025 will provide important insights into the NPP administration’s economic plans.

Spring Is In The Air In US-Russia Ties As Trump’s Revolution Gain...	What emerges from the dramatic happenings of the past week is that the 3-year chronicle of US-Russia rivalry and the NATO’s proxy war in Ukraine was a crisis engineered with great deliberation by the Anglo-American nexus per a pernicious agenda conceived by the neocon liberals wedded to globalism ensconced in the Washington and London establishment to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia. In less than a month since President Donald Trump returned to Oval Office, in a series of bold moves, he began dismantling the Iron Wall that descended on Central Europe. Its impact is already visible, as communication channels with Moscow have been flung open, as evident in the new US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s call to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Saturday and their agreement to meet at delegation level in Saudi Arabia next week. The Trump administration will allow the resumption of normal diplomatic work as well as discuss the early return of diplomatic properties unilaterally seized by the Obama – Biden administrations in wanton acts of motiveless malignity and hubris, in violation of Vienna accords. Trust Russia to reciprocate! The downstream salience of the readouts in Moscow and Washington, here and here, on the Rubio-Lavrov phone conversation is the mutual agreement between the two leaderships — Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin — for US-Russian interactive exchanges at various levels is being followed through with a view to improve bilateral relations as well as 'on key international issues, including the situation in Ukraine, developments in Palestine and the broader Middle East, as well as other regional matters.' Furthermore, a team designated by the White House comprising apart from Rubio, the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and the president’s Middle East envoy (who also works on Ukraine-Russia issues) Steve Witkoff will meet a Russian team led by Lavrov as early as this week ahead. The inclusion of Witkoff, a ‘result-oriented’, pushy negotiator and old friend of Trump is particularly interesting. Witkoff flew into Moscow for an unpublicised solo visit last week, which appears to have been productive. Clearly, Trump has drawn lessons from this first term and is determined not to get emasculated again in the Washington ‘swamp’. This is where Witkoff comes in. Trump’s approach and political style is utterly fascinating. Trump began shifting gear no sooner than he managed to put together a team of like-minded people who are 'loyalists' to head the Justice Department, Pentagon, the Treasury, etc. — and, importantly, to forcefully regenerate the authority of the attorney general and the national intelligence agency to serve his agenda. Thus, in the final analysis, it is immaterial that his administration is packed with pro-Israel figures or has a sprinkling of hardliners on China. For, it is Trump who will call the shots. Surprises could be in store in policy twists and turns. This should already give sleepless nights to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu whom Trump has sensitised apropos his intention to improve relations with Iran. To my mind, Trump may not even follow through his dramatic announcement of 'taking over' Gaza, et al. The pattern appearing with regard to relations with Russia is that Trump levels with Putin first and passes down decisions to the state department and other agencies to follow through. Equally, the mechanism of summitry is being revived as the locomotive of big power relations. There is already talk of Trump holding summit meetings with Putin in Saudi Arabia and with Xi Jinping. Trump will likely look for a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping at some point. Such an approach necessitates cutting down the role and influence of the Deep State which had throttled Trump’s presidency through the 2016-2020 period. The challenge facing Trump is formidable, given the nexus between the Democratic Party and the Deep State, and the mischief potential of mainstream media which is largely under their control and hostile towards Trump. In a glaring instance this week, Wall Street Journal deliberately misrepresented certain remarks by Vice-President JD Vance to vitiate the air in the nascent US-Russia tango. According to the story, Vance allegedly stated that the US might use economic and military leverage against Russia, and the option of sending the US military to Ukraine 'remains under consideration' in case Moscow refuses to resolve the conflict in good faith. Moscow immediately sought clarification and a rebuttal had to be issued by Vance himself to set the record straight. Vance wrote on X: 'The fact that the WSJ twisted my words in the way they did for this story is absurd, but not surprising considering they have spent years pushing for more American sons and daughters in uniform to be unnecessarily deployed overseas.' Trump has repeatedly expressed distrust of US intelligence agencies. According to CNN, all employees (approx. 22,000 people) at the CIA have received letters whereby they are given two options: to continue his/her service without guarantees of job retention in the future or to leave under the so-called deferred dismissal program at own request, while retaining salary and additional preferences until end-September. Interestingly, a code was sewn inside these letters that tracks the re-sending of the letter by the recipient, as a guarantee against leaks which was the practice used when dismissing employees of the former Twitter after its acquisition by billionaire Elon Musk, who is now considered one of Trump’s closest advisers and heads the quasi-Department of Government Efficiency overseeing the reduction of federal government! Again, the disbandment of USAID, which traditionally worked as the 'B Team' of the CIA to promote colour revolutions and regime changes, etc. can also be seen in the light. According to Vladimir Vasiliev, chief researcher at the Institute of USA and Canada of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who closely studies this topic, Trump has declared war on CIA, which he blames for his electoral defeat in 2020. Vasiliev estimates that so far, the fight against the deep state in foreign and domestic intelligence is proceeding steadily, but will now 'accelerate' with the confirmation of former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard for the post of head of national intelligence, and Kash Patel for the post of FBI director. On the other hand, the Delhi grapevine, which is dominated by fellow travellers of the defunct Biden regime is that Deep State will ultimately have the last laugh and Trump may not even be allowed to complete his 4-year term. But to my mind, that is wishful thinking. Trump’s grit should not be underestimated. Nor the seamless resources and tools at his command to queer the pitch of the disarray within the Democratic Party, which traditionally provided the requisite political cover for the Deep State. There is, conceivably, a method in Trump’s provocative moves, with some able help from Elon Musk and Steve Bannon, to stir up the pot in European politics, including Germany and Britain, who constitute the high ground of Euro-atlanticism in the continent, which serves to prevent a coalescing of liberal-globalist cliques within the transatlantic system. Patel has hinted that sufficient incriminating evidence of misuse of power is available to damn the Old Guard all the way up to Biden himself. Trump cannot be unaware of the high importance of pre-empting a Democratic backlash. The federal judges in Democrat-ruled states are openly challenging Trump’s methods. Suffice to say, Trump’s credibility to entrap the Old Guard in a cobweb of protracted litigation will be a game changer. The latest poll shows that Trump enjoys a soaring 77% support for cleaning up the swamp. The optic of this crusade is going to be hugely consequential to Trump’s ability to push both his domestic and foreign policy programme.

Trudeau: What Went Wrong, And What Lies Ahead For Canada? – OpEd	By Julia Taleb When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office in 2015, he ushered in a wave of optimism, diversity and inclusivity. His charisma and vision propelled the Liberal Party from third place to a majority government. Trudeau promised a progressive agenda centered on climate action, gender equality and reconciliation with indigenous peoples — a stark departure from the policies of his Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper. Nearly a decade later, Trudeau’s popularity has steadily declined. While he did fulfill some campaign promises, he fell short on others, and some backfired, leading to a gradual decline in public trust. Economic challenges, internal party divisions and a series of controversies gradually destabilized both Trudeau and the Liberal Party. His resignation announcement on January 6 marked the culmination of years of dissatisfaction. The economic toll A key factor in Trudeau’s decline was his government’s inability to address the economic anxieties of ordinary Canadians. Housing affordability became a crisis, with skyrocketing prices and limited inventory in urban centers. Despite government measures such as theFirst-Time Home Buyer Incentive, Trudeau failed to address structural housing issues. Canada’s inflation rate peaked at 6.8% in 2022 before gradually declining, while GDP growth languished at 1.3%. Economic uncertainty, driven by external trade tensions and domestic policy shortcomings, further fueled voter frustrations. Under Trudeau’s leadership, Canada experienced its worst economic growth in recent history, with annual per-person GDP growth averaging just 0.3%. Trudeau’s government overspent, leading to a deficit of $61.9 billion for the 2023–2024 fiscal year, far exceeding the target of $40.1 billion. This fiscal shortfall raised concerns about the government’s ability to meet its financial commitments. The final blow came in December 2024 when Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland resigned over disagreements about economic management and the government’s response to US President Donald Trump’s threats to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports. This move could raise prices for consumers and businesses, trigger retaliatory measures by Canada and lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth in both countries. Freeland’s resignation exposed deep divisions within the party and signaled a loss of confidence in Trudeau’s ability to lead effectively. In the weeks before his resignation, Trudeau faced mounting internal pressure as multiple Liberal members of parliament (MPs) publicly called for his departure, citing concerns about his leadership and the party’s future. For instance, Ontario MP Chad Collins stated that the Liberal caucus was 'not united' on Trudeau’s continued leadership, suggesting the party needed a new vision. These internal divisions, combined with declining public support, left Trudeau with little choice but to step down. In his resignation announcement, he cited 'internal battles' as a distraction, stating that Canada 'deserved a real choice in the next election.' Public perception and scandals Controversies marred Trudeau’s tenure and undermined public trust. In 2019, reports revealed that Trudeau’s office had pressured then-Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a major Canadian engineering firm facing corruption charges for allegedly bribing Libyan officials. Trudeau’s office sought to secure a deferred prosecution agreement for the company, allowing it to avoid a criminal trial. The ethics commissioner concluded that Trudeau had violated federal conflict of interest rules by attempting to influence the legal proceedings. Another major case was Trudeau’s approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, designed to transport oil from Alberta to British Columbia. It sparked widespread criticism from environmentalists and Indigenous groups, who cited concerns over oil spills and its environmental impact. The approval contradicted Trudeau’s earlier commitments to both environmental sustainability and Indigenous reconciliation, leading to accusations of hypocrisy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Trudeau initially saw a surge in popularity due to his steady communication and swift government support programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. However, his popularity waned as the pandemic dragged on, particularly during the Freedom Convoy protests in early 2022. These demonstrations, sparked by vaccine mandates for cross-border truckers, evolved into broader opposition to government restrictions, leading to blockades in downtown Ottawa and key trade routes like the Ambassador Bridge. Trudeau’s response, including invoking the Emergencies Act, was divisive — praised by some as necessary to restore order but criticized by others as government overreach. What lies ahead for Canada? Trudeau’s resignation marks the end of an era in Canadian politics that began with immense promise but ended with significant challenges and disillusionment. The Liberal Party must now grapple with internal divisions, voter fatigue and a growing appetite for change as they prepare for the next federal election. Two key candidates have emerged: former Finance Minister Chrystia Freelandand former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. They signal a potential shift toward a more fiscally conservative and economically pragmatic approach. Freeland brings political experience, a strong party base and a proven track record as deputy prime minister and finance minister. However, she must overcome Trudeau’s legacy and the public’s growing frustration with the party. On the other hand, Carney offers a fresh alternative with strong economic expertise and a reputation as a global leader on climate and fiscal policy that may appeal to centrists and dissatisfied Liberals. However, his lack of political experience and grassroots support are key obstacles. Currently, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, known for his populist approach, is leading in the polls. His rise suggests a potential shift towards more conservative policies, reflecting public dissatisfaction with the status quo rather than a definitive embrace of conservatism. Poilievre’s focus on reducing inflation and increasing housing affordability has also resonated with Canadians seeking practical solutions to everyday challenges. The Liberal Party’s choice of leader will determine whether they can regain public trust or risk further decline. The next election will not only define the country’s political trajectory but also test the resilience of the Liberal Party’s legacy. The convergence of political shifts, trade uncertainties and economic challenges suggests a complex path ahead of Canada. Whether Canadians embrace new leadership, reject the Liberal brand altogether or simply seek change, one thing is clear: The decisions made in the coming months will shape the nation’s future for years to come.

Turkmenistan: Second Conscientious Objector Sentenced To Correcti...	By Felix Corley A second Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector is serving a corrective labour sentence, where the state takes a fifth of his wages. On 27 January, a Dashoguz Region court sentenced 20-year-old Agabek Rozbayew to 18 months' corrective labour. The indictment shows he informed the Military Conscription Office in September 2022 that he could not perform compulsory military service on grounds of conscience. More than 10 others appear to be under criminal investigation. An assistant to regime-appointed Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa told Forum 18: 'I have never heard of such kinds of problems.' Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow is paralysed in prison hospital. On 27 January, Shabat District Court in the north-eastern Dashoguz Region sentenced 20-year-old Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Agabek Rozbayew to one year and six months' corrective labour. This means that while he does not have to go to prison, he must pay the State 20 per cent of his salary from his employment during that period. Rozbayew did not appeal and the verdict has entered into force, a court official told Forum 18. Rozbayew's verdict marks the second time since December 2024 that a court has convicted a Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector for refusing compulsory military service. On 18 December 2024, the regime imposed a punishment on a conscientious objector for the first known time since 2021, when 16 jailed conscientious objectors were freed under amnesty (see below). On 18 December 2024, Bayramaly City Court handed down the maximum two-year jail term to 21-year-old Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Arslan Wepayew. On 7 January 2025, Mary Regional Court changed his sentence on appeal to two years' corrective labour (see below). 'We are deeply concerned that this is the second criminal case against a conscientious objector in recent times,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. 'We are greatly saddened that, after a brief period of calm since May 2021, Turkmenistan has resumed prosecuting and imprisoning conscientious objectors, in violation of Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which it acceded on 1 May 1997. The government has consistently ignored the UN Human Rights Committee's Views censuring Turkmenistan for violating the ICCPR and obligating it to provide a genuine alternative civilian service not under military command' (see below). More than 10 other Jehovah's Witness conscientious objectors appear to be under criminal investigation, Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. An assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa – who did not give his name – told Forum 18 from the capital Ashgabat: 'I have never heard of such kinds of problems.' Asked why young men who cannot perform military service on grounds of conscience cannot perform an alternative civilian service, the assistant responded: 'I'm not a lawyer. I need to clarify this' (see below). Yusupguly Eshshayew, the regime-appointed Chair of the Mejlis (lower chamber of Parliament) Human Rights Committee, did not answer his phone each time Forum 18 called (see below). Since autumn 2022, Rozbayew has repeatedly received summonses to appear at the Military Conscription Office. 'Each time he was summoned, he respectfully explained his Bible-based beliefs and why he refused to perform military service,' Jehovah's Witnesses noted (see below). On 20 December 2024, the Prosecutor's Office summoned Rozbayew. Officials told him verbally that a criminal case had been initiated against him. On 6 January 2025, Shabat District Prosecutor's Office issued the indictment against him. The indictment – seen by Forum 18 - quotes Wepa Cholukow of Shabat District Military Conscription Office confirming that when Rozbayew was first called up in September 2022, the young man had told officials that his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness do not allow him to serve in the military (see below). Rozbayew's older brother Rasul was twice sentenced for refusing military service on grounds of conscience (see below). The 51-year-old Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow remains in poor health in strict-regime labour camp MR-E/16 in Bayramaly. He is one of five readers of the works of the late Muslim theologian Said Nursi jailed for 12 years in 2017. Three of the group are also held in the same labour camp (see below). 'Myratdurdy Shamyradow has serious problems with his health,' an individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 in January. 'He can't stand and is almost paralysed. Health care in the camp is inadequate.' His family have repeatedly asked for his sentence to be reduced. 'These pleas have been ignored' (see below). When in January Forum 18 asked an official at Labour Camp MR-E/16 – who did not give his name – about Shamyradow's poor health, the official put the phone down (see below). Shamyradow remains paralysed in prison hospital. 'He lies in bed,' the individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 on 12 February (see below). Asked why individuals like Shamyradow and the other Muslims have been jailed on long sentences, the assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Gurbannazarowa told Forum 18: 'I need to clarify this.' He declined to answer any other questions (see below). The 42-year-old Muslim prisoner of conscience Bahram Saparow is also held in Labour Camp MR-E/16 in Bayramaly. He is being punished for leading a Muslim study group in the eastern city of Turkmenabat. The regime arrested and jailed more than 60 of the group's participants from 2013. At least three are known to have died in prison of torture or neglect. At least four others are known to have been freed after completing their sentences. No alternative to compulsory military service Turkmenistan offers no alternative to its compulsory military service. Military service for men between the ages of 18 and 27 is generally two years. Article 58 of the 2016 Constitution describes defence as a 'sacred duty' of everyone and states that military service is compulsory for men. Young men who refuse military service on grounds of conscience generally face prosecution under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). This punishes refusal to serve in the armed forces in peacetime with a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment or two years' corrective labour. (Article 241 replaced the almost identically-worded Article 219 when the new Criminal Code came into force on 1 January 2023.) Turkmenistan has ignored repeated international calls, for example by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, to introduce a genuine civilian alternative to compulsory military service, to stop prosecuting and punishing conscientious objectors, and to compensate those it has punished. The UN Human Rights Committee has published 14 Decisions in favour of 16 conscientious objectors from Turkmenistan, all of them Jehovah's Witnesses. The most recent – in March 2022 – was in the case of Arslan Begenchow (see below). Jehovah's Witnesses filed a complaint with the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in May 2020 on behalf of 19 then-current or former jailed conscientious objectors. Legally-binding international human rights obligations The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has noted that conscientious objection to military service comes under International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Article 18 ('Freedom of thought, conscience and religion') and has recognised 'the right of everyone to have conscientious objection to military service as a legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.' The OHCHR has also noted in its Conscientious Objection to Military Service guide that Article 18 is 'a non-derogable right .. even during times of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation.' In 2022 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated (WGAD-HRC50) that 'the right to conscientious objection to military service is part of the absolutely protected right to hold a belief under article 18 (1) of the Covenant [the ICCPR], which cannot be restricted by States.' The Working Group also stated: 'States should refrain from imprisoning individuals solely on the basis of their conscientious objection to military service, and should release those that have been so imprisoned.' It added: 'All States should adopt appropriate legislative or other measures to ensure that conscientious objector status is recognized.' Second conscientious objector corrective labour sentence Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector Agabek Ruslanowich Rozbayew (born 1 October 2004) is from a village in Shabat District of the north-eastern Dashoguz Region. He refused military service when first called up in autumn 2022 and on subsequent occasions, most recently on 9 December 2024. He explained to Shabat District Military Conscription Office why on grounds of conscience he could not take up arms and swear the military oath. Jehovah's Witnesses are conscientious objectors to military service and do not undertake any kind of activity supporting any country's military. But they are willing to undertake an alternative, totally civilian form of service, as is the right of all conscientious objectors to military service under international human rights law. On 19 December 2024, the Military Conscription Office sent Rozbayew's case to Shabat District Prosecutor's Office, which launched a preliminary investigation and questioned witnesses. On 6 January, prosecutors issued the indictment against Rozbayew. Deputy Prosecutor R. Rozymuradow prepared the indictment, which was counter-signed by District Prosecutor Shyly Pellayew. They brought charges against Rozbayew under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'), according to the indictment seen by Forum 18. This punishes refusal to serve in the armed forces in peacetime with a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment or two years' corrective labour. 'The Holy Scriptures that Jehovah's Witnesses read state that one must not take up arms and participate in war, nor take a military oath,' the indictment quotes Rozbayew as telling investigators. The indictment quotes Wepa Cholukow of Shabat District Military Conscription Office confirming that on 9 September 2022, when Rozbayew was first called up, the young man had told officials that his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness do not allow him to serve in the military. Rozbayew tried to challenge the opening of the criminal case in court. Forum 18 was unable to reach Shabat District Military Conscription Office or the Prosecutor's Office. Rozbayew's older brother Rasul was convicted twice for refusing military service on grounds of conscience. Niyazov District Court sentenced him for a second time to two years' imprisonment on 16 March 2021. He was freed under the general amnesty on 8 May 2021. On 27 January, Shabat District Court convicted Rozbayew. The Judge sentenced him to one year and six months' corrective labour. 'He has been given the written decision,' a court official – who did not give his name - told Forum 18 on 12 February. This means that while he does not have to go to prison, he must pay the State 20 per cent of his salary from his employment during that period. Rozbayew did not appeal and the verdict has entered into force, the court official added. Under the Criminal Implementation Code, those serving a corrective labour sentence live at home but are assigned to a place of work. They must report any change of address or place of work within 10 days, and must report to the authorities twice a month. The place of work is responsible for making the deductions from earnings and handing the money to the state. Jehovah's Witnesses 'deeply concerned' over second criminal case 'We are deeply concerned that this is the second criminal case against a conscientious objector in recent times,' Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. 'We are greatly saddened that, after a brief period of calm since May 2021, Turkmenistan has resumed prosecuting and imprisoning conscientious objectors, in violation of Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which it acceded on 1 May 1997. The government has consistently ignored the UN Human Rights Committee's Views censuring Turkmenistan for violating the ICCPR and obligating it to provide a genuine alternative civilian service not under military command' An assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa – who did not give his name – told Forum 18 from the capital Ashgabat on 13 February that she was out of the office. Asked why two conscientious objectors have been sentenced to corrective labour, the assistant responded: 'I have never heard of such kinds of problems.' Asked why young men who cannot perform military service on grounds of conscience cannot perform an alternative civilian service, the assistant responded: 'I'm not a lawyer. I need to clarify this.' Gurbannazarowa's annual report for 2023 – her most recent available – makes no mention of any attempts to introduce an alternative civilian service for those who cannot serve in the military on grounds of conscience. Yusupguly Eshshayew, the regime-appointed Chair of the Mejlis (lower chamber of Parliament) Human Rights Committee, did not answer his phone each time Forum 18 called on 13 February. Court jails conscientious objector for two years Arslan Wepayew (born 7 February 2003) is a Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector from Bayramaly, Mary Region, east of the capital Ashgabat. In October 2024, the Military Conscription Office ordered Wepayew to report for military service on 19 December 2024. On 17 October, he submitted a written statement of conscientious objection to military service 'based on sincere religious beliefs', Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. He made clear to the Military Conscription Office that he was prepared to undertake alternative civilian service. On 19 October, prosecutors opened a criminal case against Wepayew under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). Formal charges were laid on 31 October 2024, but prosecutors did not inform Wepayew. Officials took him into custody on 13 November. On 18 December 2024, Bayramaly City Court handed Wepayew the maximum two-year jail term under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). Wepayew appealed against his conviction. Sentence changed to corrective labour On 7 January 2025, a panel of three judges at Mary Regional Court heard Arslan Wepayew's appeal. The court changed his sentence to two years' corrective labour, with 20 per cent of his earnings to be taken by the regime. This is the maximum corrective labour punishment under Criminal Code Article 241, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription for military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service') Wepayew was then released from the detention centre, where he had been held since November 2024. Forum 18 is unaware of any previous cases where a conscientious objector's jail sentence was changed on appeal to corrective labour, However, from 2014 courts punished conscientious objectors with corrective labour or suspended prison terms, rather than imprisonment. However, jailings resumed in January 2018. In May 2021, the regime freed all the 16 then-jailed known conscientious objectors. This was the first known criminal conviction of a conscientious objector in Turkmenistan since May 2021, when the last 16 imprisoned conscientious objectors – all of them Jehovah's Witness young men - were released under a general amnesty. UN Committee notes regime's failure to implement 2022 decision On 4 November 2024, the United Nations Human Rights Committee reviewed implementation of its March 2022 decision in the case of another former jailed Jehovah's Witness conscientious objector, Arslan Begenchow. The Committee had found that the regime had violated his human rights (CCPR/C/134/D/3272/2018). In February 2023, Begenchow's lawyer had noted that neither he nor Begenchow 'were aware of any steps taken by the State party to implement the Committee's Views'. The UN Committee's November 2024 progress report on individual communications (CCPR/C/142/2) reviewed how the regime had responded to the Committee's three key recommendations:- Expunging Begenchow's criminal record;- Providing Begenchow with adequate compensation, including by reimbursing any legal costs he has incurred;- Non-repetition, including by reviewing the legislation of the State party with a view to ensuring the effective guarantee of the right to conscientious objection under Article 18 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 'for instance by providing for the possibility of alternative service of a civilian nature'. In all three provisions, the UN Committee found: 'Information or measures taken are contrary to or reflect rejection of the recommendation.' The Committee noted: 'One Expert noted there was no convincing evidence that the State party had contemplated compensation of any kind to [Begenchow].' The Committee decided: 'Close the follow-up dialogue, with a note of unsatisfactory implementation of the Committee's recommendation.' Paralysed religious prisoner of conscience 'lies in bed' in prison hospital Muslim prisoner of conscience Myratdurdy Shamyradow (born 7 May 1973) is one of five Sunni Muslims punished for meeting with others to pray and study their faith using the works of the late Turkish Muslim theologian Said Nursi. The authorities arrested the group in May and June 2017. On 15 August 2017, Balkan Regional Court in the regional capital Balkanabat in western Turkmenistan sentenced the five men to 12-year jail terms each in strict regime labour camps. The court ordered that religious literature, mobile phones and cash be seized from them. The Supreme Court in Ashgabat refused on 11 July 2018 to overturn the 12-year strict-regime jail terms imposed on the five prisoners of conscience. Four of the five - Shamyradow, Meret Hydyrowich Owezow, Ahmet Bayramberdiyewich Mammetdurdyyew and Begejik Begejikow – initially served their sentences in the isolated top-security prison at Ovadan-Depe (Picturesque Hill) in the Karakum desert 70 kms (45 miles) north of Ashgabat. They were transferred in mid-2022 to the strict-regime labour camp MR-E/16 on the north-eastern edge of Bayramaly in Mary Region, where they remain. The fifth member of the group, Jumanazar Yuldashowich Hojambetow, is being held in the labour camp BL-E/6 in Balkan Region. The camp houses former police officers and other former officials. 'Myratdurdy Shamyradow has serious problems with his health,' an individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 in January. 'He can't stand and is almost paralysed. Health care in the camp is inadequate.' In view of his poor health, Shamyradow's family have repeatedly asked for his sentence to be reduced. 'These pleas have been ignored,' the individual told Forum 18. The duty officer at Labour Camp MR-E/16 put Forum 18 through on 8 January to a colleague. When Forum 18 asked about Shamyradow's poor health, the official – who did not give his name – put the phone down. Shamyradow remains paralysed in prison hospital. 'He lies in bed,' the individual familiar with his case told Forum 18 on 12 February. An assistant to the regime-appointed Human Rights Ombudsperson Yazdursun Gurbannazarowa – who did not give his name – told Forum 18 from Ashgabat on 13 February that she was out of the office. Asked why individuals like Shamyradow and the other Muslims have been jailed on long sentences, the assistant responded: 'I need to clarify this.' He declined to answer any other questions.

In Syria, The Barbarians Aren’t At The Gate, They’re In Power Wit...	Atrocities are being committed every day in Syria by the new rulers, according to Irish writer and peace activist Declan Hayes. However, the Western corporate-run media are ignoring or censoring the horrific reality because the Western governments backed the regime-change operation. He says that Syria – a cradle of civilization – is now being ruled by barbarians with the tacit support of Western governments and media. The population is living under a reign of terror because the new rulers are terrorists affiliated with Islamic State who espouse an extremist version of Islam that does not tolerate other religions or versions of Islam. Declan Hayes visited Syria as a peace activist and humanitarian many times during the decade-long war in that country. He witnessed the aftermath of atrocities carried out by insurgent groups in Latakia, Kassab, and Maaloula, among other places. These mercenary groups were proxy forces financed and armed by the United States and its Western allies in a covert war for regime change against the former Syrian government. The reasons for the regime-change operation were geopolitical due to the West’s support for Israel and antagonism towards Russia and Iran, as well as control of oil and gas resources. Hayes maintains close contact with religious leaders and other community figures in Syria, especially among the Alawite, Christian and Shia Muslim communities. He says that the appalling violence and killings that were carried out by the Western-backed terror proxies during the decade-long war are continuing to be inflicted today. Homes and villages are raided daily by armed supporters of Syria’s new ruling regime led by the de facto president, Ahmed al Sharaa, also known as Mohammad al Jolani, who is the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militia. HTS was formerly an affiliate of Islamic State and other Al Qaeda-linked terror networks. HTS seized power two months ago in Damascus after former President Bashar al-Assad fled the country with his family. Assad is living in exile in Russia. The collapse of his government surprised the world but in many ways, it shouldn’t have been a surprise because Syria was worn down and destroyed by a 10-year war sponsored by the U.S., European powers, Israel and the Gulf Arab kingdoms. The country was also devastated by crippling Western economic sanctions. Assad’s allies, Russia and Iran, could not prevent the collapse and takeover by the Western terrorist proxies. Syria is facing an extremely dangerous future where the new regime is exacting brutal retribution against minorities and communities perceived as being loyal to Assad. What makes the situation all the more grim is that the United States and European Union governments and their media are propping up the new regime, whitewashing its violations and its terrorist links, or simply ignoring the daily atrocities being inflicted. However, Declan Hayes contends that the new rulers of Syria do not have a firm control over the country where resistance to the reign of terror is growing.

Was The AI Summit In Paris A Missed Opportunity? – OpEd	By Simone Galimberti Since the start of the Paris AI Action Summit, held on the 10th and 11th of February, the expectations were minimal. Yet there was a trickle of hope that the gathering would succeed at maintaining a modicum focus on safety and security of artificial intelligence. Instead, the speeches resembled more business pitches. There was a deliberate intent at attracting billions of investments to spur the unlimited potential of a new technology that has already become so pervasive to our lives. Those at the Summit, concerned with the implications of an unregulated and unchecked AI could not find neither a glimpse of a symbolic traffic light nor of a guardrail, two images often invoked to slow down the crazy pace of AI development. Instead, in the words of Kevin Rose of the New York Times, it was like 'watching policymakers on horseback trying to install seatbelts on a passing Lamborghini'. Many wondered if there was a real intention, on the part of the policymakers in questions, to seriously set any standards at all. Watching their speeches, each of them, from JD Vance, the new American Vice President, to the European Commission’s President, Ursula Von der Leyen, to President Macron of France to PM Modi of India, it seems like they were trying to outmatch each other. It was like every single of them was trying to outperform the competitors, all generously offering free passes to the 'racing circuit' of AI development. Only UN Secretary-General António Guterres tried with his speech, to take the moral high ground. He remembered the audience of the high risks of a race to the bottom in developing and deploying AI tools that humanity, sooner than later, might lose control of. Wide gap Yet, at the same time, I can’t possibly imagine of a wider gap between the key messages emerged from the leaders and the discussions on the sidelines of the big speeches. Lots of cross cutting discussions related to the transformational shifts posed by artificial intelligence indeed took place. Listening to the pro business talks by the political leaders, it comes easy to dismiss the fact that the whole initiative was grounded over five underlying central pillars of absolute importance. Indeed, talking and tackling issues like Public Interest AI, The Future of Work, Innovation and Culture, Trust in AI and Global AI Governance, the key themes at Paris, remains central to ensure that the AI can be truly a force for good, rather than a force for self-destruction. But, as anticipated, these complex discussions were inevitably overshadowed by the political impetus of harnessing the business potential of the AI revolution. The United Nations, despite immense efforts over the last few years, to lead a global conversation on ethical AI development, appeared powerless, unable to steer the conversation. This happened despite the engagement in Paris not only of the Secretary General but also of active presence of Mr. Amandeep Singh Gill, the United Nations Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology. It is not that the two final outcomes of the Summit, the Paris Charter on Artificial Intelligence in the Public Interest and Statement on Inclusive and Sustainable Artificial Intelligence for People and the Planet, did not contain some references to the ethical imperatives that comes with AI. But even a sympathetic reading of them cannot flip the narrative of an agenda brazenly centered on deregulating the rollout of AI. Then how counter such intentional purpose of doing whatever it takes to incentivize the rushing to develop Artificial General Intelligence, a technology that, at minimum, will equal human capacities and, over the time, surpass them? The only hope is that the United Nations won’t give up on its moral mission to promote AI safeguards, achieving a global consensus on deploying the 'traffic lights', 'seatbelts' or any other precautionary tools indispensable for an ethical development of AI. The problem is that global leaders do not care about them. Only PM Modi, in his speech, spoke of the SDGs and 'to ensure that the AI future is for Good, and for All'. But then even Mr. Modi was taken over by an overoptimistic view that AI won’t jeopardize millions and millions of jobs but rather will be a multiplier of them. So, at the end of the day, it will be up to Mr. Guterres and Mr. Singh Gill to find a way to, once again, bring into the global agenda, the need of AI as a real force of good. Nice words delivered in international summits like the upcoming 3rd UNESCO Global Forum on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to take place from 24 to 27 June 2025 in Bangkok, won’t be nearly enough. Nor the upgrading of Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology into a new UN Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies (ODET) always under Mr. Singh Gill, as positive development as it is, will be sufficient. The UN needs a new bold strategy that should include an effective public relation dimension that, even if cannot match the prowess of Silicon Valley, can at least challenge the mainstream narrative so dominating in Paris. Involving and engaging big personalities like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei who did not hesitate calling the Summit 'a missed opportunity', should be a top priority. The propositions set in Governing AI for Humanity, the groundbreaking report prepared by the UN AI Advisory Board, must be fully taken into consideration and they should become policies. In Paris, unfortunately, it did not happen. If you look at them, none of them are even radical nor bold enough. The UN’s efforts for truly setting up common rules and standards and a global governance architecture for the AI must be re-thought, starting from a complete re-branding. Indeed, if we need business-like pitches, these should come from the UN. The stakes are too high for the UN to give up on its core mandate, saving humanity from the very probable and realistic possibility of AI induced mayhem. Simone Galimberti writes about the SDGs, youth-centered policy-making and a stronger and better United Nations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRanu0p5u7YVZ	2025-02-16T16:45:17-08:00	
German Elections Important For Middle East – OpEd	By Dr. Diana Galeeva Germany will hold federal elections on Feb. 23. Last week, during a discussion at Oxford University, a well-informed speaker who advises European governments responded to my question about how the results of the 2024 European Parliament elections may affect relations with the Middle East. He commented that the topic was not high on the agenda of the region’s countries. Arguably, the forthcoming German elections also do not seem to be on the agenda of Middle Eastern countries’ governments.However, this assumption ignores how Middle Eastern governments have been revising their international relations and I suggest that this should be regarded as a golden opportunity to plan and execute strategic policies toward the EU (and especially its traditional heavyweights). The bloc is struggling, especially with economic and immigration pressures, meaning new perspectives are more likely to receive a hearing.Now is the time for offering 'win-win' scenarios, when the Middle East’s energy-rich countries, with their accumulated experience of dealing with the most challenging matters in Germany (such as radicalism and terrorism), can boost relations between Europe and the region.Who are the main candidates in these elections in Germany and whose policies could Middle Eastern governments deal with profitably? What are their agendas and, based on these, what are the potential areas for collaboration?Briefly, there are five candidates who aim to become German chancellor. At this stage, Friedrich Merz’s conservative Christian Democratic Union leads the polls. Merz’s slogan is 'A Germany we can be proud of again.' He suggests restricting immigration and cutting taxes. He has also promised to boost Germany’s aid to Ukraine.Olaf Scholz, who has been chancellor for the past three years, heads the Social Democratic Party, but his government has struggled, largely because of the impact of the Ukraine war.Alice Weidel, of the far-right Alternative for Germany, backs the deportation of migrants and has suggested ending the sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine war. Meanwhile, the Greens’ Robert Habeck, who was vice chancellor and economy minister in the Scholz government, instead propounds strong support for Ukraine.Sahra Wagenknecht of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance suggests closer relations with Russia and offers strong support to her base in eastern Germany. Her policies include strict limits on asylum and immigration.In short, the candidates’ manifestos focus on the economic crisis and political orientation toward Russia, as well as possible reforms in immigration and asylum — all topics that are very much related with the Middle East.The German economy is Europe’s biggest, but these days it seems in need of revival. External actors, including Middle Eastern countries, have an unusual opening to provide solutions. The region’s energy-rich countries might be useful in overcoming several of the challenges that Germany is facing, such as its energy crisis, in addition to becoming key investors who could bolster the German economy in such challenging times. These mutually beneficial shifts could also be used for building diplomatic dialogue. Previously, Germany largely built its economic relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries based on non-energy exports, in the infrastructure, manufacture and service sectors. However, because of the Ukraine war and the energy crisis — which seems set to continue, perhaps not least because several of Germany’s chancellor candidates want to boost aid to Ukraine — Qatar and Germany in 2022 signed a declaration to boost their energy collaborations through trade in hydrogen and liquefied natural gas. And at the beginning of this month, Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power and Germany’s SEFE energy company signed a deal to deliver green hydrogen to Europe. Under the deal, Saudi Arabia aims to export 200,000 tonnes of green hydrogen to the continent by 2030.Another possible area for collaboration relates to the series of deadly terrorist attacks, including those in Mannheim, Aschaffenburg, Solingen and Magdeburg, which have put pressure on the mainstream parties to reform Germany’s asylum and immigration rules. There will be pressure on the incoming government to introduce new and effective ways to control immigration.Counterintuitively, at a time of increased social tension, as most of the suspects in these attacks are from Middle Eastern countries, I suggest that there are opportunities for the region’s moderate nations to build constructive relations based on their expertise on antiterrorism and antiradical reforms. Contrary to some populist narratives, violence is not integral to these suspects’ ethnic background, but a radicalization of it. Centrist candidates, in particular, might welcome dialogue that makes the discussion less binary and more political and human instead.The countries of the Middle East have strong experience in this regard, which might be helpful for Germany and the rest of Europe. For example, at the UN General Assembly in 2017, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the current UAE deputy prime minister and foreign minister, stressed his country’s resolve to fight terrorism, suggesting working together to eradicate the threat and its radical ideological roots. This becomes especially urgent with the implications of the Gaza and Lebanon wars.Finally, regional transformations offer further opportunities for closer collaboration. As a result of the Angela Merkel government’s decision in 2015-2016 not to close Germany’s borders to refugees fleeing Syria’s civil war, there are about 1 million people with a Syrian passport in Germany. Jens Spahn, deputy leader of the CDU, has suggested chartering planes and giving Syrians €1,000 ($1,049) to return to their home country following the collapse of the Assad government. Weidel has suggested that 'whoever in Germany celebrates ‘free Syria’ obviously has no reason any more to have fled.'Both the German and French foreign ministers have met Syria’s new leaders. Germany’s Annalena Baerbock spoke (guardedly) of Europe’s support for Syria’s transitional government in Damascus, stating: 'A political new beginning between Europe and Syria, between Germany and Syria, is possible.'It seems that, using the example of collaboration with a new Syrian government to deal with immigration and asylum, it could also be useful to form strategies and future policies with Syria and beyond. In other words, while acknowledging the failures and mistakes of previous German governments, it might be useful for the next government, in collaboration with Middle Eastern actors and stakeholders, to form effective policies toward immigration and refugee problems. This might set a good example for other EU countries that face similar problems.To sum up, the most challenging topics for German society today include issues that are closely connected to the existing resources and accumulated knowledge of the Middle East. These could be harnessed through 'win-win' policies. This is why the elections are important to the region and could prove to be a golden opportunity to cement relations with a troubled European heavyweight.

Europe Scrambles After Exclusion From Ukraine Talks – Analysis	By Frud Bezhan (RFE/RL) -- European leaders will meet on February 17 for an emergency summit to discuss Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine. The hastily arranged meeting in Paris is in response to mounting fears that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia will negotiate an end to the war alone, leaving Ukraine and its European allies on the sidelines. European leaders are expected to present a united front and discuss new proposals to support Ukraine and bolster European security. 'There seems to be a group of EU countries who are clear that they are not going to be part of a poorly designed and hasty Trump deal, and who are focused on continuing their support to Ukraine,' said Majda Ruge, senior policy fellow at the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign Relations. Concerns in Europe have intensified after Keith Kellogg, Trump's envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said on February 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in peace talks. On the same day, it emerged that U.S. and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia this week to start talks on ending the war -- possibly without Ukraine itself. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 16 arrived in the neighboring United Arab Emirates seeking to boost economic ties after attending the Munich Security Conference. He said he would later travel to Saudi Arabia, but Ukrainian officials said he had no plans to meet with U.S. or Russian officials there. Just days earlier, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Washington was no longer 'primarily focused' on Europe’s security, in another blow to the continent. The moves by Washington have triggered alarm and left European leaders on the continent scrambling over how to respond to what they see as Washington’s unilateral approach to ending the Ukraine war. But it is unclear if the continent can overcome its deep divisions and come up with its own concrete strategy to end the Ukraine war and deal with Russia. 'Europe has spent more time discussing, making statements, and making calls than actually putting its money where its mouth is and stepping up to give concrete support to Ukraine or to pursue any other policy of its own choosing,' said Ian Garner, a Russian expert at the Warsaw-based Pilecki Institute. European officials have warned that a hurriedly agreed peace or cease-fire deal will undermine Ukraine and wider European security. Europe is the largest financial supporter of Ukraine, even overtaking the United States. But it lags in military support, despite pledges to boost defense spending and arms production in recent years. With the exceptions of Hungary and Slovakia, there is broad support for Ukraine in Europe. But there is also disagreement 'Everybody is technically on the same page,' said Garner. 'The problem is when you actually look at finer details of the plans, everybody disagrees.' The creation of a European army is a prime example. Some European leaders have called for deploying European military forces to Ukraine to ensure security if a peace deal is agreed. But the idea has been rebuffed by other officials, including EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. 'All these European leaders are still trapped in potential maybes,' added Garner. 'Nobody has come up with a cohesive, comprehensive, and collaborative plan to say, ‘here’s what we would actually be willing to definitely do.’ And so, of course, Trump, Putin, and even Zelenskyy don’t take Europe seriously.'

Sudan, ‘The Most Devastating Humanitarian And Displacement Crisis...	Sudan’s ruinous civil war is approaching its third year, leaving a legacy of malnutrition, massive population displacement and chronic insecurity. As the UN system prepares to launch a call for record funding of $4.2 billion to support aid operations in the country, here are some of the main things to know about what has been described as the largest and most devasting displacement, humanitarian and protection crisis in the world today. 1) The war: 2023 Khartoum clashes herald end of peace process By the end of 2022, there were hopes that a UN- backed peace process would finally lead to a civilian administration in Sudan, after a tumultuous period which saw the fall of long-term dictator Omar al-Bashir in a military coup, followed by the harsh suppression of protests in favour of civilian rule. 'A final political agreement should pave the way towards building a democratic State', said former UN Special Representative for Sudan, Volker Perthes, in December 2022. Ominously, however, he warned that 'critical contentious issues' remained, not least a merger of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), separate military groups which had teamed up to depose al-Bashir. Tensions between the two sides grew in early 2023, marked by intermittent clashes, but the start of the current civil war came with the RSF attack on the capital Khartoum on 15 April. The fighting, which then spread to other parts of the country, forced the UN to evacuate Khartoum, and base operations in the relatively stable city of Port Sudan, on the Red Sea. On Friday, the Secretary-General, described the situation in Sudan as a catastrophe of 'staggering scale and brutality' at the AU's high stakes annual meeting in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, and warned that it is increasingly spilling into the wider region. The UN has strongly condemned the fighting, and the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy to Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, continues to support peace efforts, in close collaboration with regional organizations, including the African Union (AU). 2) Humanitarian crisis: More than 30 million need aid The war has been catastrophic for Sudan’s civilians and the numbers are staggering. Some 30.4 million people – over two thirds of the total population – are in need of assistance, from health to food and other forms of humanitarian support. The fighting has led to an economic collapse, sending the prices of food, fuel and other basic goods soaring, putting them beyond the reach of many households. Acute hunger is a growing problem. Over half the population faces high levels of acute food insecurity, and famine conditions have been confirmed in five locations in North Darfur and the eastern Nuba mountains. Famine is expected to spread to five more areas by May of this year. 'This is a critical moment, as the consequences of food insecurity are already being felt in parts of South Kordofan, where families are surviving on dangerously limited food supplies, and malnutrition rates are rising sharply,' warned Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan. Humanitarian efforts are severely hampered by the lack of security, which is putting severe constraints on humanitarian access, complicating the movement of supplies and endangering aid workers. Despite the dangers, the UN and its humanitarian partners continue to reach vulnerable populations. The World Food Programme – the UN’s emergency food aid agency – is saving thousands of lives every day and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) successfully distributed seeds to over half a million households during the planting season. In all, some 15.6 million people received at least one form of aid from the UN in 2024. The country’s health system is on its knees, with health facilities attacked and many health workers forced to flee. The World Health Organization and UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are still operational, supporting immunization for cholera and malaria, and deploying mobile medical teams. 3) Massive displacement: Equivalent to the entire Swiss population Huge numbers of people have been forced to flee their homes for areas of relative safety, both within Sudan and in neighbouring countries, adding to regional instability. Over three million people are classified as refugees, and almost nine million are internally displaced. The total displaced population is greater than the entire population of Switzerland. Because of the shifting frontlines, there have been successive waves of displacement, making the task of reaching those in need increasingly complicated. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, has described the situation in Sudan as 'the largest as well as the fastest growing displacement crisis globally.' The displaced population, whether they remain in Sudan or have moved abroad, face reduced access to food, scarce natural resources and limited access to essential services. In addition, outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and measles are rampant in camps for refugees and internally displaced people. Many of the surrounding nations have their own economic and security problems, and some are among the poorest in the world, with limited and overstretched services. Where possible, the UN migration agency (IOM) and UNHCR are protecting lives, supporting states hosting refugees, and ensuring that the needs of those fleeing are met with dignity. 4) Insecurity: Women and girls highly vulnerable Over 18,800 civilians have been reported killed since the beginning of the conflict, and the levels of violence in Sudan are getting worse. At the beginning of February, at least 275 people were killed in just one week, a threefold increase on the previous week’s death toll. Civilians are being hit by artillery shelling, airstrikes and aerial drone attacks: the worst affected regions are South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. As well as the general population, aid workers have been targets of intimidation and violence, with reports that some have been falsely accused of collaborating with the RSF. A UN fact-finding mission has documented a range of harrowing human rights violations committed by both the SAF and RSF, and called for investigations into the violations, and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. In an interview with UN News, Edmore Tondhlana, the deputy head of the UN humanitarian office (OCHA), explained that women and girls are the most severely impacted by the conflict, with reports of rape, forced marriage and abductions. 'If you look at the recent attack in South Kordofan, in which about 79 people were killed, the majority of victims were women and girls.' However, teenage boys are also at high risk. 'They cannot easily travel between frontlines. They will be suspected of spying,' added Mr. Tondhlana. Large numbers of children have been recruited into armed groups, forced to fight or spy against the other side. 5) Funding: Billions needed A lack of sufficient funds is severely limiting the UN’s ability to help Sudan’s population. UNHCR and partners have been able to provide less than the bare minimum of support for refugees, and food rations have been drastically cut, adding to food insecurity. On Monday, OCHA and UNHCR will launch an appeal for funding, based on their respective response plans to the crisis. Humanitarian needs have been estimated at a record (for Sudan) $4.2 billion, with an additional $1.8 billion needed to support those hosting refugees in neighbouring countries. Whilst the amount needed might seem large, Mr. Tondhlana emphasizes that, given the numbers in dire need, it barely scratches the surface. 'We’re trying to reach 21 million people, so this essentially $200 per person over the whole year. If we break it down even further, this is around $.0.50 per day.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRcr0OsSzQsSr	2025-02-16T16:34:36-08:00	
Kirill’s Crack About Critic Possibly Being From Western Ukraine S...	Until very recently, it was a commonplace among Western commentators on Ukraine that Western Ukraine, the portion that Stalin annexed to the USSR, was fundamentally different from the rest of that republic and even was the primary source of anti-Russian attitudes in Ukraine as a whole. But sociological investigations by Ukrainian scholars have shown that there has been almost a complete convergence in attitudes about Russia between Western Ukraine and the rest of that country (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2025/01/putins-invasion-has-led-to-almost.html). Consequently, talk in the West about divisions between Western Ukraine and Eastern Ukraine as far as attitudes toward Russia are concerned has become less common. But strikingly, it remains a prominent feature of discussions in Moscow about Ukraine and even appears to shape Kremlin views about how Ukraine might be partitioned to Moscow’s advantage. The latest example come from Moscow Patriarch Kirill who snapped back at a priest from Mozhaisk who said the church should be trying to help Russians find the way to Christ rather than to become better patriots of the Russian state and active supporters of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine (meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/12/are-you-from-western-ukraine). Kirill said that he’d 'never heard that before' and then pointedly asked whether the priest was 'by any chance from Western Ukraine?' The Meduza news agency reported that the hall 'filled with the sound of laughter and applause,' especially after the patriarch told the priest to 'go sit down and seriously reflect on what you just blurted out.' But Kirill’s remark is no laughing matter. Instead, it reflects both his unstinting support of almost anything Putin does and the belief both in the Kremlin and in the Patriarchate that Ukrainian opposition to Moscow is rooted in Western Ukraine rather than being part of the mentality of Ukrainians in the country as a whole. That has not only sparked suggestions in Moscow that Stalin made a major mistake by annexing Western Ukraine but also forms the core of Putin’s ideas about partitioning Ukraine where he assumes that without Western Ukraine, an eastern Ukraine annexed to Russia won’t be a problem (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2025/02/stepashin-says-stalin-made-major.html). That notion is almost as certainly wrong as it is widespread in Moscow, and that in turn means that even if the West stops supporting Ukraine and Moscow is allowed to annex large swaths of Ukraine to Russia, that will not end the conflict. Ukrainians in the east just like Ukrainians in the West will continue to resist whatever Moscow elites think.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRUR1Of0-r8cc	2025-02-16T16:31:00-08:00	
Bangladesh: Islamists Attack Book Fair For Promoting Women’s Mens...	Since Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge of an interim government in Bangladesh after the ouster of the Awami League regime , the country has witnessed a surge of radical Islamist activity. More than 250 Hindu and Buddhist temples, Christian churches and shrines of the Liberal Sufi Muslim saints have been vandalised and all institutions promoting liberal secular Bengali culture have been targeted. Even an annual fair organised in the memory of the legendary saint Lalon Fakir was closed down. Now the annual book fair in Dhaka, organised to observe the 1952 Bengali language movement in what was then undivided Pakistan, has been targeted. And the Yunus government, instead of clamping down on the Islamists have sought to appease them. The Annual Book Fair is one of Bangladesh's most cherished cultural events, where book lovers gather to celebrate Bengali heritage, intellectual freedom, and the power of ideas. However, under the rule of the Muhammad Yunus-led unelected government, the very essence of this festival is under attack as extremist forces tighten their grip on the nation. After months of violence against religious minorities, radical groups have now turned their attention to the book fair itself. In a shocking display of extremist Islamist fascism, Islamist militants targeted a stall selling sanitary napkins, branding it 'immoral' and demanding its removal. Instead of ensuring protection for the stall operators and upholding the rights of women and progressive entrepreneurs, Bangla Academy's Director General, Professor Mohammad Azam, chose to appease the extremists, recommending that the stall belonging to the Pran-RFL group, be shut down. Traditionally, the book fair has welcomed companies that support social progress, feminism, and health awareness. But under this regime, even essential healthcare products for women are being vilified in a disturbing push to erase progress in gender rights and public health awareness. The decision to dismantle the stall not only emboldens the radical forces but also signals the government's complicity in dismantling Bangladesh's hard-earned social advancements. The alignment of the Yunus administration with the extremist agenda is no longer subtle—it is open and unapologetic. By siding with religious radicals instead of safeguarding free expression and women's dignity, this government has shown that it is not only failing to protect its citizens but is actively enabling the spread of fundamentalism. As Bangladesh slips further into the hands of militant Islamists, the question remains: How much more of Bangladesh's heritage, rights, and freedoms will be sacrificed before the nation rises against this oppression? In fact, many fear that thos year , the celebration of 21st February ( locally Ekushe February) may be a muted affair. Bengalis remember the martyrs of the language movement who fell to police bullets on this day in 1952 . The Bengali language movement is seen as the starting point for the independence of Bangladesh from Islamist Pakistan. But under the Yunus regime, relations have sharply improved with Pakistan and there seems to be a conscious effort to play down the legacy of the Bengali language movement and the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. More than 700 Islamist radicals have either been released from jails or forcibly freed much before their sentence ended, even as the administration has been a silent spectator. Islamic State flags have been noticed in rallies or during mob attacks on libraries and museum which showcase the legacy of the Liberation War. Earlier this month, the museum in the ancestral house of Bangladesh's founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was bulldozed and destroyed. Many feel the Islamist groups who provide the muscle for Yunus' interim government are creating an environment to transform Bangladesh into an Taliban type Islamist Republic.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRWCGwBvgWqf8	2025-02-16T16:25:25-08:00	
Rubio: Hamas ‘Must Be Eradicated’	The U.S. fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Hamas 'must be eradicated' and 'cannot continue as a military or government force.' Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem at the start of a regional tour as the first phase of a tenuous Israel-Hamas ceasefire expires in two weeks, with the second segment yet to be negotiated. Rubio, on his first trip to the Middle East as the new top U.S. diplomat, told Netanyahu that 'as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.' Rubio is likely to face continued opposition from Arab nations about U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries and then for Israel to hand over the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the U.S. to own and redevelop. While U.S. allies and adversaries alike have assailed Trump’s Gaza plan, Netanyahu has welcomed it, saying that he and Trump have a 'common strategy' for Gaza's future. Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said 'the gates of hell would be open' if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel, without proving evidence, says it has killed over 17,000 militants. Rubio and Netanyahu met as the first phase of the ceasefire nears its end. In the second phase, the tentative plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. The tough U.S. stance aligning with Netanyahu’s position could complicate efforts to continue talks with Hamas, which, despite suffering heavy losses in the war, remains intact and in control of Gaza. Some of Netanyahu’s supporters in the Israeli government want to continue the war when the first phase of the ceasefire ends but resuming it could endanger the lives of the remaining hostages. Netanyahu has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile, but Hamas has rejected such a scenario. Meanwhile, despite the ceasefire largely holding, the Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Hamas described the attack as a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal. During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials. Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27, and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law. Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region. Rubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates was the leading force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with Israel during Trump's first White House term. Trump hopes to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S. defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRY41McruRy_8	2025-02-16T16:22:07-08:00	
Breaking Barriers: Can ASEAN Unlock Peace On The Korean Peninsula...	The Korean Peninsula remains one of the most volatile regions in the world with ongoing tensions between South and North Korea threatening regional and global security. Despite efforts for reconciliation summits including peace talks deep-rooted mistrust and political differences persist. In this context, ASEAN (Association of Asian Southeast Nations) holds significant potential to contribute and peace stability in the Korean Peninsula by leveraging its experience in multilateral diplomacy, economic cooperation, and confidence-building measures. ASEAN through its mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and ASEAN Plus Three (APT) can facilitate and promote dialogue, and economic collaboration and support de-escalation efforts. By engaging both Koreas within a regional framework that prioritizes dialogue and cooperation ASEAN can help reduce tensions and foster a path lasting toward peace. However, ASEAN faces challenges such as divisions political security concerns and the limitations imposed by international sanctions. Despite these ASEAN's challenges’neutral s and inclusive offers approach a valuable pathway toward progress on the Korean Peninsula. Economic cooperation initiatives serve as a crucial tool for building trust and interdependence between the two Koreas. According to 2024 a report by the ASEAN Secretariat regional intra-trade between ASEAN and South Korea reached $200 billion reflecting deep economic ties. However, trade with North Korea remains minimal due to sanctions. Despite ASEAN's potential to play a pivotal role, it can promote multilateral projects such as the development of tourism infrastructure and initiatives in areas like the Kaesong Industrial Complex, especially if sanctions are eased. Additionally, ASEAN + 3 which includes China Japan and South Korea could facilitate trilateral economic dialogues that incorporate North Korea into regional supply chains. Economic engagement has historically proven to reduce hostilities created by shared interests and ASEAN’s success in fostering regional economic integration makes it a credible facilitator. Confidence-building measures (CBMs) are another area where ASEAN can contribute meaningfully. The ASEAN Forum Regional (ARF) established in 1994 is the only multilateral security forum that includes both North and South Korea. In 2024, the ARF held its 31st session, focusing on preventive diplomacy and regional peacebuilding. Track II diplomacy, which involves civil society dialogues, complements Track I (official) efforts by enhancing understanding and reducing misconceptions. ASEAN's experience in resolving disputes, such as those in the South China Sea, can be applied to the Korean Peninsula. People-to-people exchange programs, along with cultural and sports diplomacy, can further foster goodwill. For instance, ASEAN's Youth Exchange Program in 2024 featured participants from both North and South Korea, fostering mutual understanding among younger generations. De-escalation of the Korean Peninsula requires addressing military and tensions security concerns. Can ASEAN promote transparency and risk reduction through joint initiatives such as management disaster exercises and military observer programs? In 2024 the ARF proposed a regional mechanism for crisis communication which if implemented could as a hotline for North and South Korea to prevent accidental conflicts. Moreover, ASEAN's principle of non-interference is advantageous because it allows both Koreas to engage without the fear of coercion. ASEAN's success in managing regional conflict, such as its role in resolving the Cambodian conflict in the 1990s, demonstrates its potential to mediate on the Korean Peninsula. However, ASEAN’s efforts are not without significant challenges. Politically the deep-seated animosity and mistrust between North and South Korea hinder dialogue. North Korea often views initiatives as multilateral with suspicion, fearing they serve as tools for international isolation. Additionally, within ASEAN there is a lack of consensus on how to engage North Korea. For instance, countries like Indonesia and Vietnam maintain diplomatic relations with Pyongyang while others such as the Philippines align more closely with U.S. policies. Economic challenges persist also primarily due to international sanctions on North Korea under United Nations Security Council resolutions. These sanctions limit ASEAN’s ability to promote economic cooperation restricting projects to engagement of humanitarian assistance. Security concerns are equally daunting with North Korea’s ongoing nuclear weapons program remaining a major obstacle to regional peace. In 2024 North Korea conducted missile tests that heightened tensions and fragile environment security. Lastly, ASEAN's interference policy, while a cornerstone of its diplomacy, limits its ability to intervene directly or mediate in Korean disputes. Despite obstacles, there are opportunities for ASEAN to overcome challenges that contribute to peace on the Peninsula of Korea. By strengthening ASEAN-led platforms such as ARF and East Asia Summit (EAS) ASEAN can sustain dialogue engagement between the two Koreas. ASEAN's economic engagement through humanitarian aid, educational exchanges, and public health cooperation not only circumvents sanctions but also fosters trust. Additionally, ASEAN’s ability to work externally with partners such as China the United States and Japan through the ASEAN+3 mechanism can enhance its influence and coordination in addressing the Korean Peninsula issues. In conclusion, ASEAN holds substantial potential to support peace on the Korean Peninsula through economic cooperation, confidence-building measures, and de-escalation strategies. Despite ongoing challenges like political divisions, sanctions, and security concerns, ASEAN's experience in regional diplomacy and its neutral stance position it as a credible facilitator for dialogue and cooperation. By leveraging existing platforms and fostering multilateral partnerships, ASEAN can help reduce tensions and establish a foundation for lasting peace between North and South Korea. The road to peace is arduous for ASEAN but’s consistent engagement and commitment to dialogue can play a crucial role in promoting stability on the Korean Peninsula.

Trump Lacks The Minerals For Ukraine Deal	By Aurélie Pugnet (EurActiv) -- Volodymyr Zelenskyy's rejection of Donald Trump's offer to trade US military aid for access to half of Ukraine's critical raw materials has teed up a back-and-forth neogtiation that could become key to peace talks. The US president has honed in on the mineral riches of Ukraine, just as he has done with Greenland. In both cases, he has used the US's military might to try and stack the odds in his favour. While he refused to take an invasion of Greenland off the table, in the case of Ukraine Trump has used military support as a bargaining chip to coax the Ukranians into surrendering vast amounts of their critical raw materials – possibly to the value of $500 billion, he said on Tuesday. But a deal has so far eluded even the world's most self-assured negotiator. Though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had initially signalled interest in an arrangement, on Saturday the Ukrainian answer was 'no'. A 50-50 deal in which the US would take half the country's raw minerals was unsatisfactory for Kyiv, the Financial Timesreported.Ukraine ranks in the world's top 10 suppliers of mineral resources. The main issue in exploiting them is that most of the deposits are located in the east of the country, close to or in Russian-controlled territory. Zelenskyy is, however, pressed for time when it comes to military aid – and not just because the US wants a deal done in 'days and weeks,' not months. At the moment, the country’s forces struggle to make any significant advancement on the battlefield, a pre-requisite if they are to have the upper hand in any negotiations with Russia. Zelenskyy is at a crossroads, as his army heavily relies on US military aid. The US provided 40% of all support last year, even despite the Republicans in the US senate blocking deliveries of fighter jets, air defence systems and long-range weapons.If Zelenskyy's efforts to entice Trump into a reasonable arrangement on raw minerals were sucessful, the floodgates could open for massive flows of weapons to Kyiv. According to the Financial Times, Zelenskyy is also interested in doing similar minerals-for-weapons deals with European countries, alongside the US. Europe has so far been relegated by the US to planning post-deal security guarantees, with no seat at the table in talks. A domestic bargaining chip Many of Trump's Republican allies have stood against more aid to Ukraine, in a nod to the views of their voting base. But the influential Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the mineral deal's major advocates, said on a panel in Munich on Saturday that a trademark Trump quid pro quo could see the American public get on board with keeping the aid tap running. 'President Trump can go to the American people and say 'Ukraine is not a burden, it is a benefit'', Graham said. 'They are sitting on top of a trillion dollars worth of minerals that we can benefit from… I do know [Putin] is going after the money, don’t let him steal what Ukraine has to enrich itself'. 'If those agreements happen, it's a nightmare for Putin because we have something to defend that we did not have before', he added. He did not explicitly mention the significant opportunity that such a deal would present for US industry – whose support is vital for the likes of Graham, up for re-election in 2026. Nonetheless, Zelenskyy seemed to agree with the latter part of Graham's assessment on Friday. 'We need to protect Ukraine and our resources,' he said. 'Why do we need to protect them? So that they do not fall into the hands of Russia and their allies.' Ukraine to compete against China and Russia? The critical nature of Ukraine's raw materials comes from surging demand as key components in vital technologies, especially for space, defence and electric vehicles. Control over those will give Western countries a major competitive advantage, especially against Russia and China. Despite the vice president's assertions to the contrary on Friday, the US administration sees China as the 'real' bad guy, said a source in direct contact with senior US officials. The NATO military alliance has listed 12 critical materials 'essential' for the defence industry, for a whole range of products, from fighter aircraft to missiles and submarines. Aluminium and graphite are on top of the list of at-risk supplies. China, the largest global and EU supplier of critical raw materials, cut off exports to the US of gallium and germanium in December. It already requires foreign importers to explain to the Chinese government how such materials should be used. Even though the US has alternative suppliers, Western countries are looking for reliable trade partners to guarantee them visibility in supply. When it comes to the environmental risks, they seem to be a secondary thought. 'If I have to choose between the threat of contaminating these territories with Russia or contaminating them with the byproducts of exploration of raw materials, I would definitely go for the second option,' former Ukrainian Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRadj5xVOforT	2025-02-16T16:13:42-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: Challenges For New Chairperson Of The ...	Saturday the 15th of February 2025 will go into the annals of the history of the Horn of Africa States region. It marks the election of the first leader from the region to become the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. It is the main office of the Union which manages and runs the day-to-day affairs of the organization, which brings together some 55 member states, the largest grouping of countries in the world. Djibouti’s Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali Youssouf was elected in a secret ballot and replaces the outgoing AU Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat of Chad. Mr. Youssouf was Djibouti’s foreign minister since 2005. He inherits an organization which has many bags full of troubles around the continent from its east to its west, from its north to its south and, indeed, in its center. These include among others the following main challenges: Streamlining the Regional Blocs H.E. Mahmoud Youssouf has ahead of him many challenges but the first is perhaps realigning the current regional infrastructure of the continent. He was elected on the basis of a set structure of the continent which composes of five regions – the Western region, the eastern region, the northern region, the southern region and the central region. Yet there are eight and growing other regional blocs, which sometimes overlap each other in the continent. This presents a confused map of the continent and complicates its administration, the job he is to do over the next four years. It looks mostly like quicksand the way these regions are structured. They include the ECOWAS of West Africa, which has now given an offshoot called the Alliance of the Sahel States. There is the SADC of Southern Africa, the EAC of East Africa, the Arab Maghreb Union, the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), and of course the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD), with a potential offshoot of this organization, the Horn of Africa States (HAS) region. Many countries are in multiple regional blocs, and this does not make sense, if one has to manage a streamlined organization. Economic Development The continent is said to be poor, but its poverty is not related to its rich natural resources both above soil and sub-soil and in its oceans and seas. It is mostly mismanagement, wars (civil or otherwise) and, of course, foreign interferences of different kinds, be it religious terrorism or mercenaries, and hypocritical aid. The United Nations reports that the continent holds some 30 per cent of all natural minerals, 12 per cent of all oil reserves and 8 per cent of natural gas. It is said to hold 40 percent of the world’s gold reserves and up to 90 percent of its platinum and chromium reserves (Al Jazeera.com – Mapping Africa’s Natural resources). The continent is home to some 1.5 billion youthful population which is still growing. These present themselves as both a large market and a large source of labor. It should not be a poor continent, and there it is, a more serious challenge for the newly elected and younger Chairperson. He has to work hard and put a lot of efforts in improving the economic status of the continent and bargaining for more reasonable returns for its natural resources in the place of dependency on foreign aid from other continents. There should be a revisit of the status quo. When the economic imbalances of the continent are corrected, the instabilities and the political upheavals of the continent will naturally disappear or be reduced drastically. It is all related to surviving from Dinosauric times to the present. Most troubles in the continent are rooted in the unequal distribution of the small economic pie that is currently available, as a result of mismanagement and wrong leaderships. It is where a common bargaining tool, the African Union, which he has just taken over, becomes a relevant organization than has hitherto been the case. It is a tough job ahead. Correcting the AU financing Capital is the original source of finance for any organization, be it private or public. Private businesses raise enough capital before they launch any business venture and public organizations raise capital through taxes to deliver the services they are supposed to deliver to a country. When there is a shortfall, different organizations raise the required capital and financing for a job through different means. Private business may raise capital and invite new investors through issuance of new shares or borrow from credit institutions at a price. Public organizations do also borrow or may raise taxes. International organizations are funded through the contributions of the member states, which should include a new heading in their budgets for the amounts they are supposed to pay and/or agreed that each country should pay and they should pay! It is a responsibility they have taken and they must fulfill their obligations. The African Union and many other African organizations are created in the hope that other countries will finance them not only for their economic initiatives, but even for their administrative machineries. This what has failed many African organizations, including the African Union. It is reported that approximately 75% of financing of the African Union’s financing come from foreign sources including European, American, and other countries. The 55 African member states hardly pay or pay little to the activities of the AU. How do they expect it to succeed in its endeavors? Do they expect the elected leaders, Mr. Youssouf, in this instance, to carry a begging bowl and go around the world to beg for more? This is a challenge, which H.E. Chairperson Youssouf will have to address, to ensure that governments in Africa should include in their budgets a heading with respect to the contributions they should be making and this should be a function of the financial needs of the organization, whether these are related to its administration or other initiatives on which the institution is working on. Financial independence of the African Union is a must. How much the new chairperson will deliver of the works in this respect will, of course, depend on how much effort he and his team will put on this matter. Avoiding the Old Pitfalls Most African leaders are kept busy on dealing with security issues, delivery of democratic values and other benign issues that do not add one iota to the lives of people. On the contrary, they only cause more problems. Should there be a better economic and financial infrastructure, better employment opportunities and educational and health services, most people would mind their lives and their businesses. It is when these are not delivered that volatility and violence, two issues which mark the continent, arise and keep leaders of the continent busy and occupied. The new chairperson would be well advised if he avoids these old pitfalls. He would also do better if he truly works on securing adequate and sustainable financing from the member states of the African Union. The member countries can provide such funding for they have the funds but waste it either on personal enrichments or other personal gains or in accounts beyond the reach of the continent in other continents – Dubai, London, Paris or Geneva and more recently in Shanghai and other Asian cities. Africa is a young continent when one looks at its population. The new Chairperson of the African continent should cater for the needs of that population. It is one of the main reasons the new chairperson was elected, as he was seen to be much younger than his rival from Kenya, more vigorous and more in line with the growing youthful population and leaders of the continent, who know what they want and have the capacity to attain and achieve them.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRWi-9s6TRpQW	2025-02-16T16:10:29-08:00	
Gaza: Which Country Has Best Claim? – OpEd	President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed reporters at the White House last week, during which the president laid out his plan for the US to 'take over' Gaza. The president elaborated further that his plan is to temporarily relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries during rebuilding efforts of up to 10 years and redevelop the war-torn enclave into what he described as the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Before Trump proceeds, the issue of which country has the best claim to Gaza must be established. The Gaza Strip (roughly the size of Washington DC) was occupied in turn by the Ottoman Empire until 1917 and the British Empire until 1948. It forms the smaller of two territories inhabited by Palestinian Arabs. The other is the ancient land of Israel (Samaria and Judea) – termed the 'West Bank' by the international community and inhabited by Palestinian Arabs. Subsequent to the creation of Israel by the UN in 1948, Egypt controlled Gaza for nearly two decades. After Israel's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War against 3 Arab nations which attacked it, Israel (having fought a purely defensive war) invoked its legal right (under customary international law at the time – prior to UN Resolution 242) to claim Gaza and the 'West Bank' as its territories. Israel, therefore, gained legal control over them. For the next 38 years, it controlled the strip and pursued the construction of 21 Jewish settlements there. Two Questions Before Trump proceeds, the issue of who has the best claim to Gaza must be established. There are two pivotal questions that must first be answered if Trump is to follow through with his plans for Gaza. An appropriate response to either of these could lead to his gaining legal control over that coastal enclave. The first interrogative deals with borders: What were the borders of Israel when it was first established? What defines this is the borders at the moment of independence. Israel was created, like many countries, after a successful war where no one came to its aid. In international law, there is a clear rule regarding the establishment of new countries: The country’s borders are determined in accordance with the borders of the previous political entity in that area. So, what legal entity existed before Israel – the British Mandate. And what were the established borders of the British Mandate? From the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. The UN General Assembly’s declaration on November 29, 1947, was a 'recommendation for partition' rather than an operative resolution. What actually defined the situation was what the Mandate did, and it neither accepted the recommendations nor put them into force. During Israel's War of Independence, Jordan and Egypt conquered territories from Israel illegally (by aggression – in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter). It was almost universally agreed that neither Jordan nor Egypt had any legitimate claim of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria (West Bank) or Gaza – Israel did. When Israel liberated the territories in 1967 – a fortiori – it renewed its control over lands that it had sovereignty over based on the original Mandatory borders and consistent with international law. Gaza and the West Bank are not occupied territories. These are lands over which Israel has sovereign claims. In fact, there are many examples where a nation has sovereignty, but it provides a uniquely different governing arrangement with one of its territories. One example is American Samoa. It has its own administration, but without independence. The residents don’t have citizenship, and they can’t vote in U.S. elections. The second question that could be answered affirmatively for Trump to proceed is: Does the UN recognize the inherent right of self-defense if an armed attack occurred and there is loss of territory by the aggressor nation to the defending state? The signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945 marked a turning point in the international legal order. Two key provisions of the Charter influenced the discourse on territorial conquest: Article 2(4): Prohibited the use or threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Article 51: Recognized the inherent right of self-defense if an armed attack occurred. While these provisions emphasized the importance of territorial integrity, they did not explicitly prohibit land acquired in self-defense. By remaining silent on the matter, this left land acquisition ambiguous, especially when defensive wars were deemed necessary to ensure national security. Customary International Law Customary international law, historically, treated defensive wars as an exception to the total prohibition on territorial conquest. A state acting in self-defense could retain captured territory essential to its future security. This view was used to legitimize territorial acquisitions following defensive conflicts. Despite the growing focus on territorial integrity, legal precedents before 1967 demonstrated the legitimacy of territorial gain in defensive wars. For instance: World War II Aftermath The Allied Powers justified retaining or redistributing territory for security reasons, such as the division of Germany and the annexation of parts of Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union. China and Tibet China asserted control over Tibet after a military invasion in 1950, formalizing its claim through the Seventeen Point Agreement in 1951 India and Goa India’s annexation of Goa from Portugal was defended as a measure of self-defense, reflecting how states could have territorial acquisition in defensive terms. Indonesia and West Papua Following military pressure and a UN-brokered agreement, Indonesia took control of West Papua from the Netherlands under the 1962 New York Agreement. Israel’s Defensive Wars The 1948 Arab-Israeli War offers a notable example of how international law treated territorial gains resulting from defensive wars before the Six-Day War. Following its War of Independence, Israel retained territory beyond the boundaries outlined in the 1947 UN Partition Plan. While armistice agreements established ceasefire lines, they were not recognized as formal borders but indicated a degree of acceptance of territorial realities resulting from defensive actions. As the only emerging state after the end of the British Mandate and based on the principle of Uti possidetis juris the entire territory between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean Sea is sovereign Israeli territory, according to customary international law. The Six-Day War marked a watershed moment in the discourse on land conquest in defensive wars. Israel, acting in preemptive self-defense, captured Judea, Samaria, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, and Golan Heights. The international response dealt more with political agendas regarding the Middle East and oil than any basis in law. The result was UN Security Council Resolution 242 – declaring the 'inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,' reflecting the shift toward a rejection of Israel's right to defensive acquisition of territory. Before 1967, international law treated the conquest of land in defensive wars with notable ambiguity. While aggressive conquest was increasingly condemned, defensive wars often provided a legal basis upon which states justified territorial acquisitions. Yet, even after 1967, there are several examples where the UN did not strongly condemn territorial acquisitions, even when they were framed as 'defensive actions.' These include: Turkey's Invasion of Cyprus (1974): After a Greek-led coup in Cyprus, Turkey invaded the northern part of the island, citing self-defense and the protection of Turkish Cypriots. While the UN condemned the invasion and called for a ceasefire, it did not demand that Turkey withdraw immediately. This evolution of customary international jurisprudence reflects a double standard in the commitment to territorial integrity, peaceful conflict resolution, and the rule of law. Understanding this historical trajectory reveals politically driven inconsistencies in sovereignty under international law. Yet, the answer to the first question is controlling and sufficient to provide the basis for recognition of Gaza as Israeli territory. A country’s borders are determined in accordance with the borders of the previous political entity in that area. Even with the subsequentpromulgation of 242, when Israel liberated the territories (Gaza and the 'West Bank') in 1967, it renewed its control over lands that it had sovereignty over based on the original Mandatory borders: From the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. Israel has the best claim to Gaza; thus, Trump needs Israel's acquiescence to legally proceed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWckDdWoF_cmRb9UNBIUD0HN	2025-02-16T16:07:27-08:00
