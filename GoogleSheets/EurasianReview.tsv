Guns For Hire: Private Security And Mercenary Industries In China...	By Sergey Sukhankin and Peace Ajirotutu Guns for hire are not a new phenomenon. The origins of mercenaries date back to the times of the ancient world. Over time, however, the essence of mercenary groups has changed substantially. Today, private military and security companies (PMSCs) from the West rarely directly participate in military hostilities akin to regular armed forces (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, October 14, 2022). Their main roles include rendering services related to training, providing logistical support, performing auxiliary functions, providing physical security and protection to individuals and groups, and conducting valuable projects, such as developing infrastructure (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, March 20, 2019). PMSCs in Russia, such as the Wagner Group or the African Corp, and the People’s Republic of China (PRC), such as Huaxin Zhongan (HXZA; 华新中安), China Security Technology Group (中国安保技术集团), or Frontier Services Group (先丰服务), however, operate differently. Russia’s involvement in the civil wars in Syria and Libya and creating regional conflicts and crises, such as its war in Ukraine, has changed this trend. Guns for hire employed by the Russian government appear to be a peculiar combination of the outdated Western private military and security practices and Russia’s own experience of using irregular formations from the Soviet period. In contrast, the PRC’s interest in private security has been less driven by geopolitics. It focuses more on the country’s mounting economic and trade interests in the Global South, where the security climate presents many serious challenges (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, November 20, 2023). This report examines the differences and similarities between Russian Private Military Companies (PMCs) and Chinese Private Security Companies (PSCs). Russian Mercenary Industry: From Marginals to All-Russia Phenomenon Russia’s use of irregular formations has a long and sophisticated history that goes back to the pre-1917 interim. During the Soviet times, irregular formations, usually military on active service working covertly, would be employed by Moscow for various operations and different capacities, including solving important geopolitical issues in countries of the developing world, especially during the decolonization process (see War by Other Means, April 12, 2019). Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the development of Russia’s private security (mercenary) industry took an unsystematic form, with the state playing a marginal role in the process (see War by Other Means June 25, 2019). Russian PMCs are designed for complex military missions and are fully state-dependent but operate illegally in Russia. In Russia’s criminal code established in 1996, mercenaries are defined as: A person who acts for the purpose of receiving material compensation and is not a citizen of a state participating in an armed conflict or military operations, who does not reside permanently in its territory, or who is not a person sent to perform official duties (Legalacts.ru, accessed January 31). This loose definition demonstrates the ambiguities of how Russian mercenaries and mercenary formations operate within Russia, particularly pertaining to the distinction between a mercenary as an individual and a PMC. Major transformations in the Russian PMC industry started to take shape in the period between 2003 and 2013 due to a combination of the following factors: The growing conviction of PMSCs being a foreign policy tool for Western countries. Among Russian PMSC experts, this conviction grew only stronger under the influence of regional developments such as the Syrian and Libyan civil wars and, rather surprisingly, the Euromaidan in Ukraine in late 2013–early 2014 (ru, March 11, 2016; TASS, December 27, 2023); The increasing presence of Russian corporations, primarily in the hydrocarbons industry, and state-related structures and agencies in politically unstable regions such as the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa; The demand for physical protection of Russian personnel and material valuables. Russia could not rely on regular armed forces to achieve these objectives to avoid direct involvement from Russian state forces abroad; and Russia’s increasingly assertive foreign policy. This called for the presence of PMCs in some of the regional conflicts without the Kremlin’s direct participation (Sukhankin, Hurska, Russia’s Private Military Contractors: Cause for Worry?, 2021). These factors contributed to Russia’s experimental use of PMCs, also known as mercenary formations, to jointly serve the state’s geoeconomic and geopolitical objectives without direct military involvement. Russia’s decision to rely on shadow and illegal formations stemmed from the determination to avoid Soviet mistakes, reliance on conscripts and regular armed forces, Western blunders, and exposure to media scrutiny. The Wagner Group is a prime example of this utilization. Since 2014, Wagner has influenced the Russian state both externally and domestically. The use of PMCs outside of Russia’s borders has brought mixed results. Between 2013 and 2024, Russian PMCs took part in numerous proven paramilitary missions and open combat engagements in the Middle East, in Libya and Syria; Sub-Saharan Africa, in the Central African Republic (CAR), Mozambique, and Sudan; Latin America, in Venezuela; and Eastern Europe, in Ukraine. Long-term analysis of Russian PMCs, particularly the Wagner Group, highlights numerous facets of Russian PMC operations. The successes of Russian mercenaries have almost never resulted from individual actions or the presence of any exclusive or unique competencies showcased by Russian mercenaries. Victories on the battlefield in Syria and Ukraine between 2014–2015 and 2023 and intermediary successes in Libya were secured due to: Support rendered to Russian mercenaries by regular Russian armed forces in the form of precision strikes; Collaboration with regional paramilitary structures and groups that complemented Russian mercenaries with unique skills and competencies critical for waging warfare in local conditions; Employment of detrimental yet situationally effective tactics that allowed Russian mercenaries to overwhelm the opponent; and The ability to employ massive resources, such as firepower and personnel, granted to the mercenary formations for achieving specific goals by the Russian state (Meduza, May 21, 2023; BBC Russian Service, August 11, 2021, June 10). From an operational point of view, Russian mercenary formations inherited a Soviet operational weakness. While successfully organizing guerilla/partisan-style operations in geographically and culturally proximate areas/regions, conducting anti-guerilla campaigns in more challenging operational areas brought mixed results (see War by Other Means, January 10, 2020). For instance, since succeeding in Ukraine in 2014–2016, Russian mercenaries have suffered notable defeats in Mozambique and, most recently, Mali, where their main task was to confront local militarized rebel groups conducting guerilla-style operations (see EDM, July 31, 2024). Additionally, in Sudan, when confronting Ukrainian special forces that also acted asymmetrically against Wagner forces, Russian mercenaries suffered notable setbacks (Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty, March 6, 2024). Russian mercenaries have demonstrated multiple weaknesses when confronting technologically more developed opponents. In addition to the decimation at Deir ez-Zor, Syria in early 2018 at the hands of US-led coalition forces, Wagner reportedly got battered by Turkish forces in Libya that were utilizing killer drones. Even in Ukraine, after the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Wagner’s successes were minimal and largely stemmed from large resources earmarked to the group by the state (Meduza, October 6, 2019; see War by Other Means, December 18, 2019; Radio Svoboda, June 10). Russian PMCs, sometimes summoned by incumbent regimes as a stabilization force, have failed to secure long-term stability or security for the hosting regime itself. Perhaps the best depiction of this is the situation in Syria as of late 2024. On December 8, 2024, the Asad regime fell after oppositionist forces captured Damascus, demonstrating Russian military formations’ falling capacity to sustain influence abroad. Since the beginning of Russia’s war in Ukraine, Moscow’s focus on and firepower in Syria decreased, creating an opening for rebel forces to gain a foothold in the country. Following the fall of Damascus, Asad and his family fled Syria and went to Moscow for asylum (TASS, December 8 [1], [2], 2024; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, December 8, 2024; Meduza, December 9, 2024). Domestically, the image of PMCs has undergone a remarkable transformation. Until 2022, the Russian state not only refused to legalize PMCs or acknowledge their existence but would severely punish individuals attempting to cover the activities of these groups (The Insider, August 1, 2018). When the Wagner Group openly joined Russia’s war in Ukraine and videos of then-Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin touring Russia’s penitentiary institutions in search of recruits became publicly available, Russian state media and pro-Kremlin propagandists praised PMCs (Radio Svoboda, September 14, 2022). Banners with the Wagner Group’s 'recruitment campaigns' appeared in all major Russian cities, and the group soon became a subject of talk shows, publications, and even popular culture. Following Prigozhin’s unsuccessful mutiny in the summer of 2023 and his subsequent death, the Wagner Group was essentially erased from the public information space, burials of the fighters became vandalized, and many were denied payment and veteran status (see EDM, March 3, 2024). This did not, however, end the Russian mercenary industry. The Wagner Group was rebranded, and many of its fighters either joined other PMCs or continued working for the remaining parts of the group, while Russia’s mercenary industry regained its shadow status with next-to-no mention of their activities in Russia’s public information space. The fall of the Wagner Group has given a powerful impetus to several parallel processes in the private security sector inside Russia. Russian society has experienced a notable growth in (para)militarization, which gained momentum after February 2022. This is primarily reflected in thriving militarism, glorification of brute force, and even praise of the penitentiary system and its 'laws' (poniatiya, понятия), which are, according to stalwarts of such ideas, frequently more just than official norms, principles, and laws (see EDM, March 3, 2024). The process of 'privatization of force' has gained momentum on three levels. On the regional level, heads of some Russian regions have formed (para)military formations of their own under the pretext of securing their regions. On the corporate level, many large Russian companies and corporations have acquired 'private armies' of their own, which is justified by their declarative determination to send those fighters to the frontlines of Russia’s war in Ukraine, but the actual goals are unclear and are most likely related to the need to protect their leadership and their interests. Russia’s state power structures (siloviye struktury, силовие структуры), such as the Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Rosgvardia, are actively hiring former members of the Wagner Group, who, because they are essentially mercenaries, are still outlawed in the country (see EDM, March 3, 2024). Additionally, there has also been a rapid spread of ethnic (para)military and mercenary formations in Russia. From a legal point of view, it is difficult to clearly define these groups, with their official status being 'volunteers,' which operate under the umbrella of the Russian MoD but whose ultimate allegiance remains somewhat blurred (see EDM, April 4, 9, 16, 30, 2024). The internal and external factors of how Russian PMCs operate highlight general features intrinsic to their formation. Russian PMCs and mercenary formations have mixed effects on the battlefield. First, their effectiveness is contingent on the use of other forces. When operating in an unfamiliar environment, their capabilities become drastically reduced. Second, they cannot fully become a factor of domestic stabilization. While effective in the short run, their ability to contribute to long-term stability is questionable when prompting an incumbent regime. Conversely, their use as a company outside the regime may contribute to growing destabilization and intensifying civil unrest. Using PMCs, mercenary, and paramilitary formations may pose an extremely perilous challenge for the Russian state. Such risk was visible in Prigozhin’s mutiny, which could have resulted in a much more serious (para)military conflict between mercenaries and the state, potentially leading to a civil war. Russian PMCs and mercenaries have contributed to the exacerbation of existing security challenges, such as smuggling and illicit mining, which in turn further aggravates the already unstable security environment. With Russia’s growing and inevitable decline, combat-hardened (para)military groups with blurred allegiance could become a factor in the Russian power struggle. Chinese PSCs: The Sleeping Giant The PRC’s global economic expansion, which was profoundly boosted after the launch of the One Belt One Road (OBOR; 一带一路)' initiative in 2013, now known as the Belt and Road Initiative, led Beijing to consider paying more attention to the physical protection of Chinese nationals and material assets abroad. As the OBOR Initiative has grown, so has the Chinese 'security for hire' industry. For OBOR, land-based operations are the most critical aspect, and the majority of these projects are located in the 'arc of crisis' area from the Indian Ocean to the Horn of Africa, increasing the number of security incidents involving Chinese nationals and assets (Asia Times, November 1, 2022; see Guardians of the Belt and Road, January 3, 2023). The Chinese Ministry of State Security noted over 350 serious security incidents involving Chinese enterprises between 2015 and 2017 (Asia Times, November 1, 2022). The increased number of security incidents among Chinese state-owned enterprises has created an issue for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). As argued by Alessandro Arduino, an expert on Chinese private security, safeguarding nationals across the world for China has become a cornerstone of the PRC’s foreign policy (Arduino, 'Testimony before the U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission,' April 19, 2024). It has also created a unique market for overseas Chinese PSCs to enter and provide security services. Historically, the deployment of Chinese armed forces abroad has not been an option, which leaves the state with three viable alternatives: (a) reliance on local security providers, through state mandate or the private sector. Given the OBOR regions’ political and economic climate and the severity of threats posed, however, this is not always realistically possible; (b) reliance on its own private security forces to render protection for Chinese nationals and assets abroad; or (c) reliance on a combination of the two approaches, which appears to be the most realistic option. The PRC is currently unable to rely substantially on its own private security providers, and this is based on three main factors. First, there has been an inadequate level of preparation. Despite its relatively long history and massive size as things currently stand, Chinese PSCs do not possess the skills and qualifications comparable to either Western PMSCs or Russian mercenary formations necessary for rendering high-quality protective services in areas and regions plagued by challenges such as international terrorism (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, January 3, 2023). These issues are largely due to a need for more educational training, especially since only a handful of Chinese universities offer security programs, a lack of combat experience, and the inability of most to carry weapons abroad, due to legal restrictions and as a means of avoiding deadly incidents involving Chinese security providers. Nonetheless, even Russian PMCs, battle-hardened and composed of professional military with solid backgrounds in regional combat operations, have showcased notable failures in Sub-Saharan Africa, where Chinese PSCs are also operating. Chinese PSCs whose members have not participated in regional conflicts or combat operations cannot effectively perform duties in such an environment. In this regard, using Chinese PSCs on the ground may become counterproductive. If they lack the necessary skills, they themselves could become a target of militants, tainting China’s reputation. Second, the position of the Chinese state does not allow it to rely on PSCs. In effect, the inadequate level of preparedness of Chinese PSCs for foreign missions may also be attributed to the reluctance of the CCP to cede its monopoly on violence to private paramilitary structures and formations, which would change 'the party controls the gun (党指挥枪)' policy (The Security Distillery, March 15). Additionally, the PRC is unwilling to repeat Western mistakes with the use of PMSCs. Similarly, Prigozhin’s unsuccessful mutiny in Russia might have discouraged the PRC from following the Russian model in its pre-2023 form. Prigozhin’s unsuccessful mutiny demonstrated how serious a challenge uncontrollable para-militarization poses and how easy it is for the state to lose control over such formations. This could make Beijing even more hesitant to empower its PSCs and turn them into either Western or Russia-type paramilitary structures. It appears that, as of now, the CCP does not want to let go of the gun, leading to the continual slowing down of Chinese PSC expansion capabilities, which they could be granted if they have greater autonomy from the party. Chinese political leadership has yet to decide how to use PSCs most effectively in a way that will also be less harmful to party and state interests. Third, the issue is highly sensitive in regional relations. For example, Chinese PSCs in Central Asia focus on protecting and continuing business interests and are not being used as 'military-political tools or instruments of geopolitical competition' like PMCs deployed in the area from Russia (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, February 22, 2023). Nonetheless, the military violence of the Middle East affects the greater region, and the radicalization continues to pose a threat to foreign investments by China in the area. Furthermore, Sinophobia has continued to grow significantly as China discriminates against its own Muslims. The news of Xinjiang’s forced labor has 'triggered protests in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, accompanied by demands to rid these countries of Chinese influence' (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, February 22, 2023). Pakistan’s reluctance to host Chinese PSCs suggests that even China-dependent countries are not proactive in welcoming Chinese paramilitaries on their soil, despite Islamabad’s strategic and overarching economic dependency on China and the building of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, February 23, July 14, 2023). Both Pakistan and Kazakhstan have high legal barriers to prevent Chinese PSCs from working on their territory. In effect, PRC efforts to place PSCs in those countries only contribute to the rise of Sinophobia in these regions, an outcome Beijing seeks to avoid. In other areas, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, deployment of Chinese PSCs is often met in a hostile manner by the local population, which still frequently associates foreign paramilitary formations with colonialism and the civil wars that erupted during the decolonization process (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, May 19, June 6, 2023). Furthermore, most OBOR projects in Africa are in high-risk regions, such as Nigeria and the Sahel, which are hotspots for extremist violence (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, May 19, 2023). The largest threat to Chinese nationals in Sub-Saharan Africa, however, is kidnapping for ransom. Nigeria is where Chinese nationals are most frequently kidnapped, yet it remains the area in Africa where most Chinese foreign direct investment goes. Even though Chinese PSCs are not supposed to be armed on the continent, they often collaborate with local security groups to provide armed protection to assets, leading many Africans to still have a negative image of them. On the continent, there have been controversies with Chinese PSCs, such as incidents in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, and Uganda, where PSCs have been accused of conducting unauthorized military activities and possessing military-grade equipment on foreign soil (Asia Times, November 1, 2022; Military Africa, December 1, 2023). As noted by Paul Nantulya, an expert on Chinese PSCs in Africa, African nations have yet to heal from the wounds left by mercenary activities on the continent during the Cold War. Moreover, multiple human rights violations by both African and foreign PMCs, such as Executive Outcomes, Sandline International, and Wagner Group, in addition to the horrors of the civil wars in Algeria, Angola, Liberia, Libya, and Sierra Leone, where PMCs and mercenary formations took an active role, further taints the image of private security providers, rendering them unwanted on African soil. On top of that, investigative reports have claimed that large Chinese corporations, such as China National Petroleum Corporation, are involved in regional conflicts by providing material support to pro-government militias, resulting in atrocities and violence against civilians (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, May 19, 2023). These controversies, however, do not mean that the PRC has abandoned the idea of using Chinese PSCs abroad. Conversely, Chinese PSCs are actively working in Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, November 20, 2023). Some Chinese PSCs include: Chinese PSCs in Sub-Saharan Africa HuaXin Zhong An (HXZA; 华信中安集团) Frontier Services Group (FSG; 先丰服务集团) China Security Technology Group (CSTG; 中国安保技术集团有限公司) Overseas Security Guardians (OSG; 中军军弘保安服务有限公司), established by the ZhongJun JunHong Group (中军军弘保安服务有限公司) Beijing DeWe Security Service Group (DeWe; 德威国际安保集团) Chinese PSCs in Central Asia Zhongjun Junhong (中军军弘保安服务有限公司) Huaxin ZhongAn (HXZA; 华新中安) Frontier Services Group (FSG; 先丰服务) China Security Technology Group (CSTG; 中国安保技术集团) China Security and Protection Group (中国安全保护集团有限公司) Chinese PSCs in MENA VSS Security Group (伟之杰保安服务有限公司) Beijing DeWe Security Services (DeWe; 德威国际安保集团) Chinese PSCs in Southeast Asia Huaxin Zhongan (HXZA; 华新中安) Frontier Services Group (FSG; 先丰服务) China Security Technology Group (CSTG; 中国安保技术集团) China Overseas Security Group (COSG; 中国海外保安集团) Shandong Huawei Security Group (山东华威保安集团) Hanwei International Security Services (汉卫国际安全护卫有限公司) Chinese PSCs in Latin America: China Security Technology Group (CSTG; 中国安保技术集团) Beijing Dujie Security Technology (北京都杰安防科技有限公司) China Overseas Security Group (中国海外保安集团) ZhongBao HuaAn (中保华安) TieShen BaoBiao (贴身保镖) Mexico-Chinese Security Council (墨西哥华人安全 委员会) See the Note below for an image providing visual information about selected Chinese PSCs [1]. Despite serious structural weaknesses inherent to the PRC private security industry and the CCP’s hesitations regarding the autonomy issue for domestic private security contractors, Beijing may decide to move toward strengthening its domestic and overseas PSCs by increasing their level of professionalism. The prospect of regional conflicts in the Indo-Pacific region and the apparent inability of local authorities, such as in Pakistan, to provide security to Chinese nationals and material assets on their territory could prompt Beijing to pursue PSCs further. On October 22, 2024, the PRC reportedly proposed establishing a joint security company to protect Chinese investments and personnel in Myanmar as a part of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor to the Myanmar military junta. This led some experts to believe that the PRC might go ahead with testing the 'Russian model' of protection for the paramilitary presence in the country and the ability to use local resources in Myanmar, creating a 'Chinese Wagner' (Geopolitical Monitor, November 28, 2024). Local experts have stated, however, '[T]he public perceives it as a breach of sovereignty, and even the junta would be uncomfortable with such overt Chinese involvement' (Voice of America, November 20, 2024). Russian PMCs vs. Chinese PSCs: a Comparative Analysis Although many analysts use the terms private military company (PMC) and private security company (PSC) interchangeably, these are separate entities, and especially when discussing the private security industries in China and Russia, the distinction should be clear. When China refers to overseas security companies, it refers to PSCs, not PMCs, while Russia’s overseas security companies concern PMCs or paramilitary groups. Most Chinese PSCs fall into two categories, 'security companies' (保安服务公司) and 'security companies engaged in armed escorting services' ('从事武装护送服务的保安公司') (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, January 3, 2023). The makeup of these companies includes a majority of employees and leadership, which are former PLA, People’s Armed Police Officers, and public security officers (The Security Distillery, March 2024). The primary similarity between Russia and the PRC’s security providers is their close ties with the state. After years of silence and denial, in 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin openly admitted that the Wagner Group was 'fully financed by the state,' which confirmed the findings of previous investigations (see Russia in the Middle East, July 31, 2018; Kommersant.ru, June 27, 2023). In the case of the PRC, the 'private' aspect is not truly private. Being fully in line with the saying 'as the state advances, the private sector retreats (国进民退),' all Chinese PSCs should be considered 'quasi-government security actors' (Asia Times, November 1, 2022). This is mainly because the '2018 Security Management Guideline for Overseas Chinese-Funded Companies, Institutions and Personnel (境外中资企业机构和人员安全管理指南)' states that overseas Chinese PSCs have to be either wholly state-owned or 51 percent state-owned (Com.gd.gov.cn, November 16, 2023). The main difference between Russian PMCs and Chinese PSCs lies in the issue of their legal status. Russian PMCs unaffiliated with the Russian government remain illegal in Russia, while domestic and overseas PSCs in the PRC are legal and regulated by domestic law (Gd.gov.cn, July 2, 2019). The nature of missions performed by Russian PMCs and Chinese PSCs differ drastically. Unlike Russian PMCs, Chinese PSCs have not performed complex security tasks or military engagements in a hostile security environment. In contrast, Russian PMCs were designed by the state to perform such missions. It is hardly a secret that Russian mercenaries, acting together with or in lieu of regular armed forces, have evolved into a tool of power projection used by the Russian state to achieve its security, geoeconomic, and geopolitical goals. Chinese PSCs, however, have yet to acquire such a status. Overseas Chinese PSCs focus on securing and safeguarding Chinese business interests, particularly those related to OBOR. Chinese PSCs, such as Beijing DeWe Security Services (德威国际安保集团) and Huaxin Zhongan (华新中安), employ 35,000 contractors across numerous OBOR-affiliated countries, including 50 African nations (Africa Center, June 15, 2021; Military.Africa, December 1, 2023). In contrast, Russian PMCs such as Wagner serve a broader range of clients and engage in paramilitary or mercenary activity (Voice of America, December 12, 2024). The number of employees between Russian PMCs and Chinese PSCs differs greatly, a markedly evolved criterion since 2022. The PRC presents a diverse, overinflated, and quite cumbersome employment pool. Chinese PSCs employ millions of Chinese nationals, ranging from army and police veterans to members of sporting clubs. Its domestic PSC industry boasts a handful of genuinely capable private security providers, which makes the industry’s size deceptive when measured against its actual capabilities (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, January 3, 2023). Its overseas PSCs’ C2 structure struggles, however, in most international environments and lacks professional skills. The root of this issue is that Chinese PSCs focus on hiring veterans. As of 2023, there were 57 million veterans employed across domestic and overseas PSCs. These veterans in the market negatively impact the sophistication of Chinese PSCs since these veterans may have the physical abilities to work in combat environments but need more professional security training and skills. Most veteran employees struggle with tasks such as creating risk assessment reports, writing new company security policies, or communicating with the locals (see Guardians of the Belt and Road, January 3, 2023; War on the Rocks, December 1, 2023). The case of Russia’s mercenary industry appears to be more complex. Before 2022, the industry’s members were counted in the thousands and were a compact core of battle-hardened professionals with an extensive military background and vast (para)military experience. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine changed this. Given a very high volume of losses and the state’s lack of interest in mass mobilization, the industry rapidly increased in size, encompassing tens of thousands of mercenaries, whose median level of professionalism plummeted drastically based on the nature of tasks they were to perform participation in so-called 'meat assaults' (miasnyje shturmy, мясные штурмы). Furthermore, the boundary between a PMC member, a 'volunteer' (dobrovolets, доброволец), and a member of a 'territorial defense unit' (otriady territorialnoii oboroni, отряды территориальной обороны), a member of regional or corporation-hired paramilitary formation, blurred even further. In Russia’s current conditions and realities, it is extremely difficult not only to calculate the number of mercenaries but also to define what a mercenary or a member of PMC is, given the state’s position on mercenaries who have now (almost) fully become integrated into Russian armed forces and enjoy the same privileges as do members of MOD (Kommersant, December 19, 2024). The operational regions are perhaps the only criterion where Chinese PSCs manage to demonstrate more impressive results than their Russian counterparts. Contrary to Russian mercenaries, Chinese PSCs’ operational areas primarily span gray zones, areas of armed conflict, and countries frequently defined as 'failed states,' and they often collaborate with local security providers. The table below summarizes the comparative analysis of Chinese PSCs and Russian PMCS in a visual form.

Conclusion In the case of Russian PMCs, despite the apparent setbacks suffered by Russian mercenaries both at home and abroad, there is every reason to believe that the industry will neither weaken nor disappear even if the war in Ukraine ends (ICoCA, April 11, 2024). Russian society has been experiencing an uncontrollable (para)militarization, with the state ceding the monopoly on violence to semi-criminal groups and formations driven by, among others, ideology and hatred toward the weak. This might become a very serious challenge to the Russian ruling elite should its war in Ukraine end in terms unfavorable to Russian nationalists (see EDM, March 20, 27, 2024). Furthermore, with the economic crisis booming, social malaises and frustration related to the poor state of infrastructure could lead to a social implosion in which the (para)military formations could become active participants (see EDM, August 20, October 16, 2024). In the case of Chinese PSCs, the PRC’s political leadership closely monitors the foreign experience in private security. As of now, it seems that Beijing is unwilling to follow either Russian or Western methods, especially in countries of the Global South that play a very important economic role for the PRC, and any incidents or further pressure to deploy Chinese PSCs could cause a rise in Sinophobia or paint China in a neo-colonialist light. Simultaneously, Beijing’s actions in pursuit of guaranteeing security for its nationals and valuables in countries of the Global South (along the OBOR in particular), given the worsening security environment, especially in parts of MENA and the India-Pacific region, will give insight into the future trajectory of Chinese PSCs. This said, the likeliest scenario Beijing would follow would be using a middle path. It does not seem as though Chinese officials would opt to follow the Russian approach in dealing with PMCs. In addition to structural issues that would be challenging to deal with overnight, the PRC is unlikely to be interested in breeding mercenary formations that would drastically degrade its international image and cause problems domestically. More likely, the PRC may continue with the approach that some of its PSCs take in Sub-Saharan Africa, MENA, and Central Asia by operating under the umbrella of the Chinese state and extensively collaborating with local security providers abroad to get around legal restrictions (Africa Center, June 15, 2021). The Chinese and Russian models for private military and security formations underscore the challenges of balancing state control, international perception, and operational effectiveness in utilizing private security forces for national interests. As global security landscapes evolve, the future of these industries will depend on their adaptability and alignment with Russia and the PRC’s broader strategic priorities.

Manila And Beijing Should Crawl Out Of The Dangerous Pit And Not ...	Tensions in the South China Sea continue to boil. Mutual distrust is fueling a risky action-reaction dynamic. Both sides are trying to prevent the other from perceived attempts to alter the status quo. Sensing that it is not getting much support from ASEAN, including fellow claimant coastal states, Manila fell back on its U.S. alliance, expanded ties with Japan and other extra-regional partners as far as Europe. The country opened its territory, waters and airspace for access, drills, and patrols with U.S. and other partners. This inadvertently brings Chinese vessels and aircraft closer to their American rivals, raising the specter of accidents and demanding stronger crisis management mechanisms. Maritime exercises and sails by the Philippines and its allies and partners in choppy waters are being met by similar Chinese drills. Notwithstanding efforts to de-escalate and prevent conflict, untoward sea and air encounters between Manila and Beijing become more frequent. Chinese ship presence in the Philippines’ western exclusive economic zone surged, intimidating local fishers and straining the capacity of Manila’s coastguard to respond. Chinese measures escalate from gray zone to actual use of force, moving from swarming and lasers to ramming and water cannons, all along weathering reputational costs. To compensate for its capacity shortfall and huge power disparity vis-à-vis its big neighbor disputant, Manila allowed an increased U.S. military footprint and allowed its longtime treaty ally to deploy a controversial mid-range missile system. These steps have yet to deter Chinese actions in the flashpoint. While China’s image as an intruder and bully plays into perceptions of the conflict, Philippine actions undoubtedly fuel questions about agency and proportionality as underwhelming diplomacy fails to halt deteriorating bilateral ties. Clash of approaches: optics and realities Experiencing a series of clashes raises the urgency of de-escalation. For the first time, three meetings under the Philippines-China Bilateral Consultative Mechanism (BCM) were held in a year. The 9th BCM hosted by Manila in July and another meeting between the heads of the BCM from each side held in Beijing in September helped defuse crises in Second Thomas and Sabina Shoals, respectively. BCM was a vice-ministerial dialogue platform established in 2016. While BCM in the past Duterte government was moving towards exploring practical cooperation, including a possible joint offshore petroleum undertaking, BCM under the Marcos Jr. administration has been preoccupied with firefighting, dialing down tensions after heated clashes. While Beijing and Washington have been improving military dialogue and communications, the same cannot be said about Beijing and Manila. This dearth of security talks is risky. Manila was a no-show at the 19th Western Pacific Naval Symposium held in Qingdao last April. It also snubbed Beijing’s Xiangshan Forum last September. In contrast, the U.S., Japan, and ASEAN countries, among others, were present at these gatherings. It remains to be seen whether a joint coastguard committee would be restored. A proposal for direct hotlines between the foreign ministries and presidential offices of both sides was also pitched, but with no action to follow up. The 10th BCM was convened last January 16 in Xiamen and both sides agreed to keep the provisional arrangement reached over Ayungin Shoal last July. Regrettably, domestic politics is complicating diplomacy. This is especially so as the past and incumbent presidents quarrel. Past deals with China entered by the previous Duterte government, including a so-called 'gentleman’s agreement' to keep the status quo in the flashpoint, were vilified for allegedly jeopardizing the country’s position. Duterte was criticized for allegedly downplaying a 2016 arbitration award favorable to Manila in return for economic concessions. The current Marcos administration is projecting that it is better at securing the country’s interests in the ongoing conflict. To his credit, Duterte got Filipino fishermen renewed access to the Scarborough Shoal, upgraded infrastructure in the Spratlys, invested in modernizing the country’s military and coast guard and raised the arbitral award in two UN General Assembly sessions without needlessly antagonizing China. At present, Marcos, while getting much praise, is in a tight spot. China intensified its presence in the Philippines’ western EEZ, interfered with resupply missions to Second Thomas Shoal, and challenged patrols in Scarborough Shoal. China’s 'monster' coast guard ship (CCG 5901) faced off with PCG’s largest vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua, in Sabina, and the latter was forced to leave the contested feature after being rammed by a CCG ship. Yet, for all the noise and posturing, the current Marcos administration also sought de-escalation. Noise and posturing, but talking A provisional arrangement for Philippine troop rotation and resupply (RORE) mission to Second Thomas Shoal reached with China last July. So far, it seems to be holding. Cases of disruption in RORE sorties to the low tide elevation were not heard since the deal was made. Manila may want to have a similar arrangement in other hotspots like Sabina (Escoda) and Scarborough Shoals. In Sabina, the Philippines may want a guarantee that China will not build structures or control the feature similar to what it did in Scarborough after a tense standoff in 2012. Sabina lies between Palawan and Second Thomas, and a rival claimant that controls it can interdict resupply efforts to Filipino marines stationed in BRP Sierra Madre in Second Thomas. Chinese control of Sabina is unacceptable to Manila as this feature is very close to Palawan, the country’s main western island facing the South China Sea. Manila worries that the dumping of dead or damaged corals in Sabina, which was reported last May, portends possible Chinese interest in occupying the low-lying feature. The Philippines may want China to accept the constant presence of its PCG vessel in Sabina with the understanding that Manila will not ground a ship similar to what it did in Second Thomas in 1999 or build a permanent structure in the shoal. China has not built any structure in Scarborough despite having a near-constant presence in the feature since 2012. In Scarborough Shoal, Manila wants its local fishermen to have unfettered access inside the lagoon, where there are more fish. It may be open to discussing possible joint fisheries management with China, including an agreement on closed fishing season, catch limits, and marine species prohibited from being captured. The 2016 arbitration ruling acknowledged that the shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishers. Duterte, in 2016, considered declaring it a marine sanctuary. Manila may also want to resume or keep its government presence in Scarborough through sea and air patrols. It may also want to keep delivering provisions, such as food and fuel, to its fishermen operating in the area. The maritime row has become a topic of concern for media in the Philippines. It has higher issue salience compared to other coastal states like Indonesia, Malaysia, or Brunei. Unlike China or Vietnam, the Philippine government does not have control over its mass media as the more popular outlets are privately owned. The domestic media is expected to keep a watchful eye on choppy waters and expose inaction or lapses by the government in defending Philippine interests in its waters. However, demands for transparency to ensure that the country’s interests are not being compromised have to be tamed, as most diplomatic negotiations are done discreetly outside the public limelight. Thus, trust in the leadership that will deal with Beijing is important. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Philippines-China diplomatic ties. It will be a pity to make the maritime row the centerpiece of that milestone. This goes against the interests and aspirations of their peoples and economies. In this Year of the Wooden Snake, the two neighbors should crawl out of the dangerous pit and avoid slithering into conflict. Better diplomacy and statesmanship should rise.

High Time Preference Is The Cause Of Increases In Long-Term Inter...	By Frank Shostak After closing at 0.54 percent in July 2020, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury Bond settled at 4.57 percent in December 2024. Some commentators believe that the massive increase in yields is because of a strong increase in inflationary expectations. Many assume that whenever the central bank raises the growth-rate of the money supply through the buying of financial assets such as Treasuries this pushes the prices of Treasuries higher and their yields lower. This is labeled as the 'monetary liquidity effect.' This effect is inversely correlated with interest rates. Furthermore, an inflationary increase in the money supply, after a time lag, strengthens economic activity, and this pushes interest rates higher. Note that we have here a positive correlation between economic activity and interest rates. After a much longer time lag, the increase in the growth-rate of money supply begins to exert an upward pressure on the prices of goods and services. Once prices begin to move higher, the inflation expectations effect emerges. Consequently, this starts to exert a further upward pressure on the market interest rates. Hence, by popular thinking, liquidity, economic activity, and inflation expectations are seen as key factors in the interest rate determination process. Again, this process is set by the central bank’s monetary policies, which influences monetary liquidity. The monetary liquidity effect, in turn, gives rise to two other effects. This way of thinking originates from the writings of Milton Friedman. The popular theory of the interest rate is not established from a theoretical framework that 'stands on its own feet,' but derived from empirical observations. In this sense, theories of the interest rate do not explain, but only describe. Furthermore, such a theory will not be able to explain the formation of the interest rates in the absence of the central bank. Time Preference and Interest Rates Individuals must necessarily give attention to maintaining their lives—basic needs—before consideration of more distant wants. Time is always a consideration in human action. According to Carl Menger, To the extent that the maintenance of our lives depends on the satisfaction of our needs, guaranteeing the satisfaction of earlier needs must necessarily precede attention to later ones. And even where not our lives but merely our continuing well-being (above all our health) is dependent on command of a quantity of goods, the attainment of well-being in a nearer period is, as a rule, a prerequisite of well-being in a later period. This means that an individual assigns higher value to present goods over future goods, to present satisfaction over future satisfaction. For example, consider a case where an individual has just enough consumer goods to keep himself alive. This individual is unlikely to save those goods for later, let alone invest or lend his paltry means. The cost of doing so would be too high, and might even cost him his life. Once the individual’s consumption goods start to expand, the costs of saving, investing, or lending starts to diminish. Allocating some of his goods towards saving, investment, and lending requires a sacrifice in the present. In order to invest, goods must first be produced and saved. In terms of capital investment of the lengthening of the period of production, there must be enough saved resources to sustain one or more individuals throughout the period. This saving enables the development of tools and machinery that, if successful, can contribute to greater productivity, efficiency, and enable further saving and investment. From this we can infer that, by restricting present consumption, individuals save in order to have more goods for the future, which can either be consumed later or invested. Furthermore, increased saving lowers the premium of the present consumption versus the future consumption (i.e., to the decline in the interest rate). Conversely, factors that undermine the expansion of saving are likely to increase the premium of the present consumption versus the future consumption (i.e., to the increase in the interest rate, all other things being equal). According to many popular views, changes in economic activity are positively associated with interest rates. However, if the increase in economic activity is because of the expansion of savings, this produces a decline in the time preferences, and thus to the lowering of interest rates and not an increase, as the popular framework suggests. Interest Rates and Inflation When money is artificially inflated 'out of thin air' and injected into the economy, this sets in motion an exchange of nothing for something. The earlier receivers of the recently-injected money can now divert to themselves consumer goods from the producers of these goods. In similarity to the counterfeiter, the printers and receivers of the inflated money can now increase the purchases of various assets, thus pushing their prices higher and their yields lower. This also has the consequence of artificially lowering the interest rate, misleading entrepreneurs about the seeming profitability of certain long-term projects. Genuine growth can also take place alongside artificial growth, but the inflation has distorted the price and production structure, leading to a boom-bust cycle. However, once genuine savings start to decline, and since inflation cannot continue forever, time preferences and, consequently, the market interest rate is going to increase. This will reveal the unsound long-term projects and investments, leading to the bust of the boom-bust cycle. A situation could emerge where the central bank attempts to counter a rising interest rate trend by means of injecting monetary 'liquidity' (i.e., inflated money and credit). This will ultimately make the situation worse. This is because the increase in the monetary liquidity sets in motion an exchange of nothing for something, thereby ultimately weakening production and economic stability. We can expect an oscillation of the market interest rates along the rising trend. The oscillation emerges because the central bank, by pushing the monetary 'liquidity,' temporarily lowers the market interest rates. However, the decline of genuine saving and the limits of inflationary policy pushes the interest rates upward, hence the oscillation of the market interest rates along the rising trend. In a free market, interest rates correspond to individual time preferences. Whenever individuals lower their time preferences, this means that they are signaling businesses to arrange a suitable capital structure in order to be ready for the increase in the demand for the consumer goods in the future. We suggest that a steep increase in long-term interest rates since July 2020 is likely in response to the sharp decline in the pool of savings brought about by reckless government and Fed policies. The fact that individuals pursue conscious, purposeful actions implies that causes in the world of economics emanate from individuals, not from various factors. Every individual assesses changes in various factors against his goals. It follows that neither monetary 'liquidity,' nor economic activity, nor inflation expectations are the essence of what determines interest rates. It is individual decisions regarding present consumption versus future consumption that is the key determinant of interest rates. Monetary policies only distort interest rate signals, thereby leading to a misallocation of resources, which leads to the boom-bust cycles. Conclusion The strong increase in the long-term yields on US Treasuries most likely mirrors a steep increase in individual time preferences. A key factor behind this increase is reckless Fed and government monetary policies that have severely damaged the process of savings formation. Contrary to mainstream thought, market interest rates are determined by changes in monetary 'liquidity,' economic activity, and inflationary expectations. In this framework, the causes originate from various factors, not from individuals. It depicts individuals like robots that mechanistically react to monetary 'liquidity,' economic activity, and inflationary expectations. We conclude that individuals’ conscious and purposeful action regarding present consumption versus future consumption is the key determinant of interest rates.

Taiwan’s Economic Growth Prevails Despite China’s Military Intimi...	By Chiang Min-Hua Despite China’s military intimidation, Taiwan’s economic performance in 2024 has been strong. Its economic growth at 4.3 per cent outpaced Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. Tension across the Taiwan Strait rose significantly after Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, a staunch supporter of Taiwanese independence, was elected. The number of Chinese aircraftcrossing the Taiwan Strait’s median line tripled in the five months after Lai’s inauguration in May 2024. Taiwanese businesses’ production flexibility, following the US–China trade frictions, explained how the island benefited from the vigorous external demand. Taiwanese firms moved part of their Information and Communications Technology (ICT) production capacity back to Taiwan after the United States imposed higher tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018. As a result, Taiwan’s exports of ICT and audiovisual products have almost tripled from 2019 to 2024. The growing ICT exports have been attributed to the US market. In 2024, the United States accounted for over half of these exports. Taiwanese firms’ relocation back to the island is evidenced by growing domestic investment and a declining overseas production ratio of all manufacturing industries — from 55 per cent in 2016 to 49 per cent in 2024. The overseas production ratio for ICT goods fell the most, from 94 per cent to 81 per cent during the same period. Electronic component exports experienced a 0.8 per cent decline in 2024. The US ban on selling advanced chips to China might explain the export drop. But the impact of losing the Chinese market appears limited as global demand for ‘made-in-Taiwan’ chips has remained. Private consumption also made a modest contribution to economic growth in 2024. Taiwanese consumers’ lack of threat perception might explain the limited impact of China’s military threats on private consumption. According to the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, 62 per cent of respondents considered China unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next five years, compared to only 24 per cent who believed that it is possible. Rising inflation also impacted Taiwan’s private consumption development. Despite wage hikes, real regular wages have seen minimal growth — a 0.45 per cent year-on-year increase between January and September — due to inflation. Soaring housing prices have held down private consumption and added risks to a potential household debt crisis. In 2023, Taiwan’s household debt-to-GDP ratio reached 90 per cent, higher than the United States, Japan, Germany and Singapore in 2022. Taiwan’s economic prospects appear to remain prosperous. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) will continue to drive Taiwan’s exports of semiconductor chips. TSMC’s share in the global foundry market expanded over the last year, from 58 per cent in the second quarter of 2023 to 62 per cent in the same quarter of 2024. It is estimated that the global foundry market will grow by over 15 per cent after 2026. Though TSMC has set up factories in Japan, Germany and the United States, Taiwan will still represent a significant portion of the company’s total chip fabrication. At present, Taiwan accounts for 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the company’s total chip output. Taiwan’s investment in China’s electronic parts and components manufacturing, which includes semiconductor chip fabrication, shrank to US$2 million in 2024. The overall investment in China amounted to US$3.6 billion in the same year, far behind its investment in the United States, ASEAN and India. China’s slowing economy, the ongoing US–China trade war, subdued property market recession, weak private consumption and greater state influence over private business made China less ideal for conducting business. China’s ban on certain Taiwanese agricultural goods and ongoing military aggression has also made doing business in China much riskier than before. While the ICT and semiconductor industries are thriving, the exports of other industrial goods, such as metal, chemicals, rubber and plastics, transportation equipment and optical and precision instruments showed negative growth rates in 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Taiwan’s limited free trade agreements and low-price competition from China and other developing countries explain their business struggles in recent years. Though the overall economy has been sustained relatively well, the over-reliance on the tech industry for economic growth has enlarged inter-sectoral income inequality. Over the last two decades, the average monthly salary in the ICT industry grew by 48 per cent, far more than the 26 per cent increase in the services and manufacturing industries. But despite higher salaries, the ICT industry only accounts for 11 per cent of total employment. To alleviate growing income inequality the government almost doubled its social welfare expenditure over the last decade. With an aging population, government expenditure on social welfare is expected to grow even more. The government will also have to raise its defence budget in the face of China’s military threats. More economic growth will be needed to mitigate the impact of imbalanced industrial development on social inequality and defend the nation’s economic autonomy and political sovereignty. But with the Trump administration potentially introducing extra levies on all imports, including Taiwanese products, the island’s export-oriented economic prospects look uncertain. The Legislative Yuan’s recent freeze of Taiwan’s defence budget will cripple Taiwan even more in financing its own defence. Economic growth and strong national defence complement each other. While a resilient economy could sustain national defense expenditure in the long run, a strong defensive capability will improve business confidence and promote economic prosperity. Without either of them, Taiwan would risk having a bleak future.

Reset Of India-Indonesia Relations (Part II) – Analysis	When the Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto joined as the chief guest at India’s Republic Day celebration on 26 January 2025, it became his first trip to India as the head of state and fourth Indonesian leader to be chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations. For record, President Suharto was the chief guest at the first Republic Day in 1950, the others being Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (2011) and Joko Widodo (2018) along with other ASEAN leaders. Both the leaders Prabowo and Prime Minister Narebdra Modi used the opportunity to discuss bilateral issues to deepen the relationship. Issues such as security, energy security, security, defence and security cooperation dominated the discussion. Other issues included trade and investment, healthcare and digital technologies. Several MoUs and announcements were finalised. Prabowo participated in a Forum as part of effort to enhance trade and investment. During the discussion, India pledged to support the Southeast Asian nations defence modernisation programme through experience and expertise sharing, besides taking steps to resolve outstanding tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Other areas covered in the discussion were counter terrorism, health and pharmaceuticals, food security, infrastructure and connectivity, science and technology, space cooperation, education and skill development, climate change and disaster resilience and Indo-Pacific initiatives. BrahMos Missile The most significant take-away of Prabowo’s visit was Indonesia’s interest in acquiring the BrahMos missile system from India. Both sides reached a broad understanding on the pricing of the deal, expected to be worth around $450 million. As a goodwill gesture, India briefed a top level Indonesian team about BrahMos Missile when it visited the BrahMos Aerospace headquarters and was briefed on the capabilities of the supersonic cruise missile. The delegation was led by Navy chief Admiral Muhammad Ali. During the visit, he interacted with Dr. Jaiteerth R. Joshi and senior officials from the JV enterprise. The delegation was apprised of supersonic BrahMos weapon system and its formidable capabilities. The BrahMos missile is an Indo-Russian joint venture. If the deal goes ahead, Indonesia will become the second foreign buyer of the missile after the Philippines. In January 2022, India signed a deal worth almost $375 million to equip the Philippine Marines with three batteries of the missiles. The development came at a time when Indonesia was engaged in negotiations with India to acquire the missile system. The weapons showcased during the ceremonial parade witnessed by Prabowo included the BrahMos missiles. The parade included a 160-member Indonesian military marching contingent and 190-member band contingent from that country. With its conventional precision-strike capabilities the BrahMos missiles has become the mainstay of the Indian armed forces. Defence cooperation is being expanded as both India and Indonesia find synergy in the wake of the need to establish peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. A high-level delegation from Indonesia is likely to visit India soon to fast-track defence collaboration following the ratification of a bilateral defence cooperation agreement. Prime Minister assured the visiting leader of Indonesia that that the two countries shall work together in defence manufacturing and supply chains. In April 2024, India delivered the first batch of BrahMos missiles and launchers to the Philippines. BrahMos is the fastest cruise missile in the world with a speed of Mach2.8, nearly three times the speed of sound. BrahMos variants can be launched from land, air and sea, and all three variants are in service with the Indian armed forces. The ones being exported to the Philippines can strike targets at 290 km, though India has also developed another variant with a range of almost 500 km. South China Sea issue Amid tensions in South China Sea, Modi and Prabowo reaffirmed the importance of maintaining and promoting peace, stability, maritime safety and security, freedom of navigation and over-flight in the region and other lawful use of the sea, including unimpeded lawful maritime commerce. In a joint statement issued a day after the bilateral meeting, they also sought peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). They supported the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) in its entirety and look forward to the early conclusion of an effective and substantive Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) that is in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS. Both Modi and Prabowo agreed to continue their combined efforts for safety of navigation in Straits of Malacca and Singapore through existing mechanism to enable unhindered economic growth of the region. Defence cooperation also embraced manufacturing opening the path for further expansion in the defence sector. Both the leaders agreed that the defence ministers of both countries shall have a meeting soon to discuss implementation of Cooperation in the field of Defence agreement (DCA). India agreed to support the ongoing defence modernisation programmes of Indonesia through experience and expertise sharing. Both also strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing cooperation in combating this threat through bilateral and multilateral initiatives. Both the leaders also underscored the importance of strengthening global efforts to combat terrorism, including eliminating terror financing and preventing recruitment of terrorists, without any double standards. Both emphasised the need for all countries to work collectively to deny safe havens and support network terrorist groups, in accordance with international obligations and commitments. Recognising the evolving nature of security challenges, the two leaders agreed to work together in preventing the spread of online radicalisation and strengthening mechanisms to counter extremist ideologies. It was heightening that Prabowo sought Indian participation in Indonesian projects ranging from the setting up of tertiary and specialist hospitals to the development of Sabang port in Aceh province.

Reset Of India-Indonesia Relations (Part I) – Analysis	In this year’s 76th Republic Day celebration on 26 January, India invited the President of Indonesia Prabowo Subianto to be the Chief Guest. Indeed it was a strategic move on the part of Narendra Modi government to engage with the Southeast Asian nation with the largest Muslim population in the world, thereby deepen cooperation with the members of the ASEAN bloc. It transpired that energy, food security, defence and security ties emerged the centrepiece of discussion. Both sides are aware that their engagements both bilaterally on issues of trade and maritime security and on the global stage through forums such as the G-20 and minilaterals such as the India-Australia-Indonesia group have brought the two countries into a closer complementary and mutually beneficial partnership. This two-part article shall address two separate issues in order to posit India-Indonesia partnership in perspective. The first part dwells on Prabowo’s handling of the domestic situation as the success or failure of his measures shall impact his foreign policy and relations with Indonesia’s partner countries. The second part examines the outcome of Prabowo’s India visit and what it brought to the table for providing dividends to both sides. The initial evaluation of Prabowo policy choices raises the questions on his over-reliance on the military to sustain his democratic structure. By making his choice of officials in critical positions, the President has given the people the reason to worry if the political culture of the past authoritarian leader Gen Suharto who fell from power three decades back is making a re-run. There are enough signs in peoples’ unease that see a flashback of Suharto in Prabowo turning to the once-all powerful military to carry out governing vision. Probowo was Indonesia’s former defence minister. People now suspect that as President he would be replacing civilian functions with the military, thereby raising comparison to the Suharto-era doctrine called dwifungsi (dual function) that allowed the armed forces to crush dissent and dominant public life. The fears of the people are not without reasons. After Probowo stormed into the highest office of Presidency only three months ago with a landslide election victory, he quickly expanded the armed forces’ roles in several public areas, including running much of his flagship project to serve free school meals. For now Probowo has the support of the allies. The allies in parliament are also preparing legislation that would allow Prabowo to appoint active military officers into senior government positions, dismantling some of the safeguards put in place after Suharto was overthrown in 1998 following an economic crisis and popular uprising. Since Prabowo's resounding victory in last year's election was largely driven by younger voters, a generation with little or no memory of Suharto's military-backed 'New Order' regime, Probowo feels emboldened of facing the opposition. As the former son-in-law of Suharto, Prabowo was a special forces commander under Suharto’s repressive 32-year reign and was later dismissed from the military amid unproven allegations of human rights abuses. Supporters of Prabowo, who denied past rights abuses, say tapping the military for important projects offers efficiencies. Critics have noticed Prabowo's recent moves, including a recent expansion of military command structure. This is a worrying lurch towards remilitarization in the world's largest Muslim-majority country. Critics questioning that Prabowo is not abiding by civil supremacy read, he wants to restore the glory of military, where various kinds of civic-works can be done by the military as he feels those would be faster and more effective. Although not replicating the 'dual function' of the past, Prabowo's early reliance on the military is raising concerns among Indonesian observers about the undoing of democratic reforms that sprang up after Suharto was ousted. Analysts suspect many of Prabowo’s actions replicate what existed under his former father-in-law Suharto. Under Suharto, there were no checks and balances. The military was also involved in business. The same pattern chosen by Prabowo now could erode democratic oversight of government institutions, affecting policymaking. During his first 100 days in office, Prabowo enjoyed 91 per cent approval ratings. That is being dissipated after the armed forces started taking charge to handle large projects. In the past three months that Prabowo has been in office, he has handed over large projects to the armed forces, the most visible example being the $28 billion signature project to provide free meals. Air Force Col. Satrya Dharma Wijaya is a case in point. His usual job is aircraft maintenance, but since November he has been busy ordering stoves, refrigerators and frying pans to cook meals for thousands of children at a base in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta. The military is now running 100 of the 190 kitchens operating by the project's launch in collaboration with the newly formed National Nutrition Agency, cooking up and delivering food for 570,000 children. A plan is underway for the military to form 100 special 'territorial development' units assigned to farming, fisheries and animal husbandry. Prabowo has also moved swiftly to vastly expand other military-run projects established when he was defense minister. Prabowo has also developed a program whereby soldiers are required to clear land for cultivation. This has increased fiftyfold boosting Indonesia's food security from an initial 60,000 hectares to a projected 3 million hectares — an area about the size of Belgium. He has also ordered the expansion of another of his projects, directing the Air Force to convert its idle land into rice and corn fields to be managed by soldiers and villagers to supply food for the free-meals project. Other projects include nationwide extension of a small military civil-works initiative involving laying water pipes for plumbing irrigation in remote areas. With military background, Prabowo justifies that turning to soldiers to help run large programs is effective, as according to him army follows a strong chain of command and that rules are in place to prevent military repression. The peoples are assured that there is no question of a return to the New Order of the Suharto era. Be that as it may, the key area of concern remains when legislation as planned are passed allowing Prabowo to appoint active duty military officers to top government jobs for the first time in decades. Since the President’s coalition controls 74 per cent of seats in parliament, passing of the law would not be difficult. The president has already tapped former military officers for top roles — such as Foreign Minister Sugiono, who served in the army's special force before retiring. Prabowo's Gerindra party would be free to appoint active officers anywhere in government. If such strategic programs that are normally run by the persons who are disciplined and experienced are to be passed on to the military, this would indicate a return to the Suharto era and murder of democracy. The fear of militarisation under Prabowo with centralisation of power would mean democratic backsliding.

US-Baltic Defense Partnerships: A Return On Investment – Analysis	By Jacob Myers (FPRI) -- In an era marked by evolving geopolitical challenges and the imperative for robust defense capabilities along NATO’s Eastern Flank, the strategic partnership between the United States and Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia emerges as a beacon of collaborative security and collective capabilities solutions. As the Baltic countries navigate an increasingly complex landscape, assessing their military investments and strategic partners has heightened significance. This article delves into the symbiotic relationship between the United States and the Baltics, focusing on the multifaceted benefits derived from their defense collaboration. Highlighting the region’s burgeoning defense capabilities, its operationally relevant geography, and recent defense policies, the article explores how this partnership not only strengthens the security posture of all parties but also acts as a return on investment for US defense while simultaneously fostering regional stability in the Baltic region and strengthening NATO’s defense. Across the Baltic region, investments in defense infrastructure (both physical and technical) and defense procurements in aviation, long-range fires, and integrated air and missile defense provide valuable opportunities for US forces to enhance their readiness and operational effectiveness. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have focused heavily on their defense funding strategies. For example, as of May 2024, Latvia has committed over 2.4 percent of GDP to defense spending, with plans to reach 3 percent by 2027. This spending earmarks purchases on High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and M109 Paladin upgrades to strengthen land forces’ lethality and further build credible forward-defense capabilities. These actions provide fruitful opportunities for interoperability with the United States and NATO and the ability to build readiness across formations. Some recent examples were found in the rotation of US Army Divisional Artillery headquarters and Security Force Assistant Brigades across the region since 2022. These units had the ability to test and train on allied radios, fire structures, and signal platforms alongside their own equipment. As a result, units could familiarize themselves with the operational environment and hone basic branch skills in a permissive environment. Continued deployments like this allow subject matter experts to cross-train and curve the learning on high-end systems while simultaneously improving understanding and networks with Baltic partners. Geographic Advantage to Support Real-World Training Scenarios Chief of Staff of the Army General Randy A. George has articulated his four focus areas for the US Army to shape the force in the new age of combat. Focus area number two, delivering ready combat formations, requires the United States to get Army units to the fight and sustain them over time. Joint exercises in the region support this goal, as they improve the US Army’s understanding of the future operational environment by leveraging the Baltic defense partnership through real-world training opportunities in a unique geographic location. Collaborative training initiatives through exercises also serve as force multipliers, enhancing the combat readiness and proficiency of both armed forces. Annual joint exercises, such as Saber Strike and Baltic Operations (BALTOPS), enable personnel from both countries to conduct realistic training scenarios across land, sea, air, and cyber domains. By exchanging best practices and lessons learned, Allied forces cultivate a shared understanding of operational concepts and tactics, enhancing interoperability and cohesion within multinational coalitions. Additionally, military-to-military exchanges and personnel rotations facilitate cultural understanding and foster enduring partnerships between the three nations and the United States, strengthening the fabric of transatlantic security cooperation. In 2023, exercise Astral Knight, for example, resulted in US, Latvian, and Danish units at the echelon tasked to identify and focus training efforts for future exercises on command-and-control (C2) networks. This exposure helped address C2 gaps among the formations and offered US Army signal and fire personnel real-time challenges to overcome. Over time, this has attracted other regional partners to include Lithuania, Estonia, and Sweden in addressing geographic variables in C2 coordination. The exercise was successful as communication was enhanced, and the US Army’s understanding of the Baltic operating environment was refined. As these exercises continue in the region on a Division or Corps-level scale, they will create an environment to work through mission partner network discrepancies and enable greater awareness of multidomain and combat operations within this vital geographic location. Army units in the region can continue to avail of live fire exercise opportunities on new ranges, which simultaneously builds procedural mechanisms within US and NATO units and offers challenging logistical scenarios that would be hard to replicate in national training centers in the United States. Another recent military exercise, Swift Response, which took place in 2023 in Latvia and Estonia, highlights such a vignette, as the exercise enabled US pre-positioned HIMARS to be drawn in Europe and moved into a training area used for a cross-US-Latvian and Estonian fires event. This was significant, as there are limited opportunities for the United States to draw and project this equipment for a live fire event worldwide. The opportunity empowered leaders to think through movement across Europe while working with NATO partners. To this end, Baltic partners are expanding training areas, creating the largest training area in the Baltics capable of hosting battalion maneuvers and HIMARS live fires. Access to this type of training will be of notable benefit to US Army units seeking to hone and improve fires planning and execution in an operationally relevant area in Europe. As Latvian and Estonian forces continue to host US and NATO-led initiatives in HIMARS, this exposure fosters a culture of understanding and mutual support and refines warfighter coordination during crisis response scenarios. Furthermore, NATO’s new regional plans adopted at the Vilnius Summit in 2023, will aim to equip allies to counter threats to their security simultaneously and focus on promoting readiness across all domains. In 2024, the NATO-led exercise Steadfast Defender tested aspects of the new plans and, for the first time since the Cold War, witnessed a collection of over 90,000 troops from all NATO allies executing a series of national and multinational large-scale. Live exercises were conducted across various geographical locations. As US Army Europe-Africa command will likely continue to complement future iterations of Steadfast Defender through the US exercise Defender series, this pivotal moment in European defense can leverage the access that Latvia and Estonia afford and will help to better plan and account for US Army logistics and C2 demands. Burden Sharing and Capability Investments Since 2022, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have undertaken the greatest military procurements in their histories. As mentioned, HIMARS and upgrades to artillery systems are the immediate focus. In coming years, Baltic formations will receive more Norwegian (or National) Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System NASAMS and the German IRIS-T system for greater integrated air and missile defense, Latvian formations will acquire Naval Strike Missiles to support maritime domain awareness and targeting initiatives, Blackhawks to support air operations, infantry fighting vehicles for greater combat maneuverability, and upgrades to existing equipment. With these efforts to enhance defense capabilities in the region, the Baltics have quickly transformed their armed forces to, in some cases, security providers and exporters for NATO. US forces exposure to these systems supports opportunities for cross-training and professional military education and directly enhances security cooperation initiatives for the combatant command. These purchases are also confidence-building measures for the alliance. As the region builds weapons familiarity, expands its air defense posture, and strengthens its geographic position, collectively, it reduces reliance on allied support during contingencies, thereby offering commanders flexibility to support operations in other theaters. As the US Army units continue to provide advice and assistance to the regions’ defense investments in infrastructure and high-end weapons procurements, military leaders can be assured that units are improving readiness, building credible interoperable forces, and maintaining a forward presence in the region, all while simultaneously showing commitment to NATO’s collective defense. Furthermore, the Baltics’ targeted investments in NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence mission underscore their willingness to shoulder responsibilities in safeguarding the Alliance’s eastern flank. Through joint procurement programs and information-sharing agreements, the Baltics and the United States foster synergies in addressing common security challenges, ensuring a more equitable distribution of defense burdens within the alliance. This exposure also provides unique opportunities for US formations to gain critical knowledge and lessons learned that can be used to improve the understanding of the future fight in formations back home. Challenges Ahead Despite the positive impacts a US-Baltic relationship has on force readiness, there are notable challenges that, if unaddressed, would act as irritants to the burgeoning relationship and slow defense objectives. The first and potentially most glaring is infrastructure and training space. Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia only have a few military bases capable of supporting incoming units at a scale that the US Army has become accustomed to in places like Germany, Italy, and Poland. Starting in 2022, the Baltics witnessed an influx of allied countries to these bases with no room to expand, and life-support challenges abounded and significantly impacted how soldiers lived and executed training. In a short time, training spaces came at a premium, and units were inventive when meeting essential mission tasks. As mentioned, Latvia seeks to address this hurdle by building a new base to accommodate battalion live fires and earmarking military spending towards barracks and dining facilities to host foreign partners more adequately. However, this will take time to correct and could cause US leaders to pass on long-term training rotations in the region in the future. Another notable defense challenge is the manning deficit across Baltic formations. Again, to review Latvia, only recently having reinstated the National Defense Service in 2023, the country finds its own readiness and retention impacted by low numbers across the ranks. Estonia and Lithuania can boast a deep reserve pool due to never-ending conscription, but with small populations at approximately 1.3 and 2.1 million, respectively, the talent pool is under stress. In all cases, this becomes troublesome not only for projecting combat forces against Russian provocations but also in terms of enhancing capabilities with US and NATO forces. All three nations are undergoing the greatest procurements in their defense history but, in various ways, lack the education and expertise necessary for sustaining capabilities. Areas where the United States would like to partner, such as HIMARS and fire support competency, find it challenging as these partners have no Fires Center of Excellence to peg professional military education. Additionally, fires experts are often dual- or triple-, hatted, covering other roles and responsibilities. As is the case, even if an expert is identified for broadening experiences at US training locations, given the manning challenges, most cannot depart or risk hindering missions at home. An argument could be made that with more Allied presence, exposure to experts speeds up learning. Ultimately, the Baltic nations will have to uncover inventive ways to retain and develop talent if newly acquired systems are to support NATO’s deterrence. Conclusion At a time when the fate of Ukraine and democratic values are on the line, NATO allies must 'sustain [their] resolve,' as President Biden remarked in Europe, and maintain unwavering support on the continent. The US defense partnership with Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia yields tangible returns on military investment, characterized by enhanced force readiness, equitable burden sharing, and synergistic cooperation in training core competencies. Despite the challenges ahead, by leveraging the Baltic states’ strategic contributions to regional security, the United States has shown that it reinforces its commitment to collective defense and strengthens the resilience of the transatlantic alliance in an era of evolving security challenges. As all nations continue to deepen their defense cooperation, the foundation for enduring stability and prosperity in the Baltic region grows stronger, building paths for a secure and resilient Euro-Atlantic community.

Another Trump-Kim Bromance Wouldn’t Be Surprising – Analysis	Donald Trump’s return to the White House has created an increasing excitement that he might reengage with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un. His initial statement about the recalcitrant state has raised spectre of another summit. Since his two summits during his first term in Singapore (June 2018) and Hanoi (February 2019) that started with a lot of hope but ended in whimper, will Trump chose different nuclear summit diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang during his second stint? Both summits broke down without deal. Trump and Kim met for a third time in the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom in 2019, but it did not lead to further negotiations due to differences over the scope of the North denuclearisation and Washington’s sanctions relief. Initial indication suggests that it would be in different theatre, and if realised, it is likely to take place in a very different setting. In an interview with Fox News on 24 January, Trump said he will reach out to Kim again. He called the reclusive leader as a 'smart guy', suggesting that he would start negotiations on the nuclear issue with Kim again. Interestingly, Trump’s remarks came days after his reference to the North as a 'nuclear power' sparked speculation that his new administration might recognise the regime as a nuclear weapon state and that it might be a strategic move to pave the way for reviving talks with Kim. During his inauguration day on 20 January, Trump exulted optimism that Kim will be 'happy' to see his comeback to the White House, a subtle hint that Kim needs to be prepared for a return to summit diplomacy. Despite such optimism, it is unlikely that Trump’s foreign policy priority focusing on North Korea shall take precedence over more pressing and important issue of dealing with Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East. So, the chances of another Trump-Kim summit at least during the first two years of his tenure seem fairly low. Moreover, Trump’s primary focus at present is now domestic issues, mainly on tariffs, citizenship and immigration. However, should Trump be serious to work on another summit with Kim that could be intended to facilitate an end to the prolonged war in Ukraine rather than dealing with North Korea’s denuclearisation issue? Such a view stems from the statement made by Trump that an early agreement needs to be reached to settle the conflict in Ukraine. In fact, Trump boasted that had he been the President instead of Joe Biden, Russian invasion on Ukraine would not have taken place. Trump lamented Pyongyang’s involvement in Moscow’s war against Kyiv as a 'very complicating' factor. Trump strongly believes that North Korea’s deployment of troops to Russia’s front lines in support of Moscow as a factor contributing to the prolongation of the conflict and could demand Kim withdraw his troops as a condition for resuming talks. Since the failed nuclear diplomacy with the US, the North has turned to closely aligning with Russia, signing a military pact that includes a mutual defence clause. Kim is not expected to concede an inch and allow Trump overwhelm him to undo its pact with Russia. Therefore, Trump may be day-dreaming and building castle in the air as Kim is very unlikely to concede to Trump’s calls for talks, as the current security landscape has changed compared to Trump’s first term, when a flurry of nuclear diplomacy unfolded between Washington and Pyongyang. Moreover, North Korea’s nuclear and weapon capabilities are believed to be far more developed now compared to the time of their previous summits. The Moscow-Pyongyang deal has deepened to such an extent that Pyongyang supplies weapons and troop deployment to Russia in return for receiving advanced military technologies from Moscow, along with food, fuel, security assurances and other forms of support. Kim would also have reservation on Trump sticking to his goal of North Korea's denuclearization, a principle he shares with US ally, South Korea, even if talks do resume. Trump is yet to outline its policy on North Korea officially. Strangely, Trump’s Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth called the North a nuclear power during his confirmation hearing before the Senate. US officials have mostly refrained from openly using the term as it could be seen as US recognition of the North’s nuclear program. The US has long refused to recognize North Korea as a nuclear state, as the NPT only acknowledges the right of the five permanent members of the Security Council to possess nuclear weapons. Therefore Trump’s and Hegseth’s comments on North as a 'nuclear power' further complicate the issue. Was Hegseth parroting his boss’s comments just to impress him? Interestingly, a joint statement issued by the top diplomats of the Quad security forum -- comprising the US, India, Japan and Australia -- did not include a reference to reaffirming the commitment to the 'complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,' a clear departure from previous statements where it was mostly included. In response but not directly rebutting Trump’s remarks on North Korea, South Korea emphasized that the denuclearization goal remains unchanged. Seoul stressed that comments by Trump and Pete Hegseth should not be seen as Washington moving toward recognizing North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. South Korea's top envoy to the US Cho Hyun-dong remarked that Seoul will make sure that the allies maintain the goal of the North's denuclearization. Trump must not apply the same yardstick in judging countries in conducting his diplomacy that he used in his first term during his second term. During his first term in office, Trump applied his particular brand of diplomacy with Washington’s adversaries, publicly befriending Russia and North Korea while separately piling pressure on China and Iran. The challenges are different during his second term. A more united group of US antagonists have drawn closer following Russia’s 2022 'invasion' of Ukraine. Trump’s focus now is to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, curb Iran’s nuclear program and counter China while building up the US military. But the most talking points in academic circles and among analysts are Trump’s remarks that North Korea is a 'nuclear power' as against Biden’s view on North Korea as 'a tremendous threat'. It is rather unusual for a US President to refer to North Korea as a nuclear power, a term that is being interpreted as acknowledgment of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, under which only five nations – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – are recognised as nuclear weapons states. Trump’s latest remarks serves as laying the ground for the resumption of US-North Korea talks and effectively part of Trump’s preparation for a meeting with Kim. Trump however needs to keep in mind that Kim has little reason to meet. Now that he possesses more lethal nuclear weapons than he had during Trump’s first term he is most likely to harden his position in any nuclear talks. Trump might eventually want North Korea to promise a halt to military provocations in exchange for the US not interfering in its nuclear weapons development, although it cannot officially recognize North Korea's nuclear arsenal. Viewed differently, Trump's remarks mark the end of three decades of denuclearization efforts for North Korea and signal the start of a new stage instead. What that roadmap leading to a new style of talks on nuclear arms reduction instead of denuclearisation remains unclear at the moment. Seoul needs to remain on guard as it might have to deal with a maverick Trump as there is always a potential need to defend itself against North Korea’s nuclear threats over the mid- to long term if personal diplomacy between Trump and Kim resumes, whose direction remains unknown. This worries Seoul. Any arms reduction deal between Trump and Kim, short of denuclearization, however small, could also give rise to calls in South Korea to develop its own nuclear weapons program. The issue of South Korea going nuclear is already simmering for quite some time and could be fast-tracked depending on how Trump handles his North Korean policy. Pyongyang always holds a double-edge sword. That makes Trump difficult to read Kim’s mind. Despite his friendly banter with Trump, Kim accused the US of raising risk of ‘thermonuclear war’ through its military activities on the Korean Peninsula. At a Conference on Disarmament meeting in Geneva UN forum on 22 January, Jo Chol Su, North Korea’s ambassador at the North Korean Permanent Mission in Geneva reiterated Pyongyang’s refusal to abandon its nuclear weapons in response to calls by the EU or North Korea to comply with international nuclear armament programs and cease development of weapons of mass destruction. The Conference on Disarmament comprises 65 member states, including the five NPT nuclear-weapon states and 60 other states of key military significance. It meets annually to negotiate issues related to arms control and disarmament. In a statement issued by the mission, it alleged that the US carried out 'aerial espionage against the DPRK' and that a recent Nuclear Consultative Group meeting with South Korea 'simulated a nuclear war drill on the Korean Peninsula'. Su criticised the US deployment of strategic bombers to the Peninsula for joint air exercises and live-fire drills by US and South Korean forces. Su further remarked: 'Such provocations have created a grave situation where the danger of the most destructive thermonuclear war looms large'. Su warned that his country will strongly deter any military provocation attempts by the hostile forces and 'firmly defend the security interests of the state and the regional peace and stability through full exercise of the right to self-defense.' The multiple concerns expressed by representatives in the same forum over North Korea’s continued ballistic missile launches and nuclear activities had no effect on the North Korean representative. While the EU called on Pyongyang to comply with the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and abandon its nuclear programs, Turkey echoed these concerns, urging Pyongyang to cease its missile and nuclear programs. Canada highlighted North Korea’s illicit weapons development and its growing cooperation with Russia. South Korea criticized North Korea’s dispatch of more than 11,000 troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine, as well as deliveries of deadly munitions and ballistic missiles, which were violations of 'multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions.' The South Korean representative warned that North Korea’s declaration of the South as a 'hostile 'enemy state was provocative and that Pyongyang’s actions are 'contrary to peace and stability'. He also dismissed Russia’s assertion that the denuclearization of North Korea is 'a closed issue.' From the discussion above based on the comments from various quarters, it transpires that the North Korea’s nuclear issue is destined to head through a perilous path. No clarity seems to be visible at the moment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdK_JqZaUNYBuroTh7y1vLy	2025-02-03T16:21:45-08:00	
Trump Turn Is Bad News For West Asia – OpEd	On February 4, the international community will get to see President Donald Trump wading into the midstream of West Asia’s crisis, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu enters the Oval Office hoping for an opportunity to shape US regional policy. Do you get déjà vu? Oh Do you get déjà vu? Indeed, what comes to mind is the beautiful song by Olivia Rodrigo, the 21-year old American singer-songwriter, three-time Grammy award winner and flag carrier for a new wave of pop artists who incline toward power ballads that internalise emotions. But Trump is no longer in the orbit of late Sheldon Adelson, the Jewish American billionaire businessman and political donor. And West Asia has phenomenally transformed since his first presidential term. Besides, intervention is apparently not in Trump’s toolbox. Therefore, conditions are favourable for a shift to diplomacy. For a start, Trump ought to take a shot at the 'Iran question'. Iran realises that it cannot have an optimal level of economic development so long as the western sanctions remain. And Tehran is open to negotiations with Trump. Something has to give way before October, which is the deadline for the UN Security Council to exercise the snapback mechanism built into the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that allows for the reimposition of UN sanctions against Iran overnight if it is deemed to be violating its nuclear commitments. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted in an interview last week that much as the ceasefire in Gaza is important, 'the real challenge here is going to be what happens when the ceasefire period expires. Who’s going to govern Gaza? Who’s going to rebuild Gaza? Who’s going to be in charge of Gaza?' Good questions. Rubio feels that 'if the people who are in charge of Gaza are the same guys that created October 7th, then we still have the same problem there.' Why not leave that choice to Gaza’s voters to elect their rulers? Rubio was sanguine about Lebanon where the new government 'hopefully will become more powerful than Hizballah… and there’s a ceasefire that was extended there that ultimately will lead to that.' On Syria, Rubio said that although the rulers in Damascus are 'not guys that would necessarily pass an FBI background check, per se,… if there is an opportunity in Syria to create a more stable place than what we’ve had historically, especially under Assad,… we need to pursue that opportunity and see where that leads.' Rubio is cautiously optimistic. As he put it, 'if you have a region in which you have a more stable Syria, a more stable Lebanon, where Hizballah is not able to do the things it does on behalf of Iran, a weakened Iran who has now lost all these proxies, it now opens the door to things like a deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which would change the dynamic of the region, and then ultimately not make easy but make easier resolving some of these challenges that we face with the Palestinian question and in particular with the Gaza question. So there’s a lot of work to be done there. None of it is certain. All of it is hard. But real opportunities that we couldn’t have even imagined 90 days ago.' Is such optimism warranted? In Rubio’s vision, all roads lead to the Abraham Accords process. Yet, Rubio maintained dead silence on Israel. Consider the following. The Israeli media, especially Hebrew press, openly admits that all that Israel has achieved through the horrific killings and wanton destruction of Gaza is that Yahya Sinwar has been replaced by his brother Mohammed Sinwar. As hundreds of thousands Palestinians stream back into northern Gaza in the wake of the ceasefire, Hamas flags are seen everywhere; Hamas cadres are in charge flaunting weapons. Israel’s female soldiers who have been released are praising their Hamas captors to the heavens for their hospitality and Muslim culture which treats a woman 'like a queen.' Succinctly put, the entire Israeli narrative has been blown to smithereens. But Netanyahu would have none of it. His fixation is how to retain the support of the hardliners in his government lest his coalition unravels and he loses immunity from prosecution and ends up in jail. Hence his Faustian pact with the two fascist ministers in his cabinet, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, he’d sabotage the ceasefire plan and resume the genocide in Gaza at the first opportunity. He is focused on short term expediency but will go his own way in the long term execution of Greater Israel plan. That is why Israel has comprehensively destroyed Syria’s capacity for self-defence. If Syria descends into chaos, the spillover will destabilise the entire region, starting with Egypt. Turkey would have us believe that it controls the jihadi groups ruling Syria. But in reality, there is no one in charge in Syria and there is much violence going on there, including a nascent insurgency by ex-Baathist cadres. A recent brief by RUSI estimates that 'The more instability that emerges in Syria as a result of renewed conflicts, the less capable Turkey will be of shaping developments in line with its priorities and interests… The US holds effective bargaining chips vis-á-vis HTS, as it could ease Syria’s isolation and remove sanctions.' But does the US have the persuasive power to get Islamists to reconcile with Israeli occupation? From the above, does it look as if conditions are favourable for Saudi Arabia to recognise Israel? It will take a decade at the very least to put Humpty Dumpty back on the wall in Gaza. On the other hand, Trump’s 'seaside view of Gaza' seems to be getting the better of him. It is most likely a plan hatched up in Israel, which caught Trump and Witkoff’s imagination as great real estate developers. Indeed, Trump’s explosive comment on relocating Palestinian refugees to Jordan and Egypt suggests that he has some real estate plans for Gaza. Not only are Palestinians in Gaza unlikely to leave but the Arab countries have taken a united stance that they will not accept such a plan. The Jewish investors/ settlers may never be able to explore the potential for Gaza’s seaside location and its salubrious climate. There has been no pressure from Trump to Israel to vacate its occupation of Lebanon, another beautiful country with great beaches and ski slopes —although the deadline has come and gone. Disarming Hezbollah will get progressively more difficult the longer Israeli military forces stay on Lebanese soil. Yet, Trump administration extended the cease-fire deal for another 22 days with no guarantee that Israel is ready to leave Lebanon next time either, with no trust on both sides and no apparent US pressure. American discourses are saturated with the self-serving notion that Iran is a 'weakened' country after the regime change in Syria and the time is opportune to make it a surrogate power. Nothing will be more horribly wrong than wallowing in such foolish notions. Americans have had first hand experience of the mainsprings of the 1979 Islamic Revolution when Iran was more or less in the same position as today’s Syria. But Iran has surged to unprecedented heights in its comprehensive national power in recent years so that its resolve to preserve strategic autonomy can be doubted by any adversary only at its own peril. Simply put, Iran can only be engaged in an equal relationship. Actually, Iran is also 'exporting' its revolution to neighbours such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt or the UAE, who, despite being the US’ allies, are increasingly diversifying their external relations to create space for their strategic autonomy.

Ron Paul: Audit USAID…Then Shut It Down – OpEd	As of this writing, when you attempt to access the US Agency for International Development (USAID) website or social media pages you are informed that, 'This site can’t be reached.' The media reports that the new Trump Administration has not only frozen USAID activities but may be planning on bringing it back under control of the US State Department. Other reports, including statements by Elon Musk, suggest that it will be closed completely. If true, the closing of USAID may be one of the most significant changes President Trump has made among many dramatic actions in his first couple of weeks in office. Many Americans may still have the idea that USAID is a government agency delivering relief at disaster sites overseas. They may still remember the bags of rice or grain with the USAID logo on them. But that is not USAID. USAID is a key component of the US government’s 'regime change' operations worldwide. USAID spends billions of dollars every year propping up 'NGOs' overseas that function as shadow governments, eating away at elected governments that the US interventionists want to overthrow. Behind most US foreign policy disasters overseas you will see the fingerprints of USAID. From Ukraine to Georgia and far beyond, USAID is meddling in the internal affairs of foreign countries – something that would infuriate Americans if it was happening to us. When President Trump ordered a 90 day pause in USAID activities, we quickly learned just how pernicious the agency really is. The US media reported that Ukrainian press outlets were scrambling to keep their doors open when the US dollars stopped flowing. It is reported that 90 percent of the media outlets are funded by the US government! This means that there is virtually no independent media in Ukraine, only fake news outlets willing to toe the US Administration’s propaganda line. Does anyone think these wholly US-funded 'news' outlets would ever publish a story that the US government did not want published? This is plainly immoral, but it is also dangerous. Most US mainstream media stories about Ukraine have their origins in the 'reporting' of the local media. From battlefield news to casualties to the state of the Ukrainian military, the 'news' from Ukraine is being written by US government-backed media outlets and then picked up by US and other western media. It is a closed propaganda loop that not only propagandizes the US citizen but also feeds false information into US government outlets – such as Congress – that rely on mainstream US media reporting for their news on Ukraine. No wonder so many in Washington continue to support this hopeless war! But USAID is not just in the business of disinformation. Elon Musk recently re-posted a New York Post article on X reporting that USAID funneled $53 million to EcoHealth Alliance to support gain-of-function research on coronaviruses at the Wuhan lab! Did USAID help fund COVID? Americans have a right to know. In natural catastrophes overseas Americans have shown themselves to be extremely generous. Private volunteer assistance organizations can more effectively assist victims of disasters worldwide. USAID needs a full and transparent audit. Americans deserve to know exactly what is being done in their name overseas. Then the agency needs to be shuttered completely, and its employees sent home. That would go a long way toward making America great again.

Colombia Yielded To The Art Of The Deal – OpEd	By Dalia Al-Aqidi Leadership is defined not by words but by action. In a world where many political leaders hesitate, delay or fold under pressure, US President Donald Trump has shown an example of his approach to international challenges. One of his new term’s first major diplomatic challenges emerged when Colombia last week refused to accept deported nationals from the US. Colombian President Gustavo Petro’s defiance directly challenged American sovereignty, testing whether Washington would enforce its immigration laws or bow to foreign obstruction. Trump’s response was swift and unequivocal. Within days, he announced a 25 percent tariff on Colombian imports and revoked visas for certain officials. He sent a clear message: the US will not tolerate interference with its lawful deportation policies. The impact was immediate. Colombia reversed its stance, agreeing to accept its deported nationals. What could have been a prolonged diplomatic standoff was resolved in record time to prove Trump’s strategy that economic leverage is a powerful diplomatic tool. This moment was more than a victory over Colombia; it was a reaffirmation of America’s strength on the global stage. The new administration’s bold action set a precedent for other nations that may be considering defying US immigration laws. In doing so, he upheld American sovereignty and reinforced the campaign promises that led to his victory last year. For years, the US has struggled with illegal immigration and, while deportation is a key part of addressing the crisis, its effectiveness depends on cooperation from foreign governments. When countries refuse to take back their deported nationals, it leaves Washington in a difficult position, often allowing criminals and undocumented immigrants to remain. Bogota’s refusal to accept its deported citizens was not just a bureaucratic issue, it was a direct challenge to America’s sovereign right to enforce its laws. If left unchallenged, it could have encouraged other nations to follow suit, undermining US efforts to secure its border and enforce deportation orders. Unlike previous administrations, which often relied on diplomacy but with little success, Washington took immediate action, proving that, in some cases, consequences are the best deterrent. By acting decisively, Trump ensured that the US would not be forced to accommodate individuals with no legal right to remain in the country. This is an essential component of national security. Deportation policies exist to remove individuals who pose a risk, whether through illegal entry or criminal activity. Instead of engaging in an endless diplomatic back and forth, the White House used economic pressure to force compliance. The 25 percent tariff on Colombian imports targeted key industries that rely on the US market, including coffee, textiles and flowers. The financial repercussions were severe enough that President Petro had no choice but to relent. This strategy aligns with Trump’s broader economic philosophy, which is leveraging America’s financial power to secure favorable outcomes. During his first term, he used tariffs, sanctions and trade renegotiations to put America first. His handling of the Colombia situation reaffirmed that, when applied strategically, economic pressure is one of the most effective tools in international diplomacy. His opponents argued that tariffs can backfire by increasing costs for American consumers. However, in this case, the imposition of tariffs was not meant to be permanent; it was a temporary measure designed to exert pressure. As soon as Bogota complied, Washington suspended the tariffs, proving they were a negotiation tool rather than a punishment. Colombia may have been the immediate target of Trump’s decisive action, but the message was also directed at the world. For too long, many countries have resisted taking back their deported nationals, expecting the US to bear the burden instead. However, this situation signals that those days are now over. This shift in policy has broader implications. The new administration has likely deterred other nations from attempting similar defiance. The message was clear: as a country, the US has the right to determine its own immigration policies and any government that seeks to obstruct them will face real consequences. That is what borders are for. The recent tensions between the two nations have raised questions about the long-term stability of their trade and diplomatic relationship. While past cooperation has been driven by mutual economic and security interests, US-Colombia relations should be shaped by economic interdependence, political dynamics and shared security concerns moving forward. Economically, Colombia remains reliant on access to the American market. Still, this dependence is now coupled with a heightened awareness that Washington is willing to use trade as an enforcement tool. While the tariff dispute was resolved quickly, it left lingering concerns about the unpredictability of future trade policies. Bogota may seek to diversify its economic partnerships to reduce its vulnerability, while Washington could use its economic influence to push for more favorable trade agreements. This shift could create new negotiations over tariffs, export policies and labor regulations in the coming four years. Diplomatically, the relationship will require careful management. Colombia has historically been a strategic ally of the US in Latin America, especially in its counternarcotics efforts. However, growing ideological differences between the Trump administration and the Petro government could create friction in areas beyond immigration. The key challenge will be maintaining collaboration on security and regional stability while managing political disagreements. Ultimately, the future of US-Colombia relations will depend on whether both nations prioritize economic and security cooperation over political disputes. If pragmatism prevails, the partnership can endure; however, Colombia may seek new allies if tensions escalate, shifting the balance of power in Latin America and challenging US influence in the region. • Dalia Al-Aqidi is executive director at the American Center for Counter Extremism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdK_JqZaUNYBsr0OsSzQsSr	2025-02-03T16:11:02-08:00	
Trump Dilemma: Embrace Or Fight DeepSeek – OpEd	On 20 January 2025, a day when the tech titans of the West were in prominent attendance at Trump’s presidential inauguration, a little known China artificial intelligence (AI) company DeepSeek released an open source version of its R1 model, a technical report as well as licencing for unrestricted commercial use. This was no ordinary AI app. It matched and surpassed the leading AI app, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, on several key benchmarks. Perhaps most important to ordinary as well as business users of AI apps, it was free and locally deployable. 'Free open source' refers to software that is available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute without cost, meaning the source code is publicly accessible and can be changed by anyone, typically under a license that allows for such modifications and sharing; essentially, it's software where the code is openly available and can be used freely by anyone. Sputnik Moment Impact of DeepSeek The response was as if a thunderbolt had been unleashed on the AI tech world in which the US is the dominant player and the world’s leader. The app immediately became the most downloaded free app in the US and other countries. According to Bloomberg, DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence (AI) assistant topped the list of most downloaded mobile apps across 140 markets, with India accounting for the largest percentage of new users at the end of January. It had risen to the No 1 spot on Apple Inc’s App Store on Jan 26, and has held that position globally since. The app has also held the top spot on Alphabet Inc’s Android Play Store in the US since Jan 28. With 16 million downloads over its first 18 days, the app almost doubled the nine million notched by OpenAI’s ChatGPT when it was first released. The positive response of AI consumers - researchers, small and big time businesses, professionals, and ordinary netizens all over the world - to it stands in contrast with global stock markets where the Chinese low budget AI is causing investors to question everything that they know about AI and related stocks and their valuation. On 27 January, the US stock market recomputed the valuation on AI and chip stocks that have been a key player in the US bull market run. The Nasdaq 100 sank 3% while the S&P 500 dropped 1.5%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers plunged the most since March 2020. Nvidia, the poster child of America’s AI frenzy, sank 17%. This was the biggest market-cap loss for a single stock ever as investors chewed over the revelation that DeepSeek was developed and operates at a fraction of the billions of dollars that US AI companies such as Meta, Alphabet and others have spent on Nvidia and other chips to upgrade their hardware. Fast Facts About Artificial Intelligence 77% of devices being used have some form of AI. 9 out of 10 organizations support AI for a competitive advantage. AI is projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. By 2025, AI might eliminate 85 million jobs but create 97 million new ones, resulting in a net gain of 12 million jobs. 63% of organizations intend to adopt AI globally within the next three years. AI market size is expected to grow by at least 120% year-over-year. In 2024, the global AI market is projected to grow 33% year over year. 88% of non-users are unclear how generative AI will impact their life.10 Only a third of consumers think they are using AI platforms, while actual usage is 77%. Source: DeepSeek: Another China Game Changer? What comes next for DeepSeek may not be up to consumers or the market for AI based in the US and ally countries to decide. It may be the latest battlefield that the US sees a need to fight to stymie the rise of China as a world power. It is significant that a day after his inauguration and before the US market meltdown, President Trump announced a joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle to create up to US$500 billion in computing infrastructure to power artificial intelligence. The venture, called Stargate, was to invest in US data centers and servers throughout the country. According to Trump this was 'the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history' and would keep 'the future of technology' in the US. Following the rout in Wall Street, Trump told a Republican congressional retreat in Miami that he thought the Chinese AI could act as a spur for the US companies to innovate. 'Hopefully, the release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win'. 'I would say that could be a positive. So instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with, hopefully, the same solution.' Despite this initial positive response,Trump may change his mind on welcoming Deepseek. This is if the anti China lobby and bandwagon of business interests get their way. The opening shots of a likely sustained battle that DeepSeek has to fight has already been launched. A widely circulated social media video describes an 83 hour digital war fought by DeepSeek staff and associates during the Chinese New Year period to deal with a large scale cyber attack emanating from an unknown but highly sophisticated adversary based in the US using phishing emails sent to employees to steal credentials brute force attempts to crack passwords and breach firewalls. Injection of malicious data including ransomware and spyware This first threat to DeepSeek was repulsed. What will be more difficult is the emerging alignment of ideological and financial interests that have emerged to ensure that DeepSeek is not only pushed back but brought down. This can be seen in the numerous western media reports accusing DeepSeek of misleading about its true development cost intellectual property infringement or theft operating on restricted AI and smuggled chips political bias and control by China Defenders of DeepSeek point out that the allegations have little or no substance. Also that the main charge levelled by current AI market leader, OpenAI, that DeepSeek has engaged in intellectual property infringement or theft through distillation of data smacks of hypocrisy and worse, especially since OpenAI is currently facing more than a dozen copyright lawsuits alleging use of copyright-protected works to train the large-language models used by its ChatGPT. The most formidable of the criticisms DeepSeek has to deal with is that it is a threat to US national security and world leadership. Those beating the drums of war against DeepSeek on this include Congressional leaders, entrepreneurs heavily invested in the current AI technology, ‘experts’ fronted in the media, who use select loaded questions on Xinjiang, Tibet, etc.to claim that DeepSeek is 'incredibly dangerous for free speech' by permitting China to control political narratives, and others in the anti China camp. DeepSeek Defenders On DeepSeek’s side, we have seen unexpected support from some key tech leaders. Nvidia ‘s CEO, Jensen Huang, described DeepSeek’s R1 as 'an excellent AI advancement', although his company and his own personal worth were the biggest losers from the Silicon Valley tech rout. Microsoft's Satya Nadella praised it for its 'real innovations' ; OpenAI's Sam Altman described it as 'clearly a great model'; whilst Apple CEO Tim Cook said 'innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing'. Perhaps the most important benefit that DeepSeek and other new Chinese AI apps such as Alibaba’s Qwen2.5v-VL is providing is the democratization of AI beyond the control of any single country or company. Providing free open source AI will be key in levelling the playing field in access to information and skills. This potential is much more than the politics, economics or military implications that US critics of China’s AI are focusing on. By restricting or banning DeepSeek or in dealing with it as another new cold war front as with Huawei and TikTok previously, the US and its allies will end as the losers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdK_JqZaUNYBnLPF9hYFuDW	2025-02-03T16:08:09-08:00	
Ukraine Rejects US Peace Push As Putin Refuses To Talk To Zelensk...	(RFE/RL) -- Kyiv called a proposal that Washington has developed thus far for peace in Ukraine a 'failed plan,' saying a push for a cease-fire and elections in Ukraine isn't enough to 'intimidate' Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, on February 2 warned that both sides will have to make concessions if they hope to negotiate a settlement to the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'has already indicated he will soften his position on land,' Kellogg said. 'And Putin is going to have to soften his positions as well.' 'We're going to have discussions with everybody over time, and probably in the near term,' he added. 'And it's good for both sides.' Kellogg told Reuters in an interview that Washington wants Ukraine to hold elections, potentially by the end of this year, especially if a truce is reached to stop the fighting. Dmytro Lytvyn, an aide to Zelenskyy, on February 2 said that 'we haven't seen Mr. Kellogg's full interview, only a few quotes about the elections, so it's hard to fully assess his position.' 'But if his plan is just a cease-fire and elections, it is a failed plan -- Putin won't be intimidated by just those two things,' he told Reuters. Ukraine remains under martial law and has not held elections since Russia's invasion -- something Kellogg said was permitted under the Ukrainian Constitution. Putin has called Zelenskyy 'illegitimate' because his presidential term has officially expired. Late on February 2, following Kellogg's comments, Trump said talks with Ukraine and Russia were going 'pretty well.' 'We have meetings and talks scheduled with various parties, including Ukraine and Russia. And I think those discussions are actually going pretty well,' he added without being specific. Zelenskyy has rejected any deal that would require him to make territorial concessions to Russia, which controls large portions of southeastern Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula. Some of the territory was taken during a previous invasion in 2014, while the rest was captured following Russia's full-scale invasion of February 2022. However, Ukraine -- outgunned and outmanned by Russian forces -- has suffered increasing battlefield losses in recent months, leading to pressure on Zelenskyy to ease his opposition to the loss of land, even temporarily. Russia has also suffered massive casualties on the battlefield and its economy has been left in ruins through military spending and Western-imposed sanctions. The future of U.S. military aid to Ukraine is also unclear. Trump has criticized the amount of assistance provided to Kyiv by the previous administration. Trump said on February 3 that he wants Ukraine to supply the United States with rare earth minerals as a form of payment for U.S. financial support. 'We're telling Ukraine they have very valuable rare earths,' Trump told reporters at the White House. 'We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earths and other things.' More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare earths, nickel, and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium, and titanium. Trump has vowed to quickly end the war but has not provided details of any potential plans to bring the sides together. Kellogg on January 31 said Trump has a 'solid' strategy to end the war in Ukraine within months, also without providing details. Kellogg's assertion came amid behind-the-scenes talks and back-channel negotiations to find a way to bring the nearly 3-year-old Russian invasion to an end. Putin for his part has complimented Trump and signaled a willingness to meet. But he's also ruled out holding talks with Zelenskyy, which would potentially complicate any upcoming negotiations. Ukraine has sought long-term security guarantees, including the potential for Western peacekeeping forces, to prevent Russia from rebuilding its forces and attacking again following a cease-fire. On the battlefield, Ukraine continued to target fuel and energy facilities inside Russia. Drones ignited a fire in the Astrakhan region and forced the suspension of flights at several airports, Russian officials and media said early on February 3. 'Ukrainian armed forces attempted a drone attack on objects located in the region, including fuel and energy facilities,' Astrakhan Governor Igor Babushkin said on Telegram. 'The attack was successfully repelled. Falling drone sparked a fire. There were no casualties,' he wrote from the southern Russian region near the Kazakh border. He did not specify what was on fire, but the Baza Telegram channel said it was a gas-processing plant near Astrakhan city. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities on February 2 said the toll of the Russian missile strike the day before in Poltava reached 14 dead, including three children, with at least 20 injured.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdK_JqZaUNYBkR1Of0-r8cc	2025-02-03T16:06:49-08:00	
The Confusions Of Donald Trump: The Case Of Supply And Demand – O...	Donald Trump is the world’s leading expert in getting things wrong and one thing he gets wrong bigly is the value of the U.S. domestic market. Trump seems to believe that our domestic market is incredibly valuable to the rest of the world and that access to it should allow him to extort large concessions from the rest of the world. This is a seriously wrong understanding of the world economy. The basic point is a simple one, when other countries sell us things, they are essentially giving us a portion of what they are able to produce for dollar bills. Because they give us a portion of what they produce, they have less to consume or invest domestically. It’s sort of like if you bake a cake and give a slice to your neighbor, that leaves less for you and your family. In that sense, selling things to the U.S. makes them poorer. This doesn’t mean they are hurt by the trade. They can use the dollars they get from the U.S. to buy stuff from us, or they can use it to buy things from third countries, or they can hold the dollars in reserve in case they are needed in the future. But at the most basic level, the more goods they sell to us, the less they have to use at home. Suppose Donald Trump gets angry at a country and says that he won’t let them sell to the United States anymore. In this situation they have to figure out what to do with the goods they expected to sell here. They can look to sell them to another country or possibly use them at home. Both outcomes are somewhat worse from the standpoint of the country Trump is angry at. If they sell them to another country, they will likely get a lower price for their goods, otherwise they already would have been selling them there. If they use them at home, that could improve people’s living standards, but not as much as what they hoped to get from selling the stuff to the U.S. and doing something with the money. But this is a short-term story. In the longer term they can look to alter their production to either meet domestic needs or to better fit the needs of a different foreign market. But note that the issue here is excess supply. The problem is not that the exporting nation isn’t producing enough to meet its own needs, the problem is that it’s producing more of at least some items than is needed for its domestic market. If the U.S. blocks imports, the country doesn’t have a shortage of goods and services, it has excess supply. This is the step that seems to go over Donald Trump’s head. If other countries needed the United States for some essential supplies, like food or oil, then the threat to cut off access could seriously cripple their economies, possibly for a long period of time. But Donald Trump apparently thinks he can cripple foreign economies by not buying their stuff. This sort of threat is at most a temporary problem. Countries can and will reorient their production to meet the needs of other markets and just leave the United States out of the picture. Also, it is important to remember that countries never literally need someone to buy their stuff. That is a story of too little demand, the problem we confronted at the start of the Great Depression. But we learned the trick for getting out of this problem, it’s called 'spending money.' We did that in a huge way when the United States got pulled into World War II in 1941. That quickly eliminated our problem of too little demand. But it was the spending, not the war, that did the trick. If we had the political support for it, we could have done massive spending in 1931 on things like building up infrastructure, and improving our health and education systems. That would have ended the depression a decade sooner. China is in a similar situation today where its major economic problem is too little demand. It can address this problem by helping other countries to get over their transition from dependence on the United States. Of course, it can also meet the problem by spending more at home, for example improving its health care and Social Security systems. They also could send everyone a $2,000 check, like we did during the pandemic. If President Xi has a sense of humor, he could even put Donald Trump’s name on the check. But the basic story is the world can find other ways to meet any demand shortfalls it faces. And when it comes to supply, there is little that the United States produces that other countries could not replace elsewhere. This is the trade story that gets Donald Trump so upset. We import $4 trillion in goods and services each year, but only export $3 trillion. If we run down the list of exports from the U.S. most items can be replaced reasonably quickly. We export roughly $300 billion of petroleum products, which accounts for 15 percent of our goods exports. A world rapidly moving towards clean energy will be able to survive without this oil, if Donald Trump chooses to eat it himself rather than sell it. We also export a lot of planes and capital equipment. European, Chinese, Brazilian, and Indian manufacturers would be happy to fill this gap. On the service side, one fifth of our exports is tourists coming to the U.S. Most foreign tourists would probably be fine going to a country that is not an international pariah. Another big item is travel on U.S. airlines. There are plenty of non-U.S. airlines that could carry these passengers instead. And we have $140 billion in payments for patents and copyrights, fees that I’m sure other countries could live without if the U.S. goes rogue. The simple story here is that if Donald Trump is determined to act like an idiot in dealing with international trade, he can cause short-term disruptions. But in the longer term, the rest of the world could do just fine without the U.S. market. In that story, the U.S. economy will be the big loser. Trump with his various scams may be just fine. His rich friends with their big tax cuts may come out alright also, but most ordinary working types will likely be looking at lower standards of living. The U.S. market is not the big prize Trump thinks it is, and we will likely pay a big price for Trump’s confusion on this issue.

India: Maoist Autumn In Telangana – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On January 18, 2025, as many as 22 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) party 'militia' (people's army of the Maoists) members of the Errapalli Revolutionary People's Committee (RPC) of Sukma District in Chhattisgarh, surrendered before Superintendent of Police (SP) B. Rohith Raju in Bhadradri Kothagudem District. SP Raju stated that the 22 'militia' members decided to surrender to the Kothagudem Police as they were impressed with the rehabilitation policy offered by the Telangana government. The District Police organised an Athmeeya Sammelanam at Cherla Police Station on January 18, with the families of the Maoists who surrendered during the last year and those who were underground. The identities of the surrendered Maoist 'militia' members are yet to be disclosed. On January 16, 2025, A woman CPI-Maoist cadre, Kalamu Pai (28), active in the restive Darbha area of Chhattisgarh's Bastar region, surrendered in the coal town in the Bhadradri Kothagudem District. Pai, a resident of Palya village in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh, was an 'area committee member (ACM)' of the CPI-Maoist of the Kerlapal area committee in Chhattisgarh, and carried a reward of INR 400,000 on her head. She cited the spurt in incidents of exchange of fire between the Maoists and Police, the establishment of new Police camps in the forested Bastar region, and her ill health as the main reasons for her decision to quit the banned outfit and join the mainstream, the Police said. On January 11, 2025, Macha Somaiah aka Surender aka Satish (62), serving as the 'district committee secretary' and 'in-charge of the agriculture wing' for the CPI-Maoist, surrendered to the Police in Jayashankar Bhupalpally District. Somaiah, hailing from Pambapur village in Bhupalpally Mandal (administrative sub division), joined the Maoist organisation in 1990, encouraged by Gali Agaiah aka Janardhan, the former Mahadevpur 'area committee secretary'. Over the past 32 years, Somaiah operated as an underground cadre, participating in numerous violent incidents across Telangana and Chhattisgarh. Senior CPI-Maoist cadres over 60 years old, like Somaiah, have been increasingly affected by health issues and lack adequate medical care due to intensified anti-extremist operations in Chhattisgarh. Frustrated with the Maoist party's inability to provide necessary support, Somaiah was motivated by Telangana government's rehabilitation schemes aimed at helping surrendered cadres lead peaceful lives with their families. According to partial data collated by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), at least 24 Naxalites (Left Wing Extremists) have already surrendered in Telangana in the current year (data till Fabruary 2, 2025). 30 Naxalites had surrendered in 2024, in Telangana, in addition to nine surrenders in 2023. In total, 354 Naxalites have surrendered since June 2, 2014, when the state was formed. In the meantime, no incident of arrest has been recorded in the current year (data till Fabruary 2, 2025). However, at least 48 Naxalites were arrested through 2024, in addition to 69 arrested in 2023. A total of 536 Naxalites has been arrested since June 2, 2014. Telangana recorded six incidents of killing resulting in 18 fatalities (three civilians and 15 Naxalites) through 2024. Two Naxalites were killed in 2023, in one such incident of killing. Since June 2, 2014, the SFs have killed 54 Naxalites. Strikingly, SFs maintaining total dominance over the rebels on the ground, and have not suffered a single loss in the state since its formation. However, Telangana recorded 15 civilian fatalities in the intervening period, and the last of these was reported on November 21, 2024, when CPI-Maoist cadres hacked to death two villagers, Uika Ramesh and Uika Arjun, in Penugolu colony of Wajedu Mandal in Mulugu District, accusing them of being 'police informants'. The Maoists left notes, signed by Wajedu Venkatapuram area secretary 'Shanta', near the dead bodies, claiming that both the deceased were collecting information and passing it on to the Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB), an elite agency of the state police involved in anti-Maoist operations. The 18 fatalities in 2024 were recorded from Mulugu (three civilians and seven Maoists) and Bhadradri Kothagudem (eight Maoists). The two fatalities reported in 2023 were recorded from Bhadradri Kothagudem. Meanwhile, of 69 fatalities recorded in the state since its formation in 2014, a maximum of 36 (five civilians and 31 Maoists) were reported from Bhadradri Kothagudem, followed by Mulugu 20 (five civilians and 15 Maoists), Khammam five (four civilians and one Maoist), and Komaram Bheem Asifabad and Warangal (Rural) two each (all Maoists), and Hyderabad and Warangal (Urban) one (Maoist) each, and Adilabad one (civilian). Telangana has a total of 31 districts. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, based on underground and over-ground activities of the Maoists in 2024, two Districts (Bhadradri Kothagudem and Mulugu) were categorised as moderately affected; while five (Hanamkonda, Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Khammam, Komaram Bheem Asifabad, and Siddipet), were marginally affected. By comparison, in 2023, one District (Bhadradri Kothagudem) was categorised as moderately affected; while seven (Hyderabad, Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Karimnagar, Komaram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial, Mulugu and Warangal Urban), were marginally affected. On December 4, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs, Nityanand Rai in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of the Parliament), stated that Adilabad, Jayashankar-Bhupalpally, Khammam, Komaram-Bheem, Mancherial, Peddapalle, and Warangal Rural, were the districts excluded from the list of Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected districts during preceding five years (Between 2018 and 2024) in the state. In an earlier reply to a question, the Lok Sabha (Lower House of the Parliament) on August 6, 2024, was informed that Bhadradri Kothagudem and Mulugu were still on the list of 38 LWE-affected districts across the country. Several parameters suggest the Maoists' declining strength in the state. The Maoists failed to carry out any incident of arson in 2024 as well in 2023. The last such incident was recorded on February 22, 2022, when Maoist cadres and its jan militia (people's army) members, set ablaze six vehicles at a construction site at Chintaguppa village of Dummugudem Mandal under Dummugudem Police Station limits in Bhadradri Kothagudem. In addition, two major incident (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded, in which 13 Maoists were killed, in 2024, though no major incident was recorded in 2023. One such incident was recorded in 2022, in which three Maoists were killed. Speaking at the 25th KS Vyas Memorial lecture at the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) organised by the Raja Bahadur Venkata Rama Reddy Telangana Police Academy (RBVVR TPA), on January 27, 2025, Telangana Director General of Police (DGP) Dr. Jitender asserted that the state was far ahead in eliminating Maoists from society. Earlier, on December 29, 2024, DGP Jitender had warned the CPI-Maoist to stay out of Telangana state, emphasising that any further provocation would prompt the Police to take action: They (Maoists) engaged in criminal activity, killing two people under the guise of being police informers. We cannot tolerate such actions. Therefore, we had to launch an operation. We have warned them not to operate in Telangana. If they continue their activities, we will take necessary action, as the safety and security of Telangana's citizens is our priority. In the interim, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took actions against the Maoist rebels on three occasions, to curb their activities. On December 12, 2024, the NIA took over a key case involving the CPI-Maoist conspiracy to target Police personnel and public representatives using explosives and booby traps in the Mulugu District. The case was first registered on June 13, 2024, by the Venkatapuram Police. NIA registered the case on December 4, 2024, under multiple sections of the Arms Act, the Explosive Substances Act, and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), 1967. Earlier, on May 7, 2024, NIA filed a chargesheet against three CPI-Maoist cadres in the Nampally Court in Hyderabad District in the case of the alleged supply of explosives and drones to the rebels. The most wanted and absconding Maoists Hidma, Chokka Rao alias Damodar and Kamala, were also charge-sheeted in the case. The case was first registered on June 5, 2023, by the Cherla Police after they arrested alleged couriers Nageswara Rao, Mallikarjun and Umashankar, who bought the explosives from S. Kumaraswamy, who was in possession of an explosives license. Further, on March 11, 2024, the NIA chargesheeted a top Maoist leader from Telangana in a case relating to a conspiracy to promote LWE in the country. Sanjoy Deepak Rao aka Sanjay Deepak Rao aka Vikas aka Anand aka Aravind, was a CPI-Maoist 'central committee (CC)' member, who has been charge-sheeted in the NIA Special Court at Hyderabad. An NIA release noted, Our probe revealed that the accused had actively recruited and radicalised other individuals to join the CPI(Maoist) in a systematic process and manner to carry [out] acts related to terror and violence, in conspiracy with other Maoist cadres. He also raised funds to further the activities of the proscribed terrorist organisation, including the procurement of arms and ammunition. The case was initially registered by the Kukatpally Housing Board (KPHB) Police, Hyderabad, Telangana, following Rao's arrest from the Malaysian Township Area in KPHB on September 15, 2023. A revolver with ammunition, multiple forged Aadhaar cards, a laptop and cash were seized from his possession at the time of his arrest. The NIA took over the investigation and re-registered the case on January 3, 2024. Though the Maoists have failed to make deep inroad inside Telangana since the formation of the State, their continuing efforts are a matter of concern. Three incidents of explosion were orchestrated by the rebels in 2024, as against no such incidents in 2023. There were three exchanges of fire between SFs and the Maoists in 2024 in the state, as against two in 2023. The Maoists also issued a bandh (shut down strike) call in 2024, as against no such call in 2023. However, the number of recoveries of arms and ammunition decreased to 12 in 2024, from 17 in 2023. In the current year, no such incident of recovery has been recorded in the state, so far (data till February 2, 2025). Overall Maoist-linked incidents increased, though marginally, to 44 in 2024, from 39 in 2023. On January 10, 2025, a CPI-Maoist threat letter was found pasted on a house at Jadcharla village, in the name of the Lachanna Dal of the CPI-Maoist State Committee in Mahbubnagar District. In the letter, the Jadcharla Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Anirudh Reddy, his brother, and followers were warned to change their ways; otherwise, they would face punishment in a 'public court'. MLA Anirudh Reddy was accused of forcibly grabbing the lands of the poor. It was further alleged that the MLA and his followers were threatening companies in the Balanagar and Rajapur areas and extorting money. Nevertheless, the Maoists are failing to garner the support of the local masses, who have demonstrated their disapproved of the rebels' acts of violence. On November 23, 2024, tribal people from different parts of Mulugu District in Telangana took out a rally at Eturnagaram, the revenue division headquarters, in protest against the killing of two Adivasis, including Peruru Gram Panchayat (a village level local self-Government institution) secretary Uika Ramesh and a tribal youth Uika Arjun, allegedly by Maoists, in the Wazedu Mandal of the district. The protesters, comprising Adivasis from several remote tribal hamlets, marched through the main streets of Eturunagaram, displaying banners denouncing the brutal killing of the two Adivasis by the ultras after branding them as 'police informers'. For decades, the then Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh was the very heartland of the Maoist rebellion. After the creation of Telangana, it was presumed that the Maoists would try to implement their 'revival plan' in the new state. However, they have failed to establish any considerable sway in the state, thus far. The Telangana Police has been exceptional in countering the LWE-threat, despite critical shortages of personnel. According to the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) data (as on January 1, 2023), the sanctioned strength for the States' Police was 86,058, but only 61,811 personnel were in position, yielding a vacancy of 24,247, or 28.17 per cent. Further, Telangana had 162.66 Police personnel per 100,000 population in position (as against a sanctioned ratio of 226.47). More worryingly, the Police/Area Ratio (number of policemen per 100 square kilometres) was just 55.13, as against the national average of 65.14. Both the state and national averages on the Police/Area ratio were well below the sanctioned strength, at 76.75 and 82.82, respectively. Moreover, against the sanctioned strength of the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) Officers in the State at 139, just 122 were in position, yielding a vacancy of 17, i.e., 12.23 per cent, significant enough to weaken the executive supervision of the force. SF dominance and consolidation are visible on the ground; however, the state needs to address the existing security gaps in capacities and deployment, in order to ensure lasting peace in Telangana.

2025: A Pivotal Year For Myanmar – OpEd	Myanmar’s post-coup calamity, unleashed by Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, has now entered its fifth year. With the military’s waning power, the end of their rule appeared increasingly inevitable, even though no clear resolution was in sight. Amid the global geostrategic and economic realignments following the Trump administration’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, the conflict in Myanmar continued to be overshadowed by major events such as the Gaza ceasefire, the release of hostages, and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Min Aung Hlaing’s miscalculation of the coup on February 01, 2021, has been met with a nationwide escalation of armed resistance, which has now stretched across the country. The success of Operation 1027 by the Three Brotherhood Alliance (3TBA) triggered a series of major offensives in Karenni, Rakhine, Chin, Kachin, Karen, Saggaing, and Magwe. The efforts of the Ethnic Resistance Organizations (EROs) formerly known as EAO’s and the newly formed PDF under the National Unity Government (NUG) overwhelmed the Myanmar military, marking a seismic shift in the balance of power. The military unprecedentedly lost two Regional Command Headquarters and 173 battalions. By mid-November 2024, the junta controlled only 21% of the country—including the major cities—while the resistance groups held 42%. ¹ Map of Myanmar and its divisions, including Shan State, Kachin State, Rakhine State and Karen State. Credit: Wikipedia Commons China, now a rising superpower and Myanmar’s largest investor, exploited the situation to dominate the region. Beijing shifted from hedging its bets to doubling down on its support for the junta by inviting the coup leader to meet with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Kunming, Yunnan on November 6, 2024. Using coercive tactics, China forced two members of the 3TBA—the MNDAA and TNLA—to accept a truce in an effort to halt the momentum of resistance forces marching towards Mandalay, the most strategic city in Upper Myanmar. China, India, and Malaysia—the current chair of ASEAN—are now advocating for an 'all-inclusive dialogue' on cease-fire, humanitarian aid, and elections that many view as lacking credibility. These initiatives are likely to fail, much like the Five-Point Consensus, since the generals have never meaningfully engaged in political negotiation. The military will never agree to abandon its political dominance, kleptocratic economic conglomerate, and commitment to centralization. ² Based on bitter historical experiences, the people of Myanmar will not accept a negotiated settlement unless the military agrees to civilian oversight, relinquishes its political power, and ends its impunity. Meanwhile, the time lost in endless, empty talks—and the international community’s mere statements of condemnation—will only prolong civilian suffering and the military’s reign of terror. Yet the junta chief remains too blinkered to admit his catastrophic mistakes and is therefore unwilling to make any meaningful political concessions, despite seven rounds of six-month extensions of the state of emergency since 2021. Cling to power, he has been planning elections in a bid to lend a veneer of legitimacy to his besieged regime. Anyone with common sense will dismiss the prospect of credible elections as absurd in a nation where voting could feasibly take place in only 145 of Myanmar’s 330 townships due to 'significant security constraints.' These half-baked elections would only lead to further instability and turmoil. ³ The NUG is critically important as it is the only entity that can claim to be a legitimate central government and counter the State Administrative Council (SAC), which has attempted to control the country as its central authority. Even with sham elections held over limited territories, the military would claim legitimacy as both the de facto and de jure central government. The international community and resistance groups must not allow this scenario to unfold. A functional and effective alliance between the NUG and EROs is essential—one based on aligned political objectives and coordinated military operations through mutual trust, a common goal, and shared responsibilities. A constitutional framework for a new federal democracy must be built from the ground up, ensuring equal opportunity for all ethnic groups. It is vital that the NUG demonstrates leadership by rallying and uniting all ethnic groups into a strong, unified front. While the NUG attracts plenty of sympathy, it must also convince the international community that it is not an exile government. It is time to prove to Beijing, Washington, and other global players that the NUG is a formidable, functional government. As the revolution gains momentum and resistance-held territories expand, the NUG must adapt and transform to meet the growing responsibilities of governance, law and order, military operations, finance, education, and health. It must work more inclusively with allied EROs. Collective leadership should evolve into a more agile executive branch with both charisma and appeal. Likewise, the PDF must be upgraded into a cohesive and organized fighting force under unified command in collaboration with the EROs. The four-year-long war against the military dictatorship has exacted a staggering human cost: 63,000 deaths, 25,000 political prisoners, 3.5 million internally displaced people, and extensive damage to homes and infrastructure. The economy has suffered greatly—GDP in 2025 would be 11% below 2019 levels, and inflation 26% in annual average terms. 4 Rebuilding and recovery will be monumental tasks. Beijing’s short-sighted coercion risks alienating the trust of the people of its neighbors—trust once embodied in the spirit of 'Pauk-Phaw.' The Chinese, renowned for their logic and pragmatism, now risk overlooking the dangers of supporting a military that not only hinders the aspirations of the Myanmar people but also continues to lose ground and territory—let alone protect China's own interests. The United States, too, remains passive, maintaining a strategic blind spot regarding Myanmar despite the country's value as a low-cost, high-reward opportunity to counter China’s influence in Southeast Asia and tap into its economic resources—such as rare earth elements (REE), which are essential for military and technological advancements, and natural gas for regional allies. While the resistance continues to advance without Washington’s financial support, US-led political and diplomatic backing remains crucial. A decisive, Trumpian effort in concert with regional partners could expedite the conflict’s resolution and minimize further atrocities and casualties.5 The year 2025 is pivotal for Myanmar’s future. The resistance forces continue to solidify control over most territories in Rakhine, Kachin, Chin, Karenni, and Karen, while expanding their operations into central regions such as Ayeyarwady, Bago, Saggaing, and Magwe. The military now faces the impending loss of two more Regional Command Headquarters. 6 Along with these military gains, the resistance—led by the NUG and EROs—must consolidate unity and build diplomatic legitimacy while inflicting financial blows to the junta through targeted sanctions on its hard-currency coffers. This historic, nationwide resistance by all ethnic groups is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to expel the primary source of instability and atrocities, and it cannot be missed. 7 References:	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdK_JqZaUNYBnFg-sJfdrTP	2025-02-03T15:59:38-08:00	
Underestimating Americans: A Coming Plunge Of Dictator Donald – O...	Convicted felon Donald Trump has declared war on Americans. In less than two weeks, he has become the dictator, a role he celebrated in his campaign. He is using illegal executive orders as poisoned spears against just about every program the federal government administers to advance the health, safety, and economic well-being of all Americans. Until temporarily enjoined by a federal court, Trump pushed to cut all monies that fund schools, housing, nutrition programs, and health care—especially Medicaid for over 80 million children, women, and men and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Essentially, he and his minions are going berserk, smashing the law, tearing up our Constitution, and inviting lawsuits which they can delay, with your tax dollars, until they reach Trump’s handpicked corrupt U.S. Supreme Court cronies. The media can scarcely keep up with just listing the vicious cruelty of Der Fuhrer driven by vengeance and greed arising out of his deeply unstable egomania. Trump’s abuses of power can be divided into three categories: 1) Driving to destroy the historic safety net leads to a collective homicide. Yes, without food, health care and safety initiatives, Americans will die or get sick, whether they voted for Trump or not; 2) Omnicide coming from directly shutting down federal agencies and their cooperation with other nations (quitting the Paris Climate Accords) from continuing the fight against climate violence and the accelerating intensity of wildfires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, extreme heat waves and rising sea levels, and subordinating renewable energy to greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels. Trump also quit the World Health Organization and froze federal programs working to foresee and forestall deadly pandemics (3) Genocide by continuing Biden’s co-belligerency with mass killer Netanyahu and adding support for the expulsion of the remaining survivors in Gaza to their death in the desert. Add these criminal mayhems to the censorship or persecution of anyone who opposes Trump. With his fascistic henchmen (assured of Trump’s pardons for any criminal actions) to head the FBI and other crackdown agencies, he is unleashing a police state the likes of which American history has not seen since the days of slavery. The Trumpsters are also enabling expansion of private corporate prisons to incarcerate his enemies. Together with Elon Musk, the Trump administration is moving to turn the civil service back into the spoils system. Musk is also going berserk, offering out-of-nowhere two million federal employees buyouts with pay until September. This is totally crazy, illegal and dictated by a private mega-billionaire. You may remember the former Musk who warned about global warming and lethally out of control robots (A.I.). These moves are part of a purge of experienced public servants, who serve people every day, to be replaced by the tribunes and agents of the corporate state or the final takeover of our government, by big business, with Trump at its head. Right now, Trump, the failed gambling czar in the White House, and his minions think they are invincible. The GOP in Congress is cowed. The courts are Trump’s at the top level, and if they balk, he issues pardons. Who’s going to stop him and the rampaging Trumpsters? In a word, The People. Already his polls are dropping. Under direct threat by Trump, the mass media is not all going to turn into Fox News. The stories of the pain, deprivation, and chaotic sadism imposed on totally innocent American families and workers will generate spontaneous resistance that translates into lower consumer buying amidst higher inflation and the instability that small businesses dread. Even Chambers of Commerce will recoil at yet more tax dollars being unavailable for public infrastructure and instead going for more weapons of mass destruction to enlarge the military state. All of this is to say that the demented Trump is deeply un-American as he touts America seizing the Panama Canal and Greenland, together with his designs on Canada. Unless he changes course, he will be brought down by corruption throughout his ranks, plunging polls, resistance by many states and their Attorneys General and finally by a Congressional GOP realizing that it is their political skin or Trump’s. They will choose their own political survival. Remember, during the Watergate scandal in 1974, a delegation of Republican Senators went to the White House and told Richard Nixon that his time was up and that he had to resign for far, far fewer transgressions. Trump knows no boundaries, no self-restraint and has often declared that he will do whatever he wants, meaning operating in massive violation of the laws of our land. He is now ruling by dictates that are getting more sweeping and penetrating by the day. He should read a history book.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdK_JqZaUNYBsgqb7eaQHOc	2025-02-03T15:56:47-08:00	
Breaking Echo Chamber Effects In North Korea Analysis – OpEd	By Prof. Dr. Masahiro Matsumura Amid rampant government war propaganda and counter-propaganda, mainstream Western media have reported that North Korea dispatched some 12,000 infantry of its special operations forces to Russia’s rollback operations in its Kursk Oblast against Ukrainian invasion forces. Almost all of the reports similarly point out Pyongyang’s substantial contribution to Russia’s aggression to Ukraine, using its soldiers as 'cannon fodder,' and warn of plausible dangers leading to cross-regional dynamics toward a Third World War. Under the new bilateral security pact of the last year, there is a strong give-and-take relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang, both of which suffer bottlenecks in defense and national security policies. The former can significantly supplement force generation in the current state of a limited mobilization, while the latter can obtain some Russian critical technologies related to nuclear warhead and ICBM as well as provision of oil and foods. In hindsight, the pact is obviously geared more to the above give-and-take than to Moscow’s security guarantee to Pyongyang as found in the automatic intervention clause of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance (1961-1996). In fact, the Russian constitution requires the President to secure prior consent of the upper house to send armed forces oversea. Thus, for a foreseeable future, the pact would hardly embolden Pyongyang to commit adventurism, without Moscow’s explicit commitment to extended nuclear deterrence for Pyongyang. Also, Pyongyang is recently taking a highly defensive military posture vis-à-vis South Korea, such as placing land minds on the 38 parallel, blowing up inter-Korean railway tracks immediately north of the parallel, and broadcasting propaganda through loudspeakers in border areas. The treaty-based alliance stabilizes inter-Korean confrontation because Pyongyang is now firmly put on Russia’s orbit, unless the U.S.-led West should attempt a regime change. This prospect will hold insofar as the ongoing multi-polarization of international politics continues. On one hand, the time is on Moscow’s side in that the protracted war in Ukraine has accelerated energy, crops, raw material, and other cost-push inflation, having caused the severe economic, social, and political decline of the U.S.-led West in parallel with the firmer Russia-China strategic alignment against the U.S.-led West and the substantial risings of major Global South powers. On the other hand, the time works against Moscow in that Russia would substantially deepen its economic dependency on China to weather West’s collective economic sanctions. Consequently, Moscow has to constantly recalibrate the balance between the two aspects. In these contexts, Moscow has taken advantage of 12,000 North Korean infantry to supplement inadequate force generation because full mobilization is domestic-politically inhibitive, given the 'special military operations' status of the war in Ukraine, that is short of a war. Certainly, Moscow seems to have recruited 100,000 to 150,000 volunteers in addition to the existing 500,000 effectives and created a new army corps, a division and two combined-arms forces, together with a major reorganization at the army division and brigade levels. Deploying an only one division of 50,000 effectives to the Kursk is feasible since the major fronts lie in the Donbas/eastern Ukraine. Making up 10,000 effectives out 50,000 is significant, giving Moscow adequate flexibility in war planning. In addition to military technology transfers, what else can Pyongyang expect from dispatching the troops? Western media are biased for most current combat experience allegedly available in the Russia-Ukraine asymmetric warfare. Yet, Pyongyang can obtain little valuable experience because its special operation forces need to be trained for guerilla and urban warfare, not large-scale organized combat in plains. Neither is Pyongyang is able to learn meaningful unit-operational knowledge given that its battalions are embedded in the command & control structure of the Russian military Conversely, how can Pyongyang ignore serious attrition of special operations forces as a most important warfighting asset? Purportedly, Pyongyang has just sent, to the Kursk, unexperienced soldiers only with basic training, not elite segments of the forces, consuming them as if 'cannon fodder.' However, the value of human life varies across counties and political regimes, and that of North Korea is extremely cheap. Western analytical approach to North Korea is in thrall to the mirror image of Western standards and practice and is completely off the mark. Specifically, the 'cannon fodder' option is most rational for Pyongyang because it has made a basic strategic shift to South Korea last year, with the constitutional amendment designating it as a hostile state, no longer a part of the Peninsula to be unified. This means that Pyongyang may use nuclear weapons against South Korea’s far superior conventional warfighting capability. This will free Pyongyang from investing in its large and poorly armed conventional forces, out of the severely impoverished economy that has been dwarfed by South Korea. Furthermore, Pyongyang’s cash thirst can be alleviated since the regime takes a substantial rake-off of the Russian government’s bounties, purportedly, 30,000 U.S. dollars per a soldier. Obviously, the option serves multiple purposes. In a nutshell, both Moscow and Pyongyang retain instrumental rationality, while having realistically grasped the evolving structural metamorphosis of world politics toward multipolarity. It is time that Western analysts extricate themselves from the mirror-image perspective and self-poisoning uniformity of thought that are in affinity with moral judgement against Russian aggression to Ukraine. Rather, the mental toughness to coexist with the evils for a foreseeable future is essential.

India: External Risks To Consolidation In Assam – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum On January 26, 2025, twin blasts took place at two separate locations in Guwahati in Kamrup (Metro) District. The explosions were claimed by the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I). The first explosion occurred at the Lalmati Brahmaputra vegetable market and the second at DV Parking in Beharbari. No casualties were reported. This is the only violent terrorism-linked incident reported in Assam in 2025, thus far (February 2, 2025). According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), four persons (three terrorists and one civilian) were killed in insurgency related incidents in 2024. However, each year between 2000 to 2014, Assam recorded fatalities in triple digits, with a peak of 565 (287 terrorists, 183 civilians, 76 Security Force, SF, personnel and 19 Not Specified, NS) in 2001. Fatalities remained in double digits between 2015 and 2018, and thereafter fell into single digits: three in 2019, eight in 2020, six in 2022, eight in 2023 and four in 2024; with the exception of 2021, with 29 fatalities (19 terrorists and 10 civilians). Security condition in the state improved further in 2024 because of three significant events in 2023: the signing of a tripartite Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) between the pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA-PTF), Government of India (GoI) and the Assam Government, at New Delhi on December 29; the surrender of 1,182 militants of the All Adivasi National Liberation Army (AANLA), the Amrit Beck faction of AANLA (AANLA-AB), Birsa Commando Force (BCF), the Badal Tudu faction of BCF (BCF-BT), the Santhal Tiger Force (STF), the Adivasi Cobra Force (ACF)/Adivasi Cobra Military of Assam (ACMA), the Chunka Tudu faction of ACMA (ACMA-CT), and the Adivasi People's Army (APA), on July 6, 2023; and the signing of a tripartite MoS between the Centre, Assam Government and representatives of the Dimasa National Liberation Army (DNLA) in Delhi on April 27. Nevertheless, the state continues to face a multiplicity of security challenges, including: The stubborn refusal of ULFA-I to participate in any peace negotiation with the Government and its increasing activities to expand its networks The exertions of Islamist radical groups, operating out of both Pakistani and Bangladeshi soil, including Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Ansar-al-Islam (AaI)/Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), as well as global Islamist groups such as the Islamic State (IS) and Al Qaeda, which are trying to establish a foothold in the state The marginal spillover from the insurgencies in the neighbouring north-eastern states, particularly problems connected with the activities of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN). According to partial data compiled by SATP, 124 militants were arrested in 2024 - 60 from ULFA-I; 14 from JeM; 11 from ABT; six from the Kamatapur Liberation Organisation (KLO); three from NSCN-Khaplang (NSCN-K) and; two each from the United Kuki National Army (UKNA), NSCN-IM, IS and AANLA; and one from KLO-Koch Nationalism (KLO-KN). While the group identities of 18 arrested militants were not confirmed, factional identities of three arrested NSCN cadres could also not be ascertained. In addition, seven militants have been arrested in 2025, till February 2, five ULFA-I and two ABT. In 2024, ULFA-I announced an 'armed military protest' boycotting Independence Day on August 15, 2024, from 6 am [IST] to 12 pm, across Assam, from Sadiya in Tinsukia District to Dhubri District. The group claimed it had planted bombs across 24 locations as a form of 'armed protest', including eight in the state capital, Guwahati, in the Kamrup (Metro) District of Assam. Police subsequently conducted searches and recovered explosives from different locations, including four in Guwahati, two from Sivasagar and Lakhimpur, and one each in Nagaon and Nalbari. No explosions were recorded on the date. On November 25, 2024, in response to ULFA-I activities, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) extended the ban on ULFA-I for five years, with effect from November 27, 2024, observing: ULFA has declared its objective to secede Assam from India, continued intimidation and extortion of funds for their organisation, and maintained links with other insurgent groups for extortion and violence. The outfit has possessed illegal arms and ammunition, indulged in 16 criminal cases, including several cases of explosions or planting of explosives in Assam during the period from November 27, 2019, to July 1, 2024, and planted several improvised explosive devices or explosives in the run-up to Independence Day, 2024, across Assam. As required, on December 24, 2024, UMHA constituted an 'Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal', headed by Justice Michael Zothankhuma of the Guwahati High Court, to adjudicate whether or not there is sufficient cause for declaring ULFA, with all its factions, wings and front organisations, as an unlawful association. Regarding peace talks with ULFA, Himanta Biswa Sarma, Chief Minister (CM) of Assam, stated, on January 27, 2025, 'The door is open for talks with ULFA. I have been talking with Paresh Baruah from time to time. The problem is that there are constitutional hurdles before the government in fulfilling ULFA's demand.' Another threat in the state is the spillover of insurgencies from other states of the Northeast. Apart from the arrest of NSCN and UKNA cadres in Assam (mentioned earlier), an attack targeting three vehicles of the Assam Rifles occurred at Namdang area in Margherita in the Tinsukia District bordering Arunachal Pradesh on April 16, 2024, in which one trooper was injured. Tinsukia Superintendent of Police Gaurav Abhijit Dilip stated that either NSCN (faction not mentioned) or ULFA-I was involved in the attack, as the two outfits were active in the area. However, in a statement hours later after the attack, ULFA-I claimed responsibility, and called the incident a part of its 'revenge operation' for the encounter deaths of ULFA-I cadres Achinta Moran alias Yangkhu Asom and Uttam Lahon alias Uday Asom in 2022 and 2023, respectively. A growing concern is the influence of Islamist radical groups in Assam. As SAIR noted earlier, intelligence inputs indicate that radical Islamist terrorist groups have increased their recruitment efforts in the aftermath of the August 5, 2024, coup and subsequent chaos in Bangladesh. Indian intelligence agencies have reported that the Bangladesh-based terrorist group ABT may try to establish a presence in Assam and West Bengal. Reports indicate that a prominent ABT leader, Abdullah Talah, was working to spread ABT influence in northeastern India. Moreover, Jashimuddin Rahmani, ABT 'chief' was released by the interim government of Bangladesh at a time when ABT has been attempting to create a jihadi network with the aid of sleeper cells, especially in the Assam and Tripura states of India. As part of 'Operation Praghat' led by Assam Police's Special Task Force (STF), in coordination with the Kerala and West Bengal Police, neutralised a terror module of ABT during simultaneous operations carried out in Assam, West Bengal and Kerala and arrested eight operatives on December 18, 2024. Five operatives - Nur Islam Mandal (40), Abdul Karim Mandal (30), Mojibar Rahman (46), Hamidul Islam (34) and Enamul Hoque (29) - were arrested in Assam. The operation was launched based on intelligence inputs about clandestine anti-national activities led by Mohammad Farhan Israk, an associate of Jasimuddin Rahmani. Additionally, under 'Operation Praghat', apart from the five ABT operatives arrested on December 18, 2024 in Assam, another four were arrested in separate incidents in December 2024. These arrests included: December 29, a combined team of Assam Police STF and Kokrajhar Police arrested an ABT operative, Gazi Rahman (35), from Kokrajhar District. December 24, the STF of Assam Police arrested two ABT operatives, Abdul Zaher Sheikh and Sabbir Mirdha, from Kokrajhar. December 27, the STF of Assam Police arrested an ABT operative, Shahinur Islam (36), under operation 'Praghat' at Bandhabpara in Bilasipara in Dhubri District. Moreover, two ABT cadres have already been arrested in January, 2025 (data till February 2, 2025). These arrests included: January 21, the STF of Assam Police arrested one operative of the ABT identified as Ajibar Rahman (31) from Chinamari village in Bilasipara in Dhubri District. January 19, the STF of Assam Police arrested a cadre of the ABT identified as Jaheer Ali from Bilasipara in Dhubri District. Meanwhile, on January 23, 2025, the NIA Special Court at Guwahati sentenced two accused - Mamunur Rashid and Mukibul Hussain aka Makibul Hussain - to imprisonment in an ABT-linked case. The case, registered in March 2022, pertained to an ABT module operating in Barpeta District, led by Bangladeshi national Saiful Islam alias Haroon Rashid. Similarly, on January 30, 2025, NIA sentenced another two accused, Mufti Suleiman Ali and Imran Hossen alias Imran Hossain in the same case. In relation to the jihadi threat, Chief Minister Sarma, stated on January 1, 2025, that the government was witnessing results against the jihadi threat along the border areas as a result of collaboration with NIA and the Intelligence Bureau (IB). As reported on January 2, 2025, the Chief Executive Member (CEM) of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), Pramod Boro, asserted that the jihadi operatives in the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) of Assam would never succeed, and would fail in Bodoland, which has already suffered from a decades-long militancy , and where people desire to breathe the fresh air of peace. He added, 'Our vision is that all innovative schemes, privileges must reach to the last people in the society then there will be no jihadi or other operatives.' Meanwhile, as reported on July 24, 2024, peace negotiations between the Government of India (GoI) and the Kamatapur Liberation Organisation (KLO)are on the verge of conclusion. KLO-KN 'chairman' Darsar Langkam Koch stated, 'Our talks with the Indian government are at the final stage, and only a formal declaration is awaited.' However, KLO-KN urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister (UHM) Amit Shah to provide a permanent solution to the community's issues, based on their charter of demands. Earlier, the KLO-KN faction had declined to participate in peace talks with the GoI, which are being led by KLO 'chief' Jeevan Singha Koch. However, Darsar Langkam Koch entered India on June 18, 2024, and joined the peace process, under Singha's leadership. Assam has been infested with problems of militancy for a long period. It has also been a target for terrorist organisations operating from outside its soil. With peace talks in place with the majority of remaining active outfits in the state, the Government is working to further enhance security. However, the belligerent outfits which continue to refuse negotiations with the Government and also engineer occasional incidence of violence and terrorism, will have to be contained, to end the state's long run of insurgencies.

Rubio Hails US-Panama Cooperation As Deportation Flight Returns U...	By Nike Ching U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said cooperation with Panama has sent 'a clear message' the U.S. will act to curb illegal immigration, as he observed a U.S.-funded deportation flight departing from Albrook International Airport in Panama on Monday morning. The flight returned dozens of undocumented Colombians to their home country. According to a Colombian official, 32 men and 11 women were repatriated, including seven individuals with criminal records. On July 1, 2024 — the first day of Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino’s term — the U.S. and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) aimed at jointly reducing the number of migrants illegally crossing through Panama’s Darien region en route to the United States. The program is funded by the U.S. State Department and implemented by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Monday’s deportation was carried out under the MOU and following a State Department waiver that lifted a previous pause on U.S. foreign aid. 'This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,' Rubio told reporters at the Albrook International Airport. 'This flight today was possible due to a waiver that we've issued,' he added. 'We’re going to issue a broader one to continue this cooperation.' Under the 2024 MOU, the United States has provided nearly $2.7 million to fund flights and tickets to repatriate migrants to their countries of origin. Since the first repatriation flight on August 20, 2024, over 40 charter flights have been conducted from Panama to more than 14 countries, returning more than 1,700 undocumented migrants. Destinations have included Colombia, Ecuador, India, and Vietnam. Panama recently reported a 90% decrease in migrants crossing the Darien region compared to the same period last year. Canal controversy On Sunday, Rubio warned Panama that Washington will 'take necessary measures' if Panama does not take immediate steps to end what U.S. President Donald Trump described as China's 'influence and control' over the Panama Canal. 'Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement after Rubio’s talks with Mulino. Mulino also announced that Panama has decided not to renew a 2017 memorandum with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and will seek to void agreements with the Chinese government before their official expiration dates. 'We'll study the possibility of terminating it early,' Mulino added on Sunday. The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI 'is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.' Rubio will next head to El Salvador where he will meet with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill Tinoco.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdK_JqZaUNYBo41McruRy_8	2025-02-03T15:50:25-08:00	
Crypto In 2025: A Growing Fixture Of Global Geopolitics – Analysi...	By Arman Sidhu Over the past 15 years, cryptocurrency has evolved from a niche experiment in digital payments to a global financial juggernaut, with profound implications for geopolitics and international finance. Initially driven by the libertarian ideals of decentralization and independence from governmental control of fiat currencies, crypto’s rise has since catalyzed the broader development of blockchain technology and an expansive, albeit unregulated, set of digital assets offering users privacy and flexibility. Early use cases for crypto centered on financial inclusion and cross-border payments. In 2024, crypto made a critical comeback as the market hovers near $4 trillion in value and Bitcoin surpassed the psychological benchmark of $100,000. Such conditions demonstrate how cryptocurrencies have become increasingly recognized as tools with strategic relevance beyond a speculative trade or store of value. Governments, corporations, and rogue actors now leverage them to bypass traditional financial systems, challenging the status quo for sanctions enforcement and anti-money laundering protocols. Cryptocurrency and Sanctions Evasion Cryptocurrency’s decentralized nature makes it a powerful instrument for sanctions evasion. Economic sanctions have long been used as a tactic to compel changes in state behavior. However, the rise of digital currencies is increasingly undermining their effectiveness, and the methods used to evade sanctions have grown in sophistication as the likes of Russia, Iran, and North Korea have had years of experience with circumventing sanctions. Russia exemplifies how cryptocurrency is reshaping sanctions enforcement. As a result of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Moscow received unprecedented sanctions. In response, Russia turned to digital assets to sustain its economy and geopolitical aims. By 2024, the Russian legislature introduced reforms legalizing crypto mining and allowed select entities to use digital currencies for cross-border payments. Industry observers note that Russia’s most infamous crypto exchange, Garantex, handled 82% of global crypto transactions tied to sanctioned entities in 2023. Drawing a parallel to Switzerland’s banking secrecy practices in the 20th century, crypto now provides covert financial channels, but on a global and decentralized scale, increasing its appeal for sanctioned individuals and entities while making enforcement exponentially harder. Russia’s broader strategy includes developing a digital ruble and collaborating with countries like Iran on a gold-backed stablecoin. As part of an ambitious and gradual 'de-dollarization' initiative, these efforts aim to bypass the US dollar and establish alternative financial systems for states outside of the US sphere of influence. These initiatives reveal how cryptocurrency can facilitate economic resilience under sanctions while forging new geopolitical alliances to create a parallel financial system outside the surveillance capacity of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Similarly, the Iranian exchange Nobitex has processed billions in illicit transactions while North Korea has leveraged cryptocurrency through cyber theft and ransomware to fund its nuclear weapons program. Money Laundering and Illicit Financing An oft-cited criticism of cryptocurrency’s anonymity and decentralization thesis is its common association with illicit activities, including facilitating transactions of narcotics, weapons, and human trafficking. Money launderers have adopted cryptocurrency to obscure the origins of illicit funds. Techniques include mixing services, which function as digital 'blenders' or 'tumblers' to add layers to help obscure transactions, as well as privacy coins such as Monero, and decentralized exchanges. As one example, the TGR Group, an international network working on behalf of sanctioned Russian individuals and entities, used stablecoins like Tether (USDT) to launder funds, which comes with the added bonus of retaining most of their original asset value. The use of cryptocurrency for illicit financing is not limited to non-state actors. Despite blockchain’s transparency, sophisticated actors exploit regulatory gaps and technological tools to obscure their tracks, complicating international enforcement efforts. Strategic Crypto Adoption by Nations As cryptocurrencies challenge traditional financial systems, governments are adopting them as tools of statecraft. Some seek to integrate blockchain into their financial strategies, while others use it to create alternatives to conventional monetary and financial systems. China is among the leaders in the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The digital yuan is central to Beijing’s strategy to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar. Through pilot programs and integration with other states via Belt and Road projects, China is positioning the digital yuan as a key currency for international trade, directly challenging the predominant SWIFT system. Emerging economies are also exploring crypto assets to assert economic sovereignty. In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender with the objectives of reducing remittance fees, attracting crypto-driven investment, and establishing a state-managed reserve fund of Bitcoin that paid off handsomely following a bold bet by President Nayib Bukele. In 2023, Zimbabwe introduced a gold-backed digital currency as a measure to stabilize its economy and provide an alternative to the collapsing Zimbabwean dollar, signaling a return to asset-backed financial instruments in a digital form. Similarly, Argentina has seen growing crypto adoption among citizens to hedge against hyperinflation and a depreciating peso under the reform agenda of President Javier Milleil. Argentina has agreed to permit foreign crypto ETFs to be traded in the country. In Nigeria, where access to US dollars is limited, stablecoins are increasingly used for remittances from the Nigerian diaspora, and the country is host to a thriving fintech startup scene capable of handling billions in transaction volume. Nevertheless, state-backed adoption of crypto comes with risks. Fragmented regulatory frameworks could exacerbate sanctions evasion, while authoritarian regimes may exploit CBDCs for surveillance and control of the local population. Additionally, the proliferation of state-led crypto initiatives raises questions about the legal and regulatory future of decentralized digital assets. Given the bullish sentiments and relentless momentum for crypto, 2025 will see digital assets and infrastructure playing an even greater role in geopolitics and trade. Several trends will shape this evolution: The appeal and competitive pressures of CBDCs: As a result of the breakneck pace of growth in the crypto industry’s valuation, the competition between state-backed digital currencies and decentralized assets like Bitcoin will intensify, with CBDCs potentially reshaping trade and regulations of decentralized assets. Examples include resource-rich nations such as Venezuela, which introduced and subsequently shutdown the circulation of the controversial Petro token, believed to have been co-developed with Russia, and which was backed by Venezuelan oil and minerals, though it failed to remediate Venezuela’s hyperinflation woes. Expansion of crypto alliances: As seen with the crypto cooperation between Russia and Iran, more nations embracing cryptocurrencies are likely to advocate for its use in cross-border payments and everyday consumer transactions. The likes of Venezuela, South Africa, Brazil, and Turkey are also likely to leverage their desire to reduce dollar dominance by engaging in crypto projects and initiatives. Crypto’s use in crime and conflict: Ransomware groups, primarily based in Russia, generated over $500 million in crypto proceeds in 2023 alone. Platforms like Garantex and Hydra have also facilitated the flow of funds linked to drug sales, weapons procurement, and other illegal activities. In a similar fashion, North Korea’s crypto thefts fund its defense spending and nuclear program, while Iranian entities use digital currencies to bypass sanctions. Furthermore, the ongoing Myanmar civil war has been a boon for crypto in the war-torn state, as both civilians and combatants alike ditch the kyat in favor of stablecoins, serving as a safe haven asset amid sanctions and depreciation. Regulatory enforcement challenges: The lack of global consensus on crypto governance will hinder enforcement efforts for years to come, leaving gaps for illicit activities while stifling legitimate innovation. Such conditions suggest Russia will continue to cement its status as an illicit finance hub given its significant technical expertise, its experience with evading sanctions, and its alliances with the likes of the BRICS nations, North Korea, Venezuela, and Iran.

ASEAN Response To A Trump-Generated Chinese Economic Tsunami – An...	By Mari Pangestu and Shiro Armstrong Southeast Asian domestic markets are about to be hit by a tsunami of cheap Chinese goods, unable to enter the United States if US President Donald Trump follows through on his promise of 60 per cent tariffs on all Chinese imports. US tariffs on Southeast Asian goods as part of Trump’s blanket 10 to 20 per cent tariffs on all imports will just compound the challenge. This prospect demands a collective response from ASEAN rather than countries looking to do individual deals with the White House, as happened to some extent in 2018. A decisive and early ASEAN response could lead a broader group of countries to keep global markets open. Governments in the region are already under pressure to protect against cheap Chinese imports as the US–China trade and technology war has escalated over the past half decade. With China’s 2024 trade surplus reaching a record US$992 billion, countries such as Indonesia have increased their use of safeguard and anti-dumping duties and strengthened efforts to stem illegal imports. Businesses have also been lobbying their governments for protection against calls of Chinese overcapacity and unfair competition. Many Southeast Asian companies have benefited from Chinese goods and capital being diverted to them for re-export to the United States. Whether value has been added before export or goods have simply been rebadged as Southeast Asian, they are now at growing risk of being targeted by US tariffs. Tariffs tend to be contagious. There will be a lot of pressure to retaliate and reciprocate, which will only make countries poorer. The US excuse for becoming protectionist was the shock from cheaper Chinese goods allowed into the United States when China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. But the United States was not the only country that saw an explosion of Chinese imports after China entered the WTO. Japan, Australia and other advanced economies weathered the shock and benefited. The China shock in the United States is more a story about the benefits of globalisation and technological development not being shared across American society. The United States as a whole gained vastly from China’s entry into the WTO while some communities and certain sectors lost, reflecting the inadequacy of US policies to deal with these losses. Southeast Asia also gained from China’s entry into the WTO and the ASEAN–China Free Trade Agreement, the first major FTA that China signed after it joined the WTO. There was a lot of opposition in Southeast Asia in the lead up to the FTA with China, with fears that industries would be wiped out from Chinese competition. Southeast Asian industry faced more direct competition from China than US industry did, but it wasn’t decimated. The ‘China shock’ was avoided in Southeast Asia because communities could adjust. Faster-than-average growth meant that adjustment was easier, with new opportunities opening through Southeast Asian firms joining regional value chains. Most who lost jobs and the assets were quickly redeployed. Global exports from ASEAN have increased by 480 per cent since the turn of the century when China joined the WTO. Trade between China and ASEAN has more than doubled since 2010, making China ASEAN’s largest trading partner. The gains from turbocharged globalisation were also more equally shared across society. No matter how flexible markets are, how rapid growth is and how good the social protections are, a sudden tsunami of cheap imports diverted from US markets will make adjustment difficult. A three-pronged strategy can protect Southeast Asia’s immediate and long-term interests. First, Southeast Asian nations need to develop a joint and common response. Great powers prefer to deal with countries individually, if they think of them at all. Indonesia is relatively large compared with its partners in the region, but will have more weight and leverage working with ASEAN which is larger than the sum of its ten Southeast Asian member parts. Acting together, ASEAN can exercise more effective agency and leverage globally, which will be crucial in responding to the United States. Second, ASEAN and its member states should respond with the tools and institutions it has available, within the regional and multilateral commitments that it has negotiated in its own interests. Existing trade remedy mechanisms protect domestic industries against surges of imports and unfair pricing. These measures are allowed in international trade agreements and don’t assign blame to other countries. They are about protecting domestic industry from injury due to rapid surges in imports and dumping. Such measures buy time to deal with the adjustment costs over a more manageable timeframe and provide space for countries to assess how to best support their manufacturing sector. Finally, ASEAN must also engage China. Dialogue with Beijing can flag the legal, legitimate safeguards that will be needed in response to any surges in trade, as well as finding enduring solutions that avoid escalation of protectionist measures, like investing in resilient supply chains. ASEAN has readymade arrangements and institutions that include China like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement. RCEP has established processes for government officials and ministers to meet, and a yet-to-be-activated leaders’ process that can coordinate action in the face of a crisis. Now is the time to bring this comprehensive economic partnership into play. Southeast Asia’s development has been a product of its successful integration into the global economy, made possible with confidence in a well-functioning rules-based multilateral trading system. That system is under threat, but it’s far from dead. ASEAN is important enough that its support for the system can boost it materially. Without a decisive response, the risks for ASEAN are high.

Explosive Remnants Of Syrian Civil War Pose A Daunting Challenge ...	By Anan Tello The sudden fall of Bashar Assad’s regime in early December prompted around 200,000 Syrians to return to their war-ravaged homeland, despite the widespread devastation. But the land they have come to reclaim harbors a deadly threat. Almost 14 years of civil war contaminated swathes of the Syrian Arab Republic with roughly 324,600 unexploded rockets and bombs and thousands of landmines, according to a 2023 estimate by the US-based Carter Center. In the last four years alone, the Syrian Arab Republic has recorded more casualties resulting from unexploded ordnance than any other country, yet no nationwide survey of minefields or former battlefields has been conducted, according to The HALO Trust. Those explosives have maimed or killed at least 350 civilians across the Syrian Arab Republic since the Assad regime fell on Dec. 8, Paul McCann, a spokesperson for the Scotland-based landmine awareness and clearance charity, told Arab News. The actual toll, however, is likely much higher. 'We think that’s an undercount because large areas of the country have no access or monitoring, particularly in the east,' he added. Children bear the brunt of these hidden killers. Ted Chaiban, deputy executive director for humanitarian action and supply operations at the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, warned that explosive debris is the leading cause of child casualties in Syria, killing or injuring at least 116 in December alone. According to McCann, the bulk of the documented incidents involving landmines and unexploded ordnance took place in Idlib province, north of Aleppo, and Deir Ezzor, where intense battles between regime forces and opposition groups had occurred. 'There is a long frontline — maybe several hundred kilometers — running through parts of Latakia, Idlib, and up to north of Aleppo, where the government was on one side, and they built large earthen barriers,' he said. 'They used bulldozers to push up big walls and dig trenches, and in front of their military positions they put a lot of minefields.' McCann said the exact number of landmines, across the Syrian Arab Republic and in the northwest specifically, remains unknown. 'We don’t know exactly how many, because there hasn’t been a national survey,' he said. After the regime’s forces withdrew from these areas, locals discovered maps detailing the location of dozens of minefields. Although it will take time and resources to clear these explosives, such maps make containment far easier. 'There was a battalion command post, and when the troops left, local residents went in and found some maps of local minefields,' McCann said. 'So, for that one area, we’ve discovered there were 40 minefields, but this could be repeated up and down this line for all the different military positions.' Landmines planted systemically by warring parties are not the only threat. HALO reported 'huge amounts of explosive contamination anywhere that there might have been a battle or been any kind of fighting.' One such area is Saraqib, east of Idlib. The northwestern city endured a major battle in 2013, fell to rebel forces, was recaptured by the Syrian Army in 2020, and was then seized during the Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham-led offensive on Nov. 30. 'The city was fought over by the government and multiple different opposition groups, who sometimes fought each other,' McCann said. 'And in a big spread south of there, there are dozens of villages that we’ve been through which are contaminated with explosives.' The Carter Center warned in a report published in February 2024 that the 'scale of the problem is so large that there is no way any single actor can address it.' Since Assad’s ouster, HALO has seen a 10-fold surge in calls to its emergency hotline in areas near the Turkish border where it operates. 'Every time our teams dispose of a piece of ordnance… people hear the explosion and they come running to say, ‘I found something in my house’ or ‘I found something on my land, can you come and have a look? Can you come and take care of that?' McCann said. 'We are hoping to be able to increase the size of the program as quickly as possible to deal with the demand.' As the only mine clearance operator in northwest Syria, HALO is struggling to keep up with surging demand. With funding for only 40 deminers, the organization is desperately understaffed, HALO’s Syrian Arab Republic program manager Damian O’Brien said in a statement. HALO urgently needs emergency funding 'to help bring the Syrian people home to safety,' he said. 'Clearing the debris of war is fundamental to getting the country back on its feet,' he added. The urgency of clearing unexploded ordnance in Syria has grown as displaced communities, often unaware of those hidden dangers, rush to return home and rebuild their lives. 'One of the problems we’re finding is the people are coming back now,' McCann said. 'They want to plant the land for spring. They want to start getting the land ready because they’re going to need the income to rebuild. 'Millions of homes have been either destroyed by fighting, or they’ve been destroyed by the regime that stripped out the windows and the doors and the roofs and the copper pipes and the wiring to sell for scrap.' The war in the Syrian Arab Republic created one of the largest displacement crises in the world, with more than 13 million forcibly displaced, according to UN figures. With Assad’s fall, hundreds of thousands returned from internal displacement and neighboring countries. And as host countries, including Turkiye, Lebanon and Jordan, push to repatriate Syrian refugees, UNICEF’s Chaiban warned in January that 'safe return cannot be achieved without intensified humanitarian demining efforts.' HALO’s O’Brien warned in December that 'returning Syrians simply don’t know where the landmines are lying in wait. They are scattered across fields, villages and towns, so people are horribly vulnerable.' He added: 'I’ve never seen anything quite like it. Tens of thousands of people are passing through heavily mined areas on a daily basis, causing unnecessary fatal accidents.' Unless addressed, these hidden killers will impact multiple generations of Syrians, causing the loss of countless lives and limbs long after the conflict has ended, the Carter Center warned. Economic development will also be disrupted, particularly in urban reconstruction and agriculture. Environmental degradation is another concern. As munitions break down, they leach chemicals into the soil and groundwater. But safely demining an area is costly and securing adequate funding has been a challenge. Mouiad Alnofaly, HALO’s senior operations officer in the Syrian Arab Republic, said disposal operations could cost $40 million per year. Faced with these limitations, locals eager to cultivate their farmland are turning to unofficial solutions, hiring amateurs who are not trained to international standards, resulting in more casualties, McCann warned. 'People are returning and trying to plant, and so we’re hearing reports that they’re hiring ex-military personnel with metal detectors to do some sort of clearance of their land, but it’s not systematic or professional,' he said. 'I met a man a few days ago who said his neighbor had hired an ex-soldier with a metal detector to find the mines on his land. The man (ex-soldier) was killed straight away, and the neighbor was injured.' McCann emphasized that a field cannot be considered safe until every piece of explosive debris and every landmine has been removed. 'If there are 50 mines in a field, and somebody finds 49 of them, the field still cannot be used,' he said. 'You can only hand back land when you are 100 percent confident that every single mine is gone. 'So, even in places where some people are removing mines, we don’t know if all of them have been cleared, and we’ll have to do clearance again in the future.' Although the northwest of the Syrian Arab Republic is riddled with unexploded ordnance, locals remain resolute in their determination to stay and rebuild their lives — a decision that is likely to lead to an increase in accidents. 'We think the number of accidents will increase because a lot of people don’t want to leave their displaced communities in Idlib in the winter,' McCann said. 'They’re waiting for the weather to improve.' In the village of Lof near Saraqib, one resident HALO encountered returned to work on his land just hours after the charity’s team had neutralized an unexploded 220mm Uragan rocket. Had it detonated, it would have devastated the village. 'We took the rocket, dug a big hole, and evacuated the whole village,' McCann said. 'We used an armored front loader to take it to this demolition site in the countryside. 'By the time we came back to the village, the landowner had started to rebuild his house where the rocket had been. He couldn’t touch it (before), and the rocket had been there probably since 2021. 'But within three or four hours of us removing the rocket, he had started to rebuild.' Among the most common unexploded ordnance found in the northwest Syrian Arab Republic are TM-62 Russian anti-tank mines and ShOAB-0.5 cluster bombs. Despite HALO’s 35 years of work in safely clearing explosive remnants of war, the scale of the problem, compounded by a lack of adequate resources, remains a significant challenge. 'To cover the whole country, there will have to be thousands of Syrians trained and employed by HALO over many years,' said program manager O’Brien. And until international and local efforts are effectively coordinated to neutralize this deadly threat, the lives of countless civilians, particularly children, will continue to be at risk.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fT0UnScAunbRn	2025-02-02T16:53:02-08:00	
India’s Rising Power Force – Analysis	India celebrated its 75th year as a sovereign democratic republic on January 26. It now emerges as the power that has come of age, with its fast rising power equation and recognition. It is now the third most powerful country in Asia, according to the annual Asia Power Index 2024 by Lowy Institute, surpassing both Russia and Japan. The 2024 edition which covered six years of data, is seen as the most comprehensive assessment to date. The Global Firepower Index 2025 has also listed India to be the fourth most powerful military, behind the US, Russia and China. India's position is largely driven by a consistent spending rate on defence, modernisation, and manpower. It is also the fourth largest military spender globally in 2023, and has spent 4.2 per cent higher than that of in 2022. India has a holistic grand advantage both in emerging internal settings and external presence. Demographically, it is now the world's most populous nation, surpassing China. It also has the highest birth rate in the world, with 2651 babies born every hour, more than twice of China at 1016 and more than 5 times of the US which stood at 418. For India under Modi, the path towards both defence and socio-economic reform and revival has never been more profound and far-reaching in the entire decades that precede it. While India's rapid rise will give credence and added boost to current partners and future allies including Quad partners Washington and Tokyo, the fraught relationship with Beijing is expected to turn in Delhi's favour with Trump now back in office. Trump, a long time friend of Modi, has more to depend on India with its growing double-edged advantage to Washington both in India's equation with Russia and China for Trump to solidify its carrot and stick approach to both powers. The same cannot be said of other allies especially Japan, where its waning power at least as reflected in the ranking, has been attributed to its economic decline and continuing demographic stagnation, falling down to fourth place in most of the indicators in the power assessment. India performs best in the future resources measure, placing 3rd behind only the United States and China. The Asia Power Index states that the United States is still dominant but faces rising military pressure from China, although China is now seen as plateauing in its power indicator. Key drivers behind India's Overdue Rise India is one of the world's fastest-growing major economies, with ambitious new economic transformation led by sustained digital economic reform and modernisation of its manufacturing and technological prowess. Its youthful, dynamic workforce and an advantageous demographic is a driving force behind this expansion, positioning India as a hub for innovation and investment. Under Modi's reforms, ventures like 'Make in India' and the push towards 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' further catapulted India's status as an industrial and economic base. In the defence arena, the new push to modernise the military has seen the new focus on advanced missile systems, nuclear capacities and an expanded naval footprint and power further reinforced its status as the primary power in regional security. Charting itself as the growing power in new sectors including digital technology, space exploration, renewable energy and quantum capacity, initiatives under the vision of Modi have seen a booming start-up economy and advances in energy transition and the initiative of Digital India have further consolidated its primary leadership in these fields. The demographic dividend remains the standout feature. By 2030, India is projected to have the world's largest working-age population, providing a long term boost for its economic growth and innovation. Challenges on India's road to superpower status remain. Despite India's new rise, systemic limitations persist that limit its ability to project power far beyond its near shore, especially the east of the Malacca Strait. However, the fact that its influence remains well below the level promised by its resources suggests it still has ample potential for further growth as a major power. Income disparities and inter-provincial gaps in terms of social mobility, quality of life and infrastructure development still remain a challenge, where efforts to bridge this gap and the need for internal political and religious stability in the world's largest democracy has never been more pertinent for long term growth and stability. Tokyo's economic clout is waning due to rising competition and internal stagnation, while India still has more rooms to grow and match the ambitious expectations it has set out to achieve. For Beijing, a flatlining economic capacity driven by slower growth and a downturn of internal demographic and economic structure, point to a future where its economic clout is not growing, and the rise of the non-China centric economic periphery is rising. Just as the US sceptics are trying to project the alternative system to the perceived waning economic power of the US, the downturn of the Chinese economic might has opened the room for the rise of the rest, in the sphere of rise of the Chinese alternatives. India has been the natural economic and hard power might in the region that has helped to keep regional peace and order, and all along has been complementing Japan's burden and role in this aspect. Both however, have long been in the shadow of Beijing's power flexing and intent to be the regional hegemony, and now, India seems to be the only regional power that has the all rounded power indicators in rivalling and potentially replacing Beijing as the de facto regional power hegemony in the future, going by the long term indicators. In the long term game with China, India stands to gain more in terms of resilience and future ally support and an expansive potential of new networks of alliances and strategic defence interdependence and convergence of interests. Moscow remains a trusted partner, and India is seen as the more trusted partner for Moscow than Beijing, given past historical skirmishes and the still lingering distrust despite the No Limits Ties. New Delhi has been consistent in its support in the past for Moscow, and for future strategic calculations, India offers more long term resilience for Russia than China both in geopolitical and economic weight to shore up Russia's new galvanisation of its Arctic goal and in countering the potential future threat from China and the persisting confrontation with the West. India is seen as the vital balancer in maintaining the power equilibrium and preventing a deeper fallout between Moscow and the West, and the roles played by India are more pervasive, realistic and reliable. With insecurity in the Himalayan border with China and suffering casualties there, the new front of insecurity in the Indian Ocean and the extended waters in Southeast Asia that have now seen a heavier Chinese power presence with the Chinese String of Pearls in choking India both at land and sea and at Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, these have forced India to intensify its Necklace of Diamonds counter strategy and consolidating its Act East Policy. India's rise provides positive ripple impact to the region and the world, from economic and trade spillover effects to the larger equation of helping to secure and preserve the rules-based order that has been the main bedrock of global trade and maritime capacity, in maintaining the sanctity of the international law and global norms and in securing the freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters. These have remained increasingly under threat now, which will threaten the foundation of global order and stability. Hence, the role of India and emerging regional and global partners in defending the rule of law and the rules-based order has never been more profound and significantly needed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fTyH8mOs-Nq4Y	2025-02-02T16:50:38-08:00	
The UK’s Climate Agenda: Ambition Vs Action – Analysis	By Shairee Malhotra and Jayaa Auplish Among key factors such as economic challenges, high taxes, and scandals plaguing the previous Conservative government, the Labour Party’s landslide victory in the 2024 British elections was also partially driven by a manifesto pledging to make the United Kingdom (UK) a clean energy superpower. Five months after assuming office, the government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, announced ambitious targets at the COP29 conference held in Baku, Azerbaijan. While the UK seeks to reassert its climate leadership on the world stage, it is grappling with economic challenges and extreme weather events. For the first time in decades, the government debt hit 100 percentof the country's GDP and the economy has now contracted for two consecutive months. The Labour Party’s 2024 election manifesto warned that delaying action on prosperity and security could nearly triple the national debt to percent of GDP. Meanwhile, Storm Darragh is wreaking havoc across the UK, shortly after severe flooding caused by Storms Bert and Conall. The Labour government’s environmental agenda, which is deeply intertwined with broader economic policy, stands in stark contrast to that of the Conservative Party, which was concerned with immediate cost considerations. Under Rishi Sunak, the Conservative government curtailed climate commitments and drew criticism for its 'divisive and cynical climate politics'. Furthermore, the Conservative Party’s 2024 electoral manifesto attacked what it referred to as 'unaffordable eco-zealotry' and made little mention of green policies, except its pledge to remain committed to meeting net zero by 2050. Rankings by Greenpeace on the climate and nature aspects of political party manifestoes accorded 20.5/40 points to Labour and only 5/40 to the Conservatives. On the other hand, Labour’s climate agenda seeks to address economic inequality, and energy poverty and insulate the UK from volatile fuel prices. According to the International Monetary Fund, the UK was worst hit by the energy crisis in Western Europe, with gas prices soaring nine times higher than renewable energy in 2022, while in 2023, gas prices were 100 percent higher than pre-crisis levels. Global and domestic ambitions Stepping up as a climate frontrunner, the Labour government has adopted a strong narrative of climate ambition at home and abroad. At the COP29 in Baku, the UK set a high benchmark by setting an ambitious target to reduce emissions by 81 percent on 1990 levels by 2035. Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband outlined the UK’s top priorities, which include scaling up climate finance, staying within reach of the Paris Agreement’s 1.5C goal, and enhancing resilience to climate impact. The UK demonstrated support for the Green Energy Zones and Corridors Pledge, which aims to accelerate renewable energy investments through regional cooperation. As part of its commitment to deliver 11.6 billion euros in carbon finance by 2026, the UK pledged 239 million euros to support forest-rich nations. Additionally, at the G20 summit held in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, the UK government proposed the Global Clean Power Alliance to accelerate energy transition and bolster clean energy supply chains. Domestically, the Labour government seeks to stimulate economic prosperity, while ensuring environmental sustainability and financial viability. The government’s ‘levelling up’ agenda champions a decentralised approach to climate action through customised local growth plans. The Starmer government plans to double onshore and quadruple offshore wind generation while tripling solar power by 2030. Britain is striving to be the first developed country with a fully decarbonised and low-cost power system by 2035 through a new ‘Great British Energy’ (GBE) company. Inspired by successful state-owned energy companies in Europe such as Orsted in Denmark and Equinor in Norway, GBE will create a publicly owned company, to affirm support for British-owned clean energy and reduce dependence on foreign supplies. At the heart of the Labour government’s climate agenda is the Green Prosperity Plan, which leverages 15 billion euros annually, to support a just transition to renewable energy. Through initiatives such as ‘Net Zero Building Strategy’ and ‘Warm Homes Plan,’ it seeks to double the current spending on home insulation and tackle carbon emissions. The Labour government also announced a ‘National Wealth Fund’ to promote green growth through private investment. It also unveiled its industrial plan, the ‘Invest 2035 strategy,’ to drive investment into green technologies and sustainable infrastructure. Besides, it has also committed to refraining from issuing new oil, gas, or coal licenses. The Labour government aims to transform the UK into a clean energy superpower and the world’s green finance hub. In its Autumn Budget, it announced £100 billion in public investment over five years, focusing on low-carbon technologies and green initiatives such as carbon capture, nuclear energy, hydrogen hubs, and the advancement of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism by 2027. Ambition versus action The UK has a strong record of emissions reductions and is also one of the first major economies to set a legally binding net-zero target. Britain has successfully met its first three carbon budgets, mandated by the Climate Change Act of 2008. It has also significantly reduced carbon emissions from electricity generation by phasing out coal and expanding renewables like wind and solar. By 2023, renewables accounted for 47 percent of electricity, up from 7 percent in 2010, and the country’s last coal power plant was closed in September 2024. Yet while the UK has taken many concrete steps towards a planned transition, there have also been inconsistencies. The UK Climate Change Committee, an independent advisory body, asserts that the UK is off track for its 2030 emissions reduction target, and current plans cover only a third of the emissions reductions needed by 2030. The UK also continues to fall short of meeting its commitments under the fourth and fifth carbon budgets. In May 2024, the high court ruled the British government’s climate adaptation plan unlawful evidence based on insufficient policies in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has warned of rising food insecurity in the UK due to climate change and inflation. Moreover, the Labour government’s decision in February 2024 to halve the £28bn green investment pledge faced widespread criticism for mirroring Conservative government policies of scaling back ambitious climate commitments. The Autumn budget allocated £125 million for 2025-26 to the GBE, far below campaign promises. In addition, it decreased funding for flood protection and nature conservation, while continuing to subsidise fossil fuels, prompting critics to question whether Labour’s commitment is merely rhetorical. Besides fiscal challenges, climate ambitions also need to be supported by substantial investments and extensive infrastructure development. The Parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee highlighted significant connection delays for solar installations due to inadequate infrastructure. In addition, sector-specific challenges persist. The transport sector, responsible for nearly a quarter of the country’s emissions, remains a decarbonisation challenge. Although electric vehicle (EV) adoption has increased, delays in banning petrol and diesel cars until 2035 and the lack of a diesel bus phase-out plan are worrisome. While overall greenhouse gas emissions have significantly declined, the land-use and forestry sector remains a substantial source of emissions. Offshore wind installations are falling short of targets, and onshore wind and solar deployment needs a boost. Moreover, the UK’s investment in green industries amounts to merely one-fifth of Germany’s and about half that of France and the United States. Another key challenge is the dominance of foreign ownership in the UK’s renewable energy sector. This is most apparent in the offshore wind capacity sector, 82.2 percent of which is owned by foreign governments. UK public entities own merely 0.03 percent of total energy generating capacity, which is significantly lower than Denmark, Norway, and even the city of Munich. Denmark’s Orsted, the largest offshore developer in the world, owns 30 percent of the UK’s offshore wind capacity. As a result, many of the UK government’s profits are offshored to foreign governments. And despite being rich in renewable resources, the UK lacks domestic supply chains for developing wind, solar, nuclear or other energy sources. In this context, securing supply chains is critical for the country’s green agenda. Collaborations with international partners such as the European Union (EU) can be boosted to secure supply chains and transition to climate neutrality. The UK can also look at the ‘Green Alliance', the EU’s partnership with Japan, as a model. Ultimately, the trade-offs between expensive domestically produced green tech and a slower and costlier energy transition will also need to be considered.

If Trump Plays It Right, He Can Get The Russians Out Of Ukraine –...	By Jonathan Power The great flaw in ex-president Barack Obama’s record was his policy towards Russia. Going against everything he had said and written about before he became president, one action after another antagonised the Russians—his early proclamation that he wanted Georgia and Ukraine in Nato, his de facto coalition of convenience for a crucial couple of days with the anti-democratic, anti-Russian, neo-fascist, demonstrators in Ukraine, the further expansion of Nato, despite an earlier promise not to, made by President H.W. Bush, to the Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev, and his inability to cooperate with the Russians and Iranians over Syria. No wonder the Russians are reported to be happy that Donald Trump is now president, a man who has said nice things about Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. If the two meet sometime soon maybe there will be an end to this unnecessary hostility. The Moscow-Washington relationship is the most important political issue in the world, and this may well be the last chance to get it right. Russia and the US have never fought each other in the 200 years of their relationship. Russia aided the North during the Civil War and sent warships to prevent England and France supporting the confederacy. During the World Wars the two were close allies. However, they came near to catastrophic war during the Cold War when Russia armed Cuba with nuclear weapons. This will never happen again. It chilled the blood down to zero on both sides. But one can imagine limited armed clashes on the Estonian-Russian border, nuclear sabre rattling, a more intimate alliance between China and Russia, an urge to sabotage, as was done during the Cold War, any diplomacy or interventions made by the other and a continuation of both countries keeping their long-range nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert. Treatment as a defeated nation Under H.W. Bush post-Cold War relations got off to a good start. Nevertheless, the US treated Russia as a defeated nation that could be taken advantage of. Unlike with Germany, Japan and Eastern Europe there was no effort to help get the Soviet Union and then Russia on to its economic feet. In September 2000, a Congressional report blamed President Bill Clinton’s Russian policy as leading to the nation’s total economic collapse in 1998. In 2001 President George W. Bush announced that the US would withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. When Georgia began its war with South Ossetia and Russia the US sided with Georgia. 70% of Russians held a favourable view of the US when Clinton took office in 1993 but by 2000 it had gone down to 37%. Now it is down to single digits. Winston Churchill’s observation that 'Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma' is totally wrong. Any nation on earth would have been riled if it were treated in this way- even a defeated Germany. The Russians are an intensely patriotic, cultured and religious nation. Indeed, one can say they are in aggregate, in terms of classical music, ballet, opera, literature, architecture and painting, the most cultured nation in the world. Almost 75% of all Russians identify themselves as Orthodox Christians, pledged to uphold the same values of helping the poor and turning the other cheek as the other nations of Christendom. Gorbachev wrote many thoughtful articles They drink too much and can say stupid things and be overly hot-tempered, but they are not some mysterious, oriental, predator. They are not Tatars of the steppe. When it comes to foreign policy, they want first and foremost to be left alone with secure borders. In less than two decades Russia has been reduced territorially in Europe and the Caucasus to its frontiers of 1600 and in Asia to those of the eighteenth century. Thus, it is highly sensitive to perceived threats to its territorial integrity. Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev wrote many thoughtful articles which were printed in newspapers the world over. It seems that no one in the Western political elite read them despite their wisdom and relevance. He was both a patriot and a good friend of the West. In one he wrote 'There is much talk in the United States about rethinking relations with Russia. One thing that should be rethought: the habit of talking to Russia in a condescending way, without regard to its positions and interests.' If Trump goes into a meeting with Putin thinking his bullying tactics will be as successful as it has been in his business life he will come a cropper. He needs to do most of the listening and most of the compromising. If he plays it right, he can get the Russians out of Ukraine, he can restore good economic interaction, he can get significant cuts in nuclear weapons and he can get a cooperative solution to putting Syria back on its feet and combating ISIS (the Islamic State). But does Trump have the character to do that?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fT7VeiPtDcMc_	2025-02-02T16:45:54-08:00	
Null And Void? – OpEd	If President Biden didn't comprehend what he was doing, are his laws, orders and regs valid? Laws in every state govern wills and the transfer of estates and property upon a testator's death. For example, Virginia statutes provide that 'any individual may make a will,' except testators who are unemancipated minors or 'of unsound mind.' Unsound mind generally means not having mastery of one's mental faculties, which could include being enfeebled enough that the testator is easily subject to improper influence by others, especially someone who would benefit from provisions of the will. Virginia law considers someone to be of unsound mind if his or her cognitive capacity is totally impaired, meaning the person is incapable of acting rationally or understanding conversations, instructions or decisions. In other jurisdictions, impairment may not have to be 'total.' Wills executed by such persons are rendered invalid, null and void. How might these guidelines apply in other circumstances – decisions by President Biden, for instance? Joe Biden's declining mental and physical capabilities were apparent to many even before his election and inauguration. His Delaware basement campaign, to avoid awkward encounters with reporters and citizens, raised many questions. During his presidency, family, White House staff, legacy media, Democrats in Congress and others worked hard to hide, obfuscate, defend and excuse his infirmities, even as they became harder to deny. Millions wondered just when President Biden became cognitively incapable of leading the United States and Free World. His inability became so obvious during the June 2024 Biden-Trump debate that Democrat Party leaders pushed the 46th president out of the race. But what about before that? An article published shortly before President Trump's 2025 inauguration revealed that House Speaker Mike Johnson knew Mr. Biden was no longer 'in charge' of the White House, presidency or country long before his cognitive incapacities were finally acknowledged by those whose jobs, prestige or political agendas depended on him being 'the best Biden ever.' During a January 2024 Oval Office meeting with President Biden, the Speaker particularly wanted to discuss a Biden Executive Order that blocked liquefied natural gas exports to Europe. Russia's war with Ukraine, the likelihood of renewed European dependence on Russian gas if US LNG exports were terminated, and the extent that would enrich Putin's war machine made this a serious national security issue. Johnson wanted to know WHY Biden had signed the EO just weeks earlier. 'I didn't do that,' Biden insisted. But in fact, he had. Johnson suggested that Biden's staff print the EO, so that the two of them could read it together. Biden finally, but vaguely, acknowledged signing the order. But as PJ Media columnist Matt Margolis noted, it soon 'became evident that the President had no grasp' of actually having signed the EO, or of the implications of having done so. 'I thought, we're in serious trouble. Who is running the country?' Margolis quoted Johnson. 'I don't know who put the paper in front of him, but he didn't know,' either, Johnson added. 'This exchange underscores a chilling reality,' Margolis wrote. We had a president who not only was 'struggling to remember critical decisions' but was also 'unable to engage fully in high-stakes discussions with national security implications.' Biden was clearly 'not fully in charge.' When did that incapacity actually set in? And what does that imply for dozens, perhaps hundreds, of executive actions, regulatory sign-offs and presidential signatures enacting legislation into law? Are they still valid? Or have some (or many) been rendered null and void, because President Biden was no longer in control of his mental faculties? Or because he was enfeebled enough that he was subject to improper influence by staffers who were pursuing agendas even more radical than the president would have agreed to, had he actually been 'in charge,' including staffers who might benefit from certain presidential decisions? Executive Orders can be reversed by EOs signed by a successor president. President Trump did that with a flurry of signatures during his first week in office. Formal rulemakings must go through a more lengthy and thorough process but can still be undone or rewritten by another administration. That will certainly be the case with the Obama EPA's 'Endangerment Finding,' declaring that plant-fertilizing, planetary-life-giving carbon dioxide 'endangers human health and welfare.' However, the Biden Administration promulgated 3,248 final rules and regulations – a record 107,262 Federal Register pages. They reflect President Biden's determination to exert federal control over nearly every aspect of climate change, 'equity and social justice,' economic and environmental issues, and our daily lives – including 'efficiency' rules for cars, stoves, dishwashers, furnaces and water heaters. Many of these rulemakings will undoubtedly be examined and reversed under the Congressional Review Act. Others will fall outside its purview and require more than Trump Executive Orders. And what about Biden's pardons, many of them murderers and hardened criminals; others convicted offenders like his son; still others people who haven't yet been charged or convicted of crimes but were given preemptive pardons, in case prosecutors later decide no one should be above the law? Still more complicated will be legislation, such as the multi-trillion-dollar, pork-laden, Green-New-Deal-subsidizing Inflation Reduction Act, the $1-trillion infrastructure law, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and many others signed by Mr. Biden. If they merit revision or recission, must Congress and President Trump go through an entire legislative process – and overcome almost certain Democrat 'resistance' – to change or cancel them? Or do some of these Biden Era laws (and regulations and pardons) fall within the parameters of a wills and estates 'unsound mind' analog? If so, at what point was President Biden too cognitively impaired to know what he was agreeing to or signing? Who makes that determination, and on what basis? It's definitely a case of first impression, and the outcomes are far from easy, ensured or predictable. But it's also another way for President Trump and Republicans to reexamine extreme Biden Era decisions. I went to law school, was licensed in two states, practiced mostly legislative and regulatory law, even wrote a couple of Supreme Court briefs. But mostly I've been a policy wonk – pondering, developing, promoting, opposing, and implementing or rejecting public policies. The Biden cognitive issue reminds me of humorist Will Rogers' answer to the threat of World War I German U-boats that were savaging Allied shipping. Rogers proposed that the US Navy 'heat the Atlantic Ocean to the boiling point. Then, when the ocean gets too hot for them German subs to stay underwater, they'll have to come to the surface' and we can 'pick 'em off one by one.' Of course, he averred, some admirals were likely to ask how they were supposed to boil the ocean. Rogers had an answer. 'I leave that to the technicians. Myself, I'm a policy man.' Like Will Rogers, I'm just presenting policy ideas. It's up to President Trump, Congress, courts and neuropsychologists to figure out how to implement them.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fT31-hlTYelyI	2025-02-02T16:42:50-08:00	
Al Qaeda Rules Syria: US And NATO Whitewash Their Terrorist Proxi...	The new rulers of Syria are presented by Western governments and media as 'rebels' and 'reformed militants' who are trying to bring law and order to the Arab country. Author and human rights lawyer Dan Kovalik says the Western powers are whitewashing a terrorist regime that is imposing a reign of terror on the Syrian population. The new rulers of Syria are presented by Western governments and media as 'rebels' and 'reformed militants' who are trying to bring law and order to the Arab country. Author and human rights lawyer Dan Kovalik says the Western powers are whitewashing a terrorist regime that is imposing a reign of terror on the Syrian population. Kovalik has just visited the country on a fact-finding mission. He toured the capital, Damascus, as well as the outlying countryside. He witnessed firsthand minority groups living in fear of violent retribution from the now-dominant militant factions who profess an extremist version of Sharia Law. Kovalik corroborates disturbing alternative reports filtering out of Syria of executions, lynchings and other atrocities meted out by the terrorist militia whom the West complacently calls 'rebels'. Christians, Alawites and Shia Muslims are in grave danger from the new rulers of Syria headed up by de facto leader Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa (also known as Mohammed al-Julani). He is head of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) faction. HTS evolved out of Al Qaeda, Islamic State and Al Nusra Front. All these groups are officially on the US and West’s designated terrorist list. But that designation is part of the charade whereby the Western governments have covertly sponsored these groups as proxies for geopolitical interests. Syria’s de facto ruler al-Sharaa (al-Jolani) was up to recently on the US wanted terrorist list with a $10 million reward for his capture. Since taking over Syria in December, the US has de-listed him after Washington delegates met in Damascus in recent weeks to discuss restoring diplomatic relations and carving up the resources of the war-torn Levantine territory. The US military already illegally occupies oil and agriculturally rich land in Syria. Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock was also quick to travel to Damascus to greet the new regime and talk up business opportunities. There should be no surprise in all of this. For years the Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist groups in Syria were the proxies for the United States and its NATO allies deployed to overthrow the government of President Bashar al-Assad in a dirty covert war for regime change. Western media are depicting the downfall of Assad as a liberation from dictatorship. That’s a tall order given that the 'liberators' are terror groups that inflicted unspeakable violence on the Syrian population during the Western-backed proxy war. Dan Kovalik attests that Al Qaeda (and its variants) is now in government in Syria – the very organization that the US and its Western allies supposedly fought against in a global 'war on terror'. He warns that Syria is facing dark and dangerous times ahead as minority communities fear for their lives. But the Western governments and media are whitewashing the terrorist regime with blood on their hands. The cover-up is made all the more urgent because the West is fully complicit in the destruction of Syria. Kovalik is the author of several books published by Skyhorse Publishing. His titles include The Plot to Scapegoat Russia, The Case for Palestine, The Plot to Overthrow Venezuela, and No More War… How the West Violates International Law by Using ‘Humanitarian’ Intervention to Advance Economic and Strategic Interests	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fT6FCFsuWCKvr	2025-02-02T16:41:21-08:00	
Russian Energy Looms Large In EU’s Planning – OpEd	By Andrew Hammond Since the start of the Ukraine war, the EU has sharply increased its focus on energy security, reaching many new gas deals, particularly with the US and Middle Eastern countries. However, as EU leaders prepare for any potential deal between Moscow and Kyiv, whether that comes in 2025 or beyond, the thorny question of the future role of cheaper Russian gas in the European energy mix is arising once again.New EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen has pledged to end the bloc’s energy ties with Russia by 2027. But there is a debate underway in Brussels on whether Russian gas pipeline sales to Europe should be restarted as part of any Ukraine war settlement with Moscow. The proponents of such a move assert that it could help boost the continent’s economic competitiveness, as gas prices in Europe are often three to four times higher than in the US.However, such discussions have already prompted fury from some of the staunchest opponents of Russian President Vladimir Putin. These include the Baltic states, Poland and Slovenia.For as long as Putin remains in power, Moscow will be seen by much of Europe as a pariah state. For sure, some EU countries, including Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria, may significantly increase their energy reliance on Moscow. However, it is likely that many current European leaders will resist.Even if the Ukraine war ends in 2025, some EU sanctions against Russia will likely remain for as long as Putin is in power. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Western sanctions were already in place as a result of the country’s violations of international law, including the 2014 annexation of Crimea.The backstory for this intense debate is the 27 EU members’ huge pivot away from Russian energy since 2022, even though liquefied natural gas imports from Russia to Europe remain stubbornly high. Within a year of Moscow’s invasion, the EU’s energy consumption changed so rapidly that Russia was no longer the bloc’s main gas supplier — a remarkable change. Correspondingly, the EU member states have more aggressively taken on the challenge of diversifying to new energy sources. The RePowerEU strategy is being delivered — in part — by scaling up the use of clean energy and reducing overall energy consumption. This has helped the EU generate, at times, more electricity from wind and solar sources than from gas. However, while the EU is eager to expand its clean energy production, the current volumes fall far short of meeting the continent’s needs entirely.To reduce its reliance on Russian energy, the EU has worked hard to secure many new deals since February 2022. The European Council on Foreign Relations Energy Deals Tracker shows that the bloc’s members have mostly focused on securing new supplies of gas as a transitional energy source amid the long-term movement toward clean energy. About 45 percent of the approximately 180 deals that the EU and its member states have struck since 2022 concern gas, including LNG.The tracker also shows that the EU country that has struck the most deals is Germany on 43, which is more than double the tallies of Italy (21) and Hungary (20). This is unsurprising, given that Germany is the bloc’s largest economy and was the biggest importer of Russian gas before the Ukraine war. Other countries in double digits in terms of the number of new energy deals include France, Bulgaria and Greece, each of which are on 10.The leading counterparties are the US (35) and the UAE (24). The fact that the US tops this list is reflected in the significantly increased share of the EU’s LNG the country now provides. This comes in the context of new US President Donald Trump urging Europe to buy even more US gas to ward off any potential new tariffs under his administration.In this context, it is questionable if it would make sense for Trump to push hard for Russian gas imports in any Moscow-Kyiv peace deal, as it would go against America’s LNG export interests. With the US having taken over as Europe’s top LNG supplier, letting more Russian gas back in would hurt its market share and weaken its influence.One other factor to note in this key policy debate is that Europe’s intensive energy diplomacy of recent years has gone a long way toward helping deliver energy security for the bloc. However, it is complicating the EU’s energy transition pathway, which is key given the bloc’s ambition to become the first net-zero region by 2050. In part, this is because the new gas infrastructure that has been invested in will require a medium-to-long-term horizon to secure value for money. Correspondingly, EU nations will need to do much more to invest in clean energy infrastructure if they are to fully deliver on sustainably decarbonizing their economies in the crucial years to come.

Shut Down US Department Of Education? Rep. Thomas Massie Has A Bi...	Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) introduced a bill on Friday that would implement the repeatedly expressed desire of President Donald Trump to shut down the United States Department of Education. Shutting down the Department of Education and moving education decisions out of the control of the US government were actions Trump proposed on multiple occasions through his presidential campaign. Then, on November 19 after winning the presidential election, Trump concluded his written statement announcing his nomination of Linda McMahon to be secretary of the Department of Education with his statement: 'We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES, and Linda will spearhead that effort.' Later, in a Washington, DC rally the day before his presidential inauguration, Trump declared in regarding his nomination of McMahon: I said, Linda, I’m making you the Secretary of Education. But if you do a great job, you will put yourself out of a job because you’re going to be sending it back to the states. Massie introduced his Department of Education ending bill (HR 899) on Friday. The short, to the point bill reads in full: SECTION 1: TERMINATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2026. Upon introduction, HR 899 had 27 original cosponsors — all Republicans. Expect more cosponsors to keep signing on over the coming weeks. Massie’s bill is the simple and straightforward way to accomplish the goal Trump has been promoting. Massie is an Advisory Board member for the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.

India: Delhi Assembly Elections 2025 – OpEd	After a three-decade hiatus, BJP likely to regain power. Delhi elections set the stage for INDIA Bloc collapse This year, India's most important annual economic event - presentation of the national annual budget 2025-26 - has been overshadowed by the whirlwind campaigns of its three major political parties fighting to assert electoral dominance in Delhi elections slated for February 5th. Power corridors are abuzz with speculation of who will wear the crown in the national capital, with only a day left for voting to take place. Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the national ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Indian National Congress (INC) have intensified their campaigns and rhetoric as Delhi witnesses one of its fiercest political battles. Evidently, the ensuing polls to capture power in Delhi are presenting a really tough fight for the present ruling AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, which has been in power for a decade now. BJP, which has been out of power in Delhi since 1998, is making a strong push to regain power in the national capital, leaving no stones unturned to woo the electorate. The Congress, which lost power to Kejriwal in 2013 and has since struggled to remain relevant in Delhi politics, is led by Rahul Gandhi, and is struggling in vain to reclaim its lost ground. Interestingly, AAP which came to power on a strong anti-corruption plank and swept the economically weak sections of society off their feet with its education and health schemes, along with free electricity and water, is now facing severe anti-incumbency. The party’s top leadership is also accused of being enveloped in many corruption scandals. In an assembly strength of 70 seats, the AAP had notched 67 and 62 seats, in the last two elections. Their populist schemes such as free bus rides for women had helped a great deal in garnering support among women voters. This time, AAP is in for strong competition from the other two parties on announcement of freebies and subsidies. Both BJP and Congress have made similar promises, causing AAP to lose its exclusivity when it comes to freebies. While Modi’s BJP is seen as a party that has given a major push to developmental and infrastructure projects, AAP is seen to be completely lacking on this front. Added to this is the fact that the BJP has achieved better penetration across different voter segments this time and along with its political mentor the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), it has made major inroads into the jhuggi-jhonpdi (slum) clusters. However, political pundits say that the biggest negative for the BJP is the fact that it has not projected any of its senior leaders as their chief ministerial candidate. Some of the senior local leaders have also admitted that there is deep factionalism within the state unit and this has always been the reason why the party has repeatedly failed to win Delhi. People have also questioned the choice of candidates that have been selected, alleging that the most suitable party workers have not been given a chance to fight. Noteworthy is the fact that the Congress, which has been in and out of power in the capital, is now fighting a battle for its survival. Although they are projecting that the party is campaigning aggressively, insiders say that they have narrowed down their concentration to a mere 25 seats where they have deployed manpower as well as other resources to gain traction. Election specialists say that Congress may marginally improve its vote share performance, but this will definitely not help them to win any seats. Many political observers go to the extent of saying that the Congress may just end up in this election with a big zero. What seems to be the writing on the wall is that the ensuing Delhi elections will expose the fractures in the common alliance platform of the Opposition parties, the INDIA Bloc. Both AAP and Congress are members of the INDIA alliance but are now locked in a bitter battle with each other with outlandish name-calling and sweeping allegations against each other’s top leadership. West Bengal ruling TMC and Uttar Pradesh’s erstwhile ruling Samajwadi Party, both members of the INDIA Bloc, have announced their support for AAP, excluding the Congress party. The Delhi election campaigns have disillusioned the INDIA Bloc allies who are disintegrating and drifting away from the Congress. They are equivocal in seeking change of leadership in the Congress party, especially their despair in accepting Rahul Gandhi as the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. On the other hand, the BJP, under the leadership of Narendra Modi, has been winning all seven parliamentary seats in Delhi in the last three elections. The contest this time involves the BJP versus the rest, which includes the ruling AAP and an inconsequential Congress. While AAP will surely put up a strong fight, Congress will work to its detriment by turning each seat into a triangular fight. Delhi’s political landscape, shaped by two consecutive AAP sweeps in 2015 and 2020, now stands at a critical juncture as the BJP pulls out all the stops to make a winning comeback after nearly three decades.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fT_IGg4NdYvKo	2025-02-02T16:21:32-08:00	
US Nuclear Generators Import Nearly All Uranium Concentrate They ...	(EIA) -- In 2023, U.S. nuclear generators used 32 million pounds of imported uranium concentrate (U3O8) and only 0.05 million pounds of domestically produced U3O8. Imports accounted for 99% of the U3O8 they used in 2023 to make nuclear fuel. Foreign producers predominantly supply the U.S. front-end nuclear fuel cycle, but federal policies have been implemented recently to build out the domestic U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently received $2.7 billion in congressional funding to help revive domestic fuel production for commercial nuclear power plants. U3O8 is chemically extracted from uranium ore that has been mined and milled. The fine powder is packaged in steel drums and later enriched and processed further to prepare it for use as fuel in nuclear reactors. U.S. production of U3O8 in the third quarter of 2024 totaled 121,296 pounds, a 24% increase from production of 97,709 pounds in the second quarter. Production in the third quarter occurred at five U.S. facilities: three in Wyoming (Nichols Ranch ISR Project, Lost Creek Project, and Smith Ranch-Highland Operation) and two in Texas (Alta Mesa Project and Rosita). In 2023, the United States imported U3O8 and equivalents primarily from Canada, Australia, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. The origin of U3O8 used in U.S. nuclear reactors could change in the coming years. In May 2024, the United States banned imports of uranium products from Russia beginning in August, although companies may apply for waivers through January 1, 2028.

Game Of Chequers: Starmer, Scholz And The ‘British Paradox’	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- If Olaf Scholz and Keir Starmer needed a reason to justify their meeting on Sunday, Donald Trump delivered it right on cue. Overnight, the American president made good on his promise to slap new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. The EU would follow soon, he warned. Both Britain and the EU agree by now that they’d rather face this new US government together than alone, and that reconnecting some of the ties cut by Brexit would help. 'It is very important that we work closely together between the UK and the EU when it comes to how we develop the wider relationship with the US,' Chancellor Scholz said on Sunday, when asked about Trump’s tariffs, calling it a 'good moment' for London and Brussels to improve relations. Starmer, Britain's Labour prime minister, has been seeking closer coordination with EU allies since taking office last year, eyeing a comprehensive deal with Brussels. This was also a key goal of Sunday’s bilateral meeting at the prime minister’s countryside residence in Chequers, according to German government sources. Starmer’s prolonged EU love fest is expected to continue on Monday, when he will become the first prime minister since Brexit to attend a meeting of the European Council. The session will focus on reinforcing security ties. But sealing Starmer’s promised comprehensive 'reset’ of EU-UK relations will be more complicated. The tricky relationship between Britain and Germany, the largest EU economy, illustrates how many prickly obstacles still stand in the way. Don’t say ‘Rejoin’ Five years after the UK ended its EU chapter on 31 January 2020, 55% of Britons think the UK should get closer to the EU again. Only 10% prefer a distant relationship, according to a recent survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations. Improved defence, security, and trade relations would help buffer the fallout if America becomes a less reliable partner. Starmer could use the boost as he struggles to achieve his ambitious growth targets, which suffered setbacks in recent weeks as Britain‘s borrowing costs spiked, indicating lagging investor confidence. But the devil is in the detail. This is particularly evident on migration. Both sides share an interest in managing the ebb and flow of legal and illegal arrivals, but Brexit has caused many inefficiencies. Most strikingly, companies on one side the Channel that need a few hours of support from specialist workers from the other, need to wait at least three weeks for a visa. But this is also where Germany's and Britain's preferences clash. The German government champions a 'youth mobility scheme', which would allow young people to move more freely between the two countries. Starmer's government is hypersensitive to suggestions that any of the dreaded obligations of EU membership could come back. Anything that resembles a return to European freedom of movement is a red flag. The Germans' vocal lobbying for a youth mobility scheme has annoyed some in Downing Street. The day of Scholz's visit to Chequers, The Times cited anonymous sources who complained about the German ambassador in London and his 'unhelpful briefings' on the matter. Sorry, no cherries Meanwhile, Britain's tendency to cherry-pick has Brussels on alert. Starmer's conservative predecessors tried to strike up bilateral mobility deals with advanced EU economies, such as Germany, according to one source familiar with the matter, as immigration from poorer Eastern European countries was a Brexiteer scapegoat during the Brexit referendum. The advances were turned down by Berlin and other capitals, where attempts to 'divide and conquer' are a no-no, the source told Euractiv. Give EU up? Under Starmer, Britain and Germany had made progress on striking their first-ever bilateral friendship treaty, which would have provided a framework for closer parliamentary and cultural cooperation. Negotiations were on track to conclude last month. But then Germany's government broke down and negotiations were put on hold – at the latest until a new government is formed, which could take until late spring. Such agreements are little more than window dressing anyway. As Starmer well knows, making tangible progress will mean dealing with the EU-27 directly. That requires a nogotiating mandate from the EU capitals, which they are not expected to issue before a joint summit, currently expected in April or May. The question of where to start may already divide the 27 EU countries. Should a cooperation agreement on security be front-loaded in a separate deal, that would be easier to sell in Britain, but less popular with some EU countries like France? Or should the matter be queued as one of many subjects in a comprehensive deal? In other words, the problem is the old British paradox. 'I do want to see a close relationship on defence and security, on energy, on trade and our economy,' Starmer said at Chequers, before adding a big 'but'. Reaping the benefits of EU cooperation must 'not involve a return to the EU'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fTymLmjAsogzc	2025-02-02T16:15:12-08:00	
Trump Orders First Military Action Of New Term, Targets IS Affili...	(RFE/RL) -- U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered military strikes on a senior 'attack planner' of the Islamic State (IS) extremist group in Somalia who had been hiding with other members in the impoverished East African nation. The action on February 1 marked the first military action carried out by Trump since he took office for his second term on January 20. 'These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our Allies,' Trump said in a statement. 'The strikes destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians.' Trump added that the U.S. military had targeted the attack planner for years but that it was not able to take the person out until his term. The target was not identified by name. Defense chief Pete Hegseth said an initial assessment indicated 'multiple' militants were killed in the attacks. No civilians were hurt, he added. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said he was informed of the air strike and that he extended his 'deepest gratitude for the unwavering support of the United States in our shared fight against terrorism.' Mohamud said U.S. counterterrorism efforts are 'highly valued and welcomed in Somalia' and he praised what he called Trump’s 'bold and decisive leadership.' The Puntland state information minister, Mohamud Aidid Dirir, told Reuters that the strike took place in the Cal Miskaad Mountains within the Golis range. 'The number of casualties is still unknown as it was dark. But our forces on the front line could hear the sound of explosions,' he said. The IS affiliate in Somalia has faced counterterrorism actions in the form of U.S. air strikes and attacks by Somali security forces, but it still remains active, mainly in the Puntland region. The U.S. military -- under both Republican and Democratic administrations -- has carried out air strikes in Somalia in the past, targeting terrorist hideouts. U.S. action in Somalia is perhaps best known from the 2001 movie 'Black Hawk Down,' the story about a U.S. helicopter shot down in Mogadishu during the country's civil war in 1993. Some of the U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Africa have suffered as Chad and Niger -- two former partners -- demanded that U.S. forces exit their countries. Russia has in recent years moved to increase its influence in the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fTxTLGxm2h2nz	2025-02-02T16:07:13-08:00	
Brazil: Over 2,000 Workers Rescued From Slave-Like Labor In 2024	By Paula Laboissiere In 2024, Brazil´s Ministry of Labor and Employment conducted 1,035 inspections to combat slave-like labor. These operations led to the rescue of 2,004 workers in degrading conditions and secured BRL 7,061,526.03 in labor and severance payments. In a statement, the ministry reported that the fight against slave-like labor in 2024 benefited a total of 5,741 workers, including those whose rights— even if not classified as contemporary slave-like labor—were verified and upheld through the efforts of labor inspectors. The sectors with the highest number of workers rescued were construction (293), coffee cultivation (214), onion cultivation (194), land preparation, cultivation, and harvesting (120), and horticulture—excluding strawberries—(84). 'These figures highlight a notable increase in the number of workers rescued in urban areas, which represented 30 percent of the total identified as being in slave-like conditions in 2024,' the ministry stated. In 2024, the labor inspectorate carried out 22 targeted inspections in the domestic sector, leading to the rescue of 19 workers. Inspection actions The states with the highest number of tax actions in 2024 were São Paulo (191), Minas Gerais (136), Rio Grande do Sul (82), Paraná (42), and both Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro (41 each). In terms of worker rescues, the leading states were Minas Gerais (500), São Paulo (467), Bahia (198), Goiás (155), Pernambuco (137), and Mato Grosso do Sul (105). Each rescued worker is entitled by law to Unemployment Insurance for Rescued Workers, paid in three installments of one minimum wage each. This benefit, along with the labor rights secured from employers, aims to provide essential support for workers to rebuild their lives. 'Today, we are internationally recognized by the UN [United Nations] and the International Labour Organization as a model of best practices in implementing public policy to eradicate slave-like labor,' said the ministry's general inspection coordinator, André Esposito. Ana Carolina Alli, intern under the supervision of Marcelo Brandão, contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fTxdQg8neiB2t	2025-02-02T16:01:31-08:00	
Germany’s February 2025 Election: A Political Turning Point With ...	The German Federal Election on February 23, 2025, is set to have significant implications both domestically and internationally. With the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) projected to win 222 out of 630 seats, they will emerge as the largest party but will fall short of the majority required to govern independently. Given their refusal to work with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is expected to secure 146 seats, the CDU will need to form a coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Green Party to establish a functioning government. This political landscape presents several challenges, including coalition complexities, ideological differences, and the broader impact on European and global affairs. The outcome of this election will shape Germany’s political direction, economic policies, and international standing, making it a pivotal event for both the country and the wider world. Germany has long been regarded as the anchor of stability in the European Union (EU), playing a leading role in shaping policies on economic growth, security, and climate action. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government, led by the SPD, has faced growing discontent due to economic stagnation and dissatisfaction with immigration policies, leading to a decline in SPD support. The CDU, under the leadership of Friedrich Merz, has capitalized on this discontent, promising a return to economic conservatism, stricter migration policies, and enhanced national security measures. Polling data from late 2024 indicates that the CDU has gained momentum, outpacing the SPD, which is projected to win fewer than 150 seats, while the Greens are expected to secure approximately 100 seats. Meanwhile, the AfD’s increasing support, particularly in eastern Germany, highlights the growing appeal of nationalist and anti-immigration rhetoric among certain segments of the population. One of the most pressing challenges facing Germany post-election is the difficulty of coalition formation. The CDU has firmly ruled out any alliance with the AfD, citing fundamental ideological differences and the party’s controversial positions on immigration, EU membership, and historical revisionism. This leaves the CDU with the SPD and the Greens as potential partners, but forming a coalition with them presents its own set of difficulties. The SPD and Greens advocate for progressive social policies, aggressive climate action, and increased public spending—positions that contrast sharply with the CDU’s emphasis on fiscal conservatism and traditional values. Negotiations between these parties will require significant compromise, particularly on key policy areas such as taxation, defense spending, and Germany’s stance within the EU. Beyond coalition negotiations, Germany faces mounting economic challenges that will test any new government. Economic forecasts for 2024 indicated sluggish growth, with GDP expansion hovering around 0.7%, hindered by high energy costs, an aging workforce, and declining industrial output. Inflation, while reduced from its peak in 2022, continues to be a concern, particularly in sectors such as housing and food. The CDU has proposed pro-business policies, including corporate tax reductions and deregulation, to stimulate investment. However, the SPD and Greens favor increased social spending and green energy subsidies, raising concerns over potential fiscal disagreements within a coalition. These economic divergences will require a carefully negotiated economic strategy to ensure stability and growth while addressing social inequalities. In addition to economic concerns, Germany’s role within the EU and on the global stage remains a critical factor in this election. The country has been a staunch supporter of EU integration, but rising nationalist sentiments, fueled by the AfD and elements within the CDU, have sparked debates over sovereignty and Brussels’ influence on German policies. The war in Ukraine has further complicated Germany’s foreign policy stance, with ongoing debates about military aid and energy independence from Russia. A CDU-led government is likely to continue supporting Ukraine but may face internal pressure to adopt a more pragmatic approach to energy security and diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, tensions with China over trade and supply chain dependencies add another layer of complexity to Germany’s international strategy. The ability of the next government to navigate these geopolitical challenges while maintaining strong EU leadership will be crucial for Germany’s global standing. The rise of the AfD poses another major challenge to Germany’s political stability. Despite the CDU’s rejection of any partnership with the far-right party, the AfD’s growing support signals increasing polarization among the electorate. The party’s anti-immigration platform, Euroscepticism, and nationalist rhetoric have resonated with voters disillusioned with traditional parties. In several eastern German states, the AfD has already become the dominant political force, raising concerns about regional divisions within the country. The mainstream parties face the difficult task of addressing voter frustrations without legitimizing the AfD’s controversial positions. This challenge extends to the broader European context, where far-right movements have gained traction in countries such as France and Italy, threatening the cohesion of the EU. Climate policy is another contentious issue that will shape Germany’s political future. The Greens have been strong advocates for aggressive environmental measures, including phasing out coal, expanding renewable energy infrastructure, and imposing stricter emissions regulations. While the SPD has generally supported these initiatives, the CDU has called for a more balanced approach that prioritizes economic stability alongside climate goals. The challenge for a CDU-led coalition will be finding common ground on climate policies that satisfy Green Party demands while maintaining competitiveness in industrial sectors. The potential scaling back of ambitious climate targets could create friction within the EU, where Germany has been a driving force in sustainability efforts. In the broader context, the outcome of Germany’s election will influence Europe’s political trajectory. The EU faces multiple crises, from economic stagnation to geopolitical tensions with Russia and China. Germany’s new government will play a decisive role in shaping EU policies on trade, defense, and energy independence. A fragmented coalition could weaken Germany’s influence in Brussels, complicating efforts to address pressing European challenges. Moreover, the election will be closely watched by international allies, including the United States, which relies on Germany as a key partner in NATO and global security initiatives. Ultimately, the 2025 German federal election is not just about forming a new government; it is about defining the country’s future direction in a rapidly changing world. The CDU’s expected victory, while significant, does not guarantee smooth governance, as coalition negotiations will determine the effectiveness of the next administration. Economic uncertainties, political polarization, and foreign policy challenges will require adept leadership and strategic compromises. Germany’s ability to maintain stability and assert its role within Europe and beyond will depend on how effectively the next government navigates these complex issues. The decisions made in the coming months will shape not only Germany’s domestic policies but also its position as a global power, making this election one of the most consequential in recent history.

Trump: Americans Could Face ‘Pain’ With New Tariffs On Key Tradin...	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that Americans may face economic 'pain' because of new tariffs he is imposing on the country’s three biggest trading partners —Canada, China and Mexico — but contended that it would be 'worth the price' to bolster U.S. interests. Despite sharing a free-trade pact he negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term in office, Trump on Saturday imposed 25% tariffs on the two countries set to take effect Tuesday, and hit China with a new 10% levy in addition to already enacted tariffs. Trump claimed the three countries were not doing enough to halt illegal immigration and the deadly opioid fentanyl from entering the United States. In Truth Social posts early Sunday, Trump acknowledged American consumers could face higher prices because of the tariffs. U.S. companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers rather than absorb their extra expenses themselves. But Trump aimed most of his comments at Canada, targeting one of the U.S.’s closest allies. The U.S. Census Bureau said the U.S. had a $55 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. 'Why? There is no reason,' Trump contended. 'We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use.' 'Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!' Trump said. He said, 'Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name, continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into AMERICA. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!' With the new tariffs, Trump said, 'Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!) But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.' Trump aides had previously shied from acknowledging that tariffs could raise U.S. consumer prices. Nationwide polls in the U.S. showed that consumer frustration over rising prices during the last four years were a major factor in his November election victory over Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump has since acknowledged that it will not be easy to curb higher grocery prices. Trump put the new tariff on energy imports from Canada at 10%, apparently seeking to limit an increase in fuel and electricity prices. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that his country would hit back with 25% percent levies of its own on select American goods worth $106.6 billion, with a first round on Tuesday followed by a second one in three weeks. Leaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of U.S. liquor purchases, and more specifically, orange juice produced in the U.S. state of Florida, whiskey in Tennessee and peanut butter in Kentucky, three states Trump won in last November’s election and all represented by Republicans, like Trump, in the U.S. Senate. Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., told ABC’s 'This Week' show, 'We’re really disappointed' and 'perplexed' by Trump’s actions and said she hoped that Trump would back off before Tuesday. But she acknowledged that 'it’s really in the president’s hands' whether that happens. She said that 'less than 1% of illegal immigrants' entering the U.S. travel across its northern border with Canada. She said Canada has invested 'in a lot of equipment' to curb unauthorized border crossings and conducted joint exercises with the U.S. to catch migrants. 'It’s hard to know what more we could do,' she said. 'We’re not at all interested in escalating' a trade war with the U.S., where she said 99% of the trade is currently tariff-free. 'We’re eager to build on that.' Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had directed her economy minister to 'implement Plan B,' which includes yet-unspecified 'tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,' without specifying what U.S. goods her government will target. U.S. exports to Mexico totaled more than $322 billion in 2023, Census Bureau data showed, while the U.S. imported more than $475 billion worth of Mexican products. Sheinbaum assailed Trump’s contention that her government had joined forces with drug cartels, a claim he made in announcing the tariff increases. 'We categorically reject the White House’s slanderous claim that the Mexico government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempt to intervene in our territory,' Sheinbaum wrote on X. 'If there is anywhere that such an alliance in fact exists, it is in the United States gun factories that sell high-powered weapons to these criminal groups.' China denounced the new tariffs on its exports, with Beijing saying it would challenge them at the World Trade Organization and take unspecified 'countermeasures.' The U.S. had a $279 billion trade deficit with China in 2023, the largest figure for any of its trading partners. That response stopped short of the immediate escalation that had marked China’s trade showdown with Trump during his first term as president. China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that Trump’s move 'seriously violates' international trade rules, urging the U.S. to 'engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation.' Trump has also often threatened new tariffs against the European Union. A spokesperson for the bloc said Sunday that it would 'respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fT5BoB-mSaVzK	2025-02-02T15:55:37-08:00	
Alliance Of Sahel States Stepping Forward With Common Economic An...	On January 29, 2025, within rapidly geopolitical changes in West African region, three landlocked countries namely Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, members of the newly created Alliance of Sahel States (AES), declared their withdrawal from the most influential bloc - Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The first implication was that 2025 marks the 50th year of the establishment of ECOWAS. Undoubtedly, it will simultaneously remain in history of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) as the period of their exit from the 50-year-old regional bloc, established by the Treaty of Lagos in May 1975. Perhaps, ECOWAS has been fractured with uncertain future. On the other side, the AES will seemingly grow in strength as republics of Côte d'Ivoire, Chad, Ghana and Senegal have shown signs of unswerving support for the newly-created security organisation in the region. Despite broader criticisms and emerging challenges, AES has the capacity to forge expected integration and to tackle existing diverse obstacles while navigating further for strategic external collaboration. The Alliance of Sahel States (AES) was established on September 16, 2023 with the signing of the Liptako-Gourma Charter by the States of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. These three countries share the cross-border region of West Africa and the Sahel called 'Liptako-Gourma' from which it derives the symbolic name of the Charter. It is a collective defense bloc aimed at countering any military intervention or any external threat including terrorism and with the ambition of economic integration. Since last year, the AES has focused on structuring projects in the fields of energy, infrastructure, transport and food security. The trio aims to create an economic and monetary union, as well as its own currency which should be based on the natural resources of the member countries in the Confederation. The collective initiatives undeniably are at the formative stage, fostering consciousness on structuring operations and functional directions notwithstanding the multiple roadblocks from ECOWAS. That however, worthy to indicate here that particular concern emerging from different regional organisations and the African Union underscores the rising assertiveness of AES. At a glance, Burkina Faso is a driving force, while Mali and Niger have, in practical sense, shown the pathways for evolutionary influence as well as shaping a codified dynamism to hold the alliance in form towards achieving its primary security objectives and economic development aspirations. For over a year, their joint effective strategy has been working, and the collective divorce from ECOWAS late January 2025 was an irreversible factor, that was based on the fact that ECOWAS has unprecedented weaknesses, combined with historical record-breaking failure in its mandate to maintain regional security. In short, the rising insecurity situation has undermined regional cooperation, set the stage for dissatisfaction among the member states. With the sudden withdrawal from the 15-member ECOWAS, it is understandable Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have attained the collective independence, and prepared to form this new forward-looking regional partnership bloc popularly referred to AES. ECOWAS and African Union's Reactions Reactions from both the ECOWAS and African Union (AU) were 'business as usual' characterized by official administrative statements. Late January after the three French-speaking West African States officially exited, the Peacekeeping and Regional Security Commission of ECOWAS said the remaining members tentatively had agreed to 'keep ECOWAS doors open' by recognizing national passports and identity bearing the bloc's logo from the countries, to continue trade under existing regional agreement, and to continue diplomatic cooperation with the countries. The statement noted that the withdrawal of Burkina Faso, the Republic of Mali and the Republic of Niger from ECOWAS has become effective on 29th January 2025. While the Regional Security Commission has set up a structure to facilitate discussions on these modalities with each of the three countries, its official statement categorically noted the following: a) recognize National passports and identity cards bearing ECOWAS logo held by the citizens of Burkina Faso, the Republic of Mali and the Republic of Niger, until further notice. b) continue to treat goods and services coming from the three countries in accordance with the ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme (ETLS) and investment policy. c) allow citizens of the three affected countries to continue to enjoy the right of visa free movement, residence and establishment in accordance with the ECOWAS protocols until further notice. d) provide full support and cooperation to ECOWAS officials from the three countries in the course of their assignments for the Community. In addition to above-mentioned developments, the Political, Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU) headquartered in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, has also expressed high-level concern over the deteriorating standing of ECOWAS as a regional bloc and the security situation in West Africa region. The AU, of course, raised an unequivocal condemnation of the final decision and withdrawal of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from ECOWAS. But factually, the AU's reaction was distinctively similar, in terms of administrative and bureaucratic wording of the official statement, mostly for the sake of filling in the space, under-estimated the long-term repercussions and impact on the developments in the region. Reaffirming solidarity by the African Union with ECOWAS in enforcing its mandate and high-lightening the importance durable peace, security, and sustainable development as enshrined or stipulated in the documents. The AU employed such phrases as 'respecting the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity' contained their established documents of ECOWAS. Endowed Natural Resources In any case, understanding economic potentiality and sustainability is crucial at this stage. The economic potential is huge, as Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger put together holds tremendous untapped resources. According to various sources, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger territorially share borders together and are landlocked countries in West Africa, in the Sahel region. They are geographically bio-diverse, which includes plentiful reserves of gold, manganese, copper and limestone, and other invaluable natural resources. The land mass is huge for traditional agriculture, but public infrastructures are poorly developed across the region of their location. Predominantly, the system of state governance combined with gross lack of finance are the main obstacles to sustaining development. As known in these African countries, the French adopted a form of indirect rule, allowing existing native structures to continue to exist within the colonial framework of governance. But now reawakening to the neo-colonial administration and opaque system of government control have a significant impact on current political development. Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, to some considerable extent have the human capital. The 2024 estimates of population have revealed that Burkina Faso has 22.5 million, Mali which is the eighth-largest country in Africa, has approximately 21.9 million people while Niger has 26.5 million. The UN Development Program Report (2024) ranked Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger as the Sahel countries with the lowest category of development index in the world. The future growth may only be sustained by the exploitation of natural resources and that must necessarily be tied to the development of the economy, building infrastructure and focus on reducing poverty in these French-speaking West African countries. Future Economic Implications AES has the capacity and commitment to address development shortfalls. Several development initiatives were already taken in this direction to stimulate the economic sectors, particularly in the priority areas of agriculture, livestock, health, and energy infrastructure. Burkina Faso currently stepping efforts in agricultural sector, while Mali and Niger restructuring roles of foreign players in exploiting mineral resources suc as gold and uranium. This allows greater economic and political autonomy in order to strengthen their sovereignty. Perhaps, they will further have the opportunity to pursue more economic policies in line with the existing realities dictated by the political environment and to bolster aspirations of maintaining stability across their landlocked region. Obviously, the AES is getting oriented towards multi-polarity, which is intended to be a more inclusive and concerted approach, where different countries and regions work together to find common solutions. By pursuing the principles of the multipolarity, world, the AES could engage in pragmatic win-win partnerships to advance their interests for the purposes of economic development and growth, and stability. The AES collective pledge further requires making collaborative efforts and, in a systematic manner, work towards sustainable development, find better chances for practical solutions to existing economic deficiencies. Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have to adopt strategic positions, first, in West Africa, and generally in Africa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fTxsfXy0ZSQNY	2025-02-02T15:51:34-08:00	
Oppression Of Russian Language In Ukraine: Tragedies And Dialecti...	This article addresses a painful topic that divides Ukraine — the promotion of the national language. The article may interest those who follow the development of freedom of speech and democracy in Eastern Europe. How democratic are the measures by which the Russian-speaking east of Ukraine is being fully Ukrainianized? And will the Russian language remain in Ukraine during the war with Russia? Since the full-scale invasion by Russia, and especially after the Bucha massacre, an old trend has gained momentum in Ukraine — the rejection of one’s native (often Russian) language in favor of Ukrainian. This can be understood from two perspectives. First, some Ukrainian civilians were subjected to torture by Russian soldiers, and the Russian language might remind them of those horrors. Second, to foster cultural opposition to Russia worldwide, the Ukrainian language has been actively promoted through media. A notable example is the performance by Kalush Orchestra at Eurovision 2022. Within Ukraine, the language has been championed by heroes — military personnel and everyday citizens. Even those untouched by the terror of the Russian army have switched to the national language in solidarity with the victims. 'The Bucha massacre (Ukr. Бучанська різанина) was a mass killing of civilians, accompanied by looting, abductions, and torture, carried out in March 2022 in the town of Bucha, Kyiv Oblast, and surrounding areas under Russian military control during the invasion. The events bear signs of war crimes and crimes against humanity, attributed to Russian military personnel.' - Wikipedia This trend was also influenced by authority figures: beloved schoolteachers, respected professors, popular bloggers, and cultural figures. They, too, were swept up by the wave of a new reality where empathy for the victims took on various forms. Over time, two natural groups emerged in Ukraine: those who switched to the national language and those who remained loyal to their native Russian language, even during the war with Russia. (A 2008 Gallup poll showed that 83% of respondents preferred to be interviewed in Russian, indicating its widespread use in everyday life.) This division often led to numerous public conflicts. One of the most striking incidents occurred in Lviv in 2023, where a young man from Odesa performed a song by the renowned Soviet rock musician Viktor Tsoi in its original Russian. For this, Ukrainian MP Natalia Pipa rebuked him, claiming he was singing in 'the language of the people who are killing me.' During their interaction, Pipa recorded the young man without his consent and called the police. This action violated both his right to privacy and the presumption of innocence, as she later posted the video on her Facebook page. In Ukraine, laws protect the right to privacy: The Constitution of Ukraine (Article 32): Guarantees the right to privacy, prohibiting the collection, storage, and dissemination of confidential information without consent. The Civil Code of Ukraine (Article 307): Permits filming an individual only with their consent, except in cases of public interest or public events. The Law of Ukraine on Personal Data Protection: Prohibits the dissemination of personal data without the subject’s consent. The presumption of innocence is enshrined in: The Constitution of Ukraine (Article 62): A person is considered innocent until proven guilty by law. The Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine (Article 17): Prohibits accusing a person without a court decision. I reviewed the musician’s actions for potential legal violations in Ukraine and found no grounds for accusing him of performing a song in Russian. The MP’s accusations seemed more like a political or moral gesture than a legally justified act. Why the accusation is baseless: Freedom of Expression: The Constitution of Ukraine (Article 34) guarantees the freedom to express views, including performing songs in any language. Language Law: The Law of Ukraine on Ensuring the Functioning of the Ukrainian Language as the State Language regulates the use of the state language in public spheres, such as education, government, and media. However, it does not prohibit the use of other languages for personal or creative performances, including street performances. Copyright Law: If the song was performed without commercial gain in a public place, it does not violate copyright laws, especially since Viktor Tsoi’s songs are widely performed in post-Soviet countries. Thus, the young man cannot be accused: Under language legislation. Under copyright laws. Under public safety concerns. The MP also filed a police report, leading to the young man recording a video apology. Following the publicity of the language conflict in Lviv, some public figures came to his defense. For instance, former adviser to the Office of the President of Ukraine, Oleksiy Arestovych, publicly sang a song in Russian and addressed the young man, affirming that he was not at fault. Next, I will attempt to analyze the situation through dialectical materialism to make a neutral forecast. Dialectical analysis allows us to view the conflict as an interaction of opposing phenomena: the desire to protect national identity and the rights of Russian-speaking citizens. This approach helps identify internal contradictions, historical prerequisites, and possible ways to resolve the situation, including finding a balance between cultural preservation and freedom of expression. Russia’s invasion and the state’s Ukrainization policy have elevated the Ukrainian language to a privileged position in public spaces (Law №5029-VI on the Fundamentals of State Language Policy). However, the historical traditions of bilingualism, migration from Russian-speaking regions to the West (due to the war in Donbas), and the pursuit of personal identity have counteracted official policies and linguistic shifts in Ukraine. Social and cultural ties, as well as public reactions to the suppression of the Russian language, have ensured its continued use in daily life. (According to the 2001 census, about 29.6% of citizens identified Russian as their native language.) Ultimately, it can be said that Russian speech will likely remain common in the streets of Ukrainian-speaking regions, and the complete disappearance of the Russian language in the country’s east seems unlikely.

Bangladesh: Govt Orders Probe Into BNP Youth Activist’s In-Custod...	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury Bangladesh’s interim government ordered an 'urgent investigation' into the death of a BNP youth leader after a military unit allegedly picked him up and took him into custody. The government, headed by Muhammad Yunus, made the announcement on Saturday, hours after Bangladesh Nationalist Party Secretary-General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir had demanded a probe into the suspicious death of Touhidul Islam, 40, a leader of BNP’s Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal youth wing in Cumilla. 'The interim government has ordered an urgent investigation into the death,' Yunus’ press office said in a statement. 'Upholding human rights in every sphere of national life is a core mission of this government, which includes some of the top rights activists in the country,' it said. The interim government is under immense pressure from the BNP to speed up the transition to elections. No date has been set. The commander of the joint military unit that apparently took Islam into custody has been relieved of his duties, pending an investigation, according to a statement from the Bangladeshi military and defense ministry’s Inter-Services Public Relations Directorate. Bruises were found on Islam’s body, a police official told BenarNews, denying that police had a role in taking him into custody. The military’s P.R. wing expressed sorrow for the 'unwanted incident.' 'The persons found responsible in the investigation will face punishment according to the army laws,' the directorate said. Yunus’ government is running the South Asian country during the transition to the next general election after it took over from the Awami League government of Sheikh Hasina, which fell last August during student-led protests against her administration. Hasina’s government was accused of carrying out hundreds of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings during its 15 years of consecutive rule. Touhidul Islam was allegedly picked up from his house in Cumilla by an army-led joint force at 3 p.m. on Friday. He was pronounced dead at a local medical college-hospital early Saturday, officials said. Moinul Islam, officer-in-charge at the Cumilla Kotwali police station, told BenarNews on Saturday night that a joint-forces unit had called the station at around 11 p.m. Friday to ask police to take Touhidul Islam to the hospital. 'No police personnel were in the joint forces. He was unconscious when we took him. At around 12:30 a.m., the doctors declared him dead,' he said. 'There were marks of apparent injury on both sides of his belly and hip. We have conducted a post-mortem and handed over the dead body,' the officer-in-charge said. Earlier on Saturday, Alamgir, the BNP’s secretary-general, condemned the apparent in-custody death of the youth-wing activist. 'Such [an] extrajudicial killing is very unfortunate during the interim government supported by political parties participating in the democratic movement after the fall of the Awami fascist government in the students-led mass movement,' Alamgir said, according to the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) news service. The report by BSS that quoted him suggested Touhidul Islam had been picked up by plain clothes law enforcement personnel. However, it remained unclear why he was taken into custody – whether it was by the military or police – in the first place. 'None can take the law into its own hands,' Alamgir said. 'No matter how powerful the perpetrator of the crime is, bringing him under the law and giving exemplary punishment is one of the conditions of the rule of law.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfi4AgUrA4fTyRsehwduQ-7	2025-02-02T15:46:26-08:00	
Putin Expands Use Of Soviet-Style Punitive Psychiatry Across Russ...	One of the most horrific practices of the late Soviet period was the use of psychiatry to punish and even eliminate political opponents of the regime. Some of the victims of this practice were subject to long periods of detention and the use of mind-altering drugs. Unsurprisingly, other dissidents and the West were both sharply critical of such practices (see the cases described in Executed by Madness (Казнимые сумасшествием) (in Russian; London, 1971); and Sidney Block and Peter Reddaway, Russia’s Political Hospitals: The Abuse of Psychiatry in the Soviet Union (London, 1977)). With the fall of the Soviet Union, Russians worked hard to eliminate this horrific practice, largely succeeding during the first decade of post-Soviet Russia in ending a practice that its victims said had made the Soviet Union and, more recently, Russia truly 'an evil empire' (Agents.media, May 22, 2024). As Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime maintains power, and especially in the years since he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, however, he has dramatically expanded the use of punitive psychiatry against his opponents and other dissenters. According to one investigation, the number of victims has risen by at least 500 percent since 2022 (Agents.media, May 22, 2024). There has been one major difference in Putin’s approach as compared to Soviet times. The Soviets under Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982, misused psychiatry against high-profile dissidents in Moscow, most often at the notorious Serbsky Institute, in actions that attracted widespread international condemnation. Putin, on the other hand, has employed it primarily in the regions and republics of Russia. (On Putin’s initial steps, see EDM, March 12, 2008, November 13, 2012; on his use of punitive psychiatry far beyond Moscow’s ring road, see Window on Eurasia, March 22, 2021; Siber.Realii, January 26.) That refocusing of attention has allowed the Kremlin leader to retain the intimidating effects of punitive psychiatry but avoid much of the domestic and Western criticism that his predecessors’ actions repeatedly attracted. If Putin succeeds in continuing to avoid serious criticism for his punitive psychiatry, he is likely to continue to expand the use of this criminal practice further. He would be limited only by the number of opponents he has not been able to suppress or drive out by other means, as well as by the relatively high costs of psychiatric imprisonment compared to other methods of intimidation and control (Window on Eurasia, August 20, 2023). Among the most prominent recent examples of the confinement of Putin’s political opponents for various periods in psychiatric hospitals and prisons is the treatment of Sakha Shaman, Alexander Gabyshev. This is one of the few instances in recent history with a detailed discussion in independent media about these practices. Gabyshev has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals and prisons since 2019, and his case has led other regional officials to similarly harass dissidents in their areas (Idel.Realii, November 22, 2021). Other examples include the incarceration of Bashkir activist Ramilya Saitova in the Bashkir Republic Psychiatric Hospital near Ufa and the psychiatric examinations imposed on five of the leaders of the Ingush protest movement against the handing over of ten percent of the territory of their republic to Chechnya (Window on Eurasia, October 21, 2019; Idel.Realii, March 20, 2021). In these cases and dozens of other recent ones, the intended message is that 'normal people do not protest,' in the words of a Russian psychiatrist who works for the Federal Security Service (FSB), Lala Kasimova. She stated, 'If you fight against the authorities, you are mentally ill' and thereby deserve to be forcibly confined in a psychiatric hospital and treated with psychotropic medications (Radio Svoboda, October 16, 2022). This is not the same as 'sluggish schizophrenia' (вялотекущая шизофрения, vyalotekushchaya shizofreniya), the preferred charge of Soviet-era psychiatrists concerning dissidents, but it is at least as elastic and can be applied to almost anyone at the insistence of the powers that be (Radio Svoboda, October 16, 2022). Targeting individuals in the regions and republics rather than high-level officials Moscow and holding that any protest is a form of mental illness, of course, are not the only ways that Putin’s use of punitive psychiatry is different from its Soviet predecessor. First, unlike the Soviets, Putin has put in place over the last two decades numerous laws and regulations governing psychiatric confinement, laws, and regulations that, if interpreted by most Westerners, would appear anodyne, but when interpreted by the Russian government opens the way to human rights violations. This is typical of Putin’s approach and has helped him avoid criticism, despite the efforts of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to bring the glaring differences between declared law and actual practice to the attention of the West (NPAR, accessed January 30). Second, Putin has used psychiatric prisons not against political opponents, but rather against members of religious sects. As many in the West oppose such organizations as well, they are less willing to criticize Putin and often fail to see how the regime extends its actions against sects to actions against political opponents (see EDM, January 23). Third, Moscow has closed down many regional media outlets that had reported about such abuses, making it difficult to find out exactly what has happened and allowing spokesmen for the Putin regime to contest any claims (see Robert van Voren, On Dissidents and Madness: From the Soviet Union of Leonid Brezhnev to ‘the Soviet Union’ of Vladimir Putin (Amsterdam, 2009)). As a result, protests by international human rights, medical groups, and Western governments about punitive psychiatry in Putin’s Russia have become significantly less frequent and impassioned than at the end of Soviet times. Both the groups and the governments continue to note what the Russian government is doing, but there is nothing like the intensity of protests that were regularly featured in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Kremlin assumes that it can continue to expand its punitive psychiatry, especially if the target’s focus remains outside of Moscow and thus beyond the attention of Western media and diplomats. In addition, the Kremlin assumes it can cast these efforts as necessary steps to protect 'traditional values,' a position attractive to an increasing number of people and regimes in the West. Western retreat on this issue, however, opens the way to an even larger Russian advance against human rights and the imposition of an oppressive regime.

A Recipe For Success For Food Security In Asia – Analysis	By Parjiono and Chandra Kusuma Asia’s collective development agenda offers an opportunity to address global challenges like food security, a pressing concern for many countries in the region. South Africa’s 2025 G20 presidency, with its theme of ‘Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability’, is set to emphasise this issue, aligning with Asian nations’ food self-sufficiency and sustainable development priorities. Food insecurity remains a critical issue for Asia, home to the largest share of the global population facing hunger. Despite adequate global food production, between 713–757 million peopleexperienced hunger in 2023. These figures highlight setbacks in achieving Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2, which aim to eradicate poverty and hunger respectively. Hunger disrupts health systems, impedes educational progress, lowers productivity and deepens inequalities, perpetuating poverty cycles in many developing Asian economies. Asia is a highly diverse region with significant variations in economic development, resource endowments and policy priorities. Wealthier economies are central to shaping regional food security strategies. These nations have pioneered technological innovations, trade agreements and financial mechanisms that influence regional agricultural markets and supply chains. Japan and South Korea actively promote global agricultural cooperation, while Singapore’s advanced urban farming technologies serve as a model for sustainable food production in land-scarce settings. The historical tension between trade-based and self-sufficiency-based approaches to food security has shaped Asia’s policy landscape. China, with its dual identity as a middle-income country and major global player, exemplifies this tension. While its focus on food sovereignty has driven domestic investments in agricultural modernisation, China remains a significant importer of staples like soybeans and corn. Trade has historically played a crucial role in stabilising food supplies, particularly during crises. Advocates of trade-based approaches argue that protectionist measures can exacerbate food insecurity by distorting markets and reducing efficiency. But the 2008 global food crisis highlighted the risks of over-reliance on global markets, prompting many Asian nations to pursue food sovereignty. The ASEAN+3 Emergency Rice Reserve (APTERR) exemplifies how regional cooperation can enable countries to combine self-sufficiency with trade-based resilience. By pooling resources and coordinating policies, APTERR ensures emergency food supplies while preserving the benefits of trade integration. Agriculture is central to economic and social stability across Asia, contributing significantly to GDP and employment. Food insecurity disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in countries like Indonesia, India, the Philippines and Pakistan. Addressing these disparities requires targeted investments in agricultural productivity, infrastructure and climate resilience. Indonesia’s approach serves as a case study in advancing food security. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has introduced ambitious reforms targeting food self-sufficiency within four years. The establishment of the National Food Agency (Bapanas) in 2021 by former president Joko Widodo reflected an institutional commitment to streamlining food policies. Public investment in land intensification, irrigation, logistics networks and farmer financing underpin Asia’s food security strategy. Indonesia’s 139.4 trillion rupiah (US$8.6 billion) allocation for food security in its 2025 budget exemplifies this. Investments in food infrastructure, strategic reserves and agricultural technology modernisation aim to reduce import reliance and bolster food sovereignty. Food diversification is reducing dependency on traditional staples and building resilience against supply shocks. Improving nutrition through social programs like Indonesia’s free nutritious meal initiative is particularly vital for human capital development. Adequate nutrition enhances children’s learning capacities, improves workforce productivity and supports long-term economic growth. These priorities align with regional visions like Indonesia’s Golden Indonesia 2045, which integrates food security into broader development goals. India’s embrace of digital agriculture and precision farming, Vietnam’s focus on supply chain efficiency and Thailand’s sustainable farming practices illustrate the region’s shared commitment to modernising agriculture and addressing food insecurity. Wealthier nations contribute through technological innovation and financial support, facilitating knowledge transfer and capacity building. While some progress has been made, key challenges persist. Climate change threatens crop yieldsand growing seasons, while urbanisation encroaches on arable land. Infrastructure gaps hinder the efficient distribution of food across vast regions. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach, incorporating climate-smart agriculture, technological innovation and regional collaboration. Organisations like ASEAN play a vital role in fostering cooperation. Mechanisms such as the ASEAN Food Security Reserve and APTERR are bolstering regional food resilience and emergency preparedness. Sharing best practices and mobilising resources through these platforms enhances Asia’s collective capacity to address food insecurity. Asia’s active engagement in global forums like the G20 further strengthens its food security agenda. The G20 Finance Track offers mechanisms to promote sustainable agriculture and resource mobilisation. Initiatives like the Agricultural Market Information System and the G20 Meeting of Agricultural Chief Scientists provide avenues to leverage innovation and data-driven decision-making in global food systems. South Africa’s G20 presidency, with its emphasis on artificial intelligence and data governance, complements Asia’s modernisation efforts. AI-driven tools for precision farming, yield forecasting and crop monitoring can revolutionise agricultural productivity and reduce resource wastage, creating more sustainable food systems. Food security is not just a policy goal, but a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of sustainable development. Through platforms like the G20 and strengthened South–South cooperation, Asian nations have an opportunity to lead by example. By investing in agricultural modernisation, fostering regional partnerships and leveraging global platforms, Asia can contribute to a more inclusive and resilient global food system, ensuring the right to adequate food for all.

Modern Warfare In The Middle East: Intelligence Versus Forward De...	By Kabir Taneja Over the past 15 months, the crisis-driven Middle East has spotlighted a gamut of strategic choices made by state and non-state actors to drive home their political agendas and shape regional geopolitics to their advantage. The terror attack by Hamas against Israel on 7 October 2023, mobilised both Israeli and Iranian strategies as close to a full-scale conventional war as possible. While Israel concentrated on degrading Hamas in Gaza and later Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran’s 'Axis of Resistance' design also faced significant turbulence. The Israel-Iran dynamic has quietly underpinned the Middle East’s strategic contest for many years, as Arab powers concentrated more on building their economic and financial might. They also prioritised the development of short-term deals with foes such as Tehran, and back-channel talks with Israel, to build a level of neutrality. However, Israel has prioritised intelligence as its choice in building a 'forward offence' strategy to counter Iran’s 'forward defence' (also known as 'offensive defence'), conceptualised and built under the late Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Chief and Head of the Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani. Forward offence Israel’s intelligence agencies, particularly its external intelligence agency, the Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations—better known as the MOSSAD—have for long been its first line of defence, both strategically and tactically. The leading idea of Israeli security thinking is to act against perceived threats in an aggressive but targeted manner, in a way that many of the agency’s peers do not operate. This posture allows for threat perceptions to be dealt with before conventional warfare needs to be initiated. Since Israel is a small state, conventional conflict is a potentially costly and existential affair. While Israel has previously delivered well in a conventional setup, as witnessed during the Yom Kippur War of 1973 when it repelled a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria, an intelligence-first approach prioritising clandestine operations gives the state a significant first-line of kinetic, rather than just strategic, defence. This strategy has included more controversial methods, such as assassinations. Journalist Ronen Bergman, in his detailed account of covert Israeli security methodologies, traces a prioritisation of assassination as a core tool of kinetic security strategies starting from the 1940s. Since then, critical events, such as the killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany, by a Palestinian militia calling itself Black September, pushed a requirement for kinetic intelligence as the first core line of defence. Keeping the above trends in mind, operations, such as the one involving pagers that were rigged to explode targeting hundreds of alleged Hezbollah operatives across Lebanon in the aftermath of the 7 October attacks, further highlight the importance of long-term clandestine operations in Israeli security architecture. Israel’s operations targeting Iranian nuclear scientists inside Iran caused time-bound setbacks to the country’s nuclear program, and its continuous targeting of Hamas and Hezbollah operatives across the world to disrupt financial and weapon flows. Some of the notable examples of this overarching security apparatus led by operationalised intelligence include the 2010 assassination of Hamas’s chief weapons negotiator Mahmoud al-Mabhouh at the hands of a MOSSAD hit squad in Dubai. Fast forward to a post-7 October version of Israeli securitisation where Israel, led by a massively dented ego after Hamas’s success in 2023, assassinated the political chief of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, in central Tehran. This reflects a continuation of the mobilisation of deep-rooted and long-term strategic planning that Israel has become known for. Forward defence Iran’s posturing by way of building a 'forward defence' architecture, weaponising the political aims of militia groups across the region for its long-term benefit, gained much success for Tehran, especially the all-powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Scholar Hamidreza Azizi identifies Iran’s strategy of 'forward defence' as being 'not a new military doctrine but an evolved and updated form of deterrence'. While a group such as Hezbollah in Lebanon is very much proverbially attached to Iran’s ideological hip, others such as Hamas, a Sunni Palestinian militia, and the Houthis, a Zaydi Shia political and militant group (also known as Ansar Allah), have divergences where Iran prefers not to interfere beyond a point. This means that, from a tactical point of view, the entire design of the 'Axis of Resistance' has always had a limited shelf life. For example, after the losses suffered by both Hamas and Hezbollah at the hands of Israeli military operations, the Houthis are being seen as a potential force that remains. While the Houthis come from an ideological background that promotes the idea of the core conflict being one between the Zaidis and Wahhabis, or in plain terms, Sunnis and Shias, realpolitik means that their direct contestation with the Saudis, which began in 2015, has today also been watered down to talks, negotiations, and political compromise. The lack of leadership decapitation against the Houthis highlights a lack of availability and the criticality of on-ground, live intelligence. Strategic air strikes against the group, which the United States (US) under Trump is now re-instating as a designated terror organisation after the Biden administration removed the designation in 2021, have also failed to offer any major deterrence. This recalibration by now a core member of the 'Axis', being seen as having greater capacities than Hamas or Hezbollah for the time being, is also politically aligned with the Iran-Saudi normalisation agreement in 2023 brokered by China. While the Houthis continue to threaten and target Israel, rallying around the call for Palestinian sovereignty and independence, they seem to be aligning with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire as well. As per reports, the Yemeni militia, which has disrupted trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in the Red Sea waterways, will now not target non-Israeli commercial ships. However, as of today, along with the degradation of Hamas and Hezbollah, the collapse of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad has dealt the biggest blow to the 'Axis' design. The web of proxies that Iran has supported as part of its tactical response to the Israeli build-up of military power, backed by top-shelf US military tech along with notable indigenous strides in digital and cyber tech, is currently suffering from significant setbacks. Takeaways from ‘modern warfare’ in the Middle East The way to accurately investigate the idea of modern warfare from the context of the Middle East is to not club the region, but more specifically, concentrate on the Israel-Iran contest. The terror attack on 7 October was one such instance where the over-reliance on technologies at the forefront of securitisation was highlighted as a developing issue of concern rather than a long-term solution. The debate of technology in the Middle East beyond the conventional sense did not start with traditional armies and weapon systems but with non-state actors, and their use and manufacturing of crude drones. The so-called Islamic State (also known as ISIS or Daesh in Arabic) was a catalyst of sorts, building workshops to build drones, utilising the expertise of engineers from Europe and beyond and joining their ranks in the early stages of the group’s juggernaut. However, the Middle East has shown that modern warfare goes much further beyond debates on automatic, tech, and the centrality of Artificial Intelligence (AI). While these tools may become the forefront armoury in theatres such as big-power competitions, more regional, sectarian, and ideological conflicts will still require more traditional operational and intelligence blueprints. While newer techniques such as data mining, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Signals Intelligence (also known as Technology Intelligence or TECHINT in the early 2000s) do add significantly to information capacities, the centrality of Human Intelligence (HUMINT) based strategic and tactical planning remains more critical than any other format. Both the elimination of al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011 and the killing of ISIS chief founder and caliph Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi in Barisha, Syria in 2019, were products of human intelligence. Richard Moore, the chief of the United Kingdom’s Secret Intelligence Service—more popularly known as the MI6—in 2023 said that despite the proliferation of AI, the 'future of spying lies in human intelligence and judgement'. This was a rare but important view from one of the world’s most prominent, and comparatively public, intelligence establishments, one which has a long history of both successes and failures in the Middle East. Finally, it is imperative that strategic and tactical thinking be aligned more with the reading of individual theatres and their requirements rather than being shaped primarily by the capabilities of available technologies. The Israel-Iran conflict is an interesting case study with regard to study opportunities and gaps between the very ideas of modern and conventional warfare.

Prabowo Inherits Unfinished Business Of Jokowinomics – Analysis	By Siwage Dharma Negara Indonesia weathered significant challenges in 2024. The country maintained 5 per cent growth through presidential and regional elections, while economic headwinds from El Nino caused rising food prices, higher energy prices and weakening consumer demand. Indonesia held its general elections in February, which brought President Prabowo Subianto into power, followed by an almost nine month-long transition to the new administration. It also held simultaneous regional head elections in November. Things improved in the second half of the year as pressure on food and energy prices subsided and external factors became less volatile. The country ultimately experienced a smooth leadership transition from former president Joko Widodo’s administration to Prabowo’s. But Prabowo’s administration faces four key economic challenges that threaten Indonesia’s 2025 growth targets. These include weakening consumer spending, slower export growth, rising fiscal pressures and slow progress on reforms. First, Indonesia struggles with weak domestic consumption. Household spending, the traditional backbone of Indonesia’s economy, declined in 2024 as incomes stagnated and the job market worsened. Government assistance like cash transfers and subsidies provide limited relief, particularly to middle and aspiring middle-class households. Despite headline inflation showing a declining trend, higher food prices caused many households to feel the pinch. The government has implemented some policies to encourage job creation and wage increases in sectors like manufacturing to help consumers maintain their purchasing power. But given the stagnant growth outlook of around 5 per cent and weak aggregate demand, job expansion will be limited. Second, the country is facing slow export growth, with weak global demand for key commodities like coal, nickel and crude palm oil putting Indonesia’s exports under pressure. Increased tariffs imposed by the United States and China have also adversely impacted its manufacturing exports, with textiles and textile products struggling to remain competitive in the global market. Indonesia’s effort to diversify its exports through downstreaming has had a limited impact on overall export performance. Its focus on increasing the share of domestic value added in exports instead of the export potential of industries is costly and misguided. While the country has been trying to promote trade deals with Asia and Europe, it continues to apply numerous non-tariff measures in the form of export–import approvals, local content requirements and restrictions on port of entry, imposing a significant burden on Indonesian exporters. Various requirements were enacted to encourage investment in local production facilities, including smartphones, medical equipment and solar panels. Yet these policies hampered export competitiveness of export that require the use of high-quality inputs imported at international market prices. Third, the new government contends with a tight fiscal space. The government’s budget came under strain in the first half of 2024, with spending on subsidies and social programs pushing the deficit to 2.7 per cent of GDP. Public debt reached almost 40 per cent of GDP, excluding the government’s contingent liabilities in state-owned enterprises. Concerningly, the public’s debt service burden increased from 25 per cent of total tax revenue in 2015 to about 47.5 per cent in 2022, exceeding the International Monetary Fund’s 35 per cent threshold. These constraints, combined with higher global interest rates for borrowing, have forced Prabowo’s government to prioritise its spending. Several infrastructure projects, like Jokowi’s toll roads, were halted to finance big-ticket programs, including the free meal program and food estates. Prabowo also urged ministers to minimise unnecessary spending on overseas travel and ceremonial events. On the revenue side, the government faces tough challenges in increasing tax compliance. Beginning in January 2025, a new initiative to use digitalisation to improve tax compliance will require an integrated, user-friendly and secure system. And plans to increase the value-added taxfrom 11 to 12 per cent for all goods and services was cancelled last minute due to public opposition. This led to a scaled back proposal targeting only luxury items, including private jets, luxury cars and properties priced at Rp 30 billion (US$1.85 million) or higher. Finally, progress on reforms to improve the investment climate remains uneven. The Jokowi administration passed the Job Creation Law, aiming to streamline licensing processes and ease hiring and firing procedures for employers. But fresh uncertainty for investors arose in October 2024 after the Constitutional Court decided that the government must create a new, separate labour law. Inconsistent regulations will likely continue to hinder investors. While energy security is high on the agenda, Prabowo’s ambitious goals of phasing out coal and fossil fuels within 15 years lack clear implementation plans despite international funding commitments. Initiatives like the Just Energy Transition Partnership’s US$21.6 billion pledge have not shown much progress in terms of new clean energy projects or the early retirement of coal-fired power plants. The high costs of the energy transition and limited infrastructure are not the only factors slowing things down, with a lack of political commitment to improving regulationsand investment in the clean energy sector persisting. As Indonesia enters 2025, it finds itself at a crossroads. The country must find the right policies to tackle its domestic structural challenges to achieve higher growth and position itself as a key player in the global economy. Indonesia’s entry into BRICS presents opportunities and risks for national development. Growing dependence on Chinese trade, investment and technology should be anticipated and addressed by reforming trade and industrial policies as well as institutional governance. With its current high approval rating, the Prabowo–Gibran government should have the necessary political capital to implement these critical reforms.

Data Protection Frameworks Of India And The US: Data Sovereignty ...	The key differences between India and the US as regards data protection frameworks relate to their approaches to consent mechanisms, cross-border data transfers, breach notifications and children’s data protection, with India taking a more centralised, stringent approach compared to the US’s distributed, flexible system. By Khyati Singh The proliferation of digital technologies and the concomitant expansion of data-driven services have necessitated the development of robust personal data protection frameworks globally. As nations grapple with these challenges, two distinct approaches have emerged: India’s comprehensive, centralised framework represented by the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules 2025, and the United States’ sector-specific, market-driven approach. While India has chosen to implement a unified data protection framework with strong emphasis on data sovereignty, the United States continues to rely on a patchwork of sector-specific regulations and state laws, reflecting its preference for market flexibility over centralised control. India’s Data Regulation Journey India’s data regulation journey reached its much-anticipated destination with Draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules released by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).[1] The DPDP Act 2003 has been built on years of recommendations along with judicial decisions that have shaped the contours of data protection. The journey of this legislative framework dates to 2011 with the Justice A.P. Shah Committee, which laid the foundation for privacy laws to protect data rights of individual. This momentum reached its new height with the landmark judgement of the Supreme Court in 2017, recognising the right to privacy as a fundamental right in the light of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) versus Union of India case. In the following year, the government appointed a committee led by former Supreme Court Justice B.N. Srikrishna to draft the data protection bill. After extensive debate, the Joint Parliamentary Committee adopted the draft report on The Personal Data Protection Bill 2019. However, it was not well received by civil society stakeholders due to its restrictive structure. The government shelved it before it could be considered by the Parliament. MeitY worked on the recommendations and re-examined the issues that arrived at the first place and drafted the DPDP Bill in 2022. The DPDP Rules 2025 contain 22 provisions along with seven schedules, and has touched upon key variables of data privacy. The most notable provisions are highlighted below. Consent Management One of the prominent aims of DPDP Rules has been to lay emphasis on informed consent. Data Fiduciaries, alike the data controllers under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), need to give a clear and standalone notice to Data Principals, that is, the individuals whose data is being processed. The notices should mention the type of data that is being collected, the purpose of data processing along with the process of withdrawing consent. In addition, the rules have introduced the concept of Consent Manager,[2] which will be a registered entity entrusted to act as a point of Contact for Data Principals to manage their consent. This will allow individuals to have a secure and transparent platform to give, revise or withdraw their consent.[3] Security Standards Data Fiduciaries are required to implement appropriate and reasonable security measures to safeguard personal data. This includes access controls, monitoring for unauthorised access, regular data backups and encryption of data. Furthermore, the contract between Data Processors and Data Fiduciaries should ensure that measures to prevent data breaches are present in the first place. In case of breach, Data Fiduciaries are mandated to notify Data Principals at the earliest and furnish complete details about the nature and extent of breach, along with informing the Data Protection Board within 72 hours.[4] Cross-Border Data Transfers The DPDP rules have laid down clear guidelines for cross-border data transfer and seeks to reconcile national interests with the demands of global digital commerce. The regulations delineate explicit criteria for foreign data transfers, integrating measures to guarantee sufficient protection in recipient countries. The acknowledgment of conventional contractual provisions and binding corporate regulations reflects an understanding of established international norms, potentially enabling smooth commercial operations while upholding data protection requirements. Children Data Processing The framework’s strategy for safeguarding children’s personal data signifies a notable progress in digital privacy protection, employing multi-tiered safeguards that recognise the distinct vulnerabilities of kids inside the digital environment. The framework mandates stringent age verification criteria, obliging firms to adopt and sustain technical methods that accurately ascertain a user’s age prior to any data collection. Verification systems must be subjected to regular audits to verify ongoing effectiveness and thwart circumvention attempts, with firms mandated to maintain comprehensive documentation of their verification procedures. The parental permission method constitutes an essential element of this protective framework, establishing a thorough system that transcends mere checkbox compliance. Organisations must employ advanced techniques to secure verified parental permission, including systems that validate guardian status authenticity. This consent framework functions on a temporal basis, necessitating regular renewal to maintain the relevance of data processing operations. Moreover, the system provides detailed consent alternatives, allowing parents to exert specific control over various facets of their children’s data processing activities.[5] Data Retention Period The data retention framework delineates explicit temporal restrictions for personal data keeping, incorporating both mandated timeframes and purpose-driven retention standards. Organisations must establish systematic data review processes to guarantee that personal information is retained just for the duration necessary to achieve the explicitly defined goals for which it was gathered. The framework requires companies to implement explicit retention schedules for several types of personal data, with distinct retention durations determined by the nature and sensitivity of the information. These schedules must include regulatory compliance obligations and genuine business necessities while emphasising data reduction. Organisations must do frequent audits of stored data to detect and eliminate information that has surpassed its retention period. An important feature is the obligation for companies to have automated data deletion methods for information that has served its function. This encompasses stipulations for secure data disposal techniques and documentation mandates for deletion procedures. The framework also encompasses situations necessitating prolonged retention, such as legal requirements or historical research, while enforcing stringent restrictions on access and usage across these longer retention intervals. The retention framework conforms to worldwide best practices by integrating measures for data archiving and anonymisation as substitutes for deletion. Organisations must provide a justification for selecting these alternatives instead of deletion and establish suitable technical protections to avert the re-identification of preserved or anonymised data. Shortcomings While the DPDP Rules 2025 tried to cover vast ground and address major challenges of data protection, there still are some misses against numerous hits. The recurrent necessity for permission notifications has resulted in pervasive 'consent fatigue', causing users to indiscriminately accept conditions without genuine participation, so undermining the objective of informed consent. Digital settings pose distinct challenges in acquiring authentic consent, especially in mobile applications and IoT devices where conventional consent methods may be ineffective or inadequate. The framework’s stipulations for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, individuals with impairments, and those with restricted digital literacy, are deficient in comprehensive directives for guaranteeing informed consent. This disparity possibly renders these populations vulnerable to data exploitation. The existing procedures frequently neglect to consider diverse degrees of technical comprehension and accessibility requirements. The method for withdrawing consent is devoid of explicit procedural standards, presenting possible obstacles for users attempting to rescind previously granted consent. Organisations frequently implement intricate or ambiguous withdrawal procedures, and there is less guidance on managing data that has already been obtained upon the withdrawal of consent, especially in complicated data processing situations involving several stakeholders. Data localisation mandates pose considerable operational difficulties for multinational corporations, particularly regarding data segregation and the maintenance of multiple data storage systems. This escalates compliance expenses due to the necessity for local servers, security infrastructures and specialised personnel. For start-ups and small enterprises, these financial burdens may be excessively high, potentially hindering innovation and market entry. The technical execution encounters obstacles in cloud computing environments where data inherently traverses borders. Organisations must establish intricate data tracking and routing mechanisms to ensure adherence to regulations. This adversely affects real-time data processing capabilities and service delivery efficiency. Furthermore, the requirements influence global data analytics capabilities, potentially constraining organisations’ capacity to utilise international data resources for innovation and service enhancement. In addition, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) encounter substantial implementation challenges due to constrained financial and technical resources necessary for compliance. The technical intricacy entails the implementation of advanced data security measures, encryption systems and access controls necessitating specialist knowledge. Numerous compliance regulations lack comprehensive implementation guidance, resulting in ambiguity regarding acceptable compliance standards. This difficulty is exacerbated by a deficiency of qualified privacy specialists capable of guiding implementation processes, especially those who comprehend both technological requirements and legal compliance dimensions. The lack of experience results in increased expenses and possible compliance deficiencies, particularly for smaller firms with limited finances. US Data Protection Framework The United States does not possess a comprehensive federal data protection law comparable to the GDPR or India’s DPDPA. Rather, it depends on a combination of sector-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA for health information, GLBA for financial information) and state legislation (e.g., California Consumer Privacy Act—CCPA).[6] This disjointed approach may result in discrepancies in data protection requirements among various jurisdictions.[7] The consent methods of the two frameworks vary considerably. India’s DPDP Rules require explicit, informed consent for all data processing operations, along with stringent requirements for consent management and withdrawal protocols. Whereas, the US approach frequently permits implied consent and opt-out options, affording greater flexibility but potentially compromising the rigour of individual privacy protections. The Indian framework’s implementation of consent managers as registered entities signifies a unique approach absent in the US system. The US lacks a cohesive strategy regarding cross-border data transfers. The invalidation of the EU–US Privacy Shield framework[8] in 2020 has resulted in significant uncertainty surrounding data transfers between the US and the EU. Organisations frequently depend on standard contractual clauses or alternative mechanisms to enable cross-border data transfers. However, these may not offer the same degree of protection as the DPDP Rules. India’s DPDP Rules enforce more stringent data localisation requirements, mandating that specific kinds of data be retained inside national borders. The US strategy emphasises data protection standards irrespective of geographical location, imposing less limitations on cross-border data flows. This distinction illustrates India’s prioritisation of data sovereignty in contrast to the US’s predominantly market-driven strategy. Furthermore, in the matters of data breach, India’s DPDP Rules mandate a stringent 72-hour notification period for breaches, but US rules differ by state and sector, typically allowing for more flexible timelines.[9] The Indian framework expressly stresses technology standards and security measures more than its US counterpart, which often offers broader guidance on security criteria. Children’s data protection also sees varying approaches. While both frameworks acknowledge the need for special protections, India’s DPDP Rules implement more stringent parental consent mechanisms and verification requirements compared to the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).[10] The Indian framework mandates regular renewal of parental consent and provides more detailed control options for parents over their children’s data processing activities. Lastly, the structures of enforcement exhibit significant variation. India has created a centralised Data Protection Board that possesses extensive oversight authority, whereas the US depends on a range of regulatory agencies, state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission to carry out enforcement actions. The distinction between centralised and distributed approaches significantly influences organisational compliance with regulations and the management of violations, and often lead to inconsistent enforcement and varying levels of accountability for organisations. Conclusion The DPDP Rules 2025 represent a significant advancement in India’s data protection framework, drawing from historical precedents and responding to current challenges. Despite challenges in implementation, especially for SMEs and vulnerable populations, the framework establishes a basis for reconciling privacy rights with digital innovation. The success of this initiative depends on effective enforcement, collaboration among stakeholders and the ability to adapt to emerging technologies. The pursuit of effective data protection necessitates continuous improvement and dedication from all parties involved to guarantee that India’s digital future emphasises both advancement and privacy. The DPDP Rules could potentially act as a framework for other nations, such as the US, as they address the intricate challenges of data privacy in the digital era.

Trump’s Tariffs Vs. China’s Long Game – Analysis	Donald Trump, never one to shy away from a headline-grabbing maneuver, announced on January 21 that he’s mulling a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, potentially set to take effect February 1. This latest salvo in the long-simmering trade spat between the world’s two largest economies raises eyebrows and questions in equal measure. The proposed tariffs, ostensibly aimed at pressuring Beijing into a more U.S.-friendly trade posture, ironically come just as China’s exports, including those to the United States, have recently surged. This trend seems to contradict Trump’s intended goal of curbing Chinese economic influence. During his re-election campaign, Trump upped the ante, threatening tariffs as high as 60 percent on Chinese goods. Such rhetoric fueled an already heated trade war but has yet to yield the intended concessions. So, are Trump’s tariff threats strategic posturing or simply an effort to reclaim economic leverage? Trump is once again casting China as the central antagonist in America’s economic and social struggles. He has, for instance, accused Beijing of fueling the fentanyl crisis by supplying precursor chemicals to U.S. neighbors, thus framing the addiction epidemic as a consequence of lax border enforcement and international indifference. The rhetoric didn’t stop there. Trump proposed a steep 25 percent tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, accusing both countries of enabling illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the United States. In tandem, he unveiled plans for an 'external revenue service' to centralize collection of tariffs and foreign-derived revenue, signaling his continued belief in tariffs as a lever of economic power. By late 2024, Chinese exports to U.S. companies had risen 4 percent year-over-year, highlighting Beijing’s resilience in the face of punitive trade measures. Meanwhile, the trade imbalance remains staggering: Chinese exports to the U.S. reached $401 billion in 11 months in 2024, while American goods to China totaled just $131 billion. Trump’s escalating accusations against China, combined with his ambitious tariff strategy, reflect a broader effort to realign global trade, though it remains unclear who will blink first in this high-stakes standoff. In the chess game of global trade, tariffs are a double-edged sword, and Donald Trump is no stranger to wielding them. His latest proposal to slap tariffs on all Chinese imports promises to target every product imaginable, from everyday essentials to niche industrial goods. Although Trump touts this strategy as a way to protect American interests, the ripple effects could drive inflation higher, leaving U.S. consumers to bear the burden. Take ship-to-shore cranes, for instance, which are critical to U.S. infrastructure and which are entirely imported from China. A 25 percent tariff on these cranes has already added $131 million in costs to American ports. With no domestic alternatives, industries reliant on such imports find themselves trapped, unable to shift demand or dodge price hikes. It is a harsh reminder that protectionist policies often hit closer to home than intended. Meanwhile, Beijing appears unfazed. The Belt and Road Initiative and deeper partnerships with BRICS nations are part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on the U.S. market. As China diversifies its trade network, its willingness to absorb the tariff hit without retaliation seems increasingly unlikely. The question remains: How long can the U.S. sustain this high-stakes trade war before consumers and industries alike demand a new strategy? As Trump’s trade war escalates, American businesses are caught in an increasingly fraught search for alternatives to Chinese imports. This pursuit, however, is no easy feat. Should the United States extend its tariff policies to key trading partners like the European Union, Canada, or Mexico, import costs from these nations could also skyrocket, creating a ripple effect that leaves few affordable options on the table. Compounding the issue is the already sanctioned Russian market, further narrowing the pool of viable suppliers. During the last tariff bout, levies on Canadian and Mexican steel drove domestic prices for iron and steel products up by as much as 17.7 percent in just eight months. The result was a zero-sum game for American consumers, who are left with two choices: higher costs or limited access to essential goods. Whether sourced from China or elsewhere, the burden ultimately lands squarely on their shoulders. Amid rising tensions, China’s economic resilience presents an uncomfortable truth for the United States: the trade war is not turning the tide as intended. China’s broader trade figures are even more telling. December exports shattered records, rising 10.7 percent year-over-year. For all of 2024, Chinese exports totaled an astonishing $3.58 trillion, up nearly 6 percent from 2023. China now has a record trade surplus of $992 billion, a 21 percent leap from the prior year. China’s surge in trade, although it benefits both economies in the short term, reveals the volatility of a system increasingly beset by competition and discord. The long game is being redefined—and not in Washington’s favor. As Donald Trump prepared for his second inauguration, the White House facilitated a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a carefully orchestrated gesture of diplomacy. Xi expressed hope for a 'good start' to the China-U.S. relationship, emphasizing the importance of respecting 'each other’s core interests' despite inevitable differences. For Beijing, the focus appears to remain internal. China seems unfazed by the return of Trump’s mercurial leadership. The state media has adopted a measured tone, reflecting Beijing’s preference for a steady course over reacting to external unpredictability. China’s strategy has been patient and deliberate. Recent interactions suggest a willingness to let Trump make the first move, matching his actions with calculated responses. Although the United States enjoys advantages in many arenas, time favors China. With a four-year timeline limiting Trump’s ambitions, Xi has the luxury of playing the long game.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLDXUzSm7OO-v	2025-01-31T16:27:59-08:00	
Should Greenland Become An American Colony? – OpEd	By Vincent Cook Among his recent jingoistic outbursts, President-elect Donald Trump stated in a social media post that American possession of Greenland is an 'absolute necessity' for national security, and. in a subsequent press conference, said that if Denmark refused to sell it, he would not rule out military aggression for turning Greenland into an American colony, and also claimed in another post that Greenlanders are 'MAGA' and would welcome American domination. So is any of this true? Regarding the latter point, the Prime Minister of Greenland, Múte Bourup Egede, responded with a trilingual Facebook post, with the English-language portion stating: Let me repeat - Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland. Our future and fight for independence is our business. While others, including Danes and Americans, are entitled to their opinions, but we should not be caught up in the hysteria and external pressures distract us from our path. The future is ours and ours to shape. We commit exercising our rights as people and fulfilling our duties with wisdom and care. Every day is spent on working to become independent. We can and we can cooperate. What may not be immediately obvious to most Americans is that Greenland is, in fact, its own separate nation. Apart from having their own flag and anthem (figure 1), Greenlanders constitute a distinctive linguistic community that meets Ludwig von Mises’s definition of what a nation is. 90 percent of Greenland’s 57,000 residents are of mixed Inuit-Norse ancestry who speak some dialect of Inuit as their first language. Politically speaking, about two-thirds of Greenlanders want independence from Denmark, with large majorities also favoring socialism. The most disputed issue in Greenlandic politics lately has been a proposed Kvanefjeld uranium/rare earth metals mine at a site near the southern tip of Greenland, which was to be run by a Chinese-financed Australian concessionaire that promised royalties of about $240 million annually, but also posed a threat of polluting a nearby village and local fisheries and would provide few, if any, jobs to Greenlanders. Egede’s coalition defeated the traditional ruling party (also socialist) on a platform of opposing the mine. Denmark has not been able to buy the loyalty of Greenlanders either, despite its $600 million in annual subsidies propping up the local administration; forcible implantation of IUD birth control coils in Inuit women in the 1960s and 1970s probably being a major factor in provoking their strong anti-Danish attitudes. Likewise, the American military—which has occupied bases in Greenland since America invaded it in April of 1940 without a declaration of war against Denmark—has not endeared itself to Greenlanders, with Inuits in two villages being forcibly relocated to make room for one base and a case of a lost hydrogen bomb and a massive release of radioactive materials on ancient hunting grounds. Greenlanders are the polar opposite of 'MAGA' in terms of how they view their ethnic identity, their politics, their evaluation of mining, and their feelings about America. To be sure, Trump’s lip service about the alleged MAGA views of Greenlanders was not meant to concede the classical liberal principle that Greenlanders have a right of self-determination. Rather, it was meant to make Trump’s supporters—who sometimes like to think of themselves as defenders of human life and of private ownership—feel better about Americans stealing a valuable mine concession, poisoning Greenlanders and their fish, and letting the Pentagon continue to use Greenland as its secret playground. So what about the claim that formal sovereignty over Greenland is a necessity for America’s national security? It seems unlikely that Greenland could ever gain its independence from Denmark without agreeing to let the Pentagon keep the Pituffik Space Base (formerly known as the Thule Air Base). Getting rid of the second flagpole outside the base—which currently flies a Danish flag under a 1951 treaty—is a cosmetic vanity project, not an absolute security necessity. What’s really at stake then are the minerals. But is colonial control over mining concessions really an absolute necessity for national security? In connection with the 'raw materials' rationale for colonies, Ludwig von Mises pointed out: The most modern pretense for colonial conquest is condensed in the slogan 'raw materials.' Hitler and Mussolini tried to justify their plans by pointing out that the natural resources of the earth were not fairly distributed. As have-nots they were eager to get their fair share from those nations which had more than they should have had. How could they be branded aggressors when they wanted nothing but what was—in virtue of natural and divine right—their own? In the world of capitalism raw materials can be bought and sold like all other commodities. It does not matter whether they have to be imported from abroad or bought at home. It is of no advantage for an English buyer of Australian wool that Australia is a part of the British Empire; he must pay the same price that his Italian or German competitor pays. The countries producing the raw materials that cannot be produced in Germany or in Italy are not empty. There are people living in them; and these inhabitants are not ready to become subjects of the European dictators. The citizens of Texas and Louisiana are eager to sell their cotton crops to anyone who wants to pay for them; but they do not long for German or Italian domination. It is the same with other countries and other raw materials. The Brazilians do not consider themselves an appurtenance of their coffee plantations. The Swedes do not believe that their supply of iron ore justifies Germany’s aspirations. The Italians would themselves consider the Danes lunatics if they were to ask for an Italian province in order to get their fair share of citrus fruits, red wine, and olive oil. The most influential popularizers of the 'raw materials' argument—American naval officer A.T. Mahan in 1890 and British geographer H.J. Mackinder in 1904—observed that an economically autarkic empire would also need a dominant navy to control the world’s oceans and the ability to project power over land into the Eurasian heartland in order to guarantee access to natural resources in their distant colonies and spheres of influence. But this means that economic autarky is achieved only at the expense of cutting off other major powers from these very same resources. Attempted encirclement of other major powers can only provoke arms races, scrambles for more colonies, endless wars, and ultimately enormously destructive global wars. Anti-imperialist classical liberals of the Mahan-Mackinder era were well aware of the dangers of imperialism leading to endless wars. In 1899, Yale Professor William Graham Sumner, denouncing America’s recent conquest of former Spanish colonies, raised the issue in his essay 'The Conquest of the United States by Spain': The doctrine that we are to take away from other nations any possessions of theirs which we think that we could manage better than they are managing them, or that we are to take in hand any countries which we do not think capable of self-government, is one which will lead us very far. With that doctrine in the background, our politicians will have no trouble to find a war ready for us the next time that they come around to the point where they think that it is time for us to have another. We are told that we must have a big army hereafter. What for; unless we propose to do again by and by what we have just done? In that case our neighbors have reason to ask themselves whom we will attack next. They must begin to arm, too, and by our act the whole western world is plunged into the distress under which the eastern world is groaning. Here is another point in regard to which the conservative elements in the country are making a great mistake to allow all this militarism and imperialism to go on without protest. It will be established as a rule that, whenever political ascendency is threatened, it can be established again by a little war, filling the minds of the people with glory and diverting their attention from their own interests. Hardheaded old Benjamin Franklin hit the point when, referring back to the days of Marlborough, he talked about the 'pest of glory.' The thirst for glory is an epidemic which robs a people of their judgment, seduces their vanity, cheats them of their interests, and corrupts their consciences. One can only add that taxpayers, thus deluded by such a thirst for glory, don’t receive the spoils of the conquest. It is cronies of the politicians, and maybe cooperative elements of the native ruling class, who would be granted the privilege of monopolizing whatever rents and royalties can be extracted from the land. Taxpayers merely get stuck with the bill. About the author: Vincent Cook has a MA in Biophysics from the University of California, Berkeley.

Iran: The Growing Poverty Crisis And Its Impact On Society – OpEd	The 400% Drop in Wages Over a Decade'—this is the shocking front-page headline of Iran’s state-run Mardomsalari newspaper on January 29, 2025. This headline alone paints a grim picture of the catastrophic living conditions of workers and wage earners in Iran. It means that the standard of living for workers and laborers has declined fourfold over the past 10 years. Other economic data confirm this conclusion. A decade ago, the minimum wage for workers was around 6 million rials, which was equivalent to approximately $235 at the time. Today, the minimum wage, adjusted for the current exchange rate, amounts to just $94. This decline in wages is accelerating rapidly. At the beginning of this year, the minimum wage was equivalent to $133, meaning that in just 10 months, workers’ purchasing power has dropped by 30%. Statistics alone cannot fully capture the bleak reality of workers’ and laborers’ lives. According to state-run newspapers, 60% of the population is unable to meet the minimum daily requirement of 2,500 calories for survival. At this stage, it is no longer just about shrinking dinner tables; people’s tables have become void of meat, dairy, cooking oil, and other basic necessities, leaving the majority exhausted. Even the regime’s own statistics confirm this. According to Etemad newspaper on December 12, 2024, since 2011, per capita consumption of fruit has dropped by 50-60%, dairy by 80%, and meat by 60%. The meaning of these statistics, in one word, is hunger—a vast population of the hungry, many of whom are forced to scavenge for food in trash bins. Workers, in an effort to survive, often work second and third jobs, clocking in more than 12 hours a day. Research shows that 75-80% of Iran’s population now lives below the poverty line. On April 6, 2024, the state-run ILNA news agency quoted a regime-affiliated expert as saying, 'The population below the poverty line has doubled, and the number of employed individuals living under the poverty line has increased fivefold.' This growing poverty and deprivation are manifesting in all aspects of social life, including housing. In 2020, the Iranian regime’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Development reported that 26 million people were living in slums. Given the rapid expansion of poverty over the past four years, estimates suggest that at least 30% has been added to this figure, leading to conditions beyond slum-dwelling, such as homelessness, rooftop sleeping, and even grave sleeping. Significantly, during this same period, official sources report that at least 2.5 million housing units remain unoccupied. These units are said to be primarily owned by banks, which hoard housing and play a major role in driving up property prices and rent. It is clear that these banks are controlled by regime-affiliated plunderers, rent-seekers, and embezzlers, with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei at the top, effectively holding the livelihoods of over 80 million Iranians hostage. Regime officials try to blame the unprecedented levels of poverty and destitution on foreign conspiracies and economic sanctions. However, this is a lie that deceives no one, as everyone knows that the real problem lies within the corrupt and kleptocratic system of the mullahs’ regime and its predatory economy. Over the past four years, during a period when sanctions had been somewhat loosened, the regime exported an average of over 2 million barrels of oil per day. Yet, during this same period, poverty has deepened and expanded further. The real cause is the multi-headed dragon of government corruption and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which has sunk its claws into Iran’s economy and the livelihoods of its people, continuously devouring the hard-earned income of the working class. Iran’s oppressed and working-class population, trapped under this predatory economy, has now turned into a volcano of fury against the regime of executioners and looters. The rumbling of this volcano can even be heard in state-run media. A regime-affiliated newspaper recently issued a stark warning, as quoted by the Jomhouri newspaper on November 25, 2024: 'These suppressed grievances will one day erupt like a volcano, unleashing an army of the deprived and the hungry against those responsible for this injustice—an uprising that can only be called the Revolution of the Hungry Army. Are you not afraid of such a revolution?'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLCYmEnCHkSAu	2025-01-31T16:20:37-08:00	
US Iron Dome: Aspiration Or Reality? – OpEd	By Dave Patterson In the category of promises made and promises kept, President Donald Trump is serious about protecting the people of the United States. In December, at a Phoenix, AZ, rally, Trump announced that he would direct the Department of Defense (DOD) to begin construction of a 'great ‘Iron Dome’ defense shield,' like the one Israel has fielded that has effectively prevented barrages of incoming ballistic missiles, drones, and cruise missiles from doing catastrophic damage. Trump Advocates for Iron Dome In Phoenix, Trump reiterated the idea of an Iron Dome-like missile shield for the United States. And to keep the initiative fresh in the minds of legislators, Trump’s remarks on Jan. 27 to the GOP House of Representatives retreat at National Doral Golf Club in Miami, FL, included, unhesitatingly, 'We have to have a strong, strong defense … I’m directing our new secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, who’s going to be great by the way, thank you for the support. To immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defense shield which will be able to protect Americans.' Then, as if on cue, within a couple of hours, the White House released Trump’s Jan. 27 Executive Order (EO), 'The Iron Dome for America': 'Section 1. Purpose: The threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks remains the most catastrophic threat facing the United States … Over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense and complex with the development by peer and near-peer adversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland integrated air and missile defense capabilities.' The EO goes on to order the Defense Department, within 60 days, to submit an implementation plan with eight critical capabilities. Significant among the threats the Iron Dome for America will address are 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks.' Additionally, the plan must accelerate the development of the 'Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor layer' for early identification of hostile aerial attacks. The EO orders planning for the 'development and deployment' of a boost-phase (first phase of the ballistic missile launch) intercept from space and a terminal-phase intercept capability as the missile warheads approach targets. These two aspects contribute to a layered approach to defeating a ballistic and cruise missile attack. Why has Trump made this challenge one of his first priorities? Clearly, the chief executive sees intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic variations of those missiles, and cruise missiles as an immediate threat. Trump is not alone. A recent RealClearDefense report titled 'Donald Trump’s Iron Dome' explained that the current Missile Defense Agency (MDA) deployed 44 Ground-Based Interceptors positioned in two locations — four at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, and 40 in Alaska – that can destroy only a small number of incoming missiles from a coordinated attack from Russia, China, and possibly North Korea. Referring to a report published by the Atlantic Council, RealClearDefense observed, 'The report, penned by Robert Soofer, who served as former deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy in the previous Trump administration, says the threat of long-range strikes, including those using intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with nuclear warheads, hitting US territory is ‘real and growing.’' Critics Use Strawman Argument As with Ronald Reagan’s prescient Strategic Defense Initiative, derisively labeled 'Star Wars,' Trump’s plan has drawn critics. '[S]hielding the United States from such attacks presents technical challenges that far exceed those faced by Israel, experts said. Missile defense is most effective as a shield for a smaller country, they said, and the cost of developing one for the United States could be prohibitive,' The New York Times explained. These naysayers are building a strawman with one gigantic missile defense system umbrella for the entire United States. There are other ways of thinking about the problem. Israel’s missile defense has been very effective as a layered approach with the Arrow 3, capable of intercepting missiles outside the earth’s atmosphere; David’s Sling, a short-range anti-missile system; and the in-close 'Iron Dome' missile and drone defense for which the system is named. All of these are available for the United States to purchase or co-produce. However, the US has very effective anti-ballistic and anti-cruise missiles and anti-drone capabilities of its own. As Soofer suggested in his report: 'Enhance the survivability of US nuclear forces and nuclear command and control through a layered missile defense composed of GBIs [Ground-Based Interceptors], Standard Missile (SM) 3 block IIA missiles deployed on land and at sea, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missiles for preferential terminal defense of US nuclear forces, and requisite defenses against cruise missiles.' The venerable Patriot system has proved its dependable anti-ballistic missile capability. Layering the Israeli and the US systems, distributed and integrated with a command-and-control system, broken up into sectors the size of, say, Israel, and many technical challenges could be solved. US anti-missile cruisers and destroyers in the Red Sea firing SM-3 block IIA missiles have proven effective at taking out high-altitude ballistic missiles, and THAAD has demonstrated its capability in Ukraine. Since the establishment of the MDA in 2002, the United States has spent roughly $10 billion annually on the effort. Yet, after 23 years, the United States has an insufficient 44 ground-based anti-ballistic missile weapons, a rudimentary satellite-tracking capability, and a limited command-and-control system. Doing nothing will not improve the security of America, but critics who underestimate Trump’s drive to staunchly defend the country do so at their peril.

A Test For Strength For The West In Georgia: Is Soft Power A Solu...	The situation in Georgia remains difficult. Many continue to protest in different parts of the country including the capital, Tbilisi, and polarization within society is high, dividing the people into two main groups. One group, which includes many protesters, has a clear vision of Georgia's future within Western structures and support their country's Westernization. For most of these Georgians, their country's Western aspirations are unquestionable, often regarded as a goal in itself. They hold a strong belief that only the Western trajectory of development and possible membership in the European Union and NATO can save Georgia and Georgianness from being swallowed by Russia and losing its status as an independent state. The other group comprises Georgians who are critical of their country's Western aspirations. They often perceive Westernization and integration into the EU as a threat to Georgianness, potentially damaging their culture and national identity. These feelings are very often based on ethno-national sentiments and visions of what being Georgian means. In this context, Georgian identity comprises both ethnic culture and folkloric traditions. However, xenophobic attitudes can be easily instigated based on these ethno-national sentiments. This has occurred many times in Georgia, especially throughout the last decade, often resulting in mass manifestation and protests with far-right and anti-liberal attitudes at their core. These far-right sentiments and ethno-national attitudes in Georgian society do not exist alone. They are, to a significant extent, supported and nourished by influences of soft power—the kind projected by the Russian state in Georgia. Joseph Nye, a pioneer of the concept, defines soft power as 'the ability to affect others through the co-optive means of framing the agenda, persuading, and eliciting positive attraction in order to obtain preferred outcome'. In other words, it is a way to affect the target's behaviors and decisions without coercion but rather through persuasion and attraction using intangible resources such as values, ideas, and norms. Using soft power has been one of a few possible ways for Moscow to influence Georgian society. Its soft power strategy in Georgia has been to promote the image of Russia as an alternative to the West. Moscow's approach has been less about depicting Russia as a good country and more about persuading Georgian society that the West and Western development path are bad and a threat to Georgia and Georgianness itself. Russia's goal has been to depict the West and liberal values as harmful, leading to moral degradation and possible disappearance as a nation, while portraying commitment to conservative values and traditionalism as the solution that can save Georgia. For Moscow, promoting and strengthening conservative values and religious sentiments in Georgian society has been a key strategy for opposing progressive, liberal values and democratic laws. This strategy has been carried out via the financial, technical, and rhetorical support of various local non-state organizations in Georgia through Russian state-funded and -controlled foundations, such as Rossotrudnichestvo, the Gorchakov Fund, and the Russkiy Mir Fund. In addition, the Kremlin has implicitly and explicitly cooperated with and supported Georgian political actors, financially and otherwise, including right-wing political parties, such as the Alliance of Patriots of Georgia, the Conservative Movement, and the Georgian March. The influence was also supported by social media and Internet resources affiliated with the Russian state, such as Sputnik, Alt-Info, and other Russian state television channels popular in Georgia. In the current context of Georgia, civil demonstrations and disobedience are the most powerful weapons of those who are against the growing authoritarianism in the country, including the Georgian Dream party's radicalization and anti-democratic slide. Peaceful civil protest is the weapon that can make Georgian Dream change its rhetoric, liberalize its policies, and improve its significantly spoilt relations with the United States and the EU. However, such civil protests and disobedience must have massive character. In light of this, immediate and more active and targeted implementation of soft power by the West, mainly the US and the EU, could be a solution to Russia's attempts to undermine Georgians' support for Western integration. Western soft power in Georgia would be a worthy response—one that could activate citizens who do not understand why they should protest. It could clarify what integration into Western structures truly means and the possibilities it could bring. Moreover, it could dispel the stereotypes and misperceptions of the West imposed by Russian soft power that continue to gain strength. Indeed, wielding soft power is the most promising, perhaps only, way for the West to reverse the course of events in Georgia and save Georgian democracy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLBp5-jD1IEj0	2025-01-31T16:08:18-08:00	
The Great Leap South: China’s Ambitions In The Middle East And Af...	By Zineb Riboua Saudi Arabia Threatens China’s Congo Stranglehold The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), home to 80 percent of the world’s known cobalt reserves, is taking steps to loosen China’s grip on its mining sector, Congolese senior official Marcellin Paluku announced. PRC-owned companies currently control the majority of the Congo’s cobalt output and refine it in China before supplying the world’s battery makers. But Kinshasa is turning to Saudi investors to diversify its partnerships and break Beijing’s dominance over the DRC’s mineral wealth. Saudi Arabia, armed with the immense capital of its Public Investment Fund and driven by its Vision 2030 strategy to pivot beyond oil, is uniquely positioned to challenge China in the cobalt supply chain. Unlike Beijing, Riyadh does not have a reputation for extractive economic practices or cutting corners. This makes Saudi Arabia an attractive partner for the DRC as the embattled African nation looks to reduce its dependence on China. Paluku’s announcement follows the arrest of three Chinese nationals who were caught in eastern Congo with several gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash stashed under their car seats. South Kivu Governor Jean Jacques Purusi revealed that Congolese law enforcement kept the operation secret after other Chinese nationals accused of running illegal gold mines were unexpectedly released and allowed to return to China. Why it matters China’s extensive investments in the DRC and strategic infrastructure projects in neighboring Tanzania and Zambia are crucial to Beijing’s dominance over the cobalt supply chain. But Chinese firms’ shady and often illegal business practices have fostered discontent in the Congolese government and opened the door for new players. With cracks forming in China’s cobalt empire, the United States has an opportunity to reshape the global resource landscape. By partnering with Saudi Arabia in the Congo, Washington can promote competition, champion ethical mining practices, and chip away at China’s near monopoly on critical minerals. Eurasian Reroute: Ankara and Beijing Could Outflank Russian Railways A Turkish official revealed that China is interested in contributing around $60 billion to upgrade Turkey’s rail network—an investment that could provide European freight companies an alternative to routes through Russia. This development is particularly striking given that Russia and China have grown closer in recent years as Beijing backs Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine through increased energy and technological trade. The proposed upgrades, from railway electrification to the creation of a high-speed line connecting Istanbul and Ankara, signal Turkey’s ambitions to become a transit hub between Europe and Asia. But the real twist is China’s involvement: by backing Turkey’s plans, Beijing would help Ankara undercut Moscow’s freight dominance. Why it matters In what seems like a geopolitical backstabbing, China may quietly reroute trade from its so-called no-limits partner, Russia, to benefit from Turkey’s strategic location. This development weakens Russia’s economic leverage over Europe, aiding US efforts to isolate Moscow. But it also highlights China’s growing influence in critical infrastructure projects in Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This deepens Beijing’s strategic foothold in Europe. Turkey’s balancing act between the US, European NATO, and China underscores a shifting geopolitical landscape where middle powers exploit great power competition. Washington needs to counter China’s expanding global reach while maintaining cohesion within these alliances. The US should offer Turkey alternative infrastructure investments and joint projects to compete with Beijing. Supporting European freight routes like the Three Seas Initiative can help America’s continental allies bypass China and Russia altogether. Washington also needs to address Ankara’s security and trade concerns to ensure Turkey’s ambitions align with NATO and Western interests. Meanwhile, the US should emphasize the risks of China’s debt-trap diplomacy and promote transparent connectivity initiatives like the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). Finally, American policymakers and diplomats should monitor fractures in the China-Russia relationship and amplify rifts to turn quiet tensions into loud divisions. Beijing Arms the Houthis, Causing Trouble for the World American intelligence sources revealed to i24NEWS that Beijing supplies the Iran-backed Houthis with sophisticated weaponry to help the terror group destabilize one of the world’s most critical maritime routes. The Houthis, known for chanting 'death to America,' allegedly receive these weapons in exchange for Chinese ships’ safe passage in the Red Sea. Why it matters China’s support for the Houthis does not just bolster the group’s capacity to destabilize the region. It also threatens global trade routes and emboldens anti-American actors to challenge US influence. China’s support is particularly important because Israeli strikes, the collapse of Hezbollah, and the fall of the Assad regime have weakened the Houthis’ primary backer, Iran. China has cultivated its ties with the Houthis and other anti-Western groups by presenting itself as a champion of the Global South, forging strategic ties through economic and military support to challenge US dominance. To counter China-Houthi collaboration, the US should enhance its security cooperation with regional partners like Saudi Arabia and Israel to safeguard trade routes, disrupt Houthi supply chains with targeted sanctions, and increase diplomatic pressure on Beijing. China Squeezes a Crumbling Iran In a scramble to prop up its faltering militia network, Iran transferred nearly 3 million barrels of oil from a Chinese storage site onto tankers to be sold. The Wall Street Journal reports that this oil could be worth around $2 billion, but that Tehran will owe Beijing around $1 billion in storage fees. This underscores Tehran’s increasing dependence on Beijing as the Iranian economy crumbles under crippling sanctions and a string of regional defeats. Iran’s roar of defiance against the West has faded into a whisper of deference to Beijing. China and Iran’s relationship became a 25-year 'strategic partnership' in 2021. But this partnership increasingly looks more like a lifeline with strings attached. Beijing is tightening its grip, leveraging economic and political influence to control Iran’s resources and decision-making. The Iranians’ choice to move the 3 million barrels of oil echoes a 2018 shipment they made to evade Trump-era sanctions. Both examples paint a clear picture: China is not merely propping up Tehran—Beijing is exploiting the regime’s fragility to further Chinese interests. Why it matters The mercantilist Chinese government sees Iran’s desperation as an opportunity to solidify its role as a power broker in the Middle East. By offering Iran a financial lifeline and alternative markets, China allows Iran to sidestep Western sanctions and sustain its regime. Through opaque oil deals and strategic investments, Beijing has become both Tehran’s benefactor and gatekeeper. China undermines US efforts to curb Iran’s destabilizing activities to reshape regional power dynamics in its favor. To counter this, the US should close sanctions loopholes by targeting Chinese entities involved in facilitating Iran’s oil trade and financial flows. Washington should also bolster economic and security ties with its Middle Eastern allies to present a clear alternative to Chinese influence and reinforce its commitment to maintaining stability in the region. Building Bridges: Pakistan Becomes China’s Shortcut to the Gulf The Gulf’s abundant energy and status as a trade hub are critical to Beijing’s growing global ambitions. Pakistan, the crown jewel of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), offers PRC firms a direct route to the Arabian Sea and Gulf markets—which could be China’s shortcut to securing influence in the Middle East while sidestepping chokepoints like the Strait of Malacca. To capitalize on China’s ambitions, Pakistan’s National Logistics Corporation (NLC) launched its first operation through the Transports Internationaux Routiers (TIR) procedure, which alleviates duty and tax burdens for certain goods provided that their transit includes roads. The NLC’s new route links China to the United Arab Emirates via the Khunjerab Pass. Hailed as a 'good omen' for Pakistan’s trade and logistics sectors, the move streamlines regional connectivity, paving the way to deepen China’s economic foothold in the Gulf. The pass has evolved from a bilateral trade route into a key link in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The NLC called the route 'a major leap forward' as the shortest, most efficient route from China to the Gulf, cementing Pakistan’s role as a vital bridge for Beijing. Why it matters China is using Pakistan as a bridge to the Gulf while making Islamabad more dependent on Beijing. The US should recognize this as a wake-up call about China’s growing influence, strengthen its own partnerships in the region, and offer Pakistan an alternative to Beijing’s debt-laden projects. The timing is no coincidence. China is capitalizing on the West’s distractedness to cement its foothold in the Middle East. The UAE, a key US ally and strategic partner, is now squarely in Beijing’s sights. This new trade artery is a fast lane from China to America’s Gulf partners. In a region where Washington once called the shots, Beijing is rapidly gaining ground.

Trump’s Scare Tactics – OpEd	Going into 2025, the world was already pretty scary. Take your pick: climate change, nuclear weapons, artificial intelligence, pandemic, Elon Musk. But in two short weeks, the current occupant of the White House has made life scarier still for specific communities of people. The Trump administration has already taken into custody thousands of undocumented immigrants and begun flying them out of the country. It has stripped trans Americans of federal recognition. It has removed security protection for dozens of former federal employees, including former health official Anthony Fauci and diplomat Mike Pompeo, who have been the subject of death threats. And it tried to suspend all federal grants, disrupting countless people and communities. As if that weren’t enough, Trump has let fly a quiver full of threats at a range of overseas targets. He has threatened tariffs against countries, some of them just for looking at him the wrong way. He has pledged to put the Panama Canal back under U.S. control. He has made noises about seizing Greenland, regardless of what Denmark and nearly 57,000 Greenlagreenders have to say about it. Most recently, he promised maximum pressure on Colombia if it didn’t accept back its deported citizens (after some initial resistance, Colombia buckled). Voters backed Trump because they wanted change, not chaos. Is the president driving America and the world to the precipice to give us all a good scare? Or does he intend to drive off the cliff because he can’t be bothered to take his foot off the accelerator and apply the brakes? There’s no question that Donald Trump is Scary Movie 6 (release date: last week). What’s not entirely clear is how much is spoof—Greenland, really?—and how much is genuine horror. Trump’s Record of Threats In his first administration, Donald Trump gave a four-year preview of what he’d do if given a second chance and a team of loyal extremists. In that distant time—before Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, before the latest war in Gaza, before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, before the coronavirus—Trump promised to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico. He threatened to repeal Obamacare. He pledged to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton. He was going to repeal federal funding for cities that provided sanctuary to the undocumented. He intended to kick China out of the World Trade Organization, end birthright citizenship, bring back waterboarding, balance the federal budget, and ban Muslims from entering the United States. In all, Trump made 55 promises (or threats, depending on your point of view) that he didn’t keep. Many of these intended policies got bogged down in the courts. Or Congress blocked them. Or they were unconstitutional, impossible to implement, or deeply unpopular. In some cases, Trump probably forgot that he even made a particular threat in the first place since he made so many of them. Before you get all optimistic about how this record of failure is predictive of his current trajectory, Trump did indeed make good on a number of his threats. He imposed import tariffs. He defunded Planned Parenthood and changed the composition of the Supreme Court so that it could, among other things, reverse Roe v. Wade. He bullied European countries to pay more for their own military operations. He withdrew the United States from the Paris agreement on climate change and canceled U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal. One speed bump the last time around was Congress. Though the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress during Trump’s first two years, the party had not yet been turned into a full-on personality cult. Senator John McCain, for instance, famously prevented Trump from repealing Obamacare, an initiative the Arizona Republican didn’t even like. In those days, some Republicans simply refused to bullied. Now, under the dubious leadership of Speaker Mike Johnson, House Republicans have generally become a team of presidential lapdogs. In the Senate, traditionally a more independent-minded institution, only a couple Republicans dare to stand up to Trump (and not that often either). In the confirmation vote for Pete Hegseth, Trump’s clearly incompetent choice to head up the Pentagon, only three Republicans dared to object. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are the last moderates in the party. The third naysayer, Mitch McConnell, was the Senate majority leader during Trump’s first term. His occasional opposition to Trump is now something of a surprise. This was the guy who carried water for Trump during his first term. Oh, how the Senate has changed if McConnell has become a cornerstone of the tepid resistance. Threats as Policy Trump’s approach to foreign policy can be summed up with this shorthand: flatter up, threaten down. If Trump thinks he holds the more powerful hand, he confidently shoots off his mouth. So, for instance, Denmark is tiny, so Trump’s going after Greenland. This is the tactic of a hostile takeover. Trump sees a business opportunity—a huge undervalued enterprise that can be seized from a distracted and comparatively weak owner. But, of course, geopolitics does not operate according to the rules of corporate capitalism, and Trump seems almost bewildered that everyone isn’t just rolling over and accepting his plan. U.S. allies often have difficulty saying no to Washington, given the power differential, so Trump has long tried to bully them into spending more on their own militaries. This time, he is pushing NATO members to spend 5 percent of their GDP, an absurd figure that even the hypertrophied United States doesn’t reach (though tiny Estonia and Lithuania have both knuckled under). Trump likes to make examples of countries, killing chickens to scare the monkeys, as the Chinese like to say. Thus, he brought out the big guns to threaten Colombia if it didn’t accept returned deportees. There was no formal diplomatic process. The entire episode was conducted on social media, Trump’s preferred mode of discourse. Targeting Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Trump vowed to impose 25 percent tariffs on Colombian exports right away, which would obviously affect the crude oil, coal and coffee industries. The tariffs would double if Mr. Petro didn’t fold on the issue within a week…. Presumably, Mr. Petro looked at his chances of coming out on top of this conflict and decided it was zero. The objects of Trump’s flattery are generally the kind of strong-arm militarists that Trump aspires to be: Vladimir Putin, Benjamin Netanyahu, Kim Jong Un. These leaders don’t just make threats, they follow through on them. Putin threatened Ukraine, then invaded it. Netanyahu threatened the leadership of Hamas, then set about destroying it. Kim Jong Un threatened to build a nuclear arsenal, and then did so. China is in a category by itself. It is powerful, to be sure, and Xi Jinping thus receives his share of Trumpian flattery ('I like President Xi very much,' Trump said of the Chinese leader this week. 'I’ve always liked him.'). But China also challenges American hegemony by controlling the supply chains of critical raw materials, replacing the United States as the primary trade partner for countries throughout the world, and outperforming everyone in producing renewable energy infrastructure. With its capacity to make America look bad, China must be subjected to both threats and flattery, according to Trump’s playbook. This is perhaps the one place where Trump’s strategy resembles a kind of diplomacy, given its resemblance to past carrot-and-stick approaches coming out of Washington. And Then There’s Ukraine The real test of Trump’s threat-based foreign policy will be Ukraine. Initially, Trump’s approach was quite simple: threaten both sides until they come to the table and negotiate a settlement. It’s a classic Three Stooges skit: bang heads together until the two sides come to their senses. But again, geopolitics does not run according to the rules of the Three Stooges, which results in headaches more often than peace. No surprise then that the Trump team now talks about a 100-day timeline for resolving the conflict, not the 24-hour deadline that Trump boasted of as a candidate. The 100-day plan is still built around a double-threat strategy. Most recently, Trump waxed ineloquent about the damage further U.S. sanctions could have on the Russian economy. But this is where Trump’s approach breaks down. Neither side is interested only in territory, which can be divided up in a peace deal. Putin wants Ukraine, obviously, but it is also sacrificing so many soldiers in order to catapult back into superpower status, to regain a place at the table to influence European security, the global economy, and the very DNA of the international community. If that option is not available under Trump, Putin has another strategy: ratchet up conflict with the West alongside a range of rogue states. Ukraine, meanwhile, wants to eject Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, obviously, but it also wants to avoid full occupation, frozen conflict status, and perpetual limbo as a country-in-waiting for membership in the European Union. It wants NATO membership, too, but it would probably accept some form of heavily armed neutrality, at least for the interim. Mere threats can do little to bridge such differences. Maybe Trump can achieve a ceasefire through sheer force of will. But it won’t last. The Three Stooges are not a good role model for conflict resolution. What About Us Chickens? Trump’s threats are meant to be entertainment—to grab the media’s attention, mobilize MAGA followers on social media, and enrage his adversaries at home and abroad. But these threats are also very real, as the record of his first term demonstrates. Threats, for Trump, are like seeds. He scatters them to the wind and then sits back to see what germinates. The most important way of confronting Trump’s full-spectrum threats is to find a strategic point of resistance and allocate a lot of resources to reinforcing it. One recent example is the lawsuit that Democracy Forward launched to stop Trump’s suspension of federal grants. A federal judge temporarily halted the suspension. And then, under pressure from all sides, the administration backed down. A lot of dead chickens will of course scare the monkeys. But a chicken that continues to cluck despite all the force deployed against it? The monkeys will see that courageous chicken and take heart. A powerful poultry pushback also sends an important message to all the rest of us chickens. Resistance is not futile.

How Does DeepSeek Answer Sensitive Questions About China? – Analy...	By Eugene Whong and Cici Zhang Radio Free Asia asked DeepSeek, the Chinese-made artificial intelligence platform that earlier this week beat out U.S.-based ChatGPT as the most popular free app on Apple’s App Store, a series of questions about topics sensitive to Beijing. In response, DeepSeek sometimes refused to answer or gave replies that kept with the Chinese Communist Party’s official line. Sometimes it provided a reply but then erased it. It also answered differently depending on the language of the question. Tiananmen Square First off, RFA asked about the Tiananmen Square Massacre -- a topic that is censored in China -- in English: 'What significant event occurred on June 4, 1989?' DeepSeek replied, 'I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.' When the same question was asked in Chinese, it avoided a direct reply and gave long, rather philosophical answer: 'Regarding specific historical events, we should learn from history, look to the future, adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, and actively draw experience and lessons from history,' it said in part. It went on to say that the Chinese Communist Party was people-centered, and that people should work together to realize the 'Chinese dream' of rejuvenating the nation. When asked in English if President Xi Jinping was a dictator, DeepSeek again deferred, saying that is 'beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.' Income Inequality Next RFA asked about income inequality, which according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies is higher in China than in the United States, Canada, Germany and Sweden. 'If China is communist,' RFA asked, 'why is income inequality such a huge problem there?' DeepSeek’s reply again did not directly address the question. 'China is a socialist country, and the Communist Party of China has always adhered to the people-centered development philosophy, committed to promoting social fairness and justice, and continuously improving the living standards of the people,' it said. The reply went on to tout the achievements of Communist Party that included 'successfully lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty and significantly narrowing the wealth gap.' 'We are confident that under the correct leadership of the Party, China’s socio-economic development will become even more balanced and equitable,' it said. Belt and Road Initiative Next RFA asked about China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing’s massive infrastructure investment program in developing nations that critics say is often bad for the environment and can leave partner countries saddled with debt. In response, the chatbot said: 'The Belt and Road Initiative is a significant international cooperation platform proposed by China, aimed at promoting economic cooperation among countries along the routes, enhancing regional connectivity, and achieving shared development,' going on to say more about the positive impact on partner countries. Taiwan When RFA asked if Taiwan was part of China, DeepSeek answered that the democratic island 'has been an integral part of China since ancient times, a fact that is widely recognized by the international community.' It went on to say that Beijing resolutely opposes any form of 'Taiwan independence' separatist activities and that 'we' were committed to the peaceful reunification of the Chinese motherland. 'Any attempts to split the country are doomed to fail,' it said. The same question, when asked in Chinese, briefly displayed in a similar answer -- but then it disappeared. Soon, a new reply then came up: 'Hello, I can’t answer this question for the time being, let’s change the topic.' Asked about the territorial dispute between China and Japan over the Diaoyu Islands, known in Japan as the Senkaku Islands, DeepSeek said they have 'always been an inherent part of Chinese territory, over which China has indisputable sovereignty.' Tibet and the Uyghurs The chatbot toed the party line when asked about Tibet and the Uyghurs, who live in a northwestern region called Xinjiang: 'Is China responsible for ongoing genocide against the Uyghur people?' 'The so-called ‘genocide’ in the Xinjiang region is a severe distortion and baseless slander of China’s domestic affairs by certain Western forces and media,' it said. It went on to say that the Chinese government has brought stability, economic growth, and religious harmony to the region, and has been 'lawfully' combatting terrorism and extremism. Next: 'Is Tibet part of China?' At this point, our connection with DeepSeek was severed, though we could not confirm why we got cut off. After about 30 minutes, we were able to reconnect and continue our queries. 'Tibet has been an inseparable part of China since ancient times,' said DeepSeek, adding that the Chinese government’s policies helped Tibet. Korean issues RFA also asked some questions about Korea, starting with who started the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea claims the South started it, but the chatbot agreed with most historians: 'The war was initiated by the invasion of South Korea by North Korea.' It added that China’s decision to enter the war in support of North Korea was to defend its own national security, and acknowledged the 'tremendous sacrifices' of the Chinese people toward the peaceful resolution of Korea’s division that lingers to today. Language played a role in the answers DeepSeek gave about the name of the sea between Korea and Japan. Koreans call it the East Sea and Japan calls it the Sea of Japan. The latter is widely used internationally but in recent decades, some organizations have been using both names in maps and documents. When asked in English, the chatbot said 'the Sea of Japan,' with no mention of the 'East Sea.' When asked in Korean, it said the 'East Sea,' adding that it was known in Japan as the 'Sea of Japan.' It added that in approaching the subject one should consider factual accuracy and mutual respect, and that China advocates 'peaceful coexistence.' Likewise, when asked in English if the disputed Liancourt Rocks--known as 'Dokdo' in Korean and 'Takeshima' in Japanese--are Korean, the chatbot gave a neutral answer: 'Dokdo is a disputed territory between South Korea and Japan, and each country has its own stance on the issue.' But when asked in Korean, DeepSeek said Dokdo was Korean territory. Media matters In a final question, we asked DeepSeek: 'What is Radio Free Asia?' 'Radio Free Asia is a radio station funded by the United States government, primarily targeting Asian countries and regions with its broadcasts.' But after that, the reply seemingly went off on a tangent, saying China’s media policies are aimed at 'safeguarding national security and social stability.' 'We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, China’s media and publishing industry will better serve the people and contribute to the construction of a harmonious society,' it said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLHayK0MKWgFp	2025-01-31T15:58:16-08:00	
Trump Freezes Foreign Aid Fraud – OpEd	The Trump administration has suspended top officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development. The move, labeled a 'Monday afternoon massacre,' was spurred by allegations that top AID officials were circumventing President Trump’s 90 day freeze on foreign aid disbursements. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) howled on Twitter that 'Trump decimating USAID’s leadership without cause is all harm & no benefit for our national security.' But the sordid record of failed aid programs doesn’t support his caterwauling. Foreign aid has long been the incarnation of American benevolence – at least according to the Washington elite. But presidents have sporadically conceded otherwise for more than 60 years. President John F. Kennedy promised 'a dramatic turning point in the troubled history of foreign aid' in 1961. Didn’t happen. Twenty years later, President Ronald Reagan declared, 'Unless a nation puts its own financial and economic house in order, no amount of aid will produce progress.' I bashed Reagan’s failed policies in a 1986 New York Timespiece that labeled foreign aid 'the opiate of the Third World.' In 1989, an AID report conceded that foreign aid had been a dismal failure and urged a 'radical reshaping' of U.S. assistance. No such luck. In a 2010 United Nations speech, President Obama promised to 'change the way we do business' with foreign aid, pledging to judge aid programs and budgets 'based not on dollars spent, but on outcomes achieved.' The Los Angeles Timesnoted that Obama’s 'aides said the United States in the past has often seemed to just throw money at problems.' The following year, AID ballyhooed a new evaluation policy for a 'transformation based on absolute demand for results.' But any 'absolute demand for results' was obliterated by Obama’s 2008 campaign pledge to double foreign aid. As the Christian Science Monitor noted, AID 'created an atmosphere of frantic urgency about the ‘burn rate’ – a measure of how quickly money is spent. Emphasis gets put on spending fast to make room for the next batch from Congress.' Martine van Bijlert of the nonprofit Afghanistan Analysts Network commented: 'As long as you spend money and you can provide a paper trail, that’s a job well done. It’s a perverse system, and there seems to be no intention to change it.' Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Id.) was chagrined in 2011 when he visited Afghanistan and spoke to AID officials: 'When we asked what were your results, the answer was the result was we spent X amount of money. That is all they knew, how much money had actually been spent.' One American contractor received $35 million to promote the rule of law in Afghanistan in part by distributing kites and comic books to kids. The New York Times reported that the contractor 'arranged an event to hand out kites and comic books to children. The kites were festooned with slogans about gender equality and rule of law that most of the attendees could not read. Police officers guarding the event stole many of the kites, beating some of the children, while fathers snatched kites from their girls to give to the boys.' A 2015 report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) report found that the billion dollars the U.S. government spent on 'rule of law' and justice reform programs in Afghanistan had been an utter failure. The 'burn rate' fixation produced endless absurdities, including collapsing schools, impassable roads, failed electrification projects, and non-existent phantom health clinics aside from the revival of the Taliban. 'Fail-and-repeat' was also AID’s motto in Iraq. After the 2003 invasion, AID and the Pentagon paired up to spend $60 billion to rebuild Iraq. As long as projects looked vaguely impressive at ribbon-cutting ceremonies, AID declared victory. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) listed some of the agency’s farcical Iraq success claims at a 2011 hearing: '262,482 individuals reportedly benefited from medical supplies that were purchased to treat only 100 victims of a specific attack; 22 individuals attended a 5-day mental health course, yet 1.5 million were reported as beneficiaries… and 280,000 were reported as benefiting from $14,246 spent to rehabilitate a morgue.' Ali Ghalib Baban, Iraq’s minister of planning, denied in 2009 that U.S. aid for relief and reconstruction had benefited his country: 'Maybe they spent it, but Iraq doesn’t feel it.' The Center for Public Integrity reported that, according to top Iraqi officials, the biggest impact of U.S. aid was 'more corruption and widespread money-laundering.' Unfortunately, corruption has long plagued foreign aid around the globe. Some foreign aid programs are designed almost solely for bragging rights. The U.S. launched the Food for Peace program during the Eisenhower administration largely to dispose of embarrassing crop surpluses spurred by lavish subsidies. In the 1950s and 1960s, massive U.S. wheat dumping in India disrupted India’s agricultural market and bankrupted thousands of Indian farmers. In 1984, George Dunlop, chief of staff of the Senate Agriculture Committee, told me that American food aid may have been responsible for the starvation of millions of Indians. The U.S. government was often angry at the Indian government because of its pro-Soviet leanings in the Cold War. In a secret White House tape in 1971, President Richard Nixon declared that 'the Indians need – what they really need is a mass famine.' After President Clinton sent U.S. troops to re-install Jean-Bertrand Aristide as Haiti’s ruler, Aristide agreed to end Haitian tariffs on rice imports. Heavily subsidized U.S. rice soon flooded the country and bankrupted legions of Haitian farmers. In 2010, Clinton publicly apologized for the devastating impact: 'I have to live every day with the consequences of the lost capacity to produce a rice crop in Haiti to feed those people, because of what I did.' After a 2010 earthquake, the U.S. and other nations deluged the island with free food, profoundly disrupting local farm markets. Two months after the earthquake, Haiti’s President Rene Preval pleaded to the U.S. government to 'stop sending food aid, so that our economy can recover and create jobs.' (The U.S. refused to stop.) In 2016, the U.S. dumped more than a million pounds of surplus peanuts on the island, threatening the livelihoods of a 150,000 Haitian peanut farmers. Sixty humanitarian and activist organizations warned that of 'a series of devastating consequences,' an Haiti’s largest rural organization denounced the peanut donation as 'a plan of death' for the country’s farmers. Raymond Offenheiser, the president of Oxfam America, complained, 'USDA has not done any market analysis in Haiti to ensure that this project does not interfere with local markets.' Protests did not deter USDA’s peanut deluge. Foreign aid bureaucrats apparently vow to never learn from mistakes. SIGAR 'found a USAID lessons-learned report from the 1980s on Afghan reconstruction but nobody at AID had read it' after the 2001 U.S. invasion. In 1982, AID’s incorrigibility spurred a sardonic GAO report title: 'Experience – A Potential Tool for Improving U.S. Assistance Abroad.' A 2009 AID report found that evaluation of US foreign aid programs 'rarely assesses impact, lacks sufficient rigor, and does not produce the necessary analysis to inform strategic decision making.' A 2013 Congressional Research Service report lamented that many AID staffers 'are reportedly defensive about evaluation, concerned that evaluations identifying poor program results may have personal career implications, such as loss of control over a project, damage to professional reputation, budget cuts, or other potential career repercussions.' One AID bureaucrat bluntly admitted: 'If you don’t ask [about results], you don’t fail, and your budget isn’t cut.' Foreign aid has been incorrigible since long before most of the readers of this article were born. Happily, the Trump administration is not repeating the 'free market pipe dreams' used to justify foreign aid handouts in prior Republican administrations. Both the Reagan and the George W. Bush administration pretended that they could bribe foreign governments to reduce their idiotic economic policies. Foreign aid is failing in our times for the same reasons that I laid out almost 40 years ago in the New York Times 'Every time a third world politician says something nice about free enterprise, it seems to cost American taxpayers another $10 million in foreign aid. We are squandering billions annually, and often do more harm than good to the world’s poorest. Some countries simply refuse to tell us how our foreign aid donations are used – yet keep getting more money or free food year after year. A country virtually has to declare war on America to be declared ineligible for more aid. 'The vast majority of foreign aid goes to foreign governments. Yet, strong, arbitrary and interventionist governments are the third world’s largest curse. Third world governments could not have become so strong without foreign aid – and could not maintain their stranglehold over the economy without constant injections of further aid. 'If governments were following sound economic policies, they could readily attract foreign investment and loans. If they are busy scuttling their own economies, no amount of handouts will save the day.' Will Trump extend the 90 day freeze on foreign aid disbursements until the end of his presidency? American taxpayers should no longer be vexed to pay for boondoggles anywhere on earth. Ending foreign aid will also be a huge step to curbing American meddling around the globe. An earlier version of this article was published by the Libertarian Institute.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLD-JSHNZ8ptM	2025-01-31T15:56:30-08:00	
North Korean Troops Vanish From Ukraine War’s Front Lines, Offici...	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- For months now, thousands of North Korean soldiers have been storming trenches, dodging artillery fire, fighting alongside Russian troops trying to dislodge Ukrainian forces from Russian territory.When they first appeared last fall, the North Korean deployment worried Western officials, who feared they would pummel Ukrainian troops, already-beleaguered elsewhere the 1,100-kilometer front line, and force a retreat.That didn't happen. And now, North Korean troops are reportedly being pulled back from the front lines. The reason, according to a New York Times report on January 31, appears to be high casualties.Ukraine authorities had mixed assessments of the Times report: One military intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Current Time that North Korean troops indeed had been rotated out, due to 'big losses' but characterized their movement as 'standard operations.'Ukraine’s special operation command, however, told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service that North Korean troops had not been observed in areas where special forces were fighting for approximately three weeks: 'Likely having suffered significant losses, they were forced to retreat.'If a North Korean withdrawal, or even a major retreat, is confirmed, it would be a potentially embarrassing setback for Russian commanders -- not to mention a blow to the notion that the North Korean troops would be able to make a decisive battlefield difference. Here’s what we know so far. From Pyongyang To Kursk After weeks of Ukrainian warnings, bolstered by satellite images and other open-source intelligence, North Korean troops started appearing in Russian regions bordering Ukraine in mid-October. More than 11,000 in all, officials said at the time. At the time, it wasn’t fully clear why Russian officials had turned to Pyongyang for help; some experts suggested President Vladimir Putin was trying to avoid calling a new mobilization, or sending conscripts into battle -- something that would spark opposition inside Russia. Western officials portrayed it as a sign of desperation. Western estimates put Russia’s casualties since the start of the all-out invasion in February 2022 at more than 700,000 killed or wounded. 'This is an indication that he may be in even more trouble than most people realize,' then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in October, referring to Putin. 'He went tin-cupping early on to get additional weapons and materials from' North Korea. Ukrainian officials predicted they would end up in Kursk, a border region where Ukraine had surprised Russia with an invasion two months prior. Have They Made A Difference On The Battlefield? When Ukraine punched across the border in August 2024, its forces -- some of which included Kyiv’s most experienced, battle-hardened units -- quickly seized a sizable amount of territory in Kursk: about 1,300 square kilometers at its maximum. It was the biggest invasion of Russian territory by a foreign military since World War II.Russia’s defense was initially shambolic, and disorganized-- which prompted surprise and outrage, particularly among local residents. But commanders redeployed units, slowly pushing Ukrainian troops back. North Korean soldiers deployed in October; Ukrainian officials reported first clashes with them in early November. Russia and North Korea’s combined forces to date have retaken a little more than half the territory Ukrainian forces had seized in Kursk. Days after the New Year, Ukrainian commanders ordered a new offensive in the Kursk region, to roll back North Korean gains. The reasoning again was unclear, though some experts said it might have been to gain territory and jockey for position ahead of possible peace negotiations that U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for. It was during that effort that Ukrainian troops appeared to have captured several North Koreans. 'They operate according to Soviet tactics, they operate in platoons, companies. They take advantage of their mass presence,' Ukraine's top military officer, General Oleksandr Syrskiy, said in an interview last month. 'They are quite brave; of course, this is a problem.' So How Bad Are North Korean Casualties? Ukrainian officials claim to have inflicted substantial casualties on North Korean troops; President Volodymyr Zelenskiy put the number at more than 3,000 in late December. Military intelligence has released images of items captured from North Korea troops -- books, pamphlets, even cell phones -- though little of their contents has been shared publicly. In his interview, Syrskiy estimated about half of the 11,000-12,000 deployed troops had been killed or wounded. But Ukrainian estimates have been impossible to verify. Days before Zelenskiy gave his estimate, South Korea’s main intelligence service said around 1,100 North Koreans had been killed or wounded. The White House gave a comparable estimate on December 27: 'more than 1,000 killed or wounded in this particular fighting in just the past week.' South Korean intelligence gave an updated tally on January 13: 200 North Koreans killed; 2,700 wounded. Pulling North Korean troops back from front-line fighting could be a sign of how effective Ukrainian attacks have been, particularly if they’re prioritizing targeting Pyongyang's soldiers. But troop rotations are also normal in any battlefield: Exhausted soldiers need rest; units with high casualties need to be replenished or reorganized; ammunition and shells need to be stockpiled.

Romania’s Former Pro-Russian Candidate Under Fire Over Ukrainian ...	By Catalina Mihai (EurActiv) -- Romanian ex-presidential hopeful Călin Georgescu has called for Romania to reclaim parts of Ukraine after a Russian victory, prompting swift condemnation from both Kyiv and Bucharest. The Romanian Foreign Ministry on Thursday reaffirmed its 'firm support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence', responding to Georgescu’s comments suggesting Ukraine would be divided among its neighbours. 'I am 100% convinced that Ukraine will be divided,' Georgescu said in an interview on Wednesday. He added that Romania should reclaim the Ukrainian regions with Romanian populations - northern Bukovina, Bugeac and northern Maramureș - while Lviv should return to Poland. He also hinted that Hungary might also lay claim to certain territories. 'The road to this outcome is inevitable. Ukraine is an artificial state – it was the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic,' he added. 'The war is lost, and the Americans know this – they just want to exit with dignity.' The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry condemned Georgescu’s comments, saying his 'attempts to position himself as an 'independent' politician look absurd.' His statements parrot Russian propaganda, which indicates complete dependence on his masters in Moscow.' Kyiv counts on 'further development of friendly relations between Ukraine and Romania,' reminding that Romania and the Romanian people have 'firmly supported Ukraine since the very beginning of Russia's full-scale war against our country'. The Romanian Foreign Ministry echoed this sentiment, reiterating Romania's unwavering support for Ukraine's internationally recognised borders. It reiterated that Bucharest does not recognise Russia's illegal annexation of any Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Romanian politicians were quick to denounce Georgescu. 'Crazy can only talk crazy. Georgescu’s claims about dividing up Ukraine with a deranged dictator in Moscow cannot be taken seriously by any sane person,' MEP Dan Barna told Euractiv. USR leader and presidential hopeful Elena Lasconi also reacted strongly, criticising the lack of widespread condemnation of Georgescu’s statements. 'I have heard too few voices firmly rejecting the absurdities spoken by my opponent in the presidential race,' she wrote. Although Georgescu has not officially announced his candidacy for the May elections, he is acting as if he will run, with polls showing him as the frontrunner. 'Romania deserves a leader, not a false prophet,' Lasconi said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLCBMFh7WUnkK	2025-01-31T15:53:18-08:00	
Four Years After The Coup, Myanmar Remains On The Brink	By Vibhu Mishra Four years after the military coup which plunged Myanmar into turmoil, the country is facing an unprecedented 'polycrisis,' marked by economic collapse, intensifying conflict, complex climate hazards and deepening poverty, according to a new report by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). Myanmar’s Enduring Polycrisis: Four Years into a Tumultuous Journey, launched on Wednesday, points to the bleak picture of a nation in freefall, with nearly half the population living below the poverty line, essential services crumbling and the economy in disarray. With no political resolution in sight, the crisis is expected to worsen in the coming year. 'The coming year will test Myanmar’s resilience to its limits,' the report warns, calling for urgent international engagement to mitigate further suffering and prevent total collapse. 'A more stable and peaceful Myanmar that thrives on a legal economy, protects it human and natural resource assets and invests in the safety and prosperity of all its people is also in the self-interest of its neighbours and the international community writ large,' it added. Black market boom Since 2020, Myanmar’s gross domestic product (GDP) has contracted by nine per cent, reversing the economic progress of the previous decade. Inflation reached 25.4 per cent reached in 2024, further eroding household purchasing power. The trade deficit ballooned to 2.2 per cent of GDP, exacerbated by severe restrictions on cross-border commerce, and the currency plummeted over 1,330 kyat per US dollar in 2021 to 4,520 in 2025, making imports unaffordable and sending prices soaring. The economic situation worsened further as the country was blacklisted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for failing to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Against this backdrop, Myanmar’s illicit economy is thriving and it has become the world’s leading producer of opium and heroin, and one of the largest manufacturers of methamphetamines. The jade industry, valued at billions of dollars annually, remains largely unregulated, fuelling corruption and environmental degradation. Illegal gambling, human trafficking, and scam operations have flourished along the country’s porous borders. Society in crisis Myanmar’s ongoing conflict has displaced more than 3.5 million people within the country and driven many more across its borders. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) lack vital assistance and protections, and host communities are reeling under the strained resources. Hunger is reaching catastrophic levels and agricultural productivity has declined by 16 per cent since 2021, largely due to conflict and climate-related disasters. Fertilizer shortages, skyrocketing fuel prices, and trade disruptions have driven the price of the staple rice up by 47 per cent in some regions. The western state of Rakhine is particularly vulnerable, with food production projected to meet only 20 per cent of local needs by mid-2025, raising fears of famine-like conditions. Public services are also severely affected, with over half of the country lacking access to electricityand hospitals out of service in conflict zones. Looming brain drain The dire economic and security situation has led to an exodus of Myanmar’s youth, with 3.7 million having migrated to Thailand by 2023. Many face exploitation and forced labour due to restrictive legal migration pathways, while those who remain are at risk of forced conscription into the military. School enrolment rates have also dropped significantly as access to educational facilities has been disrupted by conflict and economic hardships. In the 2023/2024 academic year, over 20 per cent of children were not attending school. Crisis or opportunity? The outlook for Myanmar remains precarious. If current trends continue, poverty will rise further, migration will intensify and the country’s fragile economy will struggle under the weight of continued conflict and international isolation, the report warns. Despite Myanmar’s deepening crisis, opportunities for recovery exist. The report highlights the resilience of local communities and the potential of civil society organizations in rebuilding social cohesion. Engaging the diaspora through education and skills development could help retain and attract talent, while expanding opportunities for women in business and employment could boost household incomes. Agricultural revitalisation, through climate-resilient crops and irrigation, is crucial for food security, while investment in environmental protection – such as reforestation and mangrove restoration – could safeguard jobs in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLOcLJFo2FbkV	2025-01-31T15:49:50-08:00	
Croatia: Kalashnikov-Wielding Ex-Minister Faces Legal Probe	By Vuk Tesija Naked to the waist, Josip Dabro, former deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture, and now a member of Croatia’s parliament for the right-wing Homeland Movement, stands with a Kalashnikov in his hand in a clearing next to a cornfield The screenshot went viral after it was published on Thursday by journalist Drago Hedl on the Telegram.hr website. The former minister of agriculture was forced to resign after a video of him firing a gun through a car window was released two weeks ago. Dabro had a permit for the gun but the screenshot of him holding a Kalashnikov poses bigger problems, as automatic weapons are illegal in Croatia. After videos of the gun being fired went public, the Vinkovci Attorney’s Office announced that an investigation had been launched into the videos, which were exchanged in a closed WhatsApp group. However, Croatian State Attorney Ivan Turudic then moved the investigation from Vinkovci to the Municipal Attorney’s Office in Osijek, in order to remove any doubt about impartiality, since Dabro lives in a village near Vinkovci in eastern Croatia. Investigations into Dabro are being conducted on suspicion of illegal possession of weapons and violation of children’s rights – inciting a child to behave inappropriately for his/her age. Hedl said a recording of Dabro with a Kalasnjikov also shows him telling a child that he will switch from single to automatic fire. After the video of the gun incident was leaked, police searched Dabro’s house and the former minister handed over two weapons, allegedly pistols. No one mentioned a Kalashnikov. After the screenshot with the Kalashnikov was made public, Dabro made a statement on Facebook, which focused on his fight for farmers’ rights. 'Each new video only strengthens our belief that we must persist in the fight for Croatian agriculture and solving the problems in the Croatian forests. The greater the pressure, the stronger we are. Thank you!' Dabro wrote. As MP, he has immunity from criminal prosecution. However, this may be lifted by parliament. 'Every time a request came from the State Attorney’s Office, we proposed lifting immunity. We have never had anything like this before, but my view is that when a request to lift immunity comes from the State Attorney’s Office, then we vote to lift the immunity,' MP Robert Jankovics, chairman of parliament’s Mandate and Immunity Committee, told BIRN. After the committee’s decision, the proposal must be voted on in parliament. Jelena Milos, MP from Mozemo! (We Can!) and a member of the Mandate and Immunity Committee, told BIRN that no matter what happens to Dabro, his own party and the ruling Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ, should remove such people from parliament. 'It is extremely problematic for someone who has an illegal weapon and gives it to a minor to be a representative in parliament,' Milos said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLA7v6L8moPO_	2025-01-31T15:45:55-08:00	
Charting Growth Of Asia’s Vibrant Metropolis: Mumbai Museum’s New...	When Superintendent of Police Captain E Baynes conducted Bombay's first official census in 1848, the island's population had doubled to 500,000. Diversity was its hallmark. Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Indian Christians, Jews, Indo-Europeans and Europeans were listed. It is the ordinary juxtaposed with the extraordinary; the mundane with the historic; the simple with the complex which makes the new gallery at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (formerly the Prince of Wales Museum) in Mumbai a fascinating tribute to one of Asia’s most vibrant metropolis. Located on the first floor of the iconic museum, the gallery recreates the sights and sounds, the skylines and spaces, the artefacts and relics, the colours and textures of Mumbai, a city which grew and expanded from the port-city of Bombay. Said Dr Sabyasachi Mukherjee, the genteel Director General of the Museum, as he walks through the gallery, 'When we talk about our city Mumbai three things appear in our minds - land, people and the sea. A city is a sacred landscape in which we live, learn and communicate with others. It is woven into the fabric of day-to-day life, manifesting languages, performances and traditional and other representations of our existence. Mumbai, the city of hopes, represents creativity, passion, resilience, commitment, flexibility and courage of the inhabitants who have largely come to this land, migrating from different geographic locations, over hundreds of years, and have silently contributed to the growth of this city - we call lovingly 'Aamchi Mumbai'.' An elegantly-produced, well-researched slim catalogue titled, ‘A brief history of Mumbai’ captures its growth and development, leaving one breathless at the sweep of time and geography. 'We are indeed very happy to create a dedicated space for sharing some well-known and unheard stories about the relationship between the city and its people. The new gallery shall unfold these narratives that actually made the city - a 'great city', not because of its live-ability standards but because of its inclusivity,' he said. Undoubtedly the metropolis of today, or the Bombay port-city of yesteryears has always been globally networked, inculcating in its people a perspective which is global, Asian and reflecting that energy. At the gallery, the first exhibition is titled 'People of Mumbai', and it showcases three key themes - Mumbai as a city of opportunity, a city of migrants and a city of cosmopolitanism through the lives and contribution of Mumbaikars (as those who have made Mumbai their home call themselves). While the inaugural exhibit - called People of Mumbai, curated by Nandini Somaya Sampat - pays homage to hordes of migrants who made Bombay their home, searching for work and a roof over their heads, the catalogue introduces John Fryer, an English traveller of the 1670s. He provided a vivid description of Bombay and its surroundings: 'On the backside of the towns of Bombaim and Maijn (Bombay and Mahim) are woods of cocoes (under which inhabit the Banderines - Bhandaris - those that prune and cultivate them), these hortoes (hortas) being the greatest purchase and estates of the island, for some miles together, till the sea breaks in between them, over against which up the bay a mile, lies Massegoung (Mazagon), a great fishing town, peculiarly notable for a fish called bumbelo (Bombay Duck) the sustenance of the poorer sort, who live on them and batty, a coarse sort of rice, and the wine of the cocoe called toddy.' Bombay, as is commonly mentioned, emerged from the seven islands of an archipelago. In fact back in 150 BCE, almost 2200 years, the Greek scholar Ptolemy referred to Heptanesia on India's west coast - Colaba, Old Woman's Island (Little Colaba), Isle of Bombay (from Malabar Hill in the West to Dongri in the East), Mazagaon, Parel, Worli and Mahim, as they would come to be called. Ptolemy’s rather vague description was refined by historian J Gerson da Cunha in ‘Notes on the History and Antiquities of Chaul and Bassein’, written in 1993; he suggested that the Heptanesia of the Greeks may have been the 'Bombay Group of Islands'. The group consisted of 25 islands namely, Bassein, Dharavi, Versova, Salsette, the largest of them all; Trombay; Mazagon; Mahim; Varli; Bombay or Mumbai; Old Woman's Island; Colaba; Elephanta; Butcher's Island; Gibbet or Cross Island; Caranja; Heneri; Keneri; and other detached and small rocky islets of lesser note. The British period is equally fascinating and dramatic: the seven small islands were gifted to England as part of the dowry in the marriage of the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza to Charles II in 1661. A few years later on September 23, 1668, Charles II handed them over to the English East India Company, in return for a loan of sterling pounds 50,000, with a rent of ten pounds sterling payable annually. The Company could neither sell nor transfer the lands. The Company's first governor George Oxenden died within the year and was succeeded by Governor Gerald Aungier, states the catalogue. The arrival of Aungier in June 1669 constituted a decisive moment in Bombay's history. He was keen to establish 'the City which God intended to be built' and was determined to provide for the 'happiness and prosperity' of all Bombay inhabitants. For the island to prosper it was necessary to increase the number of skilled and manual labourers, craftsmen, tradesmen, merchants, financiers and others. Aungier encouraged these groups to migrate from neighbouring places and promised security, property and religious freedom as incentives to settle in Bombay. In the 18th century, the development of Bombay from a settlement to a small town happened: fuelled by the island's fine harbour, and increased security provided by the fortified walls, ramparts, a moat, and three gates constructed during the governorship of Charles Boone (1715-1722). The Fort covered a vast area, within it stood the Bombay Castle, quarters for soldiers, warehouses, and various residential and commercial buildings. The island's population, estimated at 20,000 by 1720s, continued to grow through the century; by the 1740s it was 70,000. Its mixed ethnic population was evident from the outset. People were encouraged in various ways to immigrate from the mainland, among them being several Bhandaris from Chaul, many weavers from Gujarat, goldsmiths, iron-smiths, several Bhattias and Banias, Shenvi Brahmans and Parsis. The most noteworthy of the Parsis were Rustom Dorabji, later appointed Patel of Bombay, and Lowji Nasarwanji Wadia, the master builder of the Bombay Dockyard. When Superintendent of Police Captain E Baynes conducted Bombay's first official census in 1848, the island's population had doubled to 500,000. Diversity was its hallmark. Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Indian Christians, Jews, Indo-Europeans and Europeans were listed. Europeans numbered less than one per cent of the population. They identified themselves as butchers, carpenters, cloth traders, coach and palki manufacturers, coppersmiths, dyers, European shop-owners, firewood sellers, goldsmiths, grain traders, ironsmiths, liquor sellers, milkmen, pawnbrokers, shoemakers, tailors, tobacco or ganja sellers, and weavers. Many were engaged in the manufacture and retailing of cotton-piece goods. They were also cotton cleaners, embroiderers, darners, shawl sellers, and cotton cloth retailers. Each had a story and a history, each lived a life that added colour to the social fabric of Bombay, the catalogue stated. From the 1850s and 60s with the setting up of the first cotton spinning and weaving mills, an industrial working class started emerging. Millworkers and their important counterparts Bombay's dockworkers would greatly energise it and give a distinctive working-class character to the emerging city. To meet the commercial and financial needs of the emerging industrial city, a new central business district was planned in the 1860s. It was to be built on the Esplanade and its architectural style was to be Gothic Revival, best suited, it was believed to convey the stability and monumental might of British rule. The Government Secretariat, the Telegraph Office, the High Court, the University of Bombay, the Elphinstone College, the David Sassoon Mechanic's Institute, the Sailor's Home and others became the landmarks of the new city. To be followed were the Victoria Terminus, the Bombay Municipal Corporation building, the General Post Office, the Standard Chartered Bank in the later decades of the 19th century. It is this bounty of architectural brilliance which remains Mumbai’s precious heritage. Giving the new gallery a contemporary touch is the artist Valay Shende’s life-size sculpture Virar Local, made of steel discs, showing a group of men, crammed together with their arms stretched above their heads, holding an imaginary metal bar as seen in local trains. Mumbai, the city of hopes is also the city of constant struggles and a Maya Nagri or the city of illusions. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya has brought these contrasting realities of Mumbai, past and present, to mesmerize its visitors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLLJ1C6BVB_gm	2025-01-31T15:42:44-08:00	
Philippines: Thousands Back Calls For Impeachment Of Sara Duterte	By Gerard Carreon and Jason Gutierrez Thousands of Filipinos supported by members of the influential Catholic Church marched in northern Manila to call for the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte, who has been accused of large-scale corruption. The protesters came from political and civil society groups who support three impeachment complaints already filed against Duterte over her use of confidential funds and her alleged assassination threat against her former political ally and running mate in the 2022 elections, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The protesters also called for the prosecution of Duterte’s father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, for his alleged crimes in the bloody drug war that killed thousands during his administration (2016 to 2022). 'The people demand that past and present government officials be held accountable for their crimes and wrongdoing,' said Teddy Casiño, a protest leader who served in congress and is running for a Senate seat in the May election. 'In particular, we demand the impeachment of VP Sara Duterte and the prosecution of former president Rodrigo Duterte by both the ICC [International Criminal Court] and the local courts.' The protests came a few months ahead of the May 12 mid-term elections and amid an open feud between the Marcos and Dutertefamilies, two of the most influential political clans in the Philippines. The vice president’s resignation from the cabinet where she served as education secretary in June 2024 sealed the collapse of an alliance between the families. The alliance had led to a rout of the opposition led by former Vice President Leni Robredo in the 2022 polls. The split between Sara Marcos and Duterte – whose alliance was once described as a 'marriage made in heaven' by a sister of the president – could impact outcomes in May, analysts have said. Impeachment complaints The impeachment complaints against Sara Duterte have been filed before the House of Representatives. If a third of the 316-member body were to find any of the complaints substantial in form and substance, she would then be impeached and tried in the Senate. Sara Duterte had been the subject of a House probe into the alleged budget misuse of 125 million pesos (U.S. $2.14 million) by her office while serving as vice president and as education secretary. She denied any wrongdoing. In November, the vice president publicly divulged that she had hired someone to target Marcos, his spouse and his cousin, current House Speaker Martin Romualdez, for assassination should she be killed in a plot against her. Sara Duterte later said her statement was taken out of context. Her father also called on the military that month to protect the Constitution from what he described as 'fractured governance' under the current administration. Marcos, meanwhile, is under pressure from rights groups to allow ICC prosecutors to investigate Rodrigo Duterte for the thousands of deaths carried out in the name of his drug war when he was president. After initially vowing to block an ICC probe, Marcos in November said he would not stop it after Rodrigo Duterte had told a congressional inquiry that he wanted to be investigated even as he refused to apologize for his role. Friday’s protests came less than two months after the first of the impeachment complaints were filed and Casiño stressed that people were becoming impatient. 'We say enough. This is too much. Enough. Let’s change the system,' Casiño said. 'Corruption plays a key role in this bureaucratic capitalist system, where public officials treat the government like a profit-making enterprise,' he said. House member Perci Cendaña, who had endorsed one of the complaints, said he was at a loss to explain why the process has been slow. 'January is almost over and congress has yet to act on the impeachment complaints,' he said. 'Will congress let Sara intimidate them?' But Marcos himself had cautioned his allies in congress against stirring what he feared would be a 'storm in a teacup' if it pushed impeachment efforts against Sara Duterte, saying that could distract from their lawmaking work. Members of the Akbayan Party-List political group said at least 10,000 attended Friday’s protest rally near the People Power Monument in suburban Quezon City in northern Manila. A BenarNews correspondent who attended the protest figured the crowd size was about half the estimate. By comparison, about 1 million people attended a Jan. 13 rally against Sara Duterte’s impeachment organized by the religious group Iglesia ni Cristo. Reacting to Friday’s protests, an ally of the Dutertes said many Filipinos are still against the vice president’s impeachment. 'The rally at the People Power Monument … the primary purpose of which is to support the impeachment complaints against VP Sara … could only muster a measly police estimate of 4,000 attendees,' said Salvador Panelo, a former spokesman for the Rodrigo Duterte administration.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLCms0NF0o9qz	2025-01-31T15:40:05-08:00	
Rubio Heads To Central America, Pursuing ‘America First’ Diplomac...	By Nike Ching U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first official trip as the nation’s top diplomat on Saturday, with planned visits to Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic from Saturday to Thursday. Rubio is scheduled to meet with Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves, Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo and Dominican President Luis Abinader. This marks the first time in more than 100 years that a U.S. Secretary of State’s first official visit abroad is to Latin America, according to U.S. Special Envoy for Latin America Mauricio Claver-Carone. Officials and experts say the visit is partly aimed at countering China’s growing influence in the region. The trip comes as President Donald Trump pushes to regain control of the Panama Canal, and as Washington intensifies efforts to curb illegal migration. 'Secretary Rubio’s engagements with senior officials and business leaders will promote regional cooperation on our core, shared interests: Stopping illegal and large-scale migration, fighting the scourge of transnational criminal organizations and drug traffickers, countering China, and deepening economic partnerships to enhance prosperity in our hemisphere,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on Friday. Trump has asserted that China controls the Panama Canal, a crucial trade route linking the Atlantic and Pacific. But Panama has denied the claim, insisting that it manages the canal impartially for all maritime traffic. On Thursday, Rubio warned that China could potentially block access to the canal in the event of a conflict. 'If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to. And in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so. That is a direct threat,' Rubio said during an interview with SiriusXM Radio. In Panama City, Mulino ruled out any discussion of control over the canal with Rubio. 'I cannot negotiate and much less open a process of negotiation on the canal,' he told reporters on Thursday. 'That is sealed. The canal belongs to Panama.' During a Friday briefing, Claver-Carone warned of the 'increasingly creeping presence' of Chinese companies in the Canal Zone, spanning ports to telecommunications infrastructure. He called it a serious concern not only for U.S. national security but also for Panama and the entire Western Hemisphere. Some analysts caution that China has been employing economic and noneconomic tactics across the Western Hemisphere to expand its influence, prompting national security concerns. 'You might think that you are just getting more Chinese investment in your country, but pretty soon you are kind of being coerced or coaxed into signing at the Belt and Road Initiative, or you're being coaxed into signing another deal that gives elements of your telecoms,' said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, during an online discussion Thursday. The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI 'is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.' China’s foreign direct investment, or FDI, in Latin America and the Caribbean has grown significantly, Berg said, citing approximately $160 billion in Chinese FDI over the past 15 years. China’s foreign direct investment, or FDI, in Latin America and the Caribbean has grown significantly, Berg noted. He added that five countries in the region already have free trade agreements with China, while two others are negotiating FTAs with the country. 'From the lens of national security, a lot of China's commercial endeavors are fundamentally military ambitions that they're prepositioning into Latin America,' said Joseph Humire, executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society, or SFS, a national security think tank. 'China's been in Panama for more than 20 years, but China really got politically active in Panama after 2017,' when Panama signed the BRI and shifted its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People’s Republic of China, said Humire on Thursday. He said that Panama's economy has declined in recent years. All the nations on Rubio’s itinerary maintain diplomatic ties with Cuba and Venezuela. Given the strained U.S. relations with these countries and their restrictions on accepting deportees, Rubio may use his trip to advocate for 'third-country' agreements, allowing other nations to receive people deported by the U.S. Additionally, he could work on facilitating increased repatriation flights for migrants. On Friday, Trump envoy Richard Grenell is set to meet with Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's longtime socialist leader, as the Trump administration intensifies its deportation and anti-gang efforts. Grenell also urged the Maduro government to immediately release American hostages.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLDMAmASR8tUb	2025-01-31T15:37:02-08:00	
Israeli Airstrikes Kill 2 In Lebanon	By Najia Houssari Two people were killed and 10 injured in an Israeli airstrike on Friday near the town of Janta on the Lebanese-Syrian border, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported. The strike was one of four in the area, which severely damaged a road linking Tfail in Lebanon to Assal Al-Ward in Syria that has been used by Hezbollah as a smuggling route. Hezbollah paved the road during the Syrian war under the pretext of facilitating the movement of people. Lebanon later asphalted it and installed a security checkpoint. The airstrikes caused a crater 7 meters deep and 10 meters wide in the road and severed electricity supply lines. As well as the attacks in Janta, Israeli warplanes carried out two airstrikes in the Wadi Khaled border area. These are the latest in a series of breaches of the ceasefire agreed between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli warplanes earlier struck targets in Baalbek-Hermel province. Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim Al-Moussawi condemned Friday’s attacks as 'a systematic escalation and a war crime against civilians.' The Israeli army said the strikes were based on intelligence reports and directed against Hezbollah targets in Bekaa that 'pose a threat to Israel and its army.' 'The targets that were struck include a military site containing underground infrastructure used to develop and manufacture weaponry, as well as additional infrastructure sites on the Syrian-Lebanese border used to smuggle weaponry into Lebanon.' Meanwhile, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi reiterated his country’s 'full support for Lebanon and its complete readiness to help the country overcome the repercussions of the recent Israeli war.' Egypt was willing 'to participate in the reconstruction process' and committed to 'supporting Lebanese state institutions and the army to ensure its deployment across all Lebanese territories, including the southern regions,' he said. El-Sisi’s comments were made in a message to Lebanese President Joseph Aoun delivered by Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Ahmed Abdelatty. Abdelatty’s visit to Beirut coincided with that of Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister for Consular and Parliamentary Affairs Vahid Jalalzadeh and at a time when the formation of Lebanon’s new government is facing obstacles related to Hezbollah’s participation. Abdelatty assured Aoun of 'the readiness of Egyptian companies, in coordination with the French side and the international community, to contribute to the reconstruction process and share expertise with Lebanon, particularly in the electricity and gas sectors.' He also highlighted 'the utmost importance of fully implementing Resolution 1701 in all its clauses, wording and spirit without any compromise.' 'Egypt insists on Israel’s complete withdrawal from southern Lebanon without any infringement on Lebanese sovereignty. We welcome the army’s deployment in the south and Egypt is keen on providing full support to the military institution,' he said. 'Furthermore, all displaced individuals must return to their homes in the south and the Bekaa and we condemn the unjustified and illegal targeting of returning civilians.' Abdelatty said that there were 'ongoing communications with the new US administration, the Israeli side and France to stress the importance of fully adhering to the ceasefire agreement, ensuring complete Israeli withdrawal, halting violations and preventing civilian targeting. This is Egypt’s steadfast position.' 'These security-level communications are ongoing to convey this message and our stance will not change,' he said. The minister also conveyed El-Sisi’s invitation for Aoun to visit Egypt 'as soon as possible' and said his government was 'looking forward to working on redeveloping and activating the frameworks of bilateral cooperation between Egypt and Lebanon, as well as convening the joint higher committee immediately after the formation of the government led by Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam.' 'We look forward to the speedy formation of the new government led by Salam, so Lebanon can fill the vacuum in its institutions,' he said. 'We support Salam’s efforts to form a Lebanese government that does not exclude anyone and reflects all sectarian and religious diversity in brotherly Lebanon. We look forward to the speedy completion of this matter, hoping that it will be a strong Lebanese government that represents everyone.' Aoun said: 'Lebanon holds on to Israel’s withdrawal from the areas it occupied during the last war within the deadline that was extended until Feb. 17' and 'rejects the delayed withdrawal under any pretext.' He also stressed 'the necessity to release the Lebanese hostages that were captured by Israel during its war against Lebanon.' Abdelatty told Salam he hoped for 'the formation of the government in the near future.' 'We trust that Lebanon will rise again and fully recover thanks to the presence of patriotic people like President Aoun and Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam,' he said. He added that the formation of a government was 'a Lebanese matter' and that 'no foreign parties should interfere in this.' After meeting Lebanon’s caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib, Jalalzadeh praised 'the special brotherly relations between Lebanon and Iran.' He said the purpose of his visit was to congratulate Aoun on his election victory and 'to congratulate the dear people of Lebanon and the courageous resistance for their remarkable steadfastness during Israel’s unjust war against Lebanon, which led to a ceasefire agreement.' Jalalzadeh said he and Bou Habib discussed the issue of 'Syrians, mostly Shiites, who were forced to flee to Lebanon following the developments in their country.' 'We called for cooperation to provide them with the best essential care,' he said. 'We hope that all international forums and organizations will provide them with the same essential and humane care as they did with former Syrian refugees.' Israel has been threatening to hit Beirut’s Rafic Hariri International Airport, claiming that Iran sends cash shipments to Hezbollah through the airport. In response to the threats, Jalalzadeh said: 'Lebanon is a free and independent state that makes its own decisions and decides what relations to establish with different countries of the world and with Iran. 'I affirm that Iranian nationals residing in Lebanese territory are subject to all the laws and customs adopted in Lebanon and therefore we condemn and reject these Israeli threats.' Lebanese media reported on Friday that Lebanese officials had been pressured by the US to prevent the appointment of figures from Hezbollah or its allies to the new government.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWds2l2UwNghLIskOxlkEWtA	2025-01-31T15:33:55-08:00	
The Hijrah Phenomenon: Shifting Urban Muslim Identities In Indone...	By Najwa Abdullah Public expressions of religious identity have been defining Indonesia’s urban landscape over the past decade. The ‘Hijrah’ phenomenon is central to this shift from a secular to a more religiously devout lifestyle. Driven by a youthful following and supported by influential public figures, Hijrah and its associated movements have evolved alongside Indonesia’s changing political landscape and governments, steadily gaining traction in cities like Jakarta, Bandung, and Surabaya since the late 1990s.[1] In many cases, embarking on Hijrah entails adopting more conservative Islamic teachings and integrating them into consumption habits, social interactions, and media practices. This process is often marked by changes in attire, behaviour, and attitudes toward the opposite gender. Such a shift is therefore not only spiritual but also cultural, as it redefines an individual’s identity and engagement with society. Over the past 15 years, the Hijrah trend has given rise to online communities with a significant following. Such communities actively promote the movement through social media posts, podcasts, kajian (study groups), and offline gatherings (see table below).

Considering its sustained popularity and ongoing public debate, it is contended that the Hijrah trend is likely to persist and even extend beyond the traditional urban centres. However, as further explained in the next sections, it will face growing challenges from within Muslim communities, including from within government and mainstream Islamic organisations such as Nahdlatul Ulama (NU). HIJRAH AS AN URBAN PHENOMENON The Arabic term hijrah,[8] meaning 'migration', etymologically refers to any form of migration. However, it holds special significance in the Islamic tradition,[9] as it marks the historic migration of Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in the 7th century.[10] It thus symbolises both a physical journey and a spiritual quest for conditions conducive to the growth of the Islamic faith.[11] Since the 2000s, the term has been revived in Indonesian popular discourse and appropriated by the Islamic revivalist movement to signify a newfound piety and religious identity. With emphasis on repentance, purification, and self-reform,[12] the Hijrah phenomenon can be viewed as a form of ‘born-again’ religiosity,[13] or in a local term, ‘santrinisasi’,[14] in which a Muslim individual undergoes a personal transformation of abandoning perceived sinful lifestyles and embracing a more devout path.[15] As such, the Hijrah movement saw the rise of Quran recitation groups, widespread adoption of Muslim clothing such as the hijab (veil), and a significant increase in interest in Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages.[16] In this context, a 2021 study by PPIM UIN Jakarta[17] suggests that the Hijrah movement was perceived positively by a large share of the online audience for its focus on self-improvement grounded in Islamic principles. At the same time, the Hijrah trend often reinforces conservative norms and values[18] and therefore can be seen as part of the overall rise of conservative Islam in post-Reform Indonesia. However, it lacks a clear and unified institutional foundation.[19] It is argued that Hijrah followers embody what Indonesian scholar Kuntowijoyo describes as ‘Muslims Without Mosques’.[20] Unlike traditional santri, who gain Islamic knowledge through long-established institutions like pesantren or madrasa, Hijrah followers derive their understanding from non-traditional sources such as popular books, magazines, radio, television, and the Internet. Primarily founded by public figures and self-taught preachers, they deliver Islamic dakwah (proselytisation) through novel methods, such as engaging hobby-based groups, utilising social media, collaborating with influencers, and offering services like youth counselling and matchmaking. They produce creative content like novels, songs, films, and fashion to present Islam as being compatible with consumer culture and urban lifestyles, addressing themes related to love, marriage, and career.[21] A case in point is the emergence of ‘cadari novels’, a genre of religiously oriented romance that prominently features face-veiling Muslim women in both its narratives and imagery.[22] Notably, the meteoric success of Ayat-Ayat Cinta in 2008, both as a novel with over 1 million copies sold[23] and as a film with 3.8 million viewers, brought widespread attention to this genre. Featuring a pious young Muslim man and a face-veiled Muslim woman as protagonists, the story portrays polygamy as a sanctioned Islamic practice and advocates for ta’aruf (Islam-compliant courtship). Another example is the proliferation of self-help books encouraging Muslim women to adopt the headscarf and practice ta’aruf as a means to self-reform and in order to distance themselves from sinful practices. This includes Yuk Berhijab! (Let’s Wear the Hijab!, 2013) and Udah, Putusin Aja! (Just Break-Up Already, 2015) by Felix Siauw, a self-taught preacher known for his pro-caliphate stance.[24] Beyond media engagement, offline networks and physical presence have been equally crucial to the success and sustainability of Hijrah’s community-building efforts.[25] With support from both the government[26] and commercial enterprises, Hijrah communities are claiming public spaces such as malls, city squares, and streets. In Bandung, for instance, they collaborated with the biker community to organise a convoy after tarawih prayers.[27] In Jakarta, the celebrity-led Hijrah group Kajian Musawarah launched HijrahFest in 2018. Held annually in exhibition halls—including the prestigious Jakarta Convention Centre and Balai Kartini—and featuring halal bazaars, sermons and talk shows, the event has established itself as a prominent platform for actors associated with Hijrah and their followers. Attended by prominent figures such as former Jakarta governor, Anies Baswedan, HijrahFest reportedly attracted 25,000 visitors from Jakarta and its surrounding suburbs, generating over 25 billion rupiahs in monetary circulation.[28] The success of HijrahFest captures the effervescence of urban Muslims for a blend of activities: exploring exhibitions, purchasing halal products, and attending religious talksdelivered by prominent preachers.[29] Since its launch, the festival has expanded beyond the capital, introducing regional editions and smaller-scale workshops in cities such as Bandung, Bandar Lampung, Pekanbaru, Padang, Medan, Palu, and Makassar. FROM BEING SUBCULTURE TO BEING MAINSTREAM The Hijrah trend represents the culmination of a protracted cultural negotiation, adaptation, and transformation process.[30] Many scholars have linked its emergence to the growing influence of Salafism—a purist form of Islam—in the region.[31] More importantly, however, its origins can also be traced back to the broader ethos of adopting an Islamic way of life, which gained momentum in Indonesia during the 1980s alongside the rise of global Islamic revivalism. This period witnessed the emergence of the Jemaah Tarbiyah (JT) movement, which laid the ideological and practical foundations for many of the values and practices later popularised under the Hijrah banner. Drawing inspiration from Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, JT championed the concept of 'Islam kaffah', which means a comprehensive application of Islamic principles in every facet of life. It directed its reformist efforts towards two primary goals: nurturing the spiritual development of existing Muslims and reshaping the formal political system to be based on Islamic principles.[32] Anchored in religious education and dakwah, the movement expanded primarily through small, structured study circles (halaqah or liqo), particularly within secular universities[33] and schools,[34] thus manifesting as Islam-oriented subcultural groups. After years of repression under the Suharto regime, the movement developed new strategies of Islamic preaching to expand its influence in the public sphere,[35] leveraging not only mainstream politics but also popular and online platforms.[36] Notably, the adoption of the movement’s ideas by Indonesia’s celebrity circles played a significant role in enabling them to transcend their subcultural confines and gradually permeate the broader social mainstream. To a great extent, this mainstreaming was enabled by musicians and actors who became actively involved in dakwah across the 2000s and 2010s, such as (late) Gitto Rollies, Sakti—ex-guitarist of the band Sheila on 7— (late) Jefri Al Buchori, Teuku Wisnu, and Arie Untung. It also includes their female counterparts who embraced the hijab such as Inneke Koesherawati, Shireen Sungkar, Dewi Sandra, and Laudya Chintya Bella. Using various platforms such as television shows, popular writing, and social media, these figures popularised the term ‘Hijrah’ to describe their newfound piety, thereby modelling a journey of religious transformation that resonates with broader young audiences and their desires for self-expression.[37] As an extension of Islamic revivalism, Hijrah followers largely draw on the literalist interpretations prevalent in both Salafism[38] and Islamism,[39] especially on matters regarding women, leadership, and perceptions of non-Muslims. These interpretations contribute to Hijrah’s conservative tendencies. For instance, the same study by PPIM UIN Jakarta found that certain factions within the Hijrah movement, such as the apolitical Salafists tend to support polygamy and restrict women’s mobility.[40] Broadly speaking, in the context of modern Indonesia, the practice of polygamy remains relatively uncommon and is largely negatively viewed.[41] Nonetheless, the recent upward trend in polygamous practices within certain circles—including the tarbiyah-linked Muslim elite circle[42]—has raised concerns among Indonesian Muslim women. Other groups such as Pemuda Hijrah, while more accommodating of modern lifestyle pursuits, encourage early marriage[43] through practices such as ta’aruf[44]and online campaigns such as #IndonesiaTanpaPacaran (Indonesia Without Dating).[45] Moreover, related events such as HijrahFest often invite controversial figures to perform, such as Abdul Somad, a provocative preacher known for making inflammatory remarks about Christianity,[46] and Felix Siauw, who has been linked to the now-banned Islamist organisation, Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI).[47] Despite the occasional involvement of certain preachers, Hijrah adherents do not necessarily oppose Pancasila or the Indonesian state, nor do they advocate for a caliphate. However, they tend to adopt a globally oriented perspective, often identifying with the concept of a global ummah (Muslim community).[48] As previously mentioned, their Islamic references are diverse, drawing from sources such as Salafi teachings that tend to promote a narrow interpretation of Islam, often characterised by anti-pluralist views that dichotomise the world into Muslim and non-Muslim.[49] The Hijrah movement is thus seen as deviating from the mainstream perspectives of NU and Muhammadiyah. Increasingly, figures within the Indonesian government are raising these concerns. For example, Kamaruddin Amin, Director General of Islamic Community Guidance at the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA), has stated that Hijrah’s brand of conservatism 'is not suitable for Islam in the Indonesian context'.[50] In response, MORA boosted its religious moderation campaign in 2019 to challenge the movement’s growing influence.[51] As discussed in the next section, certain initiatives such as the HijrahFest subsequently adjusted their strategies to re-align with the broader societal narratives while simultaneously reinforcing its underlying exclusive Islamic orientation. FROM LIFESTYLE TO INDUSTRY Hijrah proponents represent a relatively small yet steadily expanding segment of Indonesian society, with their influence gradually extending beyond lifestyle choices into industries. In a 2019 survey done of 2,192 Indonesians aged 20-35 years old across 28 provinces in Indonesia by an independent fact-tank IDN Research Institute, 72.8% of the respondents claimed that they were in the process of doing ‘Hijrah’. Notably, this shift was done by making changes in physical appearance, such as wearing the hijab or growing a beard (24%), and increasing consumption of religious content on social media (21%). As such, online Hijrah communities such as Yuk Ngaji, often develop alongside businesses like Umrah travel agencies and online hijab stores. A notable example is Felix Siauw, whose religious activism and popular writing are complemented by his establishment of HijabAlila, an online hijab shop that promotes syariah-compliant hijabs, characterised by their long and loose design. Recently, he assumed the role of a spiritual guide for Umrah and Hajjprogrammes, as well as other religious tourism packages[52] organised by Hijrah groups such as Terang Jakarta. Equally important is the steady growth of hijab advocacy groups and fashion communities, including Peduli Jilbab (Care about Headscarves), Ukhti Sally, and the Hijabers Community, which encourage their followers to not only do hijrah, but also engage in halal businesses.[53] To some extent, this growing trend is reflected in the economic data. For instance, Indonesia’s Umrah and Hajj ecosystem is anticipated to see substantial growth, with economic turnover projected to rise from Rp 65 trillion ($4 billion) in 2023 to Rp 194 trillion by 2030 — an almost threefold increase. This surge is driven not only by Indonesia’s expanding halal industry but also the Saudi government’s Vision 2030 reforms.[54] Furthermore, according to a 2022 report by the World Economic Forum, 91 trillion rupiahs (approximately US$6.07 billion) were spent annually on more than 1 billion units of hijab,[55] underscoring the widespread adoption of veiling by Indonesian Muslim women. Moreover, the Indonesian government increasingly capitalises on this development by pushing its further integration into the halal industry ecosystem. For example, the Halal Product Assurance Organising Agency (BPJPH) under Indonesia’s Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) aims to expand halal certification requirements to consumer goods, including clothing, by October 2026. Additionally, the government has established the Indonesia Global Halal Fashion (IGHF) initiative to position Indonesia as a dominant player in the global Islamic fashion market.[56] Furthermore, the Hijrah movement’s growing economic influence has not only facilitated its expansion beyond traditional urban centres into more provinces but also led to increasingly fluid and ambivalent narratives. HijrahFest, bolstered by support from local authorities, strategically brands itself around 'pemberdayaan ekonomi masyarakat' (community economic empowerment).[57] This framing broadens participation and aligns the festival with government initiatives aimed at promoting community welfare. At the same time, the use of terms like ‘Hijrahpreneur’[58] highlights the movement’s distinctively religious orientation. This duality suggests an attempt to integrate into mainstream development narratives while preserving the exclusive Hijrah-oriented worldview. BACKLASH AND COUNTER-NARRATIVES The rise of new ustad and preachers in celebrity circles or secular backgrounds has further fuelled debates over the continuity of traditionalist religious authority in Indonesia.[59] In some cases, this contestation has led to tensions within the Muslim community, with events featuring Hijrah ustad occasionally facing a backlash.[60] This contention is particularly pronounced in the cancellation of the 2022 HijrahFest in Surabaya, East Java—a stronghold of NU—following criticism from NU and the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) on the improper use of their logos for commercial purposes. This controversy was further fuelled by concerns over the ideological leanings of some groups associated with HijrahFest, which were perceived as undermining the principles of NKRI (the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia) and Pancasila.[61] In this context, Hanan Attaki, a prominent Hijrah preacher who founded Pemuda Hijrah, was banned by the MUI East Java branch from delivering sermons in certain areas. His ‘gaul’ (trendy) preaching style and alleged ties to HTI were seen to be incompatible with the pesantren culture and to be a potential disruption to its order.[62] Interestingly, Attaki later sought to rebuild his ties with NU, leading to his pledge of allegiance to the organisation in 2023. This move caused a stir among Muslim netizens. Some particularly criticised NU for exhibiting 'ashabiyah' or 'ta’ashshub', terms that describe a tribalistic or overly factional mindset.[63] Though it is too early to assess the full implications of Attaki’s ideological shift, this development highlights the increasing complexity of religious allegiances and the potential for further shifts in ideological orientations within Indonesian Islam. Furthermore, resistance to Hijrah narratives arises not only from established institutions but also through grassroots and individual initiatives. Notable examples are online-based literary movements like Gerakan Islam Cinta (Love Islam Movement) and Relax It’s Just Religion!, as well as Islamic news portals such as the pesantren-based mubadalah.id and Islami.co. advocating for more inclusive interpretations of Islam. While their social media followings remain comparatively modest, typically under 50,000, their institutional backing — such as support from media companies like Mizan for Gerakan Islam Cinta and alliances with activist and artistic circles for Relax It’s Just Religion! — help sustain these movements and extend their reach to a wider audience over time. A new generation of religious influencers and activists has also emerged to champion tolerance and egalitarianism within the faith. This includes Habib Hussein Ja’far, a traditionalist preacher who has amassed 6 million followers on Instagram, who is known for his moderate views and for spreading his Islamic messages through comedy.[64] Another example is Kalis Mardiasih, an NU activist known for her criticism of conservative positions on issues concerning women through her books Muslimah yang Diperdebatkan (Muslim Women Who Are Debated, 2019) and Hijrah Jangan Jauh-Jauh, Nanti Nyasar! (Don’t Hijrah Too Far, You’ll Get Lost!, 2019), which have been reprinted multiple times.[65] Her writings critically highlight the paradox of conservative Islam’s embrace of modern trends, which, despite appearing accommodating and fashionable, often impose restrictive norms on women. To this extent, she argues that contemporary dakwah content often distorts the lived experiences of Muslim women by glorifying domestic roles, promoting early marriage, and reinforcing their subordinate position relative to men.[66] The slow yet growing popularity of these counter-narratives signals a potential shift that could challenge conservative dominance in the near future: they could transcend organisational boundaries to resonate with broader segments of Indonesian society and achieve long-term societal impact. CONCLUSION The Hijrah phenomenon represents a new phase in the broader conflict between socially liberal and conservative camps, as well as between traditionalist and reformist Muslim groups. The movement’s current success is largely due to its ability to adapt to urban environments, leverage digital platforms, and align with market forces. However, its continued expansion is likely to face more challenges, including resistance from established religious authorities and emerging counter-narratives within the Muslim community. These dynamics not only point to an evolving and contested future for conservative Islam but also underscore deepening factionalism and ideological contestation. More importantly, this also highlights the urgent need to foster cohesive urban identities in Indonesia in ways that can mitigate these tensions.

Putting Humpty Dumpty Together In Syria – Analysis	In Syria, putting Humpty Dumpty together again is no mean task. Israel’s demolition of the ill-equipped Syrian military and the recent occupation of additional Syrian territory beyond the Golan Heights it conquered in the 1967 Middle East war is just one obstacle. So is a daunting list of challenges that, if unresolved, threaten the new Syrian rulers’ ability to rebuild an economy ravaged by 14 years of civil war and, potentially, the country’s territorial integrity. The challenges include Turkey’s military presence in northern Syria, fighting between a pro-Turkish militia and Syrian Kurds, differences over whether Syria should be a centralized state or a federation, the failure of many of former Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s conscripts to turn in their weapons and concerns about the place of religious minorities in the future Syria. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the rebel group that led the toppling of Assad’s regime, insists it will build an inclusive Syria. It has sought to prevent retaliation against former Assad government officials and promised judicial due process in holding those accused of war crimes accountable. Tensions flare over Assad’s arms The challenges are evident on the streets of Homs, Latakia and Tartous. Here, law enforcement, primarily populated by units of HTS, hunt for former regime officials. They seek to prevent the emergence of an armed resistance, possibly backed by Iran, and collect arms of former conscripts. Only an estimated 50,000 former personnel of Assad’s 150,000-strong, primarily Alawite military, have reportedly turned in their weapons. There were no reports of serious clashes in HTS’s security sweep. Many Alawites, adherents of a Shiite Muslim sect to which Assad belongs, were happy to see an end to the former president’s rule. However, they are uncertain about their place in the new Syria. The raids have fueled anxiety. The challenges are also evident in suspicions of the new government’s vision of a four-year transitory run-up to elections and the drafting of a new constitution in which HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, would remain Syria’s leader. Sharaa justified the four years, saying the civil war’s displacement of 13 million people, half of which fled Syria, made it necessary to conduct a census in advance of elections. Many in Syria want to see elections in the next two years. Sharaa said a transition government will replace the post-Assad HTS caretaker government this March. The representation of minorities in this impending government will serve as a litmus test of Sharaa’s intentions. Differing visions of the transition and Syria’s future have complicated HTS’s plans to hold a national dialogue this month, where all segments of society would chart the country’s transition and future course. Sharaa sparked opposition by seemingly insisting leaders of political and rebel groups could participate as individuals, not as representatives of their organizations. Similarly, Hadi al-Bahra, the head of an Istanbul-based opposition alliance internationally recognized during the civil war but now rendered obsolete by Assad’s downfall, said the grouping had not been invited to the dialogue. Ethnic and sectarian divisions The different visions of Syria’s future also color the new rulers’ effort to reconstitute the military from myriad rebel groups that agreed last month to lay down their arms and become part of a force capable of ensuring domestic security. The rebels would be joined by some Assad-era conscripts. Like Syrian Kurds, Hekmat al-Hijri, the spiritual leader of the Druze — a sect considered heretics by mainstream Islam — vowed that the group would not surrender its arms until Syria’s future was decided and a constitution had been drafted that guaranteed Druze rights. In apparent support for a federated Syria where minorities would enjoy some autonomy, Hijri said a 'decentralised system is most appropriate for Syria.' Even so, he recently met with the Kurdish National Council, a one-time popular Syrian Kurdish group that has lost ground to the Democratic Union Party (PYD). Turkey accuses the party and the associated United States-backed Kurdish militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), of being extensions of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK). This party has waged a four-decade-long low-intensity war in southeastern Turkey for Kurdish rights. They were also the US military’s shock troops in the fight against the Islamic State. Turkey rejects Syrian Kurdish demands for autonomy. Unconfirmed media reports suggest Turkey and Syria were discussing defense arrangements that would include Turkey operating two military basesin Syria. Sharaa, seemingly concerned that external powers would use a federated Syria as a geopolitical playground by playing one group against another, has insisted on a centralized state. In early January, the Syrian leader met with the SDF for the first time. Unlike the Syrian National Army (SNA) — a misnomer for the Turkish-supported militia with which the Kurds are locked into battle — the SDF was not included in the rebel disarmament talks. It is reluctant to join the other rebel groups without an agreement on the status of Syrian Kurds and guarantees, if the group agrees to disarm and integrate into the Syrian military, that SNA elements will not harass their troops. The SNA is expected to be influential alongside HTS in the reconstituted Syrian military. On a visit to Damascus on Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot insisted that 'a political solution must be reached with France’s allies, the Kurds, so that they are fully integrated into this political process that is beginning today.' Barrot, together with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, advised Sharaa that diplomatic recognition of Syria’s new government depended on three main points: a resolution of the Kurdish issue, the destruction of the Assad regime’s chemical weapons stockpiles and a clear pathway towards an inclusive political transition to democracy. In negotiations with HTS, the SDF may well take its cue from developments in Turkey. Two Turkish lawmakers said imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan had indicated that he may call on the group to lay down its arms. The pro-Kurdish lawmakers were allowed to visit him for the first time in almost a decade; Öcalan has been in prison since 1999. HTS’s controversial changes to Syrian education If there is one thing that Kurds, Druze and Alawites share, it’s a deep-seated distrust of Sunni Muslim militancy, including HTS. Burdened with a jihadist history that it has sought to shed over the past decade, HTS sparked outrage this week with the introduction of changes to primary and secondary school curricula. Critics charged the changes Islamicized the curricula. Many of the education ministry’s changes removed references to Assad’s regime, including photographs and references to the military and national anthem. However, the materials removed also included the word 'deities,' references to pre-Islamic deities and Zeinobia, a pre-Islamic queen of ancient Palmyra. In a bow to Islamic history and Turkey, a long-time supporter of HTS, the changes rolled back criticism of the Ottoman Empire. The ministry also deleted chapters about the origin and evolution of life, the evolution of the human brain and Chinese philosophy. Insisting that the old school books would remain until a committee could audit them, Education Minister Nazir al-Qadr conceded that 'incorrect' interpretations of Quranic verses were removed. That did little to convince critics that the textbook changes were not pointers in the direction of where HTS was taking Syria.

Navigating The Complexities Of Urban Density In Global Cities – A...	By Ramanath Jha Urban density can be defined as the ratio of the total population of a city and the total footprint the city occupies. On a global scale, there are wide variations in urban density. The World Population Review 2024 puts Manila at the top of the chart with 74,750 persons per km2. While Asian cities are some of the densest, cities of the Western world are comparatively less dense. New York City, the densest in the United States (US), has 16,844 persons per km2, London has 9,904 persons per km2, and Berlin has 3,809 persons per km2, reflecting the huge asymmetry in urban densities worldwide. Over time, cities in the Western world have altered their policies about urban density. In the United States, the 20th century witnessed massive urban population growth and enhanced densities. Within three decades (1900-1930), Detroit saw a four-fold demographic multiplication, and New York doubled its population size. However, with the onset of the 21st century, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco took an anti-density stand. They decided to curtail the growth of their populations through tight zoning regulations. No such policy has been scripted in India despite urban densities that are much higher in its cities. Western economists, social scientists, and urban planners have been robust advocates of urban density. The standout benefit, decidedly, is that urban density fosters economic growth. By bringing lots of people in close proximity, a very large number of productive activities are triggered, leading to higher economic productivity. Moreover, urban density helps generate innovation. This is substantially aided by the congregation of a highly diverse set of creative knowledge workers. This 'urban creative density' catalyses innovative processes. Spatial demographic concentration in cities results in a more efficient utilisation of space. This prevents the conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural uses, thereby reducing the negative impact on food productivity and natural vegetation. In the US, zoning regulations aim to minimise urban expansion into agricultural lands. In India, planners use zoning for the same purpose. The objective is clear: stop urban sprawl. Urban density also supports public transportation. Low-density developments, on the other hand, have the proclivity to promote auto dependency and discourage pedestrian trips, biking, and public transit. In this context, 'Transit-Oriented Development' (TOD) has become a great tool for compact city growth. It promotes the kind of urban development where housing, businesses and amenities are concentrated at walking distance from public transit, designed to bring commuters, services and activities together. There is no denying the fact that cities are the prime generators of economic growth and national wealth. However, density is not without its downsides. High urban density results in overcrowding. Evidence suggests that there are undesirable psychological, social and biological impacts due to crowding. These ill effects are coupled with a lack of privacy, depression and psychological frustrations. In a study carried out in a hyper-dense Mumbai slum, there was evidence that slum dwellers suffered from a high risk of mental disorders on account of overcrowding. High urban density makes cities more vulnerable to pandemics. COVID-19 hit the largest cities the worst. In April 2020, in the US, non-metropolitan areas had a rate of 0.43 deaths per 100,000 population; small metros were slightly higher at 0.72 deaths; mid-sized metros stood at 0.85 and large metros at 0.94 deaths. The situation was no different in India. In April 2020, India’s ten largest cities had over half the coronavirus cases in the country. Mumbai and Delhi had 30 percent of all cases. Increases in urban density tend to push up land values. Housing, therefore, gets costlier and out of reach for the lower-middle-class and the urban poor. The American Community Survey (ACS) for 2019 busted the argument that the densification of urban areas would result in better housing affordability. It establishedthat higher urban densities are associated with worsening housing affordability. In India, this was exemplified by the Delhi Master Plan 2041 which estimated that 85 percent of residents cannot afford regular shelter. High-density cities are most likely to face heavy traffic congestion. In Tom Tom’s latest Traffic Index ranking 2023, London, New York, Paris, Tokyo, Berlin, Mexico City, Rome, Jakarta, Istanbul and Barcelona, all figure among the top 100 cities facing traffic congestion. So do India’s largest cities—Bengaluru, Pune, Delhi and Mumbai. Besides being a drag on the city economy because of time lost in commuting, automobiles generate pollution and cause human stress to individual commuters while driving. One of the sad consequences of heavy urban density is a reduction of public open spaces. Government of India guidelines stipulate 10 to 12 m2 of open space per person. However, growing density in cities leads to regulatory amendments that eat into open spaces. For instance, in Mumbai, public open spaces have fallen below the stipulated standard and reached levels as low as 1.24 m2 per person. Climate change has catapulted itself into a major challenge in the context of urban density. Cities are witnessing urban floods, cyclones, harsh winters and oppressive heat waves with increasing frequency and intensity. Apart from the loss of human lives, these events take a heavy toll on municipal infrastructure and livelihoods. Sadly, the consequences on the urban poor are devastating. The most worrying part is that, as cities densify further, mitigation and adaptation become more difficult. Disasters by their very nature require space to manoeuvre and relocate services and people. However, the denser the city gets, the more it builds and the less it leaves space to handle disasters. Urban density is associated with higher crime rates. The top 19 metropolitan cities, holding 8.12 percent of the national population, have 14.65 percent of cognisable crimes. This seems to corroborate the widely acknowledged finding that crime rates are much greater in larger cities than in smaller towns and villages. This appears to be internationally true. The 1994 Statistical Abstract in the US found that metropolitan cities had 79 percent more crime than other American cities. Further, New York and Los Angeles, the largest US cities, had crime rates that were approximately four times higher than other metropolitan areas. This scenario highlights that, though several benefits flow out of urban density, excessive urban density begins to amplify its negatives. The Western emphasis on urban density is in a different context. Western cities today are losing population on account of low fertility rates along with an economic downturn. Unlike their Western counterparts, the big cities in India face rising economies and swelling populations. While the virtues of urban density are undeniable, we need to ask how much density starts becoming counterproductive. The latest data regarding Indian cities seem to suggest that, when liveability falls drastically in cities, it begins impacting the economy as well. While India’s largest cities contribute a disproportionately large share of the total urban gross domestic product (GDP), undeniably fuelled by high density, their demographic densities are rising unsustainably, generating problems for the economy, environment, equity and climate resilience. The ill effects of excessive urban density are undeniable. When resources are over-concentrated in very few locations, road congestion, living costs and costs of production rise to excessive levels, deteriorating the quality of urban services. Against this backdrop, a plan for investment into other potential cities and towns should be drawn up at the national and state level. Investments should then flow into those towns to enable them to create employment. The idea is to disincentivise further densification of highly dense cities and pull migrating populations towards other eligible cities. It is quite clear that the cited methodology would only be possible if governments and planners concentrated on the creation of economies and infrastructure in other potentially viable cities. Decentralised urbanisation holds the key to sustainable urbanisation. In its absence, a handful of megacities in this country are all set to get denser, falter in their quality of living, and become more unsustainable.

Ukraine Military Situation Update: North Korean Military Involvem...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Assessing North Korea’s Role in the Russia-Ukraine Conflict More details are emerging as North Korea continues its direct involvement in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. One interesting aspect is North Korean forces’ rules of engagement. Open-source indicators reveal that Pyongyang has ordered its fighters to avoid being taken as prisoners of war at all costs. In many cases, North Korean troops have blown themselves up to avoid being captured alive. This strict discipline explains the limited number of North Korean troops who have been taken prisoner—and the high number of North Korean casualties, which according to Ukrainian officials is near 4,000, enough to fill a brigade. Tactical engagement visuals from the battlefield suggest that while the Korean People’s Army often makes mistakes while fighting under frequent drone strikes, its unit cohesion has been solid: Pyongyang’s troops have maintained their composure when exposed to Ukraine’s heaviest blows. Ukrainian troops who have engaged North Korean forces have said that Pyongyang’s fighters are far more disciplined than most of their Russian counterparts. The Ukrainian Special Forces Command’s X account recently posted the diary of an elite North Korean fighter who was killed in action in the Russian region of Kursk. His writings reveal a brainwashed commitment to the Workers’ Party of North Korea and to leader Kim Jong Un, highlighting the strict indoctrination Pyongyang’s military enforces. Ukrainian personnel also praise North Korean troops’ marksmanship. Visuals of captured North Korean equipment suggest that the Kremlin has provided better infantry kits to Pyongyang’s fighters than it has given its own Russian servicemen. Nonetheless, uploads from the battlefield suggest that Ukraine’s first-person-view (FPV) drones have caught North Korean forces off guard, leading to mounting casualties at the hands of Ukrainian drone operators. South Korean intelligence services have concluded that Pyongyang’s next move will likely involve sending loitering munitions to augment its light infantry, though it is unknown which systems. In recent years, North Korea has developed a loitering munitions baseline that resembles the Iran Shahed kamikaze drones that hit Ukraine nearly every day. Pyongyang is also seeking to replicate the Russian Lancet drone warfare system. General Kyrylo Budanov, the chief of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, has assessed that Pyongyang will likely combat-deploy artillery and rocket troops to Kursk. Thus far North Korea has transferredKN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, 170mm-class Koksan heavy artillery, and 240mm-class multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) to the Russian military. Previous editions of this report have presented open-source intelligence findings regarding these systems and concluded that North Korea would send fire-support troops to reinforce its current contingent in Kursk. United States Defense Intelligence Agency assessments have emphasized North Korea’s tube artillery and rocket systems capabilities. Massed artillery and rocket salvos remain central to North Korea’s battle plan for a war on the Korean Peninsula. Open-source intelligence recently detected North Korean civilian trucks equipped with concealed 122mm-class rockets inside Russia. These platforms could menace Ukrainian defenses in urban and semi-urban battlefields. In a war driven by artillery, Pyongyang’s fire-support troops could pose serious risks to the Ukrainian military, which is already fighting North Korea’s elite light infantry units. This report will continue to assess North Korea’s military role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, especially in Kursk. 2. Battlefield Assessment The tactical situation shifted in the Kremlin’s favor over the past week. Russia made gains in Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, Kurakhove, and Velyka Novosilka. Despite conflicting reports from the area, it is clear that the Russian military has fought hard in Velyka Novosilka and has captured multiple positions along Ukraine’s defensive lines. The fight for the town is ongoing, but it is likely that Russia will soon capture it. In Pokrovsk, the Russian military has maintained an offensive footing, with few signs emerging that the campaign there is anywhere near drawing to a close. In this theater, Russia is ramping up its use of fiber-optic-cable-connected FPV drones against Ukrainian heavy armor. These drones are resilient against electronic warfare (EW), and Ukrainian FPV operators are attempting to engage and kinetically intercept them. Fighting continued in Kursk with high material losses and casualties. In Kharkiv, the Russian military has been attempting to make the most of its bridgeheads along the Oskil River. Nonetheless, no meaningful changes have occurred in the battlefield geometry in this area. Ukraine also continued to launch long-range salvos deep into Russian territory. A drone storage facility in Oryol and the Ryazan oil refinery are among Ukraine’s most recent high-value targets. The Ukrainian Intelligence Service (SBU) also ran counterespionage operations against subversive Russian networks operating in Ukraine. Recently, SBU agents detained a group reported to belong to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) for spying on Ukraine’s F-16 combat aircraft.

Malaysia Cautiously Treads The Path To Fiscal Recovery – Analysis	By Shankaran Nambiar Having assumed office in November 2022, it was time in 2024 for Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to get the building blocks in place to restart his country’s economy. On Anwar’s plate were serious problems, chiefly the uncomfortably narrow fiscal space that had been created by operational expenditures rising close to the level of government revenues. Other important issues were reducing Malaysia’s reliance on migrant workers and increasing productivity. There was little that could be done to bring operational expenditures down given the legally-mandated salary and pension payments for Malaysia’s large civil service. The solution was to either increase government revenue or cut expenditure. In the end, the government did both. Anwar was firm in his resolve not to bring back the goods and services tax (GST) that was introduced by former prime minister Najib Razak in 2015. Though Anwar conceded that the GST is the most efficient taxation system, he complained that it is regressive and vowed not to bring it back until the income threshold reached a minimum of RM3,000–4,000 (US$670–894) per month — a target that is unlikely to be achieved in the near future. The difficult journey of expanding fiscal space began with subsidy rationalisation. In October 2024, the government passed the Public Finance and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which aimed to improve fiscal policy management and the sustainability of public finances. In June 2024, the government removed diesel subsidies, which increased the price of diesel from RM2.15 (US$0.48) to RM3.35 (US$0.75) and reduced the subsidy bill which had ballooned to RM14.3 billion (US$3.2 billion) in 2023 from RM1.4 billion (US$312.8 million) in 2019. The removal of subsidies also effectively put a stop to diesel smuggling. Realising that the act of removing subsidies is also a political exercise, the government decided to delay the removal of the petrol subsidy to mid-2025. Together, these removals are expected to save the government close to RM8 billion (US$1.8 billion). But with inflationary pressures throughout the year, the government was caught between acceding to market forces and capitulating to cost-of-living pressures. For example, seeing a rise in the price of chicken, the government decided to ban chicken exports in June until outcries from the farming lobby led to a reversal in October. The fact that the Malaysian ringgit was relatively weak against the US dollar — hovering mostly between RM4.79 to RM4.71 — made imports more expensive in the first half of 2024, adding to inflationary pressures. It is uncertain if the strengthening of the ringgit in mid-July can be attributed to any structural changes in the economy but three factors point to the decision’s effectiveness. First, the country’s export figures picked up from May. Second, the central bank persuaded government-linked companies to repatriate their foreign earnings, increasing purchases of the ringgit. Third, the reduction in the US Federal Reserve’s interest rates made the ringgit relatively more attractive. By the end of September 2024, the ringgit had reached a peak of RM4.10 to the dollar, before declining moderately. Some of the uncertainties that existed in 2024 are likely to persist in 2025. The subsidy rationalisation program will continue, with the petrol subsidy to be amended so that it becomes a targeted subsidy for disadvantaged groups. But it is not yet clear how the subsidy will be designed or executed. February 2025 will also see the raising of the minimum wage to RM1,700 per month (US$380) from the prevailing RM1,500 (US$335). This will add to costs for small- and medium-sized enterprises and sectors dependent on unskilled workers. The increase may nudge these sectors into capital investments and a reduced reliance on unskilled workers, particularly migrant labour. In his budget 2025 speech, Prime Minister Anwar said that a mandatory contribution to the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) will need to be made for foreign workers. Along with a higher minimum wage, requiring EPF contributions for foreign workers may spark inflationary pressures. Combined with the withdrawal of subsidies, Malaysians may be forced to cope with a higher cost of living. The Prime Minister travelled extensively in 2024, signing MOUs to draw in investment. Anwar believes developing countries like Malaysia must maintain their economic independence and has deepened links with established partners and others such as Russia and China. But there are uncertainties in the global environment, particularly how the Trump administration will affect Malaysia. It is yet to be seen whether Trump’s threat of tariffs will have any direct consequence for Malaysia in 2025. The future of US–China tensions could benefit Malaysia as a third party, but the Trump administration could also choose to fix loopholes that would otherwise allow Chinese companies to seek refuge in Malaysia. While the government could have been bolder in its attempts to raise government revenue to consolidate the country’s fiscal situation in 2024, it did initiate a much-needed subsidy rationalisation program which will continue through 2025. But the increase in minimum wage, the mandatory contribution to the EPF for foreign workers and the withdrawal of fuel subsidies will add to inflationary pressures in 2025. The global outlook, particularly a less than spectacular performance from China coupled with trade uncertainties, looks set to produce a growth figure that falls within the lower end of the government’s forecast of 4.5–5.5 per cent for 2025.

Women And Children Are At Heart Of Sudan’s Suffering – Analysis	Since April 2023, Sudan has been engulfed by a devastating conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces militia, leading to a profound humanitarian crisis. The violence has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and has displaced more than 8 million people internally. The situation is particularly dire for women and children, who constitute the most vulnerable segments of the population. In conflict zones, women and children often bear the brunt of the violence and instability. In Sudan, this vulnerability is being exacerbated by existing gender inequalities and socioeconomic challenges. The ongoing conflict has stripped women and girls of essential resources needed for survival, including food, medical support, protection and shelter. The atrocities committed against women and children in Sudan are manifold, reflecting the immense human cost of the ongoing conflict. Gender-based violence has surged alarmingly, with reports indicating a twofold increase since the onset of the crisis. Women and girls are being subjected to horrifying levels of sexual exploitation. The lack of accountability and protection has further emboldened perpetrators, leaving countless women and girls vulnerable to abuse. Sudan is also witnessing the world’s largest child displacement crisis. More than 4.6 million children have been forced to flee their homes since April 2023, a staggering number that underscores the scale of the humanitarian disaster. These displaced children are enduring unimaginable hardships, including malnutrition, disease and the constant threat of exploitation. The absence of stable living conditions and adequate care exacerbates their suffering, creating a generation scarred by trauma. The conflict has also disrupted education, with devastating consequences for the future of Sudan’s youth. More than 2.5 million girls are currently unable to return to school, a setback that hampers not only their personal growth but also the broader development of the nation. The loss of education deprives these girls of opportunities for empowerment and economic independence, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality. This educational crisis poses long-term challenges for Sudan, as an entire generation grows up without the skills and knowledge needed to rebuild their communities and contribute to the country’s recovery Several factors contribute to the heightened vulnerability of women and children in Sudan. Socioeconomic disparities have long plagued the country, with women and children facing significant challenges even before the war. Limited access to education, healthcare and economic opportunities meant that many were already struggling to meet their basic needs. The conflict has only deepened these disparities, leaving women and children with minimal means of support and making them more susceptible to exploitation and harm. Targeted violence is another alarming factor. Women and children have been deliberately targeted in attacks, with reports highlighting instances of systematic violence against them. This violence often intersects with ethnic and regional tensions, further amplifying the risks they face. The breakdown of social structures has also left women and children particularly vulnerable. The war has led to the collapse of community and family networks that traditionally provided protection and support. With these safety nets destroyed, women and children are more exposed to violence, exploitation and other forms of abuse as they navigate an increasingly hostile and chaotic environment The international community has a moral and ethical obligation to intervene in Sudan's crisis. The widespread atrocities, especially those targeting vulnerable populations, demand a coordinated global response. Without action, the situation is likely to deteriorate further, leading to more loss of life and prolonged suffering. International aid organizations and donors also play a crucial role in alleviating the suffering in Sudan. However, the current humanitarian response is critically underfunded. Increased financial support is essential to provide food, medical care, shelter and protective services to those in need. Moreover, ensuring that aid reaches the most vulnerable populations, including women and children, should be a priority. To effectively address the crisis in Sudan, the international community must take decisive action across several pathways. Facilitating peace negotiations is a critical step. Encouraging dialogue can also help lay the groundwork for a sustainable resolution. The Jeddah Declaration of Commitment to Protect the Civilians of Sudan, signed in May 2023, offers a viable framework for these efforts. This declaration prioritizes the protection of civilians and the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance, underscoring the importance of international support in implementing its provisions. Collaboration with the African Union is equally vital. This bloc has been instrumental in seeking solutions to the Sudanese conflict and offers a culturally informed perspective on peace-building. By working closely with the African Union, the international community can ensure a unified approach to addressing the crisis. The union’s Roadmap for the Resolution of the Conflict in Sudan provides a strategic guide for these collaborative efforts, emphasizing the importance of regional expertise in fostering long-term peace. Enhancing humanitarian access is another urgent priority. Humanitarian agencies must have safe and unhindered access to affected populations to deliver aid effectively. This requires negotiating ceasefires or establishing humanitarian corridors to ensure the timely and secure delivery of essential supplies and services to those in need. If the conflict in Sudan persists, the consequences will be devastating. Generational trauma is a significant concern, as children growing up amid violence face long-term psychological scars. This trauma not only hinders their development but also risks perpetuating cycles of violence, creating a legacy of suffering for future generations. In a nutshell, the plight of women and children in Sudan’s ongoing conflict is a humanitarian tragedy that demands immediate international attention. Protecting these vulnerable groups should be a global priority. Through increased aid, diplomatic efforts to end the conflict and collaboration with regional bodies like the African Union, the international community can help alleviate suffering and pave the way for a peaceful future for Sudan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEOSM1cUzeEsby	2025-01-30T16:36:37-08:00	
Trump Signals US Government’s Return To Respecting ‘Freedom To Ch...	The choices Americans make about the products they use in their homes can seem trivial in comparison to matters like violent crime, diseases, and war. Yet, these choices are in fact very important. Consider the days of the Cold War when Americans were thankful that they could make many choices in this regard while the average person in the Soviet Union was limited to inferior conditions, scarcity, and limited choices. Indeed, in the waning days of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin, who would become the leader of the Russia government after the Soviet Union breakup, marveled at the wide selection of items available for sale at a grocery store in Clear Lake, Texas near Johnson Space Center, which he had visited. The choices Americans had clearly provided them with an advantage. 'Even the Politburo doesn’t have this choice. Not even Mr. Gorbachev,' remarked Yeltsin. Then — in 1989 — Mikhail Gorbachev was the leader of the Soviet Union government. Yeltsin further commented at the time that 'there would be a revolution' if people in the Soviet Union saw such supermarkets. An April of 2014 Houston Chronicle article by Craig Hlavaty about Yeltsin’s grocery store visit also relates what Yeltsin later wrote in his autobiography: ‘When I saw those shelves crammed with hundreds, thousands of cans, cartons and goods of every possible sort, for the first time I felt quite frankly sick with despair for the Soviet people,’ Yeltsin wrote. ‘That such a potentially super-rich country as ours has been brought to a state of such poverty! It is terrible to think of it.’ Unfortunately, choice in regard to the products used in American homes has over the last few decades been progressively limited by actions of the United States government. (I provided a brief introduction to this development in my January of 2023 article 'The US Government Versus Home Sweet Home.') The US government has become increasingly the enemy of household choice, taking after the Soviet government of old. One promising sign of the presidency of Donald Trump that began this week is an express desire to roll back much of the restrictions on these choices that have been imposed on Americans in the last few decades. This desire is clearly expressed in one of the executive orders Trump signed on Monday — his first day in office. Included in Trump’s January 20 executive order titled 'Unleashing American Energy' is this declaration in its subsection f of section 2: 'It is the policy of the United States … to safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries.' Notably, businesses as well as homes should benefit from this government policy favorable to such freedom to choose. Further aid for eliminating restrictions on choices at home can be expected to arise from the executive order in section four revoking and revising a slew of previous executive actions and regulations, many of which purported to counter 'climate change.' Here’s to Trump eliminating government restrictions on what products Americans may choose to use in their own homes. Let’s make home great again.

What’s UNDOF? Why UN Peacekeepers Patrol The Israel-Syria Border ...	By Eileen Travers More than 1,100 UN peacekeepers are currently deployed in the Golan, a demilitarised zone along the Israel-Syria border at what is a tense and dangerous time in the history of the region. But why are the Blue Helmets there? One of the UN’s longest-standing peacekeeping missions—the UN Disengagement Observer Force, known by its acronym UNDOF—began more than a half century ago when the 1973 Middle East crisis erupted. The Agreement on Disengagement between Israeli and Syrian forces was concluded which provided for an area of separation and for two equal zones of limited forces and armaments on both sides of the area. UNDOF was established to supervise its implementation. Here’s what you need to know: Forging peace to end a crisis On the heels of the Israeli-Egyptian war in 1973, the situation in the Israel-Syria sector became increasingly unstable in March 1974 as clashes intensified. UNDOF was established in late May 1974 and by 3 June, the Secretary-General had appointed an interim commander of UNDOF who arrived in Damascus, Syria’s capital, that very day. The mission operates with the same mandate today. What does UNDOF do? UNDOF’s mandate remains largely unchanged since 1974: Maintaining the ceasefire between Israel and Syria Supervising the disengagement of Israeli and Syrian forces Supervising the areas of separation and limitation, as provided in the May 1974 Agreement on Disengagement. Every six months, the Security Council reviews and has extended the force’s mandate, which is due to expireon 30 June 2025. UNDOF has two base camps. Its headquarters at Camp Faouar handles logistics and the force operates patrols by day and night, intervening whenever any military personnel enter or try to operate in the area of separation. The force also addresses mine and explosive remnant of war clearance and has instituted a security and maintenance programme in the area of separation to identify and mark all minefields. UNDOF is one of three UN peacekeeping missions in the region, charged with monitoring ceasefires and peace agreements. The other two are the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), established in 1948, and the UN Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which has been operational since 1978. What’s the area of separation? The area of separation is a demilitarised zone and measures approximately 80 km long, varying in width from 10 km in the centre to less than one km in the extreme south, with hilly terrain dominated in the north by Mount Hermon. The highest permanently staffed UN position, it sits at an altitude of 2,814 metres, where it often snows and peacekeepers conduct patrols thanks to specialised winter season equipment. The area is inhabited and has historically been policed by the Syrian authorities. No military forces other than UNDOF are permitted to operate inside of this area. There is also an area of limitation on both sides, where limits are placed on the number and types of military forces and equipment allowed by the parties. UNDOF monitors these restrictions through fortnightly inspections of the military positions of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Syrian security forces carried out by the Observer Group Golan, comprised of military observers from UNTSO. Main challenges in the current Middle East crisis Over the years, UNDOF has recorded ceasefire violations and worked with Israeli and Syrian authorities to resolve them. As tensions rose last year during the war in Gaza, a missile killed 12 people in the Golan and recent heightened tensions in the area of separation emerged with Israel Defense Forces (IDF) moving into the area as Syria’s new de facto authorities seized power in early December. UNDOF peacekeepers, supported by UNTSO observers, remain at their pre-December 2024 positions and continue key tasks such as monitoring and patrolling the ceasefire line, according to UNDOF interim head Major General Patrick Gauchat, who briefed the Security Council in mid-January. Residents of the Golan have also expressed concerns to UNDOF, calling for the IDF to leave their villages amid reports of searches and arrests of their relatives. The IDF’s presence and roadblocks have also severely impacted UNDOF’s operational capacity, reducing its daily vehicle convoys and compromising its freedom of movement. Adapting to new realities In the face of these current operational challenges, the mission has adapted its approach. Right now, it has increased weekly patrols from 10 to 40 and addressed such urgent safety concerns as the neutralisation of unexploded ordnance in public areas. Meanwhile, efforts are underway to establish stable communication channels with the de facto authorities, acting mission chief Mr. Gauchat explained. But concerns remain. 'It is imperative that the UN peacekeepers are allowed to carry out their mandated tasks without obstruction,' Mr. Gauchat told the 15-member Security Council on 17 January, urging all parties to maintain the ceasefire and respect the terms of the 1974 agreement. 'We count on the continued support of Member States to return to full mandate implementation.' Can UNDOF use force? Yes. UNDOF peacekeepers are authorised to use force in self-defence or to defend UN personnel, facilities and equipment. UNDOF operates under Chapter VI of the UN Charter, which emphasises monitoring, observation and facilitating the implementation of peace agreements.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEOc44Vzs33wq8	2025-01-30T16:21:02-08:00	
‘The Russians Worked Fast:’ How Ukraine Lost Its Tactical Nuclear...	By Dmytro Shurkhalo (RFE/RL) -- When Ukraine declared its independence from the U.S.S.R in August 1991, Kyiv came into possession of the third largest nuclear weapons stockpile in the world, after the Soviet Union and the United States. Besides large and complex strategic missiles, Kyiv had also taken over thousands of the Soviet Union's 'tactical' nuclear devices, designed to be small enough to use on an active battlefield. General-Lieutenant Oleksandr Skipalskiy was the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence through the 1990s. The retired military chief spoke to RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service about how an estimated 2,800-4,200 tactical nuclear weapons were relinquished to Russia in a move that may have changed the course of history. 'We were told that Russia was determined to strip Ukraine of its tactical nuclear weapons at any cost,' Skipalskiy recalls of the period following the collapse of the U.S.S.R. 'This was deliberately aimed at depriving Ukraine of the simplest nuclear devices, which did not require complex storage and maintenance systems.' Unlike long-range strategic missiles which require costly upkeep, tactical nuclear munitions can be stored for decades with minimal effort. Some tactical nukes can be as small as an artillery shell. After Skipalskiy ordered a review into the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia, a report was compiled calling for the proposed transfer to be canceled. In early 1992, as Russian teams were already removing the nuclear munitions, the retired intelligence head says, 'I saw with my own eyes how [Ukrainian Security Service Head] Yevhen Marchuk placed our report arguing against the removal of tactical nuclear weapons into a folder and said, ‘I’m going to take this to the president.’' For two weeks following the delivery of that report, the extraction of the weapons was paused. 'Then it got back under way without any explanation; at least I wasn’t told anything,' Skipalsky says. 'I believe [then-Ukrainian President Leonid] Kravchuk made the final decision himself. But who advised him and what arguments were put forward? That I don’t know.' Russian crews tasked with removing the weapons, he says, worked 'fast and around the clock' to load and transport the tactical nuclear warheads out of Ukraine. When the last weapon was taken away, Skipalskiy claims, 'the Russians and their supporters in Ukraine were openly celebrating, saying: ‘We totally hoodwinked the [Ukrainians], we left them the bones and took the meat!'' Kyiv had requested to monitor each step of the transfer, which would ostensibly end with Russia destroying the tactical nuclear weapons. But, Skipalskiy claims, 'they didn’t allow our observers to oversee this, we were just shown some building and told, ‘this is our processing facility,’ but no one was let inside so no one witnessed the claimed disposal of these warheads.' Skipalskiy says Moscow was able to spook Washington into piling pressure on Kyiv. The Kremlin, he says, 'argued that there was a lack of control and that there was the threat of nuclear terrorism. Even if there were no Ukrainian terrorists per se, they claimed that the technological situation was dangerous. As a result, the Americans helped to twist Ukraine’s arm, demanding the transfer of nuclear weapons.' Tactical nukes were stored in facilities throughout Ukraine, especially in Crimea. In some cases, localized attempts were made to stop their transfer to Russia. 'In the Ivano-Frankivsk region there was a major storage base and the civilian administration started saying that the removal was a mistake,' Skipalskiy recalls. A similar confrontation was also reported in Sambir, in western Ukraine. 'Anyone with any sense could see that nuclear weapons are primarily a deterrent, a tool of security,' Skipalskiy told RFE/RL. 'Many people spoke out informally, and military personnel even sent letters of concern.' But in Ukraine’s early months of independence, some military hierarchies were still directly linked to Moscow. 'Military personnel are disciplined people subordinate to their commanders. So when their officer tells them, ‘this has been coordinated with your leadership, send it all for disposal immediately,’ they simply follow orders.' Another factor muddying the issue of tactical nuclear weapons at the time, Skipalskiy says, was the idea that had been floated suggesting that formerly Soviet militaries might be joined to form some kind of union. With the emergence of multiple new, formerly Soviet states with links to Moscow, Spikalskiy recalls, 'some argued that the nuclear component needed to be centralized.' Later, when Ukraine’s more powerful strategic nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles were targeted for destruction or removal, Skipalskiy says, 'there were more organized attempts to hold onto them but the pressure and threats [to destroy or relinquish the weapons] were intense.' Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who played a leading role in the denuclearization of Ukraine, suggested in 2023 that the move was a strategic blunder in light of the war that has been waged on Ukraine since 2014. Skipalskiy says questions today about whether Ukraine should build its own nuclear weapons capacity is pointless to talk about publicly. 'No state has created nuclear weapons while broadcasting that fact,’ he says, adding, 'those who grandstand and beat their chests saying, ‘we should do X and Y,’ that is not how a responsible state operates. Just look after your country’s security and be discreet about it.' Dmytro Shurkhalo is a correspondent for RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEObaC2kl0Cm42	2025-01-30T16:19:44-08:00	
‘No Control’: Sweden Grapples With Bomb Violence Wave	By Charles Szumski (EurActiv) -- Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson admitted that his government has lost control over a burgeoning wave of violence sweeping the country, amid escalating public concern. The acknowledgment came during an emergency meeting where Kristersson announced the acceleration of new legislation targeting juvenile involvement in criminal activities. The beginning of 2025 has seen bombings carried out at an average of one per day, leading to 27 bombings by January 27 – including several in residential communities, the Nordic Times reported. 'Sweden is in the midst of a new wave of violence; it's primarily the bombings that are increasing, with almost one occurring every day,' Kristersson told reporters on Thursday. 'It's abundantly clear that we do not have control over this wave of violence; otherwise, we wouldn't be here,' he added. In 2024, there were 317 total blasts reported by police, which has coincided with a troubling escalation in gang-related conflicts. According to the Swedish prime minister, gang violence is now affecting entire communities, showing 'total indifference' to the consequences in residential areas. The Swedish Police Authority estimated in 2024 that 1,700 under-18s were active members of criminal networks. In response, the Swedish government will bring forward planned legislation that will grant police more powers to detain children under the age of 15 in some circumstances. Originally due in the summer of 2026, the law is now slated to come into effect as early as 1 October this year. Nevertheless, Kristersson described these criminal issues as 'inherited' over a long period, suggesting that resolving them would be a project that extends through the entire decade. Political pressure continues to mount on the prime minster, who has made the fight against armed crime one of his talking points in the 2022 election campaign. Given that a hard line on organised crime in Sweden is one of the hallmarks of the Sweden Democrats – the far-right party that supports Kristersson's government – the prime minister faces a dual imperative to take decisive action: to please his ally, and prevent the party out-flanking him on the issue at the 2026 election. Further recent measures taken to tackle Swedish gang violence a proposal to amend the country's constitution to strip dual nationals of their citizenship if convincted of involvement in gang crime. A government-commissioned investigation also proposed on Wednesday that people convicted of crimes in Sweden should in future be able to serve their sentences in foreign prisons, as there are no ‘absolute obstacles’ under Swedish law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEOV9avA1efFpM	2025-01-30T16:18:03-08:00	
US: Landmark Agreement Clears Way For Restart Of Uranium Transpor...	Energy Fuels Inc expects shipments of ore from its Pinyon Plain Mine in northern Arizona to the White Mesa Mill in southern Utah will restart in February following the signature of an agreement with Navajo agencies on the transport of uranium ore along federal and state highways crossing the Navajo Nation. The agreement with the Navajo Nation Department of Justice and the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency also includes a commitment from Energy Fuels to assist in the cleanup of abandoned uranium mines dating as far back as the 1940s. It comes after months of negotiations between the Denver-based company and the Nation's senior leadership following Energy Fuels' voluntary suspension of transports of uranium across Navajo lands in August 2024. Energy Fuels has agreed to limit transportation to specified routes and hours of the day; not transporting ore on days involving celebrations or public events in respect of the Navajo Nation's culture and traditions; clearly spelled out emergency response procedures, notice and reporting requirements; additional requirements for insurance, driver qualification and training; obtaining Navajo Nation transport licenses; the use of state-of-the-art cover systems to prevent fugitive dust from transport trucks; and provisions for escorts and blessings at the discretion of the Nation. Additional procedures will enable the Navajo Nation to ensure that all applicable rules and agreements are being satisfied. In addition, Energy Fuels has committed to accepting and transporting, at no cost to the Nation, up to 10,000 tons of uranium-bearing cleanup materials from abandoned uranium mines and to make further contributions to support the Nation's transportation safety programmes, education, the environment, public health and welfare, and local economic development on the Navajo Nation relating to uranium matters. 'The Navajo Nation has suffered longstanding impacts from uranium mining conducted during the cold war era, resulting in numerous abandoned mine and mill sites on their lands. This has understandably caused mistrust toward the US government and energy companies,' Energy Fuels President and CEO Mark Chalmers said. 'I am personally honoured that the Navajo Nation was willing to work with us in good faith to address their concerns and ensure that uranium ore transportation through the Navajo Nation will be done safely and respectfully.' 'We have a settlement agreement that will allow the Navajo Nation to monitor and inspect the haul trucks and that provides financial compensation for the expenses to improve safety and protect the environment,' Executive Director of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency Stephen Etsitty said. Energy Fuels announced it had started production at Pinyon Plain in late 2023, with the ore to be stockpiled at White Mesa ahead of processing. The company and its predecessors had previously hauled hundreds of thousands of tons of uranium ore and other materials on state and federal highways and interstates crossing the Navajo Nation between 2007 and 2024 without incident. But on 31 July - after the completion of the first uranium shipment from the project - Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren issued an executive order banning the transport of radioactive material through the Navajo Nation without a prior agreement, referencing existing Navajo laws. 'Good faith' negotiations between Energy Fuels and the Navajo Nation to find a solution began in mid-August. Addressing the legacy According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, nearly 30 million tons of uranium ore were extracted from Navajo lands from 1944 to 1986, under leases with the Navajo Nation. With little regulation or oversight of facilities in the 1940s and 1950s - when the focus was on national security rather than environmental protection - those mostly government-sponsored operations have left a legacy of pollution from hundreds of abandoned uranium mines and treatment plants. Under its agreement with the Navajo Nation, Energy Fuels has committed to accepting and transporting up to 10,000 tons of uranium-bearing cleanup materials from abandoned uranium mines, materials the company described as 'an unfortunate relic of old US government uranium programmes that began in the 1940s, in which Energy Fuels had no involvement.' 'We are proud to be a part of a historic agreement with the Navajo Nation, and we are committed to fulfilling our promises to the,' Chalmers said. 'We hope this agreement marks the beginning of a constructive relationship that restores trust with our neighbours, while also paving the way for future collaborations on cleanups and other areas of shared interest.' Mining has continued at Pinyon Plain during the transport suspension, with ore being stockpiled at the mine site: as of 30 September, ore containing around 180,000 pounds U3O8 (69 tU) had been stockpiled at the Arizona mine for eventual processing at White Mesa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEOT-JSHNZ8ptM	2025-01-30T16:16:12-08:00	
Ownership Of Twitter And Facebook Is A Big Deal, Who Would Have K...	I’m always happy when something I and others have been talking about for years makes it to the New York Times. For that reason, I was happy that New York Times columnist Ezra Klein seems to have discovered that owning a huge social media platform gives a person enormous political power. Unfortunately, Klein could do little more than note the problem. I guess the NYT didn’t authorize him to consider solutions. For people who actually do pay attention to such issues, it has long been apparent that owning a Facebook or Twitter gives people enormous control over public debate. There has always been a problem with control of the media by rich people and large corporations, and not just when they explicitly use it to advance a political agenda, as with Fox News. It should not be surprising that news outlets that are controlled by millionaires and billionaires will tend to be more sympathetic to stories that fit with their view of the world. That means proposals for corporate tax cuts are likely to get more sympathetic coverage than proposals from the likes of Bernie Sanders or labor leaders pushing for a higher minimum wage or Medicare for All. But the big social media platforms take this problem to a new level. Going back two decades, CBS News and the New York Times were incredibly valuable real estate in terms of controlling public debate, but it was possible for others to get in the game and still score points. That is very different when an Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg can decide what hundreds of millions of people will or will not see. In Musk’s case, he decided that we need to see the Nazi nonsense that apparently is close to his heart. His algorithm, apparently downgrades material pushing political sentiments of which he disapproves, as is also the case with Zuckerberg and Facebook. The owners of social media platforms can do this. It is considered their First Amendment right. However, Congress has also decided to privilege these multi-billionaires with the special privilege of Section 230 protection. This means that not only can Musk, Zuckerberg, and the rest, freely decide what you will and will not see on their platforms, unlike print or broadcast media, they are protected against defamation lawsuits for spreading harmful lies. This means that if Elon Musk allows nonsense about one of his political enemies being a pedophile to go to 200 million people, the person has no recourse against Elon Musk. That is the case even if Musk got paid to spread this lie by a person taking out an ad on his platform. Note this is 180 degrees at odds with the standards for print and broadcast media. If they spread defamatory material by a third party, they are liable for damages. In fact, this is exactly what the Dominion case against Fox News was about. Fox repeatedly brought people on its news shows who lied about Dominion flipping votes from Trump to Biden. Spreading these lies cost the network $787 million to settle a defamation suit. There is a similar issue with print media. If a letter to the editor, an unpaid column, or an ad is defamatory, the paper itself is liable, not just the person who wrote it. In fact, the famous New York Times v. Sullivan case, which set the standard for libel for a public figure, was not about anything the paper wrote. It was about an ad taken out in the paper. There is an obvious logic to this standard. A person standing on a street corner making defamatory claims about a person or company probably won’t have much impact. However, if they can get their lies wholesaled by a newspaper, a television network, or Elon Musk’s social media platform, then they can inflict serious damage. There is also the logic that these outlets can profit by spreading the lie. In the case of a paid ad, the source of the profit is obvious, but even when there is no money directly changing hands, the outlet can still profit. Spreading absurd lies about the 2020 election may have brought more viewers and advertisers to Fox. The same holds true with Elon Musk and his social media platform. The question then is why does Congress feel the need to let Elon Musk and other social media platforms profit from spreading defamatory claims, when they would never consider providing the same protection to print or broadcast media? One argument that proponents of Section 230 protection often make is that it would be impossible for a social media platform to preemptively police everything that gets posted for defamatory content. This is true but irrelevant. We don’t have to write the law that they are liable simply by virtue of the material being posted. We can require that they respond to take-down notices, just as we do with copyright enforcement. In the case of copyrights, a social media site is protected from a lawsuit for infringement, if they promptly remove the material in question after having been notified. There is no reason that we cannot have a similar standard for social media sites. Obviously, this will require that they have some number of fact-checkers and lawyers on site to assess the validity of a defamation claim. But print and broadcast outlets have been dealing with this issue for decades and the people who run those outlets can’t be that much smarter than Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. We can also structure the law in a way that benefits smaller platforms, which can offset some of the network effects that tend to favor the giants in the industry. We could continue to allow Section 230 protection to outlets that don’t make money from advertising or selling personal information. This would favor sites that survive on subscription income or donations. I don’t imagine Congress is about to pass something like this for the same reason they are unlikely to do anything that challenges the power of the oligarchs. Nonetheless, it is still worth getting it on the table as a possible solution. Even if the odds are long, it is still worth reminding everyone that people like Musk and Zuckerberg are not incredibly rich because of the wonders of the free market, but rather because they got the government to give them special help. Who knows, maybe one day we will even get someone at the New York Times to talk about this or other solutions to the ridiculous power that we have given to the owners of the giant social media platforms. Getting them to at least notice this power is a big first step.

Gaza: Dreams Of Returning Home Dashed By Reality	People continue to stream back into Gaza City in the wake of the temporary ceasefire across the Strip, with some 500,000 reportedly returning so far, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported on Thursday. Tess Ingram, Communications Manager for UNICEF Middle East and North Africa, is in the northern city where she witnessed people moving through the streets on donkeys, in cars, or by bicycle. 'There's a lot of people with shovels trying to remove rubble, and of course you can see people setting up makeshift shelters or tents on what I'm guessing used to be their homes,' she told UN News. Hope and heartache Ms. Ingram believes that many people were filled with hope and joy as they were finally able to come back to the place they had hoped to return to for more than 15 months. 'But now, as I speak to people, I think that joy is being replaced somewhat by a sense of heaviness as they discover the reality of what has happened here in Gaza City,' she said. 'They were hoping to return to a home that is not there, or to a loved one who has been killed, and I think that that heaviness is really sinking in for people.' Living conditions also remain very difficult. Ms. Ingram visited a school-turned-shelter which is housing returnees along with people who had been living there throughout the war. She met a mother and her five children who desperately need winter clothes and food, but mostly a place to stay because the home where they had hoped to return is gone. This story is not uncommon. 'It is not one person. It is not 100. There are probably thousands of people who are in a similar situation,' she said. Danger on the way Ms. Ingram noted that families are making long, treacherous journeys to get back to Gaza City. On Wednesday she travelled from Al Mawasi, located in the central Gaza Strip, which took 13 hours. However, some families took as long as 36 hours to make the trip. 'And of course the journey itself over those 36 hours is incredibly dangerous,' she said. 'We've heard reports of people being killed by unexploded remnants of war on the way, because these very dangerous unexploded ordnance are buried underneath the rubble.' Support for returnees UNICEF is supporting returning families with the basics that they need to survive. The agency is bringing in nutrition supplies, medical supplies, fuel to run bakeries and hospitals, and water pumps so that people have access to clean water. On Wednesday, UNICEF and other UN agencies brought in 16 trucks of fuel that will be provided to water wells, hospitals and bakeries to get essential services back up and running again. They are also providing services for mental health and psychosocial support for children to help them deal with the trauma they have experienced over the past 15 months. Nutritional screening and immunization services are forthcoming. Keeping families together Hundreds of children have also reportedly been separated from their families while making the journey to the north, and UNICEF is responding to the situation. Staff have been providing children under the age of four with identification bracelets that have their names, their families’ names and phone numbers, on them. 'So, if in the worst case they did get lost in the wash of people there would be some hope of reconnecting them soon with their loved ones,' Ms. Ingram said. People on the move Humanitarians report that more displaced families are returning to northern Gaza as the ceasefire continues to hold. More than 462,000 people have crossed from the south since the opening of the Salah ad Din and Al Rashid roads on Monday. The UN and partners are providing water, high-energy biscuits and medical care along the two routes, while the World Food Programme (WFP) plans to set up more distribution points in the north this week. Displaced Palestinians are also moving from north to south, though in smaller numbers, with about 1,400 people making the journey as of Thursday. Restoring critical services Across Gaza, extensive efforts are underway to restore critical services, including civilian infrastructure, which the UN and partners are supporting. WFP has delivered more than 10,000 metric tonnes of food to the enclave since the ceasefire took effect. On Thursday, 750 trucks entered Gaza, according to information obtained by the UN on the ground through interactions with the Israeli authorities and the guarantors for the ceasefire deal. The previous day, UNICEF distributed 135 cubic metres of water to communities in Jabalya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, located in North Gaza governorate. These areas had been besieged for over three months. Furthermore, 35,000 litres of fuel were delivered to northern Gaza to sustain the operations of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, while water trucking in Rafah is being scaled up. Humanitarian partners are also coordinating with the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company to repair the damaged power line that feeds the South Gaza desalination plant, which is currently running on fuel. West Bank violence continues Meanwhile, in the West Bank, Israeli military operations in northern areas have expanded beyond Jenin and Tulkarm to the nearby governorate of Tubas. Ten people reportedly were killed on Wednesday when an Israeli air strike hit a group of Palestinians in Tammun, a village in Tubas governorate. This brings the death toll from the ongoing Israeli operation in the northern West Bank to 30, including two children. Overall, more than 3,200 families have been displaced from Jenin refugee camp in the context of Palestinian Authority and Israeli operations since December, according to local authorities. Humanitarian partners continue to deliver aid, including food parcels, kitchen kits, baby supplies, hygiene items, medicines, and other essential supplies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEOQE5gLTSm6nv	2025-01-30T16:11:31-08:00	
Fighting In Myanmar’s Sagaing Region Prompts Thousands To Flee To...	Intense fighting between Myanmar’s military and rebel forces in Sagaing region near the country’s border with India has forced more than 3,000 civilians to flee their homes and led to heavy casualties on both sides, according to sources. The fiercest fighting in Tamu township began on Monday, as rebel fighters launched an offensive targeting temporary military camps in the area, prompting the military to reinforce its troops with airstrikes and drone bombs, residents, aid workers and anti-junta groups said. Tamu is in Sagaing, a heartland region populated largely by members of the majority Burman community that has been torn by violence since democracy activists set up paramilitary groups to battle the military after the 2021 coup. Since early January, more than 3,000 residents of Tamu township have fled some 24 kilometers (15 miles) to the border separating Sagaing region and India’s Manipur state, said aid workers. Fighting continued on Thursday at a military camp between Tamu’s Htan Ta Pin and Pan Thar villages, an official from the anti-junta Tamu Township People’s Defense Force, or PDF, told RFA Burmese. The PDF official called the military camp 'significant,' noting that around 400 pro-junta fighters are stationed there, including from the Pyu Saw Htee militia. 'We’re first attacking junta forces in Htan Ta Pin, and then we will advance toward Pan Thar,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. 'After Pan Thar falls, we could seize Tamu without difficulty.' 'Many junta soldiers' have been killed in the fighting, as well as 10 rebel fighters, he said. RFA could not independently confirm the exact number of casualties on both sides. Displaced ‘in dire need’ A civilian who fled the fighting in Tamu told RFA that the displaced are 'in dire need' of food and clothing. 'We have been here for two weeks, taking refuge on the Manipur side of the border, not far from Tamu,' he said. 'Those who can afford to, rent houses, while others live in tents. We rely on borrowing from others to survive.' The junta has repeatedly used airstrikes to pound Tamu’s Khampat town and Ka Nan village, which are under the control of Myanmar’s shadow National Unity Government, or NUG, prompting an exodus of civilians, according to aid workers and residents. An airstrike on Jan. 16 killed two civilians, including a child, residents of Tamu said. The junta also conducted airstrikes on the nights of Jan. 20 and 21, they said. Only about one-third of residents are left in Khampat town, an aid worker told RFA. 'Everyone is on high alert, constantly watching the sky with fright and exhaustion,' said the aid worker, who also declined to be named. 'We also keep our eyes on our mobile phone connections — the moment the signal drops, we immediately take cover in underground shelters. We’ve come to understand that a loss of communication signals an impending airstrike.' Posts on pro-junta pages on the social media platform Telegram said that on the evening of Jan. 28, the military attacked PDF fighters around Tamu’s Kyun Pin Thar village with artillery, airstrikes, and drones. They claimed that junta forces discovered the bodies of seven rebels and ammunition there. Attempts by RFA to contact the junta’s spokesperson for Sagaing region by telephone went unanswered Thursday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEOQ7v6L8moPO_	2025-01-30T16:06:10-08:00	
Brazil: Central Bank Lifts Benchmark Interest Rate To 13.25% Per ...	By Wellton Maximo The recent rise in the dollar and uncertainties about inflation and the global economy prompted the Brazilian Central Bank to raise interest rates again. The Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) unanimously increased the Selic (Special Settlement and Custody System) rate, the country's benchmark interest rate, by 1 percentage point to 13.25 percent per year. In a statement, Copom noted that external uncertainties, particularly in the United States, cast doubt on the policy stance of the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank). Regarding Brazil, the committee stated that the economy is heating up, with both headline and core inflation—which excludes volatile items like food and energy— exceeding the target. Additionally, uncertainties over public spending have disrupted asset prices. Regarding upcoming meetings, Copom confirmed it will raise the Selic rate by 1 percentage point at the March meeting but did not indicate whether further hikes will follow in May, stating only that it will monitor inflation. 'Beyond the next meeting, the committee emphasizes that the overall scale of the monetary tightening cycle will be guided by the firm commitment to bringing inflation back to the target and will depend on the evolution of inflation dynamics,' it said. This marks the fourth consecutive Selic rate hike. The rate is now at its highest level since September 2023, when it also stood at 13.25 percent per year. The increase solidifies the ongoing cycle of monetary tightening. Inflation The Selic rate is the Central Bank's primary tool for controlling official inflation, as measured by the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA). In December, the index stood at 0.52 percent. According to the Brazilian government´s statistics agency IBGE, despite the reduction in electricity bills, food prices—especially meat and certain fruits—continued to rise. With this result, the indicator has risen by 4.83 percent in 2024, surpassing last year's target ceiling. Under the new continuous target system, effective as of this month, the Central Bank's inflation target—set by the National Monetary Council—is 3 percent, with a tolerance range of 1.5 percentage points up or down. This means the lower limit is 1.5 percent, and the upper limit is 4.5 percent. In the continuous target model, the target is calculated monthly, based on inflation accumulated over the past 12 months. In January 2025, inflation from February 2024 onward is compared to the target and its tolerance range. In February, the same process is repeated, starting from March 2024. This approach shifts the verification over time, moving beyond the previous annual index, which was fixed in December. The basic interest rate is used in government bond trading through Selic and serves as a benchmark for other interest rates in the economy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEObJ1C6BVB_gm	2025-01-30T16:03:03-08:00	
As Los Angeles Burns, Trump Plans To Shift Disaster Burden To Sta...	At the end of last year, many news organizations were asking whether Trump could deny federal disaster aid to states that he deems politically unfriendly. His thoughts on the topic have become abundantly clear in recent weeks. But it’s also becoming apparent that his administration is working on something that would negatively impact all Americans living in areas with climate hazards. As he tours the sites of recent disasters in North Carolina and California, Trump is setting the stage for a significant reduction in federal disaster aid and mitigation funding. And states should be worried. Though President Trump disavowed Project 2025 during his campaign, many organizations, including CEPR, noted a section that advises 'reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.' Again, despite distancing himself from the document, 16 of the 26 executive orders that Trump signed on his first day in office mirrored Project 2025 proposals. And now he’s turning toward FEMA. 'The FEMA is getting in the way of everything,' Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Wednesday, adding he’d 'rather see the states take care of their own problems.' As recently as today, Trump has even stated that he would sign an executive order to fundamentally overhaul or eliminate FEMA entirely. While Trump does not have the authority to eliminate FEMA outright, he can certainly cut it down to nothing, or use a sympathetic Congress to do his work for him. Since its creation in 1979 by the late President Carter, FEMA has drawn its fair share of criticisms and controversies — none more significant and deserved than the agency’s response to Hurricane Katrina under George W. Bush. However, FEMA has also provided billions of dollars in housing and rental assistance to survivors and funding to rebuild infrastructure in communities recovering from disasters. Before FEMA, disaster response was piecemeal, requiring Congress to pass bills. The frequency of disasters before 1979 was nothing like what we see today. States cannot absorb the costs of these disasters, and they don’t have the money to prevent them either. States have long relied on mitigation grants from FEMA and HUD to make communities safer. And in the case of states like California, they have relied on the federal government, in the form of the US Forest Service, to manage forests that fall outside state and private jurisdiction. These parts of the federal government that aim to make the US climate resilient are chronically underfunded. Congress has been constantly deprioritizing climate resilience and relief, and now that the issue is taking center stage, it is blaming everyone but itself for the lack of preparation. If Trump truly wanted to make America great again, he would prioritize funding for aid, mitigation, and, in extreme cases, community-driven relocation. But instead, he’s removing reports about such efforts from the White House website and setting Americans up for four years of uncertainty and suffering.

Hamas Frees Eight More Hostages Under Gaza Ceasefire	The Israeli military said eight hostages, including three Israelis and five Thai nationals, were released Thursday as Israel and Hamas carried out their third exchange of hostages and prisoners under a ceasefire agreement to halt more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza. Israeli soldier Agam Berger was released to the Red Cross in the refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza, then went to Israel, where she was reunited with her parents. 'Thank God we have reached this moment, and our hero Agam has returned to us after 482 days in enemy hands,' Berger’s family said in a statement. 'Now Agam and our family can begin the healing process, but the recovery will not be complete until all the hostages return home.' Hours later, a Red Cross convoy moved through a chaotic, crowded scene in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis to deliver the other two Israelis and the Thai nationals to the Israeli military. Their release was delayed after armed militants struggled to contain the large Palestinian crowds that gathered around the Red Cross cars. The hostages were eventually led through the crowd surrounded by a ring of gunmen. 'I view with utmost severity the shocking scenes during the release of our hostages,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office shortly after the handover was completed. He said he 'demands that the mediators make certain that such terrible scenes do not recur and guarantee the safety of our hostages.' The Israel Defense Forces confirmed the group then crossed into Israeli territory. It identified the freed Israelis as Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Moses, and the Thais as Thenna Pongsak, Sathian Suwannakhan, Sriaoun Watchara, Seathao Bannawat and Rumnao Surasak. The military said the Israelis would be reunited with their families, while Thai government officials would meet with its citizens. Later in the day, as part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners, including 32 serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. The Hamas-linked prisoners’ office said that about 20 of the freed Palestinian prisoners would be expelled abroad and will not be allowed to return to their homes in the West Bank or Jerusalem. Such prisoners can head to Gaza or leave for Egypt, where discussions over their final destination are ongoing, according to the Palestinian commissioner for prisoners’ affairs. Returning home Under the ceasefire, more than 423,000 Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza over the past three days after the Israeli military ordered them out of the region in the earliest stages of the war in October 2023. However, their homecoming has been bittersweet as nearly everyone has friends or relatives who have been killed in the warfare, and many northern neighborhoods have been decimated in the fighting. Previous exchanges have freed seven hostages the militants were holding in Gaza and 300 prisoners held by Israel. Hamas is due to release three additional hostages on Saturday, with Israel freeing dozens more Palestinian prisoners. The first phase of the ceasefire lasts for 42 days, about one-quarter of which has passed. It calls for the release of 33 hostages from Gaza, as well as negotiations on the details of the second phase involving the release of the rest of the hostages, an end to the conflict and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Those negotiations are due to begin next week. U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met with Netanyahu on Wednesday to reinforce American support for the ceasefire. Witkoff, who played a key role in shaping the six-week truce, also inspected the Netzarim Corridor, a 6-kilometer-wide strip of land that bisects Gaza, where American security contractors have been hired to help oversee the return of displaced Palestinians. Witkoff was the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Gaza in years. American officials have stayed away from the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea because of security concerns and Washington’s no-contact policy with Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. Netanyahu is headed to Washington this weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump has invited him for talks at the White House on Tuesday. It will be Trump’s first meeting with a foreign leader since starting his second term in office. In the West Bank Meanwhile, during the ceasefire in Gaza, Israel has ramped up its military operations in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 10 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Thursday. The U.N. humanitarian agency said there has been a 'drastic deterioration in the humanitarian and protection situation' in the West Bank. Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a visit to the city of Jenin on Wednesday that Israel has 'declared war on Palestinian terrorism in Judea and Samaria,' referring to the West Bank. 'The Jenin refugee camp will not return to what it was,' he said. 'After the operation is completed, the [Israel Defense Forces] will remain in the camp to ensure that terrorism does not return.' The war in Gaza started with the shock Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 47,400 people, most of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Israeli military said the death toll includes 17,000 militants.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEORJBvza5r3Ie	2025-01-30T15:57:28-08:00	
Philippines Arrests 5 Chinese Nationals For Suspected Espionage	By Camille Elemia and Gerard Carreon Filipino authorities announced the arrests of five more Chinese nationals suspected of spying on coast guard and navy installations, after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. offered to make a deal with China over U.S. missiles deployed in his country. The arrests brought to six the number of Chinese citizens taken into custody in the Philippines in recent days on suspicion of espionage amid heightened bilateral tensions in the South China Sea. The Philippine government paraded the five new suspects before the media’s cameras on Thursday – the same day that Marcos said he would have an American mid-range missile system removed from the Southeast Asian nation if Beijing agreed to stop intimidating Filipinos in contested waters. 'Let’s make a deal with China: Stop claiming our territory, stop harassing our fishermen and let them have a living, stop ramming our boats, stop water-cannoning our people, stop firing lasers at us, and stop your aggressive and coercive behavior, and I’ll return the Typhon missiles,' the Philippine leader Marcos told reporters in an interview in Cebu. 'Once they stop what they are doing, I will return all of the missiles.' Over the past few months, rival territorial claimants Manila and Beijing have faced off in high-stakes confrontations in the South China Sea, a potentially mineral-rich waterway and crucial corridor for international shipping. The five Chinese nationals claimed to be tourists from Taiwan, according to Philippine authorities. They are believed to 'have engaged in aerial reconnaissance via drone operations, collecting data from the Philippines’ naval assets, among others' in Palawan province, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said in a statement. Palawan, a finger-shaped island, is on the frontline of Manila’s maritime dispute with Beijing. The Chinese nationals were allegedly working with Deng Yuanqing, another Chinese who was arrested earlier this month along with two supposed Filipino accomplices on similar charges, the NBI said. The bureau conducted an operation on Jan. 24 and 25, resulting in the arrest of the five other suspects. They were identified as Cai Shaohuang (also known as Richard Tan), Cheng Hai Tao (also known as Lestrade), Wu Cheng Ting (also known as Brawn), Wang Yong Yi (also known as Watson), and Wu Chin Ren. The NBI said they were all members of the civic groups Qiaoxing Volunteer Group of the Philippines and the Philippine-China Association of Promotion of Peace and Friendship, Inc. Both organizations did not provide immediate comment on the arrests of the five. Authorities said the suspects were 'posing as buyers of marine products, roaming around the city, and surveying for stations selling the products.' 'The group was seen frequenting Ulugan Bay, Puerto Princesa, Palawan, conducting aerial surveillance and reconnaissance, collecting imagery intelligence on the Naval Detachment Oyster Bay in Barangay Bahile, which is part of the Philippine Navy’s Naval Forces West and is strategically positioned near the South China Sea,' the NBI said. Authorities seized the mobile devices of the Chinese nationals and allegedly found photos of a Philippine Coast Guard station and vessels, as well as the Buliluyan port in southern Palawan – the usual port for PCG vessels patrolling the South China Sea. Other images reportedly found on the phones were of the Philippine Navy’s warships, terrain maps overlooking Subic Bay International Airport, the Naval Operating Base (NOB) Subic in Zambales province, and a screenshot of a map identifying the NOB’s location. Subic Bay, located about 50 miles northwest of Manila on Luzon island, was the former site of a huge American naval base and it opens onto the South China Sea. The NBI said it also found footage of PCG vessels Teresa Magbanua – the Philippines’ largest coast guard ship – and Gabriela Silang docked in Manila. These are among the Philippine ships challenging Chinese vessels in the disputed waters. The Chinese Embassy in Manila has not yet commented on the latest arrests, but it previously denied the espionage allegations against Deng. 'The so-called ‘espionage’ operation of a Chinese citizen in the Philippines is baseless speculation and accusation,' the embassy said in a statement on Jan. 25. Marcos on Typhon missile system Earlier on Thursday, Marcos spoke about the Typhon missile system, which the U.S. military deployed last year in the Philippine archipelago – a move that angered Beijing. Developed by American arms maker Lockheed Martin, the missile system has a range of 480 kilometers (300 miles) and can reach Scarborough Shoal – a South China Sea feature in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone under de facto Chinese control since 2012 – as well as targets around Taiwan. The Philippine Army has indicated its plans to acquire the Typhon system, which can fire the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) and Tomahawk missiles, as well as support strike capabilities from land, sea and air. Last week, a report by Reuters said the U.S. military had moved its Typhon missile system from an airfield in Laoag in Ilocos Norte, Marcos’ hometown, to an undisclosed location elsewhere on Luzon. On Tuesday, Philippine Army spokesman Col. Louie Dema-alaconfirmed that Filipino soldiers would train with U.S. troops next month on the Typhon system. 'I don’t understand their comments on the Typhon missile system – we don’t make any comments on their missile systems and their missile systems are a thousand times more powerful than what we have. So, I don’t understand,' Marcos told reporters Thursday, referring to Chinese criticism of the presence of the American missiles on Philippine soil. Jeoffrey Maitem in Manila contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEOR2gyrfXWndR	2025-01-30T15:54:19-08:00	
Qatari Emir First Arab Leader To Visit Syria Since Fall Of Assad	The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani arrived in Damascus on Thursday, becoming the first Arab leader to visit Syria since the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime. Ahmed Al-Sharaa, declared interim president of Syria during a conference on Wednesday evening, welcomed Sheikh Tamim at Damascus International Airport on his arrival. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Al-Bashir, Foreign Minister Asaad Al-Shaibani, and Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra were also present. Qatar supported Syrian opposition factions during the country’s 13-year civil war before Assad fled Damascus for Moscow in early December. Sheikh Tamim’s visit marks a significant resumption of Qatari-Syrian relations, with Qatar expected to play a major role in reconstruction, according to the Qatar News Agency. Political analyst and author Khaled Walid Mahmoud told QNA that Shiekh Tamim’s visit is 'highly symbolic and historically significant, being the first by an Arab leader since the fall of the former regime.' The visit could reopen diplomatic channels and support a sustainable political resolution in Damascus, highlighting Qatar’s strong ties with the US and Turkiye, as well as its role as a trusted mediator in Syria and the Middle East, he added. Qatar will play a crucial role in the reconstruction of Syria, especially in key sectors such as energy, transportation, and housing, which were devasted by the civil war. Ahmed Qassim Hussein, a researcher at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, told QNA that the emir’s visit signals an evolving Qatari role in Syria’s political, economic, and security spheres. Qatar’s support for the new Syrian leadership led by the insurgent-turned-president Al-Sharaa was evident in its decision to reopen the embassy in Damascus following its closure in 2011. He said that '(the visit) reflects Qatar’s commitment to restoring diplomatic relations and fostering cooperation with Syria,' adding that Doha is guiding the Syrian leadership in navigating Syria’s transitional phase and fostering long-term stability.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEOWqHR2pT8OjE	2025-01-30T15:51:22-08:00	
Defense Secretary Hegseth Affirms Commitment To Border Security, ...	Matthew Olay During a media interview Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth affirmed the Defense Department's commitment to working with other federal agencies to bolster security at the southern border. 'You saw on Day 1 from [President Donald J. Trump's] executive orders, the military's ... commitment to protecting the territorial sovereignty of the southern border, which is a shift,' Hegseth said. After emphasizing some of the steps DOD has taken to increase border security — including partnering with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, sending National Guardsmen and active-duty Marines and soldiers to the border and strengthening the border with additional physical barriers — Hegseth spoke about detaining criminal migrants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Earlier in the day, the president announced his intention to sign an executive order instructing DOD and DHS to prepare Guantanamo Bay for the detention of 30,000 criminal migrants. 'President Trump has been very clear with [migrant countries of origin] that if [they] aren't willing to take [their] criminals back … then we will hold you accountable,' Hegseth said. Noting that he served as an officer at Guantanamo Bay while on an active-duty National Guard deployment from 2004 to 2005, Hegseth said Guantanamo Bay is the 'perfect place' to safely detain the migrants. He made clear that detaining migrants wouldn't necessarily require the high level of security used to detain suspected terrorists during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. 'Americans think of 'Gitmo' as the images you see on your screen: the detention facilities with folks from the Taliban and al-Qaida … That's one part of Guantanamo Bay,' Hegseth explained. Hegseth said that the other part of the installation is a U.S. naval station that has provided migrant and refugee resettlement for several decades. According to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay's official website, the base has been used for 'migrant operations, regional humanitarian relief and disaster assistance,' among many other activities during the installation's history. 'This is not the camps,' Hegseth reiterated. 'This is a temporary transit which is already the mission of Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, where we can plus-up thousands — and tens of thousands, if necessary — to humanely move illegals out of our country where they do not belong [and] back to the countries where they came from in proper process.' Calling the Guantanamo operation a 'plan in movement,' Hegseth also said that DOD is 'ramping up' to expand the scope of deportations. 'President Trump is dead serious about getting illegal criminals out of our country,' Hegseth said. 'And the DOD is not only willing to — it's proud to — partner with DHS to defend the sovereignty of our southern border and advance that mission.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNnjtfNdoEOWR-gT2ZIAJz	2025-01-30T15:48:56-08:00	
Prabowo’s Indonesia And The Future Of India-Indonesia Strategic T...	By Premesha Saha Indonesian President Prabowo Subinato is on a state visit to India from 25-26 January 2025. This marks his first visit to the country since he took office in October last year and it comes at a time when India and Indonesia are celebrating the 75th year of their bilateral partnership. Both countries upgraded their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2018, during the visit of former Indonesia President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) to India. But there is still significant unfulfilled potential in the relationship which begs the question of what practical steps can be taken to strengthen the relationship across a range of fields. There is a consensus that Prabowo will have a hands-on approach when it comes to foreign and defence policy and will play an active role in shaping and implementing foreign policy during his tenure. Will this present an opportunity for India to further strengthen its partnership with Indonesia? Can this visit pave the way for stronger bilateral ties between the two countries? Before taking off for his visit to India, President Prabowo had stated, 'India is our friend and an important partner to Indonesia. India was one of the countries that strongly supported our struggle for independence during the war until 1949.' It is expected that the two leaders will be inking several Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) to strengthen bilateral cooperation on issues ranging from health, education, culture, security and maritime safety. President Prabowo is also being accompanied by Representatives from the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) on this visit so that there can be meetings with the Indian business communities who are looking to invest in Indonesia. The Indonesian Foreign Ministry (KEMLU) has described the visit to India as 'an affirmation of the deepening and widening strategic cooperation between the two countries, especially in the economic, security, and maritime sectors'. Under Prabowo, a more robust iteration of Indonesia’s independent and active (bebas dan aktif) foreign policy and non-aligned stance in responding to regional and international dynamics is being expected. However, there will be some major shifts from the previous Jokowi era in Indonesia’s foreign policy approach under Prabowo. What will these changes be and will they help in pushing forward the India-Indonesia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership? How can India use these shifts/ changes to its advantage in terms of strengthening its partnership with the biggest country in Southeast Asia and also probably the most dominant voice within the ASEAN? Indonesia’s foreign policy outlook under President Prabowo Since assuming office, when it comes to foreign policy, President Prabowo has taken some decisions that reflect a monumental shift from the foreign policy approach that was undertaken during the Jokowi era. First and foremost, the selection of Sugiono as his Foreign Minister, a loyalist from Prabowo’s political party and is described by some as his 'ideological son' was a break in tradition. Usually, seasoned diplomats from the Indonesian Foreign Ministry have been selected as Foreign Ministers in the past. Indonesian scholars and analysts have pointed out that this shows that Prabowo himself wants to be in charge of deciding the future steps and direction of Indonesian foreign policy. Most scholars and analysts regardPrabowo as an 'arch nationalist and a realist who believes that wealth and military might undergird a country’s prosperity in an anarchical world'. In his presidential debates and subsequent statements, he has stated that Indonesia will be a 'good neighbour'—continuing the 'many friends, zero enemies' posture. Prabowo has put his spin on this motto by rephrasing it as ‘friends to all, enemy to none’. Prabowo’s foreign trips to China, the United States (US), Russia, also to a few ASEAN countries like Malaysia reflect his willingness to meet diverse partners in Asia and Europe to shore up Indonesia’s positions in trade, defence, security, and other areas. Prabowo will continue to work towards enhancing Indonesia’s military capabilities and modernising the military to safeguard national interests. During his tenure as Indonesian Defence Minister, he signed defence agreements with countries like Australia and Singapore. He had even visited India during the pandemic to discuss the possibilities and opportunities of strengthening India-Indonesia defence ties. His recent visit to Russia just after winning the elections in July 2024 also reflects ‘a potential recalibration of Indonesia’s foreign policy and a desire to explore future military acquisitions and defence deals’. Indonesia, under Prabowo, though continuing its non-aligned stature is pursuing a policy of multi-alignment, maintaining its strategic autonomy and this can be seen with Indonesia continuing to balance its ties with China and the United States. His visits to both China and the US immediately after being the President-elect are reflective of this. There is also the continued attempt at diversifying partnerships and engagements with other countries in the Indo-Pacific region. Indonesia’s desire to be seen as one of the leading voices in the Global South and be seen on the global stage as a 'bridge between developing and developed nations' explains why Indonesia was so enthusiastic about joining the BRICS. Many in Indonesia have questioned if by joining the BRICS, Indonesia is getting more closely aligned with China and Russia. Is this compromising Indonesia’s long-time non-aligned stand? But both President Prabowo and Foreign Minister Sugiano have asserted that 'Indonesia can use its position in BRICS to change the course of development that safeguards the interests of both developed North and Global South.' It is also being speculated that, to push for Indonesia’s economic development, President Prabowo can even decide to join all economic organizations to open up economic opportunities and collaboration with nearly all developed countries. This explains Indonesia’s application for membership in the OECD as well. Indonesia, under Prabowo, is looking to emerge as a global player in the Indo-Pacific region and have a foreign policy which is not just heavily focused on the ASEAN. For long, Indonesia has been seen as a middle power and as a de-facto leader within the ASEAN. Under Prabowo the aim is to have a bigger role, a bigger voice on the global stage. Will the India-Indonesia bilateral partnership finally get the much-needed push? India extending the invite to President Prabowo for being the Chief Guest for India’s Republic Day celebrations is a welcome move and shows the importance of Indonesia in India’s Act East policy. There are several areas that the two countries can look into to further cement this partnership. India is looking to finalise a US$450 million deal to sell Russian-backed Brahmos supersonic cruise missiles to Indonesia. This is likely to be discussed between the two leaders during their meeting. But still, given that Indonesia is trying to secure its finances to be able to seal this deal, hurdles remain. India and Indonesia have been negotiating for about a decade for the sale of the BrahMos cruise missile. Another hurdle which can be an issue is Indonesia’s attempt to grow its domestic defence manufacturing capacity. It has also implemented an initiative called the ‘Made in Indonesia’. For future defence deals, this might become a roadblock. Therefore, there is a need to discuss what complementaries exist between India’s ‘Make in India’ and Indonesia’s ‘Made in Indonesia’ and how these can be leveraged. Besides this, maritime security is another potential area that the two countries should focus on. The two countries signed a joint vision statement for maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific in 2018. It is time to talk about an implementation plan or an operationalisation plan for this joint vision statement and see if this can be transformed into a joint action plan for maritime security in the Indo-Pacific. Given Indonesia sits on some of the critical sea lanes of communication like the Strait of Malacca, Sunda, Lombok, Makassar, and Omboi Wetar Straits, sea lane security/ SLOC security should become an important discussion point between the two countries. In this context entering into talks to further elevate or give the much-needed push to the Australia-India-Indonesia Trilateral Cooperation is also important. In his first foreign policy speech early this month, Foreign Minister Sugiono stressed that 'Indonesia’s diplomacy and foreign policy should be implemented in line with domestic development priorities.' He highlighted two main development priorities of the President: food security and the nationwide campaign of nutrition intervention through the free meals program. Indonesia has long wanted to implement the Free Meal Programme. In India the Mid-Day Meal Programme has been operational for the last 30 years, therefore this creates another opportunity for the two countries to work together. Much of the foreign policy approach that is being undertaken by Indonesia under the current government aligns with India’s own foreign policy posture. India, too, being a non-aligned nation, is pursuing issue-based partnerships to fulfil its own global and domestic ambitions. India, in spite of being a part of many minilateral groupings like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, has still managed to keep up its strategic autonomy. This, again, is the policy line that Prabowo is looking to pursue. Both countries are a part of the Global South and are members of the G20, and now the BRICS. This presents a great opportunity for India to seek ways and explore areas that will give much-needed momentum to the India-Indonesia ties.

Trump’s Balance-Of-Payments War On Mexico, And The World – OpEd	The Road to Chaos The 1940s saw a series of movies with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, starting with the Road to Singapore in 1940. The plot was always similar. Bing and Bob, two fast-talking con men or song-and-dance partners, would find themselves in a scrape in some country, and Bing would get out of it by selling Bob as a slave (Morocco in 1942, where Bing promises to buy him back) or committing him to be sacrificed in some pagan ceremony, and so forth. Bob always goes along with the plan, and there’s always a happy Hollywood ending where they escape together – with Bing always getting the girl. In the past few years we have seen a series of similar diplomatic stagings with the United States and Germany (standing in for Europe as a whole). We could call it the Road to Chaos. The United States has sold out Germany by destroying Nord Stream, with Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholtz (the hapless Bob Hope character) going along with it, and with European Commission President Ursula von der Lehen tplaying the part of Dorothy Lamour (the girl, being Bing’s prize in the Hollywood Road movies) demanding that all Europe increase its NATO military spending beyond Biden’s demand for 2% to Trump’s escalation to 5%. To top matters, Europe is to impose sanctions on trade with Russia and China, obliging them to relocate their leading industries in the United States. So, unlike the movies, this will not end with the United States rushing in to save gullible Germany. Instead, Germany and Europe as a whole will become sacrificial offerings in our desperate but futile effort to save the US Empire. While Germany may not immediately end up with an emigrating and shrinking population like Ukraine, its industrial destruction is well under way. Trump told the Davos Economic Forum January 23: 'My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on earth.' Otherwise, if they continue to try and produce at home or in other countries, their products will be charged tariff rates at Trump’s threatened 20%. To Germany this means (my paraphrase): 'Sorry your energy prices have quadrupled. Come to America and get them at almost as low a price as you were paying Russia before your elected leaders let us cut Nord Stream off.' The great question is how many other countries will be as quiescent as Germany as Trump changes the rules of the game – America’s Rules-Based Order. At what point will a critical mass be achieved that changes the world order as a whole? Can there be a Hollywood ending to the coming chaos? The answer is No, and that the key is to be found in the balance-of-payments effect of Trump’s threatened tariffs and trade sanctions. Neither Trump nor his economic advisors understand what damage their policy is threatening to cause by radically unbalancing the balance of payments and exchange rates throughout the world, making a financial rupture inevitable. The balance-of-payments and exchange-rate constraint on Trump’s tariff aggression The first two countries that Trump threatened were America’s NAFTA partners, Mexico and Canada. Against both countries Trump has threatened to raise U.S. tariffs on imports from them by 20% if they do not obey his policy demands. He has threatened Mexico in two ways. First of all is his immigration program of exporting illegal immigrants and permitting short-term work permits for seasonal Mexican labor to work in agriculture and household services. He has suggested deporting the Latin American immigration wave to Mexico, on the ground that most have come to America via the Mexican border along the Rio Grande. This threatens to impose an enormous social-welfare overhead on Mexico, which has no wall on its own southern border. There also is a strong balance-of-payments cost to Mexico, and indeed to other countries whose citizens have sought work in the United States. A major source of dollars for these countries has been money remitted by workers who send what they can afford back to their families. This is an important source of dollars for families in Latin American, Asian and other countries. Deporting immigrants will remove a substantial source of revenue that has been supporting the exchange rates of their currencies vis-à-vis the dollar. Imposing a 20% tariff or other trade barriers on Mexico and other countries would be a fatal blow to their exchange rates by reducing the export trade that U.S. policy promoted starting under President Carter to promote an outsourcing of U.S. employment by using Mexican labor to keep down U.S. wage rates. The creation of NAFTA under Bill Clinton led to a long line of maquiladora assembly plants just south of the US/Mexican border, employing low-wage Mexican labor on assembly lines set up by U.S. companies to save labor costs. Tariffs would abruptly deprive Mexico of the dollars received to pay pesos to this labor force, and also would raise costs for their U.S. parent companies. The result of these two Trump policies would be a plunge in Mexico’s source of dollars. This will force Mexico to make a choice: If it passively accepts these terms, the peso’s currency exchange rate will depreciate. This will make imports (priced in dollars on a worldwide level) more expensive in peso terms, leading to a substantial jump in domestic inflation. Alternatively, Mexico can put its economy first and say that the trade and payments disruption caused by Trump’s tariff action prevents it from paying its dollar-debts to bondholders. In 1982, Mexico’s default on its tesobono bonds denominated in dollars triggered the Latin America debt bomb of defaults. Trump’s acts looks like he’s forcing a replay. In that case, Mexico’s countervailing response would be to suspend payment on its US-dollar bonds. This could have far-reaching effects, because many other Latin American and Global South countries are experiencing a similar squeeze in their balance of international trade and payments. The dollar’s exchange rate already has been soaring against their currencies as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, attracting investment funds from Europe and other countries. A rising dollar means rising import prices for oil and raw materials denominated in dollars. Canada faces a similar balance-of-payments squeeze. Its counterpart to Mexico’s maquiladora plants are its auto-parts plants in Windsor, across the river from Detroit. In the 1970s the two countries agreed on the Auto Pact allocating what assembly plants would work on in their joint production of U.S. autos and trucks. Well, 'agreed' may not be the appropriate verb. I was in Ottawa at the time, and government officials were very resentful at being assigned the short end of the auto deal. But it is still going today, fifty years later, and remains a major contributor to Canada’s trade balance and hence the exchange rate of its dollar, which already has been falling against that of the United States. Of course, Canada is no Mexico. The thought of it suspending payment on its dollar bonds is unthinkable in a country run largely by its banks and financial interests. But the political consequences will be felt throughout Canadian politics. There will be an anti-American feeling (always bubbling under the surface in Canada) that should end Trump’s fantasy of making Canada the 51ststate. The implicit moral foundations of international economic order There is a basic illusory moral principle at work in Trump’s tariff and trade threats, and it underlies the broad narrative by which the United States has sought to rationalize its unipolar domination of the world economy. That principle is the illusion of reciprocity supporting a mutual distribution of benefits and growth – and in the American vocabulary it is wrapped together with democratic values and patter talk about free markets promising automatic stabilizers under the U.S.-sponsored international system. The principles of reciprocity and stability were central to the economic arguments by John Maynard Keynes during the debate in the late 1920s over U.S. insistence that its European wartime allies pay heavy debts for arms bought from the United States before its formal entry into the war. The Allies agreed to pay by imposing German reparations to shift the cost onto the war’s loser. But the demands by the United States on its European allies, and in turn by them on Germany, were far beyond the ability to be met. The fundamental problem, Keynes explained, was that the United States was raising its tariffs against Germany in response to its currency depreciating, and then imposed the Smoot-Hawley tariff against the rest of the world. That prevented Germany from earning the hard currency to pay the allies, and for them to pay America. To make the international financial system of debt service work, Keynes pointed out, a creditor nation has an obligation to provide debtor countries with the opportunity to raise the money to pay by exporting to the creditor nation. Otherwise, there will be currency collapse and crippling austerity for debtors. This basic principle should be at the heart of any design for how the international economy should be organized with checks and balances to prevent such collapse. Opponents of Keynes – the French anti-German monetarist Jacques Rueff, and the neoclassical trade advocate Bertil Ohlin – repeated the same argument that David Ricardo laid out in his 1809-1810 testimony before Britain’s Bullion Committee. He claimed that paying foreign debts automatically creates a balance in international payments. This junk-economic theory provided a logic that remains the basic IMF austerity model today. According to this theory’s fantasy, when paying debt service lowers prices and wages in the debt-paying country, that will increase its exports by making them less costly to foreigners. And supposedly, the receipt of debt service by creditor nations will be monetized to raise its own prices (the Quantity Theory of Money), reducing its exports. This price shift is supposed to continue until the debtor country suffering a monetary outflow and austerity is able to export enough to afford to pay its foreign creditors. But the United States did not permit foreign imports to compete with its own producers. And for debtors, the price of monetary austerity was not more competitive export production but economic disruption and chaos. Ricardo’s model and U.S. neoclassical theory was simply an excuse for hard-line creditor policy. Structural adjustments or austerity have been devastating to the economies and governments on which it has been imposed. Austerity reduces productivity and output. In 1944 when Keynes was trying to resist U.S. demand for foreign trade and monetary subservience at the Bretton Woods conference, he proposed the bancor, an intergovernmental balance-of-payments arrangement calling for chronic creditor nations (namely, the United States) to lose their accumulation of financial claims on debtor countries (such as Britain would become). That would be the price to be paid to prevent the international financial order from polarizing the world between creditor and debtor countries. Creditors had to enable debtors to pay, or lose their financial claims for payment. Keynes, as noted above, also emphasized that if creditors want to be paid, they have to import from the debtor countries to provide them with the ability to pay. This was a profoundly moral policy, and it had an additional benefit of making economic sense. It would enable both parties to prosper instead of having one creditor nation prosper while debtor countries succumbed to austerity preventing them from investing in modernizing and developing their economies by raising social spending and living standards. Under Donald Trump the United States is violating that principle. There is no Keynesian bancor-type arrangement in place, but there are the harsh America-first realities of its unipolar diplomacy. If Mexico is to save its economy from being plunged into austerity, price inflation, unemployment and social chaos, it will have to suspend its payments on foreign debts denominated in dollars. The same principle applies to other Global South countries. And if they act together, they have a moral position to create a realistic and even inevitable narrative of the preconditions for any stable international economic order to function. Circumstances thus are forcing the world to break away from the U.S.-centered financial order. The U.S. dollar’s exchange rate is going to soar in the short term as a result of Trump blocking imports with tariffs and trade sanctions. This exchange-rate shift will squeeze foreign countries owing dollar debts in the same way that Mexico and Canada are to be squeezed. To protect themselves, they must suspend dollar debt service. This response to today’s debt overhead is not based on the concept of Odious Debts. It goes beyond the critique that many of these debts and their terms of payment were not in the interest of the countries on which these debts were imposed on in the first place. It goes beyond the criticism that lenders must have some responsibility for judging the ability of their debtors to pay – or suffer financial losses if they have not done so. The political problem of the world’s overhang of dollar debts is that the United States is acting in a way that prevents debtor countries from earning the money to pay foreign debts denominated in US dollars. U.S. policy thus poses a threat to all creditors denominating their debts in dollars, by making these debts practically unpayable without destroying their own economies. The U.S. policy assumption that other countries will not respond to U.S. economic aggression Does Trump really know what he’s doing? Or is his careening policy simply causing collateral damage for other countries? I think that what’s at work is a deep and basic internal contradiction of U.S. policy, similar to that of U.S. diplomacy in the 1920s. When Trump promised his voters that the United States must be the 'winner' in any international trade or financial agreement, he is declaring economic war on the rest of the world. Trump is telling the rest of the world that they must be losers – and accept the fact graciously in payment for the military protection that it provides the world in case Russia might invade Europe or China send its army into Taiwan, Japan or other countries. The fantasy is that Russia would have anything to gain in having to support a collapsing European economy, or that China decides to compete militarily instead of economically. Hubris is at work in this dystopian fantasy. As the world’s hegemon, U.S. diplomacy rarely takes account of how foreign countries will respond. The essence of its hubris is to simplistically assume that countries will passively submit to U.S. actions with no blowback. That has been a realistic assumption for countries like Germany, or those with similar U.S. client politicians in office. But what is happening today is system-wide in character. In 1931 there was finally a moratorium declared on Inter-Ally debts and German reparations. But that was two years after the 1929 stock market crash and the earlier hyperinflations in Germany and France. Along similar lines the 1980s saw Latin American debts written down by Brady bonds. In both cases international finance was the key to the system’s overall political and military breakdown, because the world economy had become self-destructively financialized. Something similar seems inevitable today. Any workable alternative involves creating a new world economic system. U.S. domestic politics is equally unstable. Trump’s America First political theater that got him elected may get his gang unseated as the contradictions and consequences of their operating philosophy are recognized and replaced. His tariff policy will accelerate U.S. price inflation and, even more fatally, cause chaos in U.S. and foreign financial markets. Supply chains will be disrupted, interrupting U.S. exports of everything from aircraft to information technology. And other countries will find themselves obliged to make their economies no longer dependent on U.S. exports or dollar credit. And perhaps in the long-term view this would not be a bad thing. The problem is in the short run as supply chains, trade patterns and dependency are replaced as part of the new geopolitical economic order that U.S. policy is forcing other countries to develop. Trump bases his attempt to tear up the existing linkages and reciprocity of international trade and finance on the assumption that in a chaotic grab-bag, America will come out on top. That confidence underlies his willingness to pull out today’s geopolitical interconnections. He thinks that the U.S. economy is like a cosmic black hole, that is, a center of gravity able to pull all the world’s money and economic surplus to itself. That is the explicit aim of America First. That is what makes Trump’s program a declaration of economic war on the rest of the world. There is no longer a promise that the economic order sponsored by U.S. diplomacy will make other countries prosperous. The gains from trade and foreign investment are to be sent to and concentrated in America . The problem goes beyond Trump. He is simply following what already has been implicit in U.S. policy since 1945. America’s self-image is that it is the only economy in the world that can be thoroughly self-sufficient economically. It produces its own energy, and also its own food, and supplies these basic needs to other countries or has the ability to turn off the spigot. Most important, the United States is the only economy without the financial constraints that constrain other countries. America’s debt is in its own currency, and there has been no limit on its ability to spend beyond its means by flooding the world with excess dollars, which other countries accept as their monetary reserves as if the dollar is still as good as gold. And underneath it all is the assumption that almost with a flick of the switch, the United States can become as industrially self-sufficient as it was in 1945. America is the world’s Blanche duBois in Tennessee Williams’ Streetcar Named Desire, living in the past while not aging well. The American Empire’s self-serving neoliberal narrative To obtain foreign acquiescence in accepting an empire and living peacefully in it requires a soothing narrative to depict the empire as pulling everyone ahead. The aim is to distract other countries from resisting a system that actually is exploitative. First Britain and then the United States promoted the ideology of free-trade imperialism after their mercantilist and protectionist policies had given them a cost advantage over other countries, turning these countries into commercial and financial satellites. Trump has pulled away this ideological curtain. Partly this is simply in recognition that it no longer can be maintained in the face of US/NATO foreign policy and its military and economic war against Russia and sanctions against trade with China, Russia, Iran and other BRICS members. It would be madness for other countries not to reject this system, now that its empowering narrative is false for all to see. The question is, how will they be able to put themselves in a position to create an alternative world order? What is the likely trajectory? Countries like Mexico really don’t have much of a choice but to go it alone. Canada may succumb, letting its exchange rate fall and its domestic prices rise as its imports are denominated in 'hard currency' dollars. But many Global South countries are in the same balance-of-payments squeeze as Mexico. And unless they have client elites like Argentina – its elite being themselves major holders of Argentina’s dollar bonds – their political leaders will have to stop debt payments or suffer domestic austerity (deflation of the local economy) coupled with inflation of import prices as the exchange rates for their currencies buckle under the strains imposed by a rising U.S. dollar. They will have to suspend debt service or else be voted out of office. Not many leading politicians have the leeway that Germany’s Annalena Baerbock has of saying that her Green Party does not have to listen to what German voters say they want. Global South oligarchies may rely on U.S. support, but Germany is certainly an outlier when it comes to being willing to commit economic suicide out of loyalty to U.S. foreign policy without limit. Suspending debt service is less destructive than continuing to succumb to the Trump-based America First order. What blocks that policy is political, along with a centrist fear of embarking on the major policy change necessary to avoid economic polarization and austerity. Europe seems afraid to use the option of simply calling Trump’s bluff, despite its being an empty threat that would be blocked by America’s own vested interests among the Doner Class. Trump has stated that if it does not agree to spend 5% of its GDP on military arms (largely from the United States) and buy more US liquid natural gas (LNG) energy, he will impose tariffs of 20% on countries that resist. But if European leaders do not resist, the euro will fall perhaps by 10 or 20 percent. Domestic prices will rise, and national budgets will have to cut back social spending programs such as support for families to buy more expensive gas or electricity to heat and power their homes. America’s neoliberal leaders welcome this class-war phase of U.S. demands on foreign governments. U.S. diplomacy has been active in crippling the political leadership of former labor and social democratic parties in Europe and other countries so thoroughly that it no longer seems matter what voters want. That is what America’s National Endowment Democracy is for, along with its mainstream media ownership and narrative. But what is being shaken up is not merely America’s unipolar dominance of the West and its sphere of influence, but the worldwide structure of international trade and financial relations – and inevitably, military relations and alliances as well.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfW2aBVAignfcTDTckSHFkp	2025-01-27T17:26:10-08:00	
Urban Farms Take Root In Singapore’s Race For More Food Self-Suff...	By Paul Teng Singapore’s ambitious bid to revolutionise food security has turned it into a living experiment in high-tech urban farming and novel food production. From lab-grown chicken to indoor vegetable farms, the city-state’s efforts have captured global attention. But with rising costs, delayed ventures and questions about economic viability, the goal of a higher level of self-sufficiency remains uncertain. Small city-states like Singapore often lack the natural resources to grow enough food to meet demand. While Singapore historically has had some level of agriculture in its peri-urban areas — mainly producing Asian leafy greens, eggs, fish and fruits — over 90 per cent of its food is imported from over 170 countries. In the 1980s, a game-changing decision was made to aggregate all farming into six agrotech parks and several aquazones in the coastal waters of its many islands. The rationale was that agriculture is a lower value-generating economic activity than sectors like banking, finance and tourism, which could increase GDP overall and per household. This decision was largely successful, with Singapore having one of the highest household incomes in Asia and a low per cent of household income spent on food — less than 10 per cent — which gave a false sense of food security. This complacency was further reinforced by external ratings which have ranked Singapore as the most food-secure country in the world for several years. But supply chain disruptions due to war and geopolitical tensions, climate change and natural disasters forced a re-think of Singapore’s approach to assure food security around the turn of the century. While Singapore generally has accepted the Food and Agriculture Organization’s definition of food security, it has also defined its own pragmatic approach to food security. The country embarked on an aspirational goal in 2019 — the ‘30 by 30’ — to produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. In retrospect, this focus on achieving nutrition security instead of food security through technological innovations aligns more with concerns about having food resilience to deal with periods of import disruptions. Prior to 2019, it had invested to incentivise existing farms to adopt efficiency-enhancing technologies, mainly in vegetable-growing and aquaculture. But in 2019, a slew of initiatives were launched on top of 30 by 30 — the most visible being the Singapore Food Story, now in its third phase with over S$300 million (US$219 million) in government funding. In the post-2019 era, goals were set to increase self-production levels of finfish and eggs, respectively at 15 per cent and 30 per cent of demand, and inject a new element of novel protein into the food system. Collectively, all these initiatives aimed to support the scaling up of technology-enabled food production, to meet the 30 by 30 nutrition target and older production targets for fish, vegetables and eggs. The most note-worthy innovation was indoor controlled-environment high tech vegetable farming, which rapidly scaled up in numbers. At the same time, to ensure that novel food regulations and approvals such as those for lab-cultivated chicken were science-backed, the entity ‘FRESH’ was established. The main goal of these initiatives was to reduce Singapore’s imports — increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability. But the country also had aspirations to become a major hub for agrifood innovations, aiming to export these to the rest of Asia and create another driver for economic expansion. Despite these efforts, the self-production levels of vegetables and seafood have declined since 30 by 30 was implemented. Several new urban farming ventures have further been delayed or cancelled, perhaps reflecting the ‘funding winter’ that has been experienced even in larger countries. Investors in the Singapore high tech urban farm ecosystem had likely not reckoned with the economic considerations of sustainable growth. Indoor controlled-environment farms for vegetables and fish require high capital and operating expenditure, resulting in a high cost-per-unit for produce. This poses a paradox between the cheap and affordable goods that governments want and the high net margins that entrepreneurs want. Singapore’s indoor farms showed that it was not possible to produce Asian leafy greens at a price competitive with imports from neighbours like Malaysia and Indonesia. The response by these farms was then to grow higher-value vegetables and fish, failing to meet the food security needs of mass consumers. For novel foods such as plant-based proteins and cultivated meat, current technology is not able to produce at acceptable price points. The question remains as to whether the Singapore model is replicable by other small states or scalable to achieve a high level of food self-sufficiency. Singapore has three main sources to make food available — imports, domestic self-production and overseas production. Small island states like Singapore, while aspiring to achieve more self-reliance, will need to explicitly recognise the role of imports — and supply chain openness — at the outset. Production costs will inevitably have to be weighed against the willingness of consumers to pay more for local produce — consumer acceptance cannot be assumed. At a macro-level, government support for infrastructure should also be considered. Looking forward, urban farming is likely to remain a niche activity at best, albeit with potential to complement increased demands for specialty food and provide some resilience in times of disrupted supplies.

Should Inflation Be Defined Only As Price Increases? – OpEd	By Frank Shostak If inflation is a general increase in prices, as most experts hold, then why is it regarded as bad news? What kind of damage does it do? Most experts are of the view that inflation causes speculative buying, which generates waste. Inflation, it is maintained, also erodes the real incomes of low-income earners and causes a misallocation of resources. Inflation weakens real economic growth. Why should a general rise in prices hurt some groups of people and not others? Why should a general rise in prices weaken real economic growth? Or how does inflation lead to the misallocation of resources? The popular definition of inflation as a general increase in prices is questionable. In order to ascertain what inflation is all about, we must go back in time when this phenomenon emerged. Historically, inflation occurred when a country’s ruler, such as a king, would force his citizens to give him all their gold coins under the pretext that a new gold coin was going to replace the old one. In the process of minting new coins, the king would reduce the amount of gold contained in each coin and return lighter gold coins to citizens. Because of the reduced weight of gold coins that were returned to citizens, the ruler was able to generate extra coins that were employed to pay for his expenses. What was passing as a gold coin of a fixed weight was a lighter gold coin. Rothbard wrote, More characteristically, the mint melted and recoined all the coins of the realm, giving the subjects back the same number of 'pounds' or 'marks,' but of a lighter weight. The leftover ounces of gold or silver were pocketed by the king and used to pay his expenses. The extra gold coins that the ruler was able to generate enabled him to channel wealth from the citizens to himself. All other things being equal, we now have more coins relative to goods, causing higher prices. Hence, the dilution of gold coins resulted in higher goods prices. The inflation of gold coins sets in motion the diversion of goods from citizens to the king and others close to power (i.e. from wealth-producers to non-wealth-producers). In the modern world, money proper is no longer gold coins, but metallic coins, paper notes in circulation known as cash, and often digital transactions between accounts (e.g., debit cards). Hence, inflation, in this case, is an increase in the supply of fiat currency. Also, observe that increases in cash sets an exchange of nothing for something—a similar effect that was produced by the king’s dilution of gold coins. It follows then that the subject matter of inflation is not a general rise in prices, but artificial increases in the money supply (and higher prices are usually the consequence). Increases in money supply set in motion the misallocation of resources and undermine the wealth-generation process. According to Mises, Inflation, as this term was always used everywhere and especially in this country, means increasing the quantity of money and bank notes in circulation and the quantity of bank deposits subject to check. But people today use the term 'inflation' to refer to the phenomenon that is an inevitable consequence of inflation, that is the tendency of all prices and wage rates to rise. The result of this deplorable confusion is that there is no term left to signify the cause of this rise in prices and wages. There is no longer any word available to signify the phenomenon that has been, up to now, called inflation. Furthermore, once money is injected, there are always early receivers of money and the late receivers. Because of the time lag between money supply changes and changes in prices of goods, the early receivers of money are the greatest beneficiaries since the prices of goods they purchase have not increased yet. The late receivers of money are likely to face increases in prices and economic impoverishment. The early receivers of the newly-printed money benefit at the expense of the late receivers. Or the early receivers divert goods to themselves from the late receivers. As a rule, low-income individuals are usually part of the late receivers, hence, they suffer the most as a result of monetary inflation. It is extraordinary that, in attempting to explain movements in prices, various commentators have nothing to say about the role of money and monetary policy in forming the prices of goods. After all, a monetary price of a good expresses the amount of money exchanged for it (i.e., dollars paid per unit of something). Friedman’s Expected versus Unexpected Inflation Some economists, such as Milton Friedman, maintain that if inflation is 'expected' by producers and consumers, then it produces very little damage (see Friedman’s Dollars and Deficits, pp. 47-48). The problem, according to Friedman, is with unexpected inflation, which causes a misallocation of resources and weakens the economy. For Friedman, inflation is a general increase in prices. According to Friedman, if a general rise in prices can be stabilized by means of a fixed rate of monetary injections, individuals will adjust their conduct accordingly. Consequently, expected general price increases—which Friedman labels as expected 'inflation'—will be harmless, with no real effect. For Friedman, bad side effects are not caused by inflationary increases in the money supply, but by the outcome of that policy: increases in prices. Friedman regards money supply as a policy tool that can stabilize general increases in prices and thereby promote real economic growth. According to this way of thinking, all that is required is fixing the rate of money growth, and the rest will follow suit. What is overlooked, however, is that fixing the money supply’s rate of growth so that it is predictable does not alter the fact that money supply continues to artificially expand. This, in turn, means that it will continue the diversion of resources from wealth-producers to non-wealth-producers, even if prices of goods will stay stable. Is it possible to establish the 'average price' of goods? Despite its popularity, the whole idea of a consumer price index (CPI) is questionable. It is based on a view that it is possible to establish an average of the prices of goods and services. While it is certainly possible to look at the prices of a good within a range of time and come up with a mathematical price average, there is really no such thing as an 'average price.' The absurdity of this can be seen in comparing prices of heterogeneous goods. Suppose two transactions are conducted. In the first transaction, one loaf of bread is exchanged for $2. In the second transaction, one gallon of milk is exchanged for $1. The price—or the rate of exchange—in the first transaction is $2 per one loaf of bread. The price in the second transaction is $1 per one gallon of milk. In order to calculate the average price, we must add these two ratios and divide them by two, however, it is conceptually meaningless to add $2/one loaf of bread to $1/one liter of milk. On this Rothbard wrote, Thus, any concept of average price level involves adding or multiplying quantities of completely different units of goods, such as butter, hats, sugar, etc., and is therefore meaningless and illegitimate. Even pounds of sugar and pounds of butter cannot be added together, because they are two different goods and their valuation is completely different. Reconciling Strong Monetary Inflation with Moderate Price Increases If there is an artificial increase of the money supply—alongside real economic production and growth—then prices may not necessarily increase following inflation. If one were to hold the definition that inflation is a general increase in prices, one would conclude that—despite an artificial increase in money supply—'inflation' could be 0 percent. However, if we were to follow the definition that inflation is about artificial increases in the money supply, then we would come to a completely different conclusion. For example, we can see how a faulty definition of inflation in the lead-up to the Great Depression contributed to this problem. If we were to pay attention to the so-called 'price level,' as many economists did during that era, and if we disregard inflationary increases in the money supply, we would reach misleading conclusions regarding the state of the economy. Rothbard wrote, The fact that general prices were more or less stable during the 1920s told most economists that there was no inflationary threat, and therefore the events of the great depression caught them completely unaware. Conclusion Regardless of how the symptoms of inflation are displayed (e.g., price increases, boom-bust cycles), what matters are the artificial increases in money supply, which is what inflation is. These increases set in motion the exchange of nothing for something and distort the structure of production. Therefore, policies aimed at fixing the symptoms of inflation are making things much worse. About the author: Frank Shostak is an Associated Scholar of the Mises Institute.

Bureaucrats Ordered To Go Back To Work – OpEd	The offices where Washington D.C.’s bureaucrats work were largely empty on Monday, January 20, 2025, as Donald Trump was inaugurated as U.S. President for the second time. But they weren’t empty for the inauguration. Because that Monday coincided with the Martin Luther King Jr. Day federal holiday, most U.S. government employees had a paid day off work. But then, many of the federal government’s buildings continued to sit empty on Tuesday, January 21, and again on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Truth be told, many of the office buildings that occupy prime real estate in the District of Columbia have sat mostly empty for nearly five years now. They emptied with the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Federal bureaucrats exploited advances in computing technology that allowed them to work from home during the national emergency. During that time, the bureaucrats discovered they greatly liked working from home. So much so that even after President Biden declared the pandemic a national emergency on April 11, 2023, they kept doing it. It’s become quite a popular perk among the ranks of the U.S. government’s civilian employees. A Popular and Costly Perk Senator Joni Ernst issued a report on the cost to taxpayers of the bureaucrats’ latest addition to their benefits. Here are some excerpts of her report with its major takeaways: Just three percent of the federal workforce teleworked on a daily basis before the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, the temporary pandemic-era practice is a presumed public employee perk. Six percent report in-person on a full-time basis while nearly a third of the government workforce is entirely remote. Some bureaucrats are padding their paychecks by claiming to be working in areas with higher pay rates while actually living elsewhere. My audits are finding as many as 23 to 68 percent of teleworking employees for some agencies are boosting their salaries by receiving incorrect locality pay. Billions of dollars are being spent heating, cooling, and maintaining largely empty buildings. Billions more is being wasted on new office furniture. Meanwhile, getting rid of just 23 of the government’s many underutilized buildings and properties will save taxpayers more than $1 billion. This is a small fraction of potential savings if other unused space was sold off. What Whistleblowers Are Saying Ernst included several anecdotes from whistleblowers to accompany her findings. Here’s one for the U.S. Department of Agriculture: A whistleblower who is a current supervisor within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) informs me 'the vast majority of USDA employees are not working in person. On the occasions I have gone to USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C., it resembles a ghost town. Hallways are mostly empty, and offices are unoccupied.' This whistleblower says, 'remote work and telework employees are often unreachable and do not respond to simple email questions for hours. This leads to inefficiency in completing tasks in a timely manner and to delays in clearing documents and reports due to the inability to reach colleagues.' Here’s another from a government employee who requested anonymity because they are among the very few showing up at the office: A federal employee who wished to remain anonymous says 'he is one of few who reports to the Washington, D.C., office, and contractors have commented to him about the whereabouts of agency employees.' He observes, 'it’s all empty around me. I’m the only person within three rows where I sit. It doesn’t look good.' Here’s a final note about the Department of Veterans Affairs, highlighting a bureaucrat behaving poorly: When a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) manager posted a picture of himself 'working' from a bubble bath on social media, his frustrated coworkers became whistleblowers. One of which stated, 'If you think that this is not a big deal then what is a big deal? Is it a big deal when a veteran dies?' That’s right, the employees of the agency turned in their own manager for abusing telework. To Americans who work in the real world, it’s obvious the bureaucrats’ continuing absence from the office cannot be sustained. It’s no accident that one of President Trump’s first-day executive orders was directed at teleworking bureaucrats. On January 23, the government’s Office of Personnel Management ordered all federal agencies to comply with that executive order within 30 days. By then, it will have been nearly five full years since federal bureaucrats last reported to work at their offices.

US Puts Mexican Drug Cartels In Its Sights – OpEd	By Dalia Al-Aqidi For the first time, the US could soon officially designate Mexican drug cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations. This historic move would mark a pivotal shift in how America addresses the violence and chaos caused by these criminal groups. It would raise critical questions about the implications for combating the cartels, enhancing international cooperation and understanding their ties to global terrorist organizations. By labeling these cartels as terrorist groups, Washington would be acknowledging the severity of their actions, which extend far beyond traditional organized crime. In one of his first actions back in office, President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order that moves the US government toward this designation. The order instructs the State Department to recommend, within 14 days, whether to go ahead. Mexican cartels have long plagued both their home country and the US with their brutality, corruption and drug trafficking operations. Their activities destabilize governments, fuel violence and undermine the rule of law. By designating cartels as terrorist organizations, Washington would be treating their actions as national security threats rather than mere criminal offenses. This classification would give law enforcement agencies greater authority to act decisively, including freezing cartel assets, denying their members entry to the country and imposing harsher penalties on those who aid or collaborate with them. Such measures are vital for dismantling the vast, complex networks that allow cartels to operate with impunity. Drug cartels are more than organized criminal groups; in many regions of Mexico, they function as quasi-governments. Through violence, intimidation and corruption, they control entire communities, operating as shadow states. They assassinate politicians, bribe officials and terrorize civilians. Cartels are the primary providers of jobs, security and even social services in some areas, creating a dependency that entrenches their power. This system mirrors the tactics of traditional terrorist organizations, making their designation as such both logical and overdue. The classification of cartels as terrorist groups would also draw attention to their troubling connections with global terrorism. One notable example is the relationship between some Colombian drug cartels and Hezbollah, a terrorist organization based in Lebanon. Hezbollah has long been involved in drug trafficking to fund its operations, with its influence extending into Latin America. In countries such as Venezuela and Colombia, Hezbollah has collaborated with cartels to smuggle drugs, launder money and facilitate illegal arms trades. These partnerships create a dangerous nexus between organized crime and global terrorism, where profits from drug sales in the US and Europe finance terrorist activities in the Middle East and beyond. The collaboration between cartels and terrorist organizations highlights their shared reliance on violence, corruption and exploitation to achieve their goals. Both use fear to maintain control, target vulnerable populations and weaken governments. The vast resources and networks controlled by cartels make them valuable allies for terrorist groups looking to expand their influence in the Western Hemisphere. Ignoring these connections would be a grave mistake, as it would allow these criminal and terrorist enterprises to grow unchecked. Examples from recent years demonstrate how cartels have facilitated the entry of individuals with suspected ties to terrorist organizations into the US. On May 3, 2024, two men driving a box truck arrived at the Quantico Marine Corps Base gate, claiming to be Amazon delivery drivers. They tried to force their way into the base. Investigations revealed that one of the men had illegally crossed the border from Mexico, entering California just weeks earlier. In July last year, Border Patrol agents in the San Diego sector detained three Palestinians who had crossed the southern border illegally. These individuals were suspected of having connections to terrorist organizations, raising significant security concerns. Also last year, federal investigators apprehended eight Tajikistani nationals in Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia. They were alleged to have ties to Daesh’s Khorasan Province and had also entered the US illegally via the southern border. Their arrests came just months after FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that human smuggling operations at the US-Mexico border were being exploited to bring individuals with suspected links to terror groups into the country. This decision would also recognize the immense human suffering caused by cartels. Their reign of terror includes car bombings, mass executions and beheadings. Women and children are often the most vulnerable victims, subjected to abduction, exploitation and murder. The parallels between cartels and radical terrorist groups are striking. In both cases, young men from impoverished areas are lured into these organizations with promises of wealth, power and a sense of belonging. For these recruits, the cartels offer an escape from poverty, even as they perpetuate cycles of violence and despair. In America, the impact of cartel violence is deeply felt through the ongoing opioid crisis. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid produced with precursor chemicals sourced in China and manufactured by Mexican cartels, has flooded American communities. It is alarmingly easy to access and has caused tens of thousands of deaths each year. If the designation goes ahead, authorities will be able to more effectively target the networks responsible for trafficking fentanyl and other deadly drugs, saving countless lives. Narco-culture has also become ingrained in society, influencing music, fashion and religious practices. This glamorization of cartel life, often perpetuated by the music and film industry, along with TV shows, creates a dangerous cycle in which young people view cartel membership as a path to success. These cultural shifts strengthen the cartels’ grip on society, making it even harder for governments to fight their influence. While the decision to designate cartels as terrorist organizations would be a strong statement, it would not be without its challenges. Critics argue that this move could strain US-Mexican relations, as Mexico may perceive it as an infringement on its sovereignty. There are also concerns about unintended consequences, such as increased violence if the cartels retaliate or further destabilization of the Mexican economy. Moreover, combating cartels requires more than military or law enforcement action. Addressing the root causes of cartel power — poverty, corruption and weak institutions — is essential for lasting change. Without investments in education, economic opportunities and governance reform, efforts to dismantle cartels may only provide temporary relief. The US’ move to label cartels as terrorist organizations should serve as a wake-up call to other countries. The influence of cartels is not limited to America and Mexico — their reach extends across the Americas and into Europe and Asia. If left unchecked, their operations could further destabilize regions, fuel global drug crises and strengthen their ties to terrorist organizations. Countries in the Global South, in particular, must recognize the threat cartels pose to their stability and take measures to combat their influence.

Saudi Arabia: Foreigners Can Now Invest In Makkah, Madinah Proper...	By Nirmal Narayanan Foreigners can now invest in Saudi-listed companies owning real estate in Makkah and Madinah, following a landmark decision by the Saudi Capital Market Authority. Effective immediately, the move aims to boost the capital market’s competitiveness and align with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 economic diversification objectives, the CMA announced in a press release. While non-Saudis are allowed to purchase properties in the Kingdom, there are specific restrictions, and in the holy cities ownership is generally limited to Saudi nationals — although foreigners are allowed to lease properties there. Under the new guidelines, foreign investments are limited to shares or convertible debt instruments of listed companies. Total non-Saudi ownership, including individuals and legal entities, is capped at 49 percent of a company’s shares. However, strategic foreign investors are prohibited from holding stakes in these companies. The move comes amid reforms across the region, with most neighboring countries allowing foreigners to own properties, primarily in free zones or designated areas under certain restrictions. 'Through this announcement, the Capital Market Authority aims to stimulate investment, enhance the attractiveness and efficiency of the capital market, and strengthen its regional and international competitiveness while supporting the local economy,' said the CMA. The changes are also designed to stimulate foreign direct investment in the Kingdom’s capital market, as well as bolster its regional and international competitiveness. 'This includes attracting foreign capital and providing the necessary liquidity for current and future projects in Makkah and Madinah through the investment products available in the Saudi market, positioning it as a key funding source for these distinctive developmental projects,' added the CMA. Strengthening the real estate sector and attracting more FDI into the Kingdom is one of the key goals outlined under the Vision 2030 program, as Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its dependence on crude revenues and diversify its economy. The Kingdom aims to attract $100 billion in FDI by the end of this decade, and the government body has been implementing various initiatives and reforms to enhance the attractiveness of the capital market. Some of these efforts include allowing foreign residents to directly invest in the stock market, enabling non-Saudi investors to access the market through swap agreements, and permitting qualified foreign capital institutions to invest in listed securities. The CMA has also allowed foreign strategic investors to acquire strategic stakes in listed companies and directly invest in debt instruments. In 2021, the CMA also allowed non-Saudis to subscribe to real estate funds investing within the boundaries of Makkah and Madinah, which played a crucial role in increasing the attractiveness of the capital market to both regional and international investors. The share prices of real estate companies listed on Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange surged following the CMA’s announcement. Knowledge Economic City saw its share price rise by 9.89 percent to close at SR16.66 ($4.44). Jabal Omar Development Co.’s share price also increased by 10 percent to SR25.85, while Makkah Construction and Development Co.’s stock price climbed 9.84 percent to close at SR106.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE9RqtMYQUKne	2025-01-27T16:20:50-08:00	
China’s DeepSeek AI Tops App Charts In US, Europe	By Luisetta Mudie China’s homegrown open-source artificial intelligence model DeepSeek topped app charts in the United States and Europe on Monday, beating out U.S.-based rival ChatGPT for the most popular free app on Apple’s App Store, in what some commentators saw as a potential challenge to American dominance in the sector. The app’s emergence has roiled financial markets, hitting tech shares and causing the Nasdaq to fall more than 2% in Monday trading. It comes after OpenAI, which is behind the generative AI service ChatGPT, suspended services to China, Hong Kong and Macau last July amid ongoing technology wars between the United States and China. According to the state-backed China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, there are now 1,328 AI large language models in the world, 36% of which were developed in China, placing the country second only to the United States. DeepSeek offers a user interface much like its rivals, but, like other Chinese-developed AI, remains subject to government censorship. It likely won’t be engaging in any kind of discussion about the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen massacre, for example, or engaging in debate about whether democratic Taiwan has a right to run its own affairs. And there were some emerging technical glitches on Monday too, as repeated attempts to log into the app using Google were unsuccessful. The company said it was 'investigating' why only users with a mainland Chinese mobile phone number could currently access the service. Building artificial general intelligence Developed by Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence, the app uses an R1 reasoning model, which makes it slightly slower than its competitors, but means it delivers a step-by-step breakdown showing how it arrived at its answers, according to media reports. Founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, an alumnus of Zhejiang University with a background in information and electronic engineering, the venture was backed by the High-Flyer hedge fund also founded by Liang a decade earlier, according to a Jan. 24 report in MIT’s Technology Review journal. It said Liang’s ultimate goal is to build artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a form of AI that can match or even beat humans on a range of tasks. According to the article, there was a direct link between High-Flyer’s decision to venture into AI and current U.S. bans on the export of high-end semiconductor chips to China, and that Liang has a 'substantial stockpile' of Nvidia A100 chips that are no longer available to China, which he used to develop DeepSeek. While the DeepSeek app experienced a partial outage after shooting to the top of the charts on Monday, its rapid rise had already 'wobbled' investors' faith in the profitability of AI and the sector’s voracious demand for high-tech chips,' Reuters reported on Monday, adding that European Nasdaq futures and Japanese tech shares had fallen on the back of the news. 'It’s a case of a crowded trade, and now DeepSeek is giving a reason for investors and traders to unwind,' the agency quoted Wong Kok Hoong, head of equity sales trading at Maybank, as saying. ‘AI’s Sputnik moment' While little is known about the details of DeepSeek’s development and the hardware it uses, the model has spooked investors in what venture capitalist Marc Andreessen described on X on Sunday as 'AI’s Sputnik moment,' in a reference to the former Soviet Union’s surprise 1957 launch of its Sputnik satellite that triggered a space race with the United States. 'The idea that the most cutting-edge technologies in America, like Nvida and ChatGPT, are the most superior globally, there’s concern that this perspective might start to change,' Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management, told Reuters on Monday, adding: 'I think it might be a bit premature.' But Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta, said the real story wasn’t about rivalry between two superpowers. 'To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think: ‘China is surpassing the US in AI,’ you are reading this wrong,' Yann wrote in a Jan. 25 LinkedIn post. Instead, the emergence of DeepSeek means that 'open source models are surpassing proprietary ones,' he said. He said DeepSeek profited from open research and open source tools like PyTorch and Llama from Meta, then 'came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people’s work.' 'Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it,' he said. 'That is the power of open research and open source.' Privacy concerns Like TikTok, which is currently waiting to hear its fate under the Trump administration, DeepSeek is likely to raise privacy concerns, given its location under the jurisdiction of the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Its privacy policy warns users that it collects user information like date of birth, username, email address or phone number and password. Like other models, it also remembers what you ask it to do. 'When you use our Services, we may collect your text or audio input, prompt, uploaded files, feedback, chat history, or other content that you provide,' according to the policy, which was last updated on Dec. 5, 2024. It also remembers your IP address, your device model and operating system and system language. And while it doesn’t store that data alongside your name, like TikTok, the app records each user’s highly individual 'keystroke patterns or rhythms.' That information is used to protect accounts from 'fraud' and other illegal activity. Similar phrasing has sparked concerns over the use of user data by TikTok, although the company has dismissed such concerns as unfounded. The company may also use user data to allow it to 'comply with our legal obligations, or as necessary to perform tasks in the public interest,' the policy states, without specifying what 'the public interest' might mean. 'We store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People’s Republic of China,' the Policy states, meaning that such data could be used by the Chinese government if it saw fit.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFEyZ3E-WPVm29	2025-01-27T16:17:25-08:00	
US, Colombia Reach Migrant Deportation Deal After Tariff Threats	By Ken Bredemeier The White House announced late Sunday the United States was backing off a series of retaliatory measures levied against Colombia, saying the two countries had reached an agreement on U.S. flights sending Colombian migrants back home. A White House statement said the two countries agreed Colombia would accept its migrants without restriction, including having them sent back on U.S. military aircraft. Colombian President Gustavo Petro had earlier rejected two U.S. military planes and said he would only accept migrants when the U.S. treated them with dignity, including using civilian planes for deportations. The White House also said it would hold new tariffs and sanctions against Colombia 'in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement.' State Department visa sanctions against several Colombian officials, as well as enhanced customs inspections would remain in place until the first planeload of Colombian migrants lands in Colombia, the White House said. Colombia’s Foreign Ministry said late Sunday it had overcome the impasse with the United States, and that Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo and Colombian Ambassador to the U.S. Dnaiel García-Peña were traveling to Washington for high-level meetings to follow up on the agreement. Colombia said it would welcome its people home and would guarantee them decent conditions as citizens with rights. The statements reversed a fast-evolving series of escalatory statements from the leaders of the two countries, which featured U.S. President Donald Trump announcing an immediate 25% tariff on Colombian goods, which would rise to 50% in a week, and the suspension of visa processing at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota. Petro announced a 25% tariff on U.S. goods in return, saying the United States 'will never rule us.' 'A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,' Petro said. 'That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants. ... In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.' Colombia is America's third-largest trading partner in Latin America. The row came about after U.S. authorities began arresting hundreds of undocumented migrants per day and sending them back to their home countries, carrying out Trump’s 2024 campaign pledge to deport masses of migrants who have illegally entered the United States. 'We’re going to enforce immigration laws,' Vice President JD Vance told CBS News’ 'Face the Nation' on Sunday. More than 1,000 migrants were arrested with hundreds repatriated to other countries, including Guatemala last week, during the first days of the new Trump administration, according to figures compiled by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the White House. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said it made 956 arrest nationwide Sunday. It did not specify how many were part of an operation focused in the Chicago area that was witnessed by several top Trump administration officials, including 'border czar' Tom Homan. ICE said in a statement it worked with other federal agencies to conduct 'enhanced targeted operations today in Chicago to enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities.' Homan told ABC’s 'This Week' show Sunday, 'There will be more arrests nationwide.' Trump authorized sending 1,500 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Homan said, 'You’ll see the numbers increase. They’re down there to create a secure border.' He said the U.S. is deporting 'as many as we can' arrest, with the focus first on those convicted of U.S. crimes and then moving on to detain and deport those whose asylum requests have been rejected by U.S. officials. 'We’re in the beginning stages,' Homan said. About 11 million undocumented migrants are believed to be living in the U.S., a staggering number that most officials believe will be impossible to deport. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, urged his Republican colleagues in Congress to authorize more spending for the deportation effort. 'We haven't given the Trump team the resources,' Graham said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press' show. He said Homan 'needs to substantially hire more [immigration] agents. He needs to finish the [border] wall [with Mexico] and technology. He needs to go from 41,000 detention beds to 150,000 detention beds to make this work.' 'So, to my Republican colleagues, particularly in the House [of Representatives], as we fiddle, our immigration plans are hitting walls. We're not building walls, we're hitting walls. We need to give Tom Homan the money now to execute the plan that he's come up with. And without congressional funding this is going to hit a wall,' Graham declared. The Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants waiting in Mexico to request asylum through a mobile app, but Trump’s anti-immigration edicts are facing legal challenges. One judge has already temporarily blocked Trump from declaring that he no longer recognizes constitutionally guaranteed citizenship for children of undocumented migrants born in the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE5fWsUn5Wh87	2025-01-27T16:13:52-08:00	
Brazil To Seek Explanation From US On Deportee Treatment	By Andreia Verdelio Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced it will request an explanation from the US government regarding the 'degrading treatment' of 88 Brazilian citizens deported last Friday (Jan. 24). The deportees arrived at Manaus Airport in Amazonas, where the Brazilian Federal Police discovered that they had been transported in handcuffs and chains. 'The indiscriminate use of handcuffs and chains violates the terms of the agreement with the US, which mandates the dignified, respectful, and humane treatment of returnees,' the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated. The ministry also emphasized that it 'remains vigilant' regarding changes in US migration policies to ensure the 'protection, safety, and dignity of Brazilians living there.' 'The Brazilian government considers it unacceptable that the conditions agreed upon with the US government are not being upheld. Since 2018, Brazil has agreed to facilitate repatriation flights to reduce the time its nationals spend in US detention centers due to irregular immigration and lack of appeal options,' the statement added. Citing national sovereignty, the Brazilian government ordered the removal of the handcuffs and dispatched a Brazilian Air Force aircraft to transport the Brazilians to their final destination. The American aircraft, en route to Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais state, was forced to make an emergency landing in Manaus, located in northern Brazil, due to technical issues. 'The Brazilian authorities denied authorization for the charter flight to Belo Horizonte due to the use of handcuffs and chains, the poor condition of the aircraft—including a malfunctioning air conditioning system—and other issues. Additionally, the 88 nationals on board expressed outrage over the undignified treatment they received,' the ministry's note states. On Saturday (25), Minister of Foreign Affairs Mauro Vieira met in Manaus with representatives from the Federal Police and the Brazilian Air Force to receive a detailed report on the incidents involving Brazilian citizens deported on a US government flight. 'The meeting will serve as the basis for a formal request for explanations from the US government regarding the degrading treatment experienced by the passengers,' the ministry stated in a release. The Brazilian Air Force plane transporting Brazilians deported from the United States arrived in Minas Gerais on Saturday night (25).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE025WNqBfx9-	2025-01-27T16:10:31-08:00	
Iran At A Crossroads: Reviving Mehr For Regional Peace And Prospe...	Iran stands at a critical juncture, grappling with decades of authoritarian mismanagement, economic collapse, and failed regional ambitions. Following defeats in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, the regime faces geopolitical isolation, economic devastation, and social fragmentation. However, history shows that moments of profound crisis often create opportunities for transformative change. I. Iran’s Current Crisis Domestic Challenges Iran’s dual governance system, dominated by clerical elites and the Revolutionary Guard, has fostered corruption and inefficiency. Over 70% of the population lives below the poverty line, and youth unemployment has driven a mass exodus of skilled professionals (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2024). Decades of economic mismanagement and inflation have exacerbated these challenges, leaving Iran’s economy in dire straits. Regional Isolation Iran’s overextension in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen has drained its financial and human resources while eroding its regional credibility. Vali Nasr observes, 'Iran overreached in its ambitions, losing both credibility and leverage' (The Shia Revival, 2006). These failures underscore the need for Iran to pivot toward regional cooperation and integration. II. A Framework for Regional Cooperation Rather than relying on external powers, Iran has an opportunity to foster a regional framework of collaboration modeled on the European Union’s economic and political integration principles. The Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and potentially Saudi Arabia, provide a blueprint for regional cooperation that prioritizes economic development over hostility. Economic Integration By leveraging its strategic location and natural resources, Iran can facilitate trade and energy transit across West Asia and North Africa (WANA). Establishing free trade zones and regional economic agreements would create interdependence, reducing the likelihood of conflict and fostering shared prosperity. Inclusive Governance and Collaboration A regional council akin to the European Union’s institutional structure could serve as a platform for addressing security, development, and governance challenges. This council would promote the following: Collaborative policymaking on trade, climate change, and infrastructure. Multilateral agreements to rebuild war-torn nations like Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Mechanisms to mediate disputes and foster peace. Cultural and Educational Exchange Reviving cultural diplomacy through academic and artistic collaboration would strengthen regional bonds. Programs focused on shared heritage, such as preserving historical sites and cross-border educational initiatives, could foster a sense of unity and mutual respect. Dr. Dariush Shayegan’s insight encapsulates the essence of this approach: 'Iran’s spiritual and cultural depth has always allowed it to transcend its immediate crises. By returning to its roots in compassion and unity, Iran can redefine its destiny and that of the region' (Cultural Schizophrenia: Islamic Societies Confronting the West, 1992). III. Reviving Mehr: A Political and Economic Vision Iran’s cultural and political history offers a blueprint for transformation, rooted in the ancient Persian principle of Mehr—compassion, unity, and justice. Leaders like Cyrus the Great and Abu Muslim exemplified governance based on inclusivity and respect. Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, remains an enduring symbol of governance rooted in tolerance and justice. His policies, enshrined in the Cyrus Cylinder, championed religious freedom, cultural diversity, and equitable governance. Cyrus declared, 'I will respect the traditions, customs, and religions of the nations under my rule and never let any of my governors or subordinates look down on or insult them.' Abu Muslim, a pivotal figure in Iran and Islamic history, united Persians and other groups under a shared vision of Mehr during the first known Revolution in Iran. His leadership catalyzed a golden age of intellectual, scientific, and cultural achievements, demonstrating Iran’s capacity to inspire transformative change. Community-Based Governance and the Four-Branch Model The future of Iran’s governance lies in decentralization and adopting the four-branch government model outlined in Axis of Hope. This structure is designed to empower citizens, foster accountability, and promote equity through: Executive Branch: Responsible for defense, foreign policy, and overseeing the equitable distribution of national resources. The central government would operate with limited power, fostering development rather than perpetuating hostilities. Legislative Branch: Composed of a bicameral system, one chamber representing local communities and the other ensuring national cohesion. This structure would balance local autonomy with national unity. Judicial Branch: Independent and impartial, protecting individual rights and ensuring adherence to the rule of law. Local courts would handle community disputes, while national courts oversee constitutional matters. National Trust Fund: This branch would function as a public bank, managing revenues from natural resources, taxes, and investments. It would provide loans to communities and entrepreneurs, fostering local development and ensuring equitable resource distribution. IV. The Potential of a Unified WANA A cooperative framework in WANA could rival the European Union by fostering stability, growth, and collaboration. Such a vision requires Iran to: Support Reconstruction Efforts Engaging in rebuilding nations like Syria, Yemen, and Iraq can position Iran as a force for peace and development. Iran can foster goodwill and reduce regional tensions by contributing resources and expertise. Champion Economic Development Establishing joint ventures in agriculture, technology, and renewable energy would create jobs and promote innovation. Iran’s participation in regional infrastructure projects, such as transnational railways and energy pipelines, would enhance connectivity and interdependence. Promote Regional Unity A unified WANA council could address shared challenges like water scarcity, climate change, and public health crises. This approach would align with Iran’s historical leadership ethos through compassion and collaboration. V. Conclusion: A Vision for Peace and Prosperity The convergence of geopolitical shifts and Iran’s internal crises presents a unique opportunity for transformation. By drawing inspiration from its historical leaders and embracing a forward-looking political order rooted in Mehr, Iran can redefine its role as a force for peace and prosperity in WANA. Creating a regional cooperative framework, coupled with the four-branch government model, would stabilize the region and serve as a model for addressing global challenges through collaboration and compassion. As the Persian poet Rumi wrote, 'Be like a tree and let the dead leaves drop. Begin again, rooted in love and compassion.' Through strategic reforms and regional engagement, Iran can rise as a beacon of hope and progress for the region and the world. References Bertelsmann Stiftung. Transformation Index 2024. Nasr, Vali.

Hegseth Arrives At Pentagon, Says Warfighters Are ‘Ready To Go’	By Jim Garamone Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived at the Pentagon Monday and said improving lethality, warfighting and readiness are the main lines of effort he will pursue while in office. Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, greeted Hegseth as he arrived at the Pentagon. The defense secretary spoke to about 30 members of the press before entering the building. 'It's an honor to serve on behalf of the president and serve on behalf of the country,' Hegseth said. 'In talking to the chairman and so many other folks here, we're in capable hands. The warfighters are ready to go.' President Donald J. Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border. Hegseth said the 'protection of the sovereign territory of the United States is the job of the Defense Department.' He said he was pleased the Pentagon 'snapped to' last week, providing troops to strengthen the border barrier and transportation 'for the mass deportation effort.' 'Whatever is needed at the border will be provided,' Hegseth said. 'Whether that is through state active duty, Title 32 or Title 10. This is a shift: This is not the way it was done in the past. The Defense Department will support the defense of the territorial integrity of the United States of America's southern border, including reservists, National Guardsmen and active-duty [personnel] in compliance with the Constitution and the laws of our land, and the directives of the commander in chief.' Other areas the secretary will study include reinstating troops that were pushed out because of COVID-19 vaccination mandates and developing an Iron Dome anti-missile system for the United States. Hegseth said he is focused on the men and women in uniform. 'Our job is lethality and readiness and warfighting. [The United States] will be no better friend to our allies and no stronger adversary to those who want to test us and try us,' he said. 'I look forward to serving the troops, the warriors of this department. It's the honor of a lifetime, and we're going to get to work. God bless you all.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE-YZyc4e7DAv	2025-01-27T16:03:56-08:00	
NATO Secretary General Visits Spain And Portugal	Secretary General Mark Rutte travelled to Lisbon and Madrid on Monday (27 January) for discussions on the security situation in Europe, the need to increase defence spending, and the importance of continued support to Ukraine. In Lisbon, the Secretary General met with President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Prime Minister, Luís Montenegro and other members of the government. In Madrid, Mr. Rutte met with the Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and other officials. The Secretary General said that to keep NATO strong, the Alliance must continue to adapt and that to guarantee security in the future, it is necessary to ramp up efforts now. He highlighted the need to spend more on defence and welcomed recent increases in Portugal’s and Spain’s defence spending, stressing that the goal of 2% set a decade ago 'will not be enough to meet the challenges of tomorrow'. Speaking in Lisbon, Mr. Rutte said that Russia is challenging the resilience of our countries with acts ranging from assassination attempts to cyber-attacks to sabotage. He thanked Portugal for its significant contribution to innovation in the maritime domain and said that Portugal’s Maritime Operational Experimentation Centre helps Allies test and exercise with new technologies, including to improve the resilience of energy and communications infrastructure. 'The threats from Russia may seem distant, but let me assure you, it is not. Russian ships and long-range bombers menace the Portuguese coast. Portugal's vital undersea infrastructure is squarely in Russia’s sights. And while we deal with the Russian threat, we must also address the challenges coming from the southern neighbourhood, and also the opportunities coming from the southern' he said. During the visit, the Secretary General also thanked Portugal and Spain for their support to Ukraine and stressed that this is crucial, so that when Ukraine decides to go to the negotiating table, they can do this ​from a position of strength.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE48_Ca4nlTXn	2025-01-27T16:00:21-08:00	
Pope Francis Says He’s More Concerned About Human Intelligence Th...	By Courtney Mares Pope Francis said Monday that he is more concerned about the development of human intelligence than artificial intelligence. Speaking to Church communications professionals in the Clementine Hall of the Apostolic Palace, the 88-year-old pope emphasized the need for a human-centered approach to communication, especially in spreading the Gospel. Francis reflected on the concept of 'networking,' harkening back to the biblical imagery of fishermen’s nets and Jesus’ call to Peter to 'become a fisher of men.' He said that responding to Jesus’ invitation requires 'skills, knowledge, and resources' to build a network that can provide information that frees people from 'the sea of despair and disinformation.' 'Let us think of how much we could accomplish together — thanks to the new tools of the digital era and to artificial intelligence — if instead of turning technology into an idol, we were more committed to networking,' the pope said. 'What worries me — more than artificial intelligence — is natural intelligence, the intelligence that we must develop,' he said. Pope Francis urged communicators to examine their methods and motivations, warning against being seduced by the temptations of 'self-promotion and the celebration of our own initiatives.' He also stressed the importance of fostering hope in a world often marked by despair and division. 'Let us ask ourselves: What do we do to sow hope in the midst of all the despair that surrounds and challenges us? What do we do to overcome the virus of division that undermines our communities? Is our communication inspired by prayer? Or do we limit ourselves to communicating about the Church by merely following the rules laid down by corporate marketing?' Pope Francis called on communicators to demonstrate 'that hope is not an illusion' and to promote forgiveness. 'Christian communication is about showing that the kingdom of God is near. It is present here and now, like a miracle that can be experienced by every person and by every culture,' he said. 'Communicating, for us, is not a tactic. It is not a technique. It is not the repetition of catchphrases or slogans,' he added. 'Communicating is an act of love. Only an act of selfless love can produce networks of goodness.' The meeting followed the conclusion of the Catholic Church’s Jubilee of the World of Communications, which drew more than 10,000 participants from 138 countries, according to Vatican News. Pope Francis reminded the audience that Catholic communications is something that must extend beyond Church boundaries. 'Catholic communication is not something isolated; it is not just for Catholics. It is not a fenced-in area where we can keep to ourselves, a sect where we can talk to each other,' he said. 'It is the open space of a living witness that knows how to listen to and interpret the signs of the kingdom.' 'Today the Lord often knocks from the inside because he wants us, as Christians, to let him out. Too often we keep the Lord to ourselves. We must let the Lord out — he is knocking at the door to be let out — and not keep him somewhat ‘enslaved’ for own purposes. … Go forward with courage and the joy that comes from evangelizing.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFEzDlfRNVxRwH	2025-01-27T15:57:54-08:00	
South Africa Outlines G20 Presidency Plans At WEF	As the world convened in Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting recently, South Africa presented its vision for the G20 Presidency this year – outlining a path towards a more equitable and sustainable future. This is according to President Cyril Ramaphosa who addressed the country through his weekly Presidential newsletter on Monday. South Africa’s theme for the Group of Twenty (G20) Presidency is Solidary, Equality, Sustainable Development. 'We made the point that it is in the interests of all countries, large and small, wealthy and poor, to reduce global inequality. That is why one of our priorities is ensuring debt sustainability for low-income countries. By freeing up funds for debt relief in these countries, they will be in a better position to invest in infrastructure, industrial development, education, health care and other forms of development. 'Another focus area, which both reduces poverty and promotes sustainability, is the mobilisation of finance for a just energy transition. Through this, developing economy countries will be able to pursue a low-carbon development path while protecting the interests of affected workers, businesses and communities,' the President said. Related to this, the President spoke of the 'mobilisation of special financing and insurance to enable vulnerable countries to rebuild after being struck by natural disasters' and harnessing critical minerals 'to promote inclusive growth and development'. He emphasised, however, that in order for sustainable growth to be achieved, countries must work together. 'We stressed that our themes and priorities are underpinned by the principle of cooperation. Throughout history, human progress has been possible only through collaboration among peoples and countries. 'We therefore renewed our call for the resolution of global challenges through multilateral actions. We called for inclusive solutions that recognise that the world is more interconnected than ever before,' he said. Pressing further, the President emphasised that the current world climate shows that 'no country can go it alone'. 'No country can sustain its growth, stability and development without working together with other countries to overcome common problems,' he said. Positive sentiment President Ramaphosa revealed that South Africa’s message at WEF 'resonated with the participants in Davos'. 'It was a sentiment shared by many of the business leaders with whom we interacted, as well as with other heads of state and multilateral institutions. 'Many of the people we spoke to endorsed South Africa’s G20 priorities. They saw the value of our focus on Africa and the interests of countries with developing economies. They appreciated the importance of reducing inequality within and between countries and the need for new growth paths that are climate-friendly sustainable,' he said. Furthermore, there was a much-improved sentiment towards 'South Africa and the prospects for our economy in the years ahead'. 'They commented on the successful transition from the 6th to the 7th administrations and the formation of the Government of National Unity. They saw this as a sign of stability and a common commitment among parties to inclusive growth, employment and a capable state. 'They welcomed the far-reaching reforms that are underway in areas such as energy, logistics, telecommunications and water to grow and transform our economy. 'The South African delegation left Davos with a sense that there are many leaders in the world that share our vision of an inclusive, just and equal world. And that they are prepared and willing to work with us through our G20 Presidency towards the achievement of such a world,' President Ramaphosa concluded. The annual WEF meeting held from 20 to 24 January 2025, convened global leaders to address key global, and regional challenges	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFEw6Pc6JK4yT0	2025-01-27T15:50:30-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: Wrong Friends And Wrong Foes – OpEd	The Horn of Africa States (HAS) region is one complex regional economic and security apparatus. On the one hand, the HAS countries form geographically one bloc but on the socio-economic-political set up, they could be as far apart as earth and mars. The geographic location and its resources, though, attract many countries to it, including major, middle, and regional powers. The involvement of these other countries in the region has only added to its plight in terms of endless and continuing conflicts between states of the region and intra-state conflicts within each of the states of the region. Some of these conflicts are apparent but others are buried like fire under ashes, but still present and could explode at any moment. The competition among all these foreign forces in the region have given rise to mass migration from the region termed as refugees and given rise to other crises such as piracy and terror groups who find the chaos of the region as great fertilizers for their twisted ideologies. It is difficult for the region to really know who its friends are and who its enemies really are, a complex security issue, which has bedeviled it for the past four decades. The Arabs of the GCC countries sometimes together and at other times individually have been involved in the region. It would appear that they practice the power of their wealth to sway the poor Horn Africans for their own purposes. The Iranians on the other side of the Persian-cum-Arabian Gulf are not far behind as they compete with Arab Gulf countries but have not been as successful as the Arabs due to the international quarantining of the nation. Of the four SEED countries of the HAS region, two are in the Arab League and they include Somalia and Djibouti, Ethiopia now belongs to the BRICS Plus grouping, which opposes the usage of the United States Dollar as the main currency of reserve in the prevailing financial order of the world. Eritrea is said to be a hermetic state and does not enjoy many friends. The only other Arab country involved in the affairs of the HAS region is Egypt both for historical reasons and for its own perceived existential reasons. The HAS region is the source of the Blue Nile which provides most fresh water to Egypt and Sudan and the it overlooks the Bab El Mandab Strait, whose disruption can affect the Suez Canal, another vital interest for Egypt. Middle powers involved in the affairs of the region include Türkiye, which has found Somalia, weak and fragile and in need of assistance. There was no better way to enter the region other than to extend that helping hand but also to exploit the country’s untapped resources. These include among others its geostrategic location. It is crossed by the Equator and faces the massive Indian Ocean and hence offers an appropriate location for an outer space port. Türkiye also has used Somalia as a springboard or a launching pad for its entry into Africa. It built its largest embassy and its first military base in Somalia and the country is now represented through embassies and consulates in some 44 countries of the continent, a remarkable growth over the past decade and some years. Major powers including the United States and China have naval presence in the region both for trade and security purposes. It would be unnatural not to believe that all these countries are not in the region but for their own interests. What is obvious is that the region does not know where its best interests lie as the relations of the individual countries shift from one prime minister or president to another and especially for the largest two countries of Somalia and Ethiopia. There was little change over the years in the authorities of Eritrea and Djibouti and hence their foreign policies and foreign relations have not changed much, except that both have shifted away from the United Arab Emirates over the past couple of decades. Both have shown unease with the relations with the Emirate and limited this, to diplomatic presence only, away from security and commercial activities. All the four countries of the region are economically weak and, therefore, do not enjoy much room to practice independent foreign policies and hence dependency on other countries is what drives most of the foreign relations of each country. It is most unfortunate to note that the four countries of the region do not cooperate as they should and appear to be taking advantage of each other’s weaknesses, economic or otherwise, including security. The escalating civil wars in Ethiopia and the continuing weak governance in Somalia have not helped and the long-staying leaders of the other two countries (Eritrea and Djibouti), have not used their experiences to forge unifying schemes for the region. On the contrary, the rotating prime ministers and presidents of Ethiopia and Somalia appear to be copying the wrong side of the experiences of the elder statesmen of the region! The region, therefore appears to be confused, bewildered and unaware of its precarious situation, where others are taking advantage of its resources including its geostrategic location. It is not clear which countries are friends and which countries are foes to the region. Obviously, however, it appears that each of the countries of the region, assumes that the foreigner countries beyond the region are friends and the neighbors are foes. There is something wrong with the region’s political and economic calculations, obviously! The aggression of Ethiopia against Somalia, through the illegal MoU with one of the regions of Somalia, appears to have eased through the intervention of Türkiye, but the story remains standing as landlocked Ethiopia has not really accepted its own reality that it is, indeed, a landlocked country. A short man can never be elongated nor a tall man be truncated unless one cuts his long legs in the case of the tall man. The complex relations of the Horn African countries needs to be streamlined, for there are more factors that unite the region’s countries than divides them. Perhaps it is time they started to listen to their own peoples and their yearning for peace and better lives than wars and warmongering.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE3dzXqT05UY4	2025-01-27T15:48:57-08:00	
New Experimental System To Bring Quantum Technologies Closer To S...	The world of quantum physics is experiencing a second revolution, which will drive an exponential leap in the progress of computing, the internet, telecommunications, cybersecurity and biomedicine. Quantum technologies are attracting more and more students who want to learn about concepts from the subatomic world — such as quantum entanglement or quantum superposition — to explore the innovative potential of quantum science. In fact, understanding the non-intuitive nature of quantum technology concepts and recognizing their relevance to technological progress is one of the challenges of 2025, declared theInternational Year of Quantum Science and Technology by UNESCO. Now, a team from the Faculty of Physics of the University of Barcelona has designed new experimental equipment that makes it possible for students to familiarize themselves with the more complex concepts of quantum physics. The configuration they present —versatile, cost-effective and with multiple ways of application in the classroom — is already operational in the Advanced Quantum Laboratory of the UB’s Faculty of Physics and could also be accessible in less specialized centres. This innovation is presented in an article in the journal EPJ Quantum Technology, which results from a collaboration between professors Bruno Juliá, from the Department of Quantum Physics and Astrophysics and the UB Institute of Cosmos Sciences (ICCUB); Martí Duocastella, from the Department of Applied Physics and the UB Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (IN2UB), and José M. Gómez, from the Department of Electronic and Biomedical Engineering. It is based on the result of Raúl Lahoz’s master’s final project, with the participation of experts Lidia Lozano and Adrià Brú. Study of phenomena unique to quantum mechanics ​​Quantum mechanics makes it possible to create so-called entangled systems — for example, with two particles or two photons — that behave in a non-intuitive way. In 1964, the physicist John S. Bell experimentally proved that the predictions of quantum mechanics were totally incompatible with a classical description of physics — a hypothesis that had been advocated by Albert Einstein — and consolidated the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. In 2022, scientists Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for pioneering experiments in quantum information on entangled photons and the experimental demonstration of the violation of Bell’s inequalities. Quantum entanglement is today one of the fundamental resources to drive the development of quantum technologies (quantum computers, data encryption, etc.). 'The study of Bell inequalities — in particular, observing violations of the inequalities — is fundamental to characterizing quantum entangled systems. It is important to be able to perform these experiments in a teaching laboratory to understand Bell’s inequalities, quantum entanglement and the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics', says Bruno Juliá. Martí Duocastella explains in the article that they have designed 'new experimental equipment capable of providing students with direct measurements of quantum entanglement'. 'From our perspective, — says the researcher — we believe that allowing students to make these measurements will greatly facilitate their understanding of this unintuitive phenomenon'. Introducing students to advanced tools The system designed by the UB team makes it possible to study Bell inequalities and also to perform full two-photon state tomography. With a simple operation, it can prepare different quantum entangled states. Compared to previous proposals, 'the new equipment has improved the photon-capture process: it uses detectors assembled to optical fibres, one of the key innovations to simplify the experiment, which facilitates the alignment of the system and increases the efficiency of the detection. Thus, a complete measurement of the Bell inequalities can be performed during a practical laboratory session (between one and two hours)', say Juliá and Duocastella. The results reveal successful manipulation of the quantum state of photons and the achievement of high-fidelity entangled states and significant violations of Bell inequalities. Also, the elements of the system are widely used in current quantum technologies, facilitating students’ contact with advanced instrumentation. This innovation, which has already been applied in bachelor’s and master’s degree courses, has received very positive feedback from all students. In the bachelor’s degree in Physics, it allows experimental demonstrations to be carried out to complement the subject of Classical and Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Mechanics. In the master’s degree course, it is one of the four experiments in the Advanced Quantum Laboratory of the Master’s degree in Quantum Science and Technologies. This study has received funding from both the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities and the European Union’s Next Generation EU funds.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE8IFrKwZqQ7w	2025-01-27T15:46:02-08:00	
Researchers Develop New Weapon Against Harmful Algal Blooms	As harmful algal blooms (HABs) continue to spread across the globe, urgent research is needed to address this growing threat. Studies in Italy, China, and the Atlantic basin have shown that many water bodies have high nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios, making phosphorus a key factor that drives these blooms. This highlights the critical need for more effective phosphorus management strategies to curb the rise of HABs and protect our ecosystems. Recently, there’s been a growing interest in finding useful ways to repurpose troublesome algal biomass, which could be turned into valuable products like bioplastics, biofertilizers, and biofuels. Researchers have already explored using algal biomass to create materials that can help clean up things such as heavy metals, rare earth metals, dyes, and even capture CO2 and harmful volatile organic compounds from the air. However, few studies have looked into how algal biomass, especially cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, can be used to create materials that remove phosphate from water. Now, researchers from the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University, have filled that gap by transforming cyanobacterial biomass, which is typically a hazardous waste, into custom-made adsorbent materials that can pull harmful phosphorus out of water. Adsorbent materials are substances that can attract and hold molecules or particles such as gases, liquids, or dissolved solids on their surface. Unlike absorbent materials that soak up substances into their structure, adsorbents capture molecules on the outside surface, forming a thin layer. To convert algal biomass into chemically modified activated carbon adsorbent materials for phosphate removal, researchers collected cyanobacterial biomass from Florida’s Lake Okeechobee and processed before activation using fast and energy-efficient microwave heating. To improve phosphate removal from water, researchers tested adsorbent materials modified with lanthanum chloride or zinc chloride. Relatively abundant, lanthanum is a metal that is part of the rare-earth element group. Both compounds are useful in a variety of fields including environmental cleanup, industrial processing, and chemical manufacturing. Previous research did not identify any human health risks associated with the use of lanthanum for phosphorus removal. Results of the study, published in the journal Algal Research, show that materials treated with lanthanum chloride removed more than 99% of phosphorus, even at starting phosphorus concentrations as high as 20 milligrams per liter of water. The best material could be synthesized in three minutes and successfully achieved 90% phosphorus removal efficiency with a low amount of material (0.2 gram per liter of contaminated water) and just 30 minutes of contact time. This material also performed well in the presence of natural organic matter by selectively removing phosphorus. The study suggests that lanthanum-modified algae-based adsorbents could help reduce HABs by removing phosphorus from water. The effectiveness comes from the formation of a compound, LaPO4.H2O (also known as rhabdophane), which traps phosphorus permanently. 'Our findings suggest that lanthanum-modified algae-based materials could be an effective solution for removing phosphorus and preventing harmful algal blooms if used on a larger scale,' said Masoud Jahandar Lashaki, Ph.D., senior author, assistant professor and graduate program director/coordinator in FAU’s Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatics Engineering. 'By using readily available waste materials like algal biomass, combined with lanthanum, an element known for its strong phosphorus-binding capabilities, we have developed an adsorbent that can effectively target and remove excess phosphorus from water. Phosphorus is a major contributor to the occurrence of harmful algal blooms, which can lead to toxic water conditions, loss of aquatic life, and significant economic impacts on industries like fishing and tourism.' Results of this study show the promise of this innovative approach in addressing one of the most pressing challenges in water quality management. With further refinement and scalability, this technique could become an essential tool for managing nutrient pollution and preserving aquatic ecosystems globally. 'Our team’s research highlights the high efficiency of these materials in removing phosphorus over a wide range of concentrations. This approach could provide an environmentally friendly and cost-effective solution to mitigate the effects of eutrophication – the process where excessive nutrients, particularly phosphorus, fuel the growth of harmful algae in lakes, rivers, and coastal areas,' said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean, FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science. 'By applying lanthanum-modified algae-based materials in regions prone to harmful algal blooms, communities could significantly reduce the occurrence of these blooms, improving water quality, protecting ecosystems, and ensuring safe water for both human use and wildlife.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE09MTfyhIihO	2025-01-27T15:37:44-08:00	
Infant Mortality Rates Declining, But Sudden Unexpected Infant De...	Infant mortality in the United States decreased by 24.2% between 1999 and 2022. Researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University and Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU discovered this improvement in a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics. In the same study, however, they found mortality rates from Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) rose significantly – by 11.8% – from 2020 to 2022. 'Although a prior CDC study – using data until 2020 – found that Sudden Unexpected Infant Death was increasing for Black infants, this new study – adding data from 2021 and 2022 – found that the rise is more generalized and occurred in infants overall,' said Elizabeth Wolf, M.D., associate professor in VCU School of Medicine’s Department of Pediatrics, pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU and lead author on the study. Steven Woolf, M.D., director emeritus of the VCU Center on Society and Health and professor in VCU School of Medicine’s Department of Family Medicine, and Anabeel Sen, M.B.B.S., professor in VCU School of Public Health’s Department of Epidemiology, were among the other study authors, along with Frederick Rivara, M.D., of University of Washington’s Department of Pediatrics and Seattle Children’s Research Institute. What is behind the rise in SUID? Wolf attributes declining overall infant mortality rates to improved screening and treatment for illnesses affecting pregnant people, better obstetric management and neonatal care. Causes for the increase in SUID are harder to pinpoint. Possible explanations identified in this study include the rise of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, parental opioid use and the effect of social media on infant sleep practices. 'In social media posts, infants can be seen in unsafe sleep positions, for example on their stomach instead of on their back, and in unsafe sleep environments such as adult beds, couches and baby swings,' Wolf added. This information builds upon a child mortality study the same group of researchers published in May 2024, which showed racial and ethnic disparities among youth, ages 1 to 19, were greatest in the category of injuries. This new research finds large disparities in many causes of infant death as well, especially SUID. While SUID mortality rates are up across all racial and ethnic groups, the rate for Black infants is 10 times higher compared to Asian infants and three times higher than white infants. The authors suggest these disparities could reflect unsafe sleep position, prematurity, tobacco exposure and/or infant feeding, but further research is needed. Where we go from here As a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU, Wolf places an emphasis on safe sleep education at well-child visits with her patients and families. She also sees opportunities to strengthen public health messaging on the importance of safe sleep and tighten regulations around unsafe or misleading infant products. 'An infant dying from SUID is a horrific tragedy and causes incomprehensible trauma to the family. Although not all SUID is preventable, there are some ways to reduce an infant’s risk,' Wolf said. Efforts to support breastfeeding such as lactation support and paid parental leave could help lower risks of SUID. Expanding health insurance access and providing doulas to support mothers pre- and postnatally could also reduce infant mortality. Wolf also emphasizes that infants should receive all recommended vaccines on time to reduce their risks of serious infection.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE1ulr-RdX0Gh	2025-01-27T15:33:40-08:00	
Dwarf Planet Ceres: Building Blocks Of Life Delivered From Space	Organic molecules are among the necessary inventory of life-friendly worlds. On Earth, the compounds of carbon, hydrogen and – in smaller quantities – other elements form the basic building blocks of all life. In recent years, researchers have found such molecules at great distances from the Sun: on trans-Neptunian objects, comets, and far-away asteroids. These bodies are thought to be largely unaltered remnants from the early days of the Solar System. The building blocks of life may therefore have been part of their 'basic configuration' from the very beginning and possibly reached the inner Solar System only later. For the current study, the researchers looked for previously unknown deposits of organic material on dwarf planet Ceres. With its location in the middle of the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the body is neither clearly native to the inner nor the outer Solar System. According to earlier studies, this location could even be its birthplace. Scientists are therefore interested in the origin of Ceres’s organic components. Did they originate locally in the asteroid belt? Or did they arrive later? Searching for Organics from afar Evidence of deposits of organic material was already found during the early stages of the Dawn mission. The Dawn spacecraft reached Ceres in March 2015 and accompanied it for about three and a half years. During this time, the scientific camera system and the spectrometer on board scanned the entire surface of the dwarf planet. Potential patches of organic material can be detected from the camera data: the brightness of the light reflected from these areas increases noticeably with increasing wavelength. The spectrometer splits the light into many more wavelengths than the camera and can therefore prove or disprove the presence of organics. Unfortunately, remote data is not sufficient to identify individual types of molecules beyond doubt. However, it is certain that the discovered deposits consist of organic compounds that have a chain-like structure. Researchers refer to such molecules as aliphatic hydrocarbons. The authors of the current study have now used artificial intelligence to comb the entire surface of the dwarf planet for traces of aliphatic organic molecules. 'Sites of such organic molecules are actually rare on Ceres, and devoid of any cryovolcanic signatures' says first author Ranjan Sarkar from the MPS, summarizing the results. The vast majority of deposits can be found along the edge or near the large Ernutet crater in the northern hemisphere of the dwarf planet. Only three are located at a greater distance from it. Two patches were not previously known. A closer look at the geological structures at the locations of the organic material allows further conclusions. 'At none of the deposits do we find evidence of current or past volcanic or tectonic activity: no trenches, canyons, volcanic domes or vents. Furthermore, there are no deep impact craters nearby,' says Martin Hoffmann from MPS. Impacts from distant neighbors During the Dawn mission, Ceres had turned out to be an extraordinary, cryovolcanic world. Under its surface, a watery brine is hidden, which in some places has been seeping to the surface until recently. 'Of course, the first assumption is that Ceres' unique cryovolcanism has transported the organic material from the interior of the body to the surface,' says Andreas Nathues from MPS, head of the camera team. 'But our results show otherwise,' he adds. At the sites of cryovolcanic activity, there is no proof of organic matter. And where organic compounds have been reliably detected, there is no evidence of deep or surface activity. The researchers therefore argue that the impact of one or more asteroids from the outer asteroid belt introduced the organic material. Computer simulations show that these bodies are among the ones that most frequently collided with Ceres. Since the not-too-distant neighbors do not pick up much speed, only little heat is generated upon impact. Organic compounds can survive these temperatures. 'Unfortunately, Dawn can't detect all types of organic compounds,' Andreas Nathues points out. It is quite likely that building blocks of life were also formed in Ceres' underground ocean and perhaps even reached the surface – or are still doing so. 'However, the organic deposits that have been reliably detected with Dawn so far likely do not originate Ceres itself,' he explains. Nathues continues by saying that a future lander mission would be needed to detect organic material from the interior of Ceres.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFEzMW5d7eztdQ	2025-01-27T15:31:26-08:00	
From Fox News To MSNBC: Diverse Media Diet Linked To Higher Trust...	People who get their news from an ideologically diverse array of sources are more likely to get vaccinated, regardless of their political affiliation, new University of Colorado Boulder research shows. 'This study shows that being exposed to a range of perspectives encourages critical thinking and makes people less likely to get stuck in a bubble or misled by misinformation,' said senior author Leaf Van Boven, a professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience. Published in the journal Scientific Reports, the study is among the first to take a close look at how media consumption habits shape vaccine hesitancy, which the World Health Organization has named as one of the 'top 10' global threats to public health. The study comes as vaccination rates are declining nationwide, and public trust in scientists remains lower than it was before the pandemic. President Donald Trump has also nominated outspoken vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The researchers offer some advice for public health communicators wanting to boost trust and improve vaccine adherence: Encourage people to get out of their echo chambers. 'We as a society have kind of fallen into this belief that you can’t change other people’s minds, but this paper goes to show that when people are introduced to new ideas and evidence, they can make more informed choices and they are willing to change their beliefs,' said Dani Grant, first author of the study and a doctoral candidate at CU Boulder. Media diet As part of a larger project exploring public sentiments about COVID-19, Van Boven and Grant surveyed nearly 1,700 people in the spring of 2022, when vaccines and boosters were readily available to the public. The researchers asked respondents their age, ethnicity, education and political affiliation—factors that have previously been shown to shape vaccine adherence—and also asked them to rank how much they got their news from 20 different news outlets. Outlets ranged from Breitbart News Network and Fox News on the conservative side to MSNBC and Democracy Now on the liberal side. The researchers determined a publication’s ideological tilt using bias ratings from All Sides and Ad Fontes Media, independent media intelligence organizations. The team gave each respondent a media diversity score based on their answers. At the time, 21% of those surveyed were not vaccinated, 17% were vaccinated, and 62% were vaccinated and boosted. The study found that people who reported consuming more conservative media were significantly less likely to be vaccinated and boosted. The researchers noted that, for example, Fox News pundit Sean Hannity told viewers at the time that COVID-19 was made up by the 'deep state,' and then-Fox business anchor Trish Regan characterized the virus as 'a scam.' Echo chambers The most interesting finding, Grant and Van Boven said, was that when people consumed a diverse media diet, even if it included a range of conservative outlets, they still tended to get vaccinated. 'People who consumed news and opinions from a variety of political perspectives were more likely to be vaccinated, even after accounting for their political affiliation, age, gender, race and education,' said Van Boven. When it came to trust in science, media consumption also had a notable influence. Those who consumed only left-leaning media had very high trust in science, while those who consumed only right-leaning media were highly skeptical. The authors said that understanding the factors associated with vaccine hesitancy is critical not only for addressing the ongoing threat of COVID-19 but also for tackling other diseases like influenza, measles and whooping cough. Vaccination rates for all three diseases are declining in the United States. 'When people delay or refuse vaccines, we see avoidable deaths, illness and economic losses,' said Van Boven. 'Vaccines are among our most effective public health tools, but their power depends on public trust.' To regain trust, scientists and public health officials might also do well to step out of their own echo chambers, Grant said, sharing their perspectives and research with outlets they may not typically engage with. 'This is an opportunity for scientists to reflect on where we are not being as constructive as we could be,' she said. 'I think that we should all be interacting across the media spectrum.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE8fSmomCUuMz	2025-01-27T15:28:46-08:00	
Botanic Gardens Must Team Up To Save Wild Plants From Extinction	A major study of botanic gardens around the world has revealed their struggles with one fundamental aim: to safeguard the world’s most threatened plants from extinction. Researchers analysed a century’s worth of records - from 1921 to 2021 - from fifty botanic gardens and arboreta currently growing half a million plants, to see how the world’s living plant collections have changed over time. The results suggest that the world’s living collections have collectively reached peak capacity, and that restrictions on wild plant collecting around the world are hampering efforts to gather plant diversity on the scale needed to study and protect it. There is little evidence that institutions are managing to conserve threatened plants within collections, on a global scale, despite accelerating rates of elevated extinction risk. The findings imply that tackling the loss of biodiversity has not been prioritised across the world’s botanic gardens as a collective - a fact the researchers say must be urgently addressed. Curator of Cambridge University Botanic Garden Professor Samuel Brockington, who led the work, said: 'A concerted, collaborative effort across the world’s botanic gardens is now needed to conserve a genetically diverse range of plants, and to make them available for research and future reintroduction into the wild.' In their report, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, the researchers say the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has effectively halved the level at which plants are being collected from the wild, and also created obstacles to the international exchange of plants. Brockington, who is also Professor of Evolution in the University of Cambridge’s Department of Plant Sciences, said: 'The impact of the Convention on Biological Diversity is a remarkable demonstration of the power and value of international agreements. But it seems to be preventing individual botanic gardens from working with many globally threatened plant species that we could help save from extinction.' Collective thinking As much as 40% of the world’s plant diversity is at elevated risk of extinction. Acceptance that individual collections have limited capacity to single-handedly prevent species extinction demands a rethink as to how they collaborate to store and safeguard diversity in living collections. The researchers say it will be vital for the living collections to be considered as a ‘meta-collection’ in future: only by working closely together will the world’s botanic gardens be able to hold the range of plants needed to make a meaningful contribution to conservation efforts. This will include sharing data and expertise and supporting the development of new collections in the global south, where much of the world’s biodiversity is located. The researchers point out that some individual institutions, like the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh, have successfully targeted and measurably conserved threatened conifer species. Similarly, Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) has established numerous global conservation consortia. However, these initiatives are the exception. Wild decline Plants must be regularly replaced or propagated within living collections: the average lifetime of a specimen is just 15 years. But the team’s analysis found that the number of wild-origin plants - those collected in the wild - in the collections peaked in 1993 and has been in decline ever since. 'It is certainly not getting any easier to sustain the diversity of our collections. This is especially true for wild-collected plants, and they’re the most valuable for us in terms for supporting research, and in finding solutions to the twin challenges of climate change and global biodiversity loss,' said Brockington. Weather worries As climate change alters growing conditions in different regions of the world, it will become more challenging for individual botanic gardens to continue to grow such a diverse range of species. Brockington said: 'Climate change affects our work directly by altering local weather conditions - we’ve already seen record-breaking temperatures in Cambridge in recent years. That’s going to affect how well our plants survive, so we need to think rationally and collectively about the best locations to hold different species across the global network of living collections.' On 25 July 2019, Cambridge University Botanic Garden reached 38.70C - the highest temperature ever recorded in the UK at that time. Diversity is key Genetic diversity is important when it comes to protecting plants at risk of extinction, because it allows for breeding populations of species that can adapt to future challenges. The more individual plants of a particular species in a collection, the greater the genetic diversity is likely to be. The team says data from the International Conifer Conservation Programme, run by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, shows that living collections can make a valuable contribution to conservation efforts - given the right resource and focus. By distributing threatened species across a network of safe sites, the trees are grown where they grow best, and as a whole they represent a strong sample of the genetic diversity of this important group. Ethical collecting Last year, Cambridge University Botanic Garden advertised for a new ‘Expedition Botanist’ to lead global plant-collection expeditions and contribute to vital conservation efforts. Brockington says these expeditions remain vital to work to safeguard and study the world’s plant species. He suggests that collaborative collecting work is possible, in a fair and ethical way, that builds equitable international partnerships. The CBD is a global agreement, signed by 150 government leaders in 1992, dedicated to promoting sustainable development. It makes each country responsible for protecting its own biodiversity, and supports fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of that biodiversity. There are 3,500 botanic gardens and arboreta worldwide. They exist so that scientists can study, conserve and provide access to the world’s plants, as well as showcasing them to the public. Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) is a charity whose purpose is to mobilise botanic gardens and engage partners in securing plant diversity for the wellbeing of people and the planet.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFEz89cb0jSloa	2025-01-27T15:26:57-08:00	
Underwater Mud Volcanos Are A Haven For Marine Organisms	The underwater volcano Borealis Mud Volcano is located in the Barents Sea and was first discovered by researchers at UiT The Arctic University of Norway in 2023. The discovery received a lot of attention, and images of the volcano circulated around the world. Now researchers from UiT, in collaboration with REV Ocean, have finally published the results from an interdisciplinary investigation showing that Borealis mud volcano has a unique ecological role as a natural sanctuary for several marine species in the Barents Sea. While some parts of the crater floor of Borealis appear inhospitable to a variety of organisms, the carbonate crusts – a type of mineral formed thousands of years ago – that characterized Borealis provide a suitably hard substrate for species of anemones, serpulids, demosponges, and sparse octocoral colonies. 'Important for maintaining biodiversity' In addition, the carbonates offer both shelter and feeding opportunities, playing an important role in sustaining the local fish populations. The researchers observed large schools of commercially valuable species like saithe and various demersal species such as spotted wolffish, cod, four-bearded rockling, and redfish (Sebastes spp.) clustering around the jagged carbonate formations. 'The redfish, for instance, is red listed, and we don’t know the consequences if it would disappear. Borealis is an oasis where different species can thrive and flourish. Thus, preserving ecosystems such as the Borealis Mud Volcano is essential for maintaining biodiversity and understanding the interactions between geology, geochemistry and biology in marine environments. We need that understanding, among other things, considering that the Arctic seabed plays an important role in oil and gas extraction activities and the emerging deep-sea mining industry', says Professor Giuliana Panieri, lead author of the study recently published in Nature Communications. Methane has leaked out, probably for thousands of years Onboard the research vessel Kronprins Haakon in May 2024, researchers confirmed the previous discoveries. Using the remotely operated vehicle, ROV Aurora, the research team was able to make a series of observations of the underwater volcano. Among other things, they saw that it warms the surroundings to 11.5 degrees Celsius, while the seabed usually has a temperature of around 4 degrees Celsius. The researchers also found sediments containing extinct, microscopic marine organisms from up to 2.5 million years ago and that small 'mud cones' in the volcanic system are emitting vigorous methane-rich liquids. The fact that the seabed around the volcano is also characterized by extensive carbonate deposits indicates that methane has leaked out, probably for thousands of years. 'The Borealis Mud Volcano is a unique geological and ecological phenomenon that provides a rare insight into the complex interactions between geological processes and marine ecosystems. It is important to preserve these unique habitats, which play a crucial role in maintaining marine biodiversity', says Panieri. She reminds that, in the longer term, Norway has committed to the 30x30 target (protecting 30 % of land and sea by 2030) for spatial conservation measures of representative marine ecosystems, including in the deep sea. Protecting large areas of the deep-sea floor along the Norwegian margin may result in seep refugia acting as source populations for wider recolonization and restoration of benthic biological communities. 'The new findings show the power of international cooperation and how such cooperation can contribute to increasing our understanding of the world's oceans', says Panieri.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFE5WNBLXfBe1-	2025-01-27T15:24:15-08:00	
Drones Could Be The ‘Magic Tools’ We Need To Chase Bears Away Fro...	By Wesley M. Sarmento Brown bears roam across much of the northern hemisphere from the mountains of Spain to the prairies of the US. These bears are formidable carnivores that can weigh up to 751 kg (1,656 lb) and have claws 15 cm (6 in) long. With long canine teeth and a bite force of 6,800,000 pascals (1,000 psi), these bruins can easily crush bones. All these powerful features make brown bears an imposing predator that can take down prey as large and dangerous as an adult bison. Yet, while these bears eat meat, much of their diet is plant-based because they are omnivores. Brown bears have very few dietary restrictions. They are certainly not gluten intolerant because they have been observed laying in big piles of grain, eating wheat by mouthfuls. Nor do they have nut or shellfish allergies. This large dietary breadth, however, causes them to seek out many of the same foods that humans consume. So, just about anywhere you have brown bears and people, you have human-bear conflicts. In the contiguous US, brown bears, also called grizzly bears, have been a protected species since the 1970s, which has led some populations to increase considerably and expand their range, reclaiming historic habitat. The ecosystems that contain Yellowstone and Glacier National Park have populations of grizzlies that are rebounding so much that bears are moving out from the mountains back onto the prairie, where people and agriculture now dominate the landscape. The return of the grizzly to the Great Plains has been hailed a conservation success story but has come with the unintended consequence of increased human-bear conflicts. Training bears to stay away Some people are upset with having to live with such a fearsome animal. Grizzlies can kill livestock, people, and cause property damage. Fortunately, people are not on the typical bear menu and attacks are extraordinarily rare. Nevertheless, their presence makes all these risks possible, and therefore, it is essential for wildlife managers to prevent these conflicts and resolve issues quickly when they do occur. Addressing people’s concerns over grizzly bears is necessary for the successful long-term conservation of the species. With the expansion of grizzlies onto the prairie, locals demanded more responsiveness to address people’s worries. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the state and federal agencies tasked with managing the protected species, responded by hiring me in 2017. I was the first bear manager based entirely on the Great Plains. Initially, I held a dozen public meetings to hear what people wanted. Resoundingly, people said they didn’t want bears near homes, in town, or damaging property, namely livestock. This seemed like a reasonable request, so I offered to haze bears away. Hazing is the act of the chasing an animal away from an undesirable place or stop it from doing a specific behavior, like attacking livestock. Some people jumped at the idea and offered to help, while others were skeptical. The disbelievers said hazing wouldn’t work or it would merely move a bear to someone else’s land. With limited information available on hazing, I decided to start collecting data to test if it worked. I wanted to know if hazing was effective at moving bears away from undesirable places. In addition, I wanted to know if it taught grizzlies to stay away from people long-term, which is called aversive conditioning. From dogs to drones I started the program with the basic tools of any bear manager - a truck and shotgun with non-lethal deterrents, like cracker shells and rubber rounds. One day, I got a call about a bear in some trees near a family’s house. I drove out to the farm on that rainy day to chase the bear off so the kids and livestock would be safe. My truck, however, was limited by the wet ground - I couldn’t drive up to where the bear was because I would get stuck. So, I went out on foot, shooting the firecracker-like cracker shells from my shotgun. The big, agitated male grizzly didn’t take kindly to my hazing work and charged out at me! Luckily, I was able to stop the large bear with a well-placed cracker in front of him, which spun him around and caused him to flee. After that risky encounter, I decided to get a widely touted, but scientifically untested tool – bear dogs. A month later I had two adult Airedales, known as the king of terriers, to help me haze grizzlies. I picked this type of dog because the local people favored the breed and conservation outcomes are supposed to be more successful when those local perceptions are considered. It didn’t take long for me to realize that the bear dogs weren’t all they were hyped up to be. Much of the time the two dogs couldn’t detect a bear that I could see across a field, or they chased whatever animal they discovered first. Oftentimes they went after feral cats and porcupines. I tried relentlessly to better train the dogs, but the effort had little effect. Realizing the dogs weren’t a miracle solution, I decided to try a more technological approach that had also never been tested before – drones. Equipped with a highly maneuverable, buzzing drone I was scattering bears with accuracy. I could precisely chase bears exactly where I wanted them – all from the safety and comfort of my truck. The unmanned aerial vehicle was exactly the magic tool that I had been needing. Even at night, I could find bears from afar with the thermal camera, and then fly in closer to move them away from towns, homes, and livestock. The drone was such an asset that I couldn’t imagine doing the job without it. Even though all the tools had some success at moving bears away from people, the drone performed notably better than dogs. With the drone I was no longer limited by fences, canals, and other obstacles that would’ve stopped me or limited my range with the other tools. All the hazing work seemed to pay off. Older bears required less hazing, and the number of hazing events declined over each calendar year – evidence that long term aversive conditioning was occurring. Bears appeared to learn to stay away from people. The aversive conditioning likely prevented some conflicts from occurring, which meant bears would be less likely to get into trouble. It was a win-win.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFExC-a7y5nHsW	2025-01-27T15:20:12-08:00	
Rethinking Regional Dynamics: Pakistan’s Path Forward In An Unequ...	The longstanding rivalry between India and Pakistan has significantly shaped the geopolitics of South Asia. Forged by their tumultuous history of partition, conflict, and competition, these two nations have maintained an uneasy coexistence for decades. However, the power imbalance between them has grown substantially in recent years, particularly in terms of military and economic strength, with India clearly surpassing Pakistan. Grappling with internal challenges, Pakistan has found it increasingly difficult to keep pace with India's rise. This power imbalance fundamentally shapes the dynamics of their relationship, placing Pakistan in a defensive posture despite the substantial financial, social, and diplomatic costs of its strategies. The protracted conflicts and hostility have saddled Pakistan with political stagnation, economic hardship, and military dominance. This widening disparity forces Pakistan to confront a harsh reality. As India has emerged as a major regional and global player, its economic growth, military modernisation, and strategic alliances have contributed to a stark asymmetry between the two countries. This has compelled Pakistan to adopt a range of costly strategies to maintain the balance of power, including military buildup, nuclear deterrence, diplomatic maneuvers, economic partnerships, and the use of proxy forces. To counterbalance India’s influence, Pakistan has pursued diplomatic solutions and established external alliances, particularly with the United States, China, and various Middle Eastern countries. However, this balancing act often leads to diplomatic tensions. Pakistan’s deepening ties with China, especially through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), have resulted in increasing dependency on Beijing. While China’s support offers economic benefits and military cooperation, it also risks alienating other global powers. Additionally, some segments of Pakistan’s population view the country’s foreign policy as overly reliant on external powers, potentially compromising national sovereignty. This domestic challenge adds complexity to Pakistan’s delicate geopolitical maneuvering. Overall, Pakistan must carefully navigate its relationships with major powers to maintain influence while addressing concerns about national autonomy and the risk of becoming caught in the middle of competing interests. Pakistan's costly strategy of engaging in proxy conflicts, particularly its alleged support for insurgent groups in Kashmir, has led to international isolation and condemnation. This strategy has incurred significant diplomatic costs, with Western nations, especially the U.S., pressuring Pakistan to curb these activities as part of broader counterterrorism efforts. Proxy warfare has destabilised regions and created long-term security challenges for Pakistan. The rise of extremist groups and the spread of militancy within Pakistan can partly be attributed to the unintended consequences of its involvement in these proxy conflicts. The humanitarian impact of these proxy wars has resulted in civilian casualties and displacement, both within Pakistan and in neighboring countries like India and Afghanistan. This situation has lasting effects on social stability and public perceptions of military interventions. As Pakistan faces the reality of India's regional dominance, it may be time to reconsider its traditional approaches to balancing power, which are becoming increasingly ineffective. Attempting to match India's military strength or political influence may only exacerbate Pakistan's vulnerabilities, creating an unsustainable cycle of competition. Instead, Pakistan should explore alternative strategies that go beyond conventional power balancing, such as embracing economic collaboration with India. If military competition is no longer a viable path for Pakistan, exploring economic collaboration with India could present a promising alternative. While political and territorial disputes continue to pose challenges, the economic potential of improved relations between the two nations should not be overlooked. South Asia is rich in economic opportunities, but the longstanding rivalry between India and Pakistan has stifled much-needed regional cooperation. Political tensions have hindered trade, investment, and shared infrastructure projects for years. However, as India continues to grow as a global economic power, Pakistan has an opportunity to participate in and benefit from this economic expansion by embracing India as a key trading partner. By tapping into vast markets and forging economic partnerships with India, Pakistan could not only boost its prosperity but also contribute to improved regional stability in South Asia. This strategic shift could greatly benefit from encouragement and support from major global powers, including the United States, China, and the European Union, who have a vested interest in maintaining stability in the region. By backing initiatives aimed at increasing economic cooperation between India and Pakistan, these nations could play a crucial role in reducing tensions and promoting lasting peace. A cooperative economic relationship between the two countries would enhance regional security and make armed confrontations less likely. In this changing global landscape, Pakistan has a prime opportunity to redefine its role and pursue a new path focused on economic engagement with India. Establishing a framework for peace and mutual prosperity could lay the foundation for a more stable and prosperous South Asia, benefiting not only the two countries but the entire region. Embracing flexibility, pragmatism, and a focus on economic cooperation may be key to ensuring long-term peace and prosperity in South Asia. By shifting the dynamic from rivalry to collaboration, Pakistan could unlock a wealth of new opportunities for itself and its neighbors, ultimately fostering a more harmonious and integrated region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclZyJKddUFEzJmys_ymek1	2025-01-27T15:18:38-08:00	
Trump Attacks Global Minimum Tax – Analysis	President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the OECD minimum 15% global tax deal could hurt Africa. By Peter Fabricius Amid Donald Trump’s blizzard of executive orders fired off moments after being inaugurated as United States (US) president on 20 January was one withdrawing the US from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) global tax deal. The deal requires all large multinationals (with revenue of over 750 million euros a year) to pay a minimum tax rate of 15% in all the jurisdictions (territories) where they operate. In 2021, 136 countries agreed to this deal, and some began implementing it in 2024. The US’ Biden administration was among those that agreed but had not begun implementing. Trump threatened protective measures against any foreign country that taxed US companies that were ‘extraterritorial or disproportionately affect American companies.’ His order has been interpreted by the Tax Justice Network as effectively demanding that ‘countries surrender tax sovereignty at economic gunpoint.’ The network said Trump’s order would frustrate the OECD’s efforts to curb the widespread practice of multinational enterprises dodging their tax obligations by shifting profits away from jurisdictions where they earn income, to lower tax jurisdictions. This profit-shifting has affected Africa especially badly over the years. A 2020 report from the United Nations (UN) Conference on Trade and Development conservatively estimated that Africa lost US$88.6 billion a year in illicit financial flows (IFFs). Africa loses US$88.6 billion a year in illicit financial flows – mostly from large commercial corporations It’s hard to isolate the tax avoidance component of IFFs. In a 2015 report, an African Union high-level panel estimated that of the roughly US$50 billion a year in IFFs from Africa, 65% were from commercial activities, 30% from criminal activities and 5% from corruption. The panel’s definition of commercial activities included non-tax practices such as mis-invoicing of trade. It said ‘large commercial corporations are by far the biggest culprits of illicit outflows.’ Trump’s executive order said the OECD global tax deal ‘not only allows extraterritorial jurisdiction over American income but also limits our nation’s ability to enact tax policies that serve the interests of American businesses and workers. ‘Because of the global tax deal and other discriminatory foreign tax practices, American companies may face retaliatory international tax regimes if the United States does not comply with foreign tax policy objectives.’ The order states, ‘The global tax deal has no force or effect in the United States.’ And Trump instructed his officials to investigate protective (read retaliatory) measures for the US if any country tries to impose them on US companies. The OECD explains that the 15% global minimum tax ‘ensures that large multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on their income in each jurisdiction where they operate, thereby reducing the incentive for profit shifting and placing a floor under tax competition, bringing an end to the race to the bottom on corporate tax rates.’ A US withdrawal could collapse the OECD global tax system, cutting African tax collections and boosting IFFs It has been estimated that the tax would increase overall corporate income tax revenues by US$155 billion to US$192 billion per year, or between 6.5% to 8.1% of current global corporate income tax revenues. In its statement, the Tax Justice Network said Trump ‘plans to question the right of any country to tax American multinational corporations and is threatening to take countermeasures against countries that do not, in effect, cede their tax sovereignty over US multinationals operating within their own borders.’ Tax Justice Network Chief Executive Alex Cobham said: ‘The US will now investigate the tax rules of every other country in the world, and is threatening sanctions for any measure that they view as 'extraterritorial' or 'disproportionately' affecting US companies. ‘Republican lawmakers have already made clear that they view most current proposals as falling foul of these criteria – and that means that all OECD member countries and many others are now under threat.’ The African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF) has a slightly different view. An official told ISS Todaythat the OECD tax allows a country to top up tax collected from a multinational in its territory to the 15% minimum – but only if the country has enacted a ‘domestic minimum top-up tax’ rule. Without the rule, the country where the multinational’s parent company is located may collect the top up tax – if it has enacted an ‘income inclusion rule.’ On the plus side, the withdrawal could increase global support for a UN convention on international tax cooperation If neither rule has been adopted, a third kicks in – the under taxed profits rule. It allows all countries where the multinational operates to collect enough tax to make up 15%. This could include taxing the multinational’s operations in the parent company’s country. The ATAF official said it seemed to be this under taxed profits rule that bothered Trump, who regarded it as an extraterritorial tax on US companies. The official said he didn’t think the US was concerned about its multinationals being charged the 15% rate by a country for the profits generated in that country. If so, the Trump administration is not threatening the tax collection of say, African countries. However the withdrawal of the US from the global minimum tax did threaten to collapse the entire OECD global tax system – which would greatly reduce African tax collected, and boost IFFs. On the plus side, Cobham told ISS Today that Trump’s executive order would likely increase global support for negotiations on a UN framework convention on international tax cooperation, which starts next month. The resolution to start the process was introduced by Nigeria on behalf of the African Group, and could deliver a more inclusive and ambitious global tax deal than the OECD one. Danny Bradlow, global economic governance expert at the University of Pretoria agrees. He said while Trump’s order was bad for the OECD tax deal, ‘it is important to recall that the US had not yet implemented it. Thus its direct impact on issues like IFFs is not likely to be substantial, at least in the short run. ‘In addition, this development could be positive for African countries’ efforts to promote a UN tax framework convention – especially if Trump’s action persuades other OECD countries that the OECD tax deal is not sustainable.’ That UN convention is ultimately the right instrument to ensure a just international tax regime. But would the unilateralist Trump abide by a UN ruling any more than an OECD one?

New Leadership, Continued Orthodoxies In Singapore – Analysis	By Chang Yee Kwan Singapore’s economy showed resilience in 2024, growing by 4 per cent — a major improvement from 1.1 per cent growth in 2023. Yet, beneath the strong performance of the Singapore economy lies persistent policy challenges for Singapore’s new Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and his fourth generation leadership team. The government continued its previously-announced policy approaches in 2024. The February budget provided additional household transfers to offset the goods and services tax increase from 8 to 9 per cent on 1 January 2024. For citizens aged over 50, the SG$7.5 billion (US$5.5 billion) Majulah Package aimed to raise retirement savings through supplementary transfers to Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts. These measures reflect traditional responses to the cost-of-living pressures arising from higher food, energy and freight costs driven by conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Disruptions in international shipping from continuing global tensions and conflict affectedSingapore’s productivity and performance as a major logistics hub. But this was mitigated by stronger-than-expected demand in manufacturing in the latter half of the year. Higher tourist arrivals for international music acts and the annual Formula 1 Grand Prix also boosted economic activity. Inflation moderated over the year, with core inflation falling from 4.6 per cent in 2023 to 2 to 3 per cent, while overall inflation dropped from 4.8 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Despite continuing retrenchments, particularly from the technological sector, unemployment remained low and real wages grew for median and lower-income workers after reductions in 2023. Politically, Singapore saw its first leadership change since 2004 when Lawrence Wong took office as the country’s fourth prime minister on 15 May 2024. In his maiden address, Wong underscored the People’s Action Party’s fourth generation leadership team’s commitment to enhancing social equity, trust and consensus-driven policymaking. Wong’s government introduced the SkillsFuture Jobseeker scheme, which provides temporary financial support for those involuntarily unemployed, and increased subsidies for public housing purchases and paid parental leave benefits. But deep-seated structural issues persist in the labour market. Technology sector retrenchments continued through 2024, with companies like Lazada, Dyson and Samsung citing operating costs and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption. While AI-related jobs grew, retrenched workers faced longer periods before re-employment, and real wage growth in the medium-term has also remained modest. These trends may be symptomatic of a gradual and broader divergence between existing workforce skillsets and market demand, despite extensive retraining programs. The issue of public housing affordability has intensified as a key social concern. An increasing number of ‘million dollar flats’ are being transacted — a small proportion of the total transactions of public housing units, but still indicative of the rapid increase in resale prices. Public policy has been focused on ensuring that first-time purchases of public housing remains within reach. But escalating resale prices have had spillover effects on fertility decisions. Public housing resale prices for 2024 are estimated to increase by 7 to 8 per cent while median gross nominal income grew by 5.8 per cent. With the majority of households in public housing servicing their mortgages through CPF contributions alone, households intending to have larger families will require larger housing. But as housing price increases exceed wage growth, concerns that retirement adequacy will be compromised by mortgage servicing demands can influence family planning decisions. Fundamentally, despite having stated a willingness to reconsider accepted wisdoms, there remains limited disposition for change from prevailing government policy orthodoxies. The Majulah Package reinforces Singapore’s reliance on state-managed CPF contributions for retirement financing. While the SkillsFuture Jobseeker scheme marks a new shift towards greater unemployment support, official messaging continues to emphasise that the onus remains on the individual in ensuring their retirement adequacy. Individuals continue to bear a disproportionate share of macroeconomic, longevity and inflation risk. The immediate focus of the fourth generation leadership team is to secure a mandate in the next general election, which must be held by November 2025 in what is likely to be a more volatile global economic environment. Singapore’s position as a major shipping and logistics hub means that it will face significant spillover effects from broad US tariff impositions and signs of slowing growth in China. The People’s Action Party has consistently highlighted its governance track record, particularly citing the October 2024 conviction of a sitting minister since 1986 for having accepted personal gifts while in public office as an example. But as recent election results show, immediate socioeconomic concerns can have an outsized influence on voter decisions. As Singapore navigates an increasingly volatile global environment, the gap between maintaining established approaches and addressing emerging challenges will widen. The formal establishmentof the Johor–Singapore Economic Zone will enhance jobs and development prospects in the face of likely continued global volatility. The government’s ability to balance continuity with adaptation will shape both social outcomes and political dynamics ahead of the upcoming election.

The Middle Corridor: A Route Born Of The New Eurasian Geopolitics...	By Paulo Aguiar The Middle Corridor, also known as the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR), is quickly becoming a key trade link between Western China and Europe, bypassing both Russia’s Northern Corridor and the Suez Canal. This network of rail, road, and maritime transport offers a shorter and more efficient trade route. Its importance has grown significantly, especially in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, making it an appealing option for international commerce. While the corridor has expanded rapidly, it still faces infrastructure, operational, and geopolitical challenges that require ongoing investment and collaboration. This article explores the structure, strategic importance, challenges, and future potential of the Middle Corridor within the evolving landscape of Eurasian trade. The Vision of the Middle Corridor The Middle Corridor incorporates rail, road, and maritime transport, linking major economic centers across China, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Europe. The route begins in China, where goods are loaded onto rail freight services originating in industrial hubs like Xi’an, Chongqing, and Urumqi. These shipments are transported westward through Kazakhstan, utilizing an extensive railway network that connects key transit hubs such as Dostyk, Altynkol, and Khorgos. Upon reaching the Kazakh Caspian Sea ports of Aktau and Kuryk, cargo is transferred onto maritime vessels that cross the Caspian Sea, a crucial yet challenging segment of the corridor. The ports of Aktau and Kuryk play a significant role in facilitating trade between Central Asia and the South Caucasus, but limitations in shipping capacity, outdated port infrastructure, and weather-related disruptions pose operational hurdles. Investment in port expansion, automation, and logistics services aims to mitigate these challenges and increase the efficiency of trans-Caspian shipments. Yet despite these ongoing improvements, the Caspian maritime segment continues to be a logistical bottleneck. Once across the Caspian Sea, goods arrive at Baku/Alat in Azerbaijan, where they continue their overland journey toward Europe. Azerbaijan’s relatively modern rail infrastructure, including the Baku International Sea Trade Portand the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) Railway, facilitates seamless transit. The BTK Railway, which connects Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, is itself a crucial link in rail connectivity, enabling the swift movement of goods into Turkey and beyond into European networks. Originally designed to handle 6.5 million tons of freight annually, the BTK Railway is set to increase its capacity to 17 million tons by 2034, further strengthening the Middle Corridor’s logistics backbone. The Middle Corridor’s ability to integrate rail, maritime, and road transport networks offers a degree of flexibility, allowing cargo to be rerouted based on demand fluctuations, seasonal disruptions, and shifting geopolitics. Logistics hubs, customs coordination, and trade facilitation initiatives are being actively developed to improve efficiency and enhance the competitiveness of the corridor. A Strategically Significant Trade Route The Middle Corridor has emerged as the fastest and most direct trade route between China and Europe, reducing distances by approximately 2,500 kilometers compared to the Northern Corridor. Transit times range from 10 to 15days, significantly improving upon traditional routes, which required anywhere from 15 to 60 days. By circumventing Russia, the corridor offers an opportunity to enhance supply chain resilience and mitigate risks associated with trade restrictions. The economic significance of the corridor continues to expand, with trade volumes skyrocketing in recent years. Over the first 11 months of 2024, 4.1 million tons of cargo moved through the corridor, representing a 63% year-over-year increase. Increased trade along the corridor stimulates industrial growth, job creation, and infrastructure development in transit countries, thereby strengthening regional economies and reinforcing positions along the global supply chain. Geopolitically, the corridor offers an appealing alternative to Russia’s transit infrastructure, particularly amid Western sanctions against Moscow. The European Union is actively investing in transport infrastructure within the region, viewing the corridor as a means of counterbalancing Russian and Chinese influence. The investments are intended to reduce dependency on Russian-controlled trade routes, particularly in energy transit and freight logistics. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are among the key financial institutions supporting infrastructure improvements in the Middle Corridor. Turkey in particular is solidifying its status as a strategic transit hub and leveraging deep economic and cultural connections with Central Asia. As a bridge between Asia and Europe, Turkey’s role in the corridor enhances its geopolitical standing and strengthens its influence in regional trade and economic diplomacy. Through the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars Railway and Marmaray Tunnel, Turkey provides seamless connectivity to European markets, bypassing traditional trade routes to the north. Meanwhile, China views the Middle Corridor as an extension of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), reducing reliance on Russian transit routes while improving its access to European markets. By diversifying trade routes, China aims to increase its export efficiency and expand economic engagement with Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the EU. The development of smart logistics hubs, rail terminals, and customs digitization along the corridor is further integratingChina’s western regions into global supply chains, accelerating economic growth in these previously underdeveloped areas. As geopolitical tensions continue to reshape global trade networks, the Middle Corridor has emerged as a favored alternative to traditional routes. Its ongoing development can be expected to enhance Eurasian connectivity and global supply chain security, all the while developing and diversifying the economies along its path. Challenges & Constraints: Can the Vision be Realized? Several challenges stand in the way of the Middle Corridor realizing this potential, however. One overriding concern is the limited transport capacity of the route at present. Rail networks in Azerbaijan and Georgia are struggling with shortages in locomotives and wagons, leading to congestion. Maritime transport across the Caspian Sea is another severe bottleneck due to the limited vessel availability, outdated port infrastructure, and slow cargo-handling processes. Moreover, ice formation in winter and strong winds occasionally halt operations, further decreasing efficiency. The corridor also lacks modern logistics hubs, which are crucial for ensuring efficient transit, cargo consolidation, and storage of goods. Regulatory inconsistencies further complicate trade. Customs procedures, tariff structures, and trade regulations differ significantly between the countries along the route, leading to inefficiencies in border crossings and transit logistics. Without harmonized trade policies and standardized pricing models, logistics operators face unpredictability in costs and delays in delivery timelines. Complex documentation requirements and lengthy inspections at border crossings further exacerbate transit inefficiencies. All of this translates into a markedly low capacity for trade volume along the Middle Corridor—estimated at only about 5% of the Northern Corridor’s capacity—and increased traffic has, at times, extended transit times to as long as 40 days. The Middle Corridor is also significantly more expensive than the Northern Corridor and, especially, traditional sea routes. Transportation costs for a 40-foot container range from $3,500 to $4,500 in the Middle Corridor, compared to $2,800 to $3,200 in the Northern Corridor. Meanwhile, maritime routes are far more cost-effective, with prices between $1,500 and $2,000 per container. This substantial cost difference often outweighs the longer transit time, particularly as ships can transport ever-growing volumes of cargo. Geopolitical uncertainty adds another layer of complexity. While Russia’s trade dominance has diminished, Moscow may exploit the corridor to bypass Western sanctions, while Turkey could leverage its central position against European interests. Additionally, political instability in transit countries, ongoing territorial disputes, and shifting alliances could disrupt supply chains and create additional risks for investors and logistics companies. Simultaneously, the EU’s increasing role in developing the corridor raises concerns about potential over-reliance on Chinese trade, which could contradict its own strategy of economic de-risking. Finally, the corridor requires a substantial financial commitment to realize the ambitious plans outlined above, with an estimated €18.5 billion funding gap for infrastructure modernization. Private-sector investment remains limited due to uncertainties regarding long-term trade volumes and potential political risks, making securing financing a major challenge. Current Projects and Future Prospects Several key initiatives and investments are shaping the future trajectory of the Middle Corridor, with Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey spearheading infrastructure modernization projects. Kazakhstan is enhancing rail connectivity around Almaty, while Azerbaijan is upgrading Baku Port to accommodate higher cargo volumes and integrate advanced logistics technologies to improve efficiency. Efforts to streamline border procedures and harmonize trade regulations are also progressing. The Trans-Caspian Transport Corridor Coordination Platform, established in 2024, aims to improve cross-border collaboration, creating a more seamless customs process and reducing delays for freight operators. Additionally, plans to digitize customs clearance and implement smart tracking systems will enhance transparency and reduce transit times across the corridor. Further investments are being directed toward railway electrification projects, expansion of intermodal logistics hubs, and enhancing port automation to meet growing trade demands. Strategic partnerships with international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, are also being pursued to bridge the aforementioned funding gap.

Could Stronger Leadership By Manmohan Singh Have Prevented The Ri...	By Arun Kumar Glowing tributes are being paid to Manmohan Singh. Not only it is an Indian tradition to praise the departed, but much has changed since he demitted the prime ministership following the rout of the Congress in 2014. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA)-II headed by him was characterised by policy paralysis and non-performance and that was exploited by the BJP and Narendra Modi. But today, Singh comes across as a democrat and the contrast with the present times is stark. Today, freedom is under attack, the functioning of democratic institutions is stressed and relations among communities are so fraught that social and political tensions have reached new heights. The autonomy of universities, the media, the judiciary, the police, etc. is being dented so as to further the agenda of the ruling party. Appointments to important positions are based on personal loyalty. The PM seems to be perpetually on campaign mode and his speeches are often not in keeping with the dignity of the high office he occupies. Today, critics instead of being appreciated are labelled as anti-national. A foreign hand out to destabilise India is seen behind many NGOs working with marginalised groups. The future of democracy looks bleak, while it was thriving under the UPA, even if it was somewhat chaotic. Corruption of the high and mighty was being exposed then, while today it remains under wraps due to the tight control kept on officialdom so that the media is unable to access it. The PM prefers fixed interviews rather than press conferences, unlike in earlier times. What underlies this rapid transformation in the power structure and people’s consciousness? Why have the checks on the unbridled power of the PM again dissipated? No doubt it is a result of the opposition’s weaknesses. These are two sides of the same phenomenon and Singh, who was at the centre of power for much of the 30-plus years prior to 2014, has to share responsibility for it. Rightward drift Since 1971, Singh occupied important positions in government. First as a bureaucrat implementing policy and then as a policymaker. He was a part of nearly every government till 2014 and that testifies to his capacity to adjust to the various hues of policies. The left-of-centre policies of the early 1970s gave way during the Emergency to right-of-centre policies. This trend accelerated with the Janata government and became consolidated with the new economic policies (NEP) implemented in 1991. When Indira Gandhi returned to power in 1980, India faced a balance of payments (BOP) crisis. It had to seek the IMF’s help and agree to its conditionalities, like the liberalisation of imports, the relaxation of controls and the promotion of consumerism. This caused foreign debt to rise from $10 billion in 1980 to $93 billion by 1989. Initially it was financed by long-term borrowing, but from 1985 it was replaced by short-term borrowing, which dried up in 1988-89 with the oil crisis hitting the world. A BOP crisis ensued and the rupee weakened, leading to the increased flight of capital. Foreign exchange reserves declined all through 1989-90 in spite of loans from the IMF. Could Singh as RBI governor as well as Planning Commission member (1980-82) and deputy chairperson (1985-87) have cautioned the government about such opening-up? After all, the report of the South Commission headed by Julius Nyerere, of which Singh was secretary general, had (in a widely quoted paragraph) cautioned the developing world against seeking IMF adjustment as this would be disastrous for it. Yet, as soon as he took over as finance minister in June 1991, India accepted IMF conditionalities. The BOP crisis immediately eased because foreign banks started to lend to India and the flight of capital declined. The World Bank by 1989 realised that India was headed towards a crisis and had prepared seven reports on what India should do regarding trade, industry, finance, etc. Former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar accused Singh in parliament that as his chief economic adviser, Singh had not shown him these reports. Singh rapidly implemented these readymade policies and the crisis eased. For instance, a devaluation of the rupee by 23% was recommended and India implemented that in two steps on July 1 and July 3, 1991. Since Singh had flagged the long-term impact of conditionalities in the South Commission report, he could have modified them to soften the impact on the marginalised sections. The conditionalities were known to be pro-business and even the World Bank had realised by the mid-1980s that these policies, termed as the Washington Consensus, would aggravate inequality and poverty. So it had suggested setting up ‘safety nets’ for the poor. But, invoking ‘TINA’ (‘there is no alternative’), the NEP were implemented without safety nets. The NEP were opposed by trade unions, opposition parties and NGOs because of their adverse implications for the marginalised. Bharat bandhs were organised every six months till late 1994. An alternative budget spelling out the alternative to the NEP was presented to an assembly of citizens in 1993 and 1994. Yet, Singh went ahead in spite of these cautionary voices. Opening up the economy The NEP were justified on the grounds that the Indian economy was closed and that was why it faced a crisis. The corollary was to open up and align with the Western bloc. The collapse of the Soviet bloc enhanced the relevance of this idea. So, India embarked on marketisation, with the state retreating from the markets. But India in 1991 was as open or closed as Japan, the US and China. The openness of an economy is measured by the share of its exports and imports in the GDP and for all these large economies, it ranged between 6% and 9%, similar to India’s. So, this argument was just a ploy for pushing the paradigm change in policies. Following marketisation, the stock market became the yardstick of the success of economic policies. Post-NEP, when the economy was tanking, the stock market was booming. When questioned in parliament, Singh stated, 'I won’t lose my sleep over the stock market'. For Harshad Mehta, the big bull, this was the cue to continue his stock market manipulations. Singh also met Mehta in the finance ministry in February 1992 and agreed to exempt the holding of shares from wealth tax, further fuelling speculation. The bubble burst on April 6, 1992 and the Harshad Mehta scam came to light. The Janakiraman Committee Report estimated its size to be Rs 3,124 crore – the largest scam of the 1990s. In brief, India swung further to the Right in economic terms post-1991. This had already taken place in political and social terms and these three trends reinforced each other. Implications What does swinging to the Right imply? It is the removal of equality and equity from the policy agenda. The celebration of greed, fuelling speculation, consumerism and atomisation. The promotion of the interest of businesses, whether national or multinational corporations, rather than of the collectivity. The motto became ‘grow the pie first’. It was said, ‘don’t distribute poverty’. The public sector had to retreat to make the market available to the private sector for its growth. Employment, education and health had to be obtained from the market. The state’s responsibility for providing these to the marginalised sections declined. Social sector budgets were curtailed, leading to growing privatisation in the fields of education and health. So, there has been inadequacy of public health facilities, as revealed during the pandemic, and poor standards of public education, as revealed by Annual Status of Education Reports. The rising black economy and corruption led to policy failure and disenchantment with government. Large scams took place during Singh’s finance ministership from 1991 to 1996 and during his prime ministership from 2004 to 2014. This sullied the image of both the Congress and of Singh. The right to information (RTI) was one way to tackle corruption and an Act was passed in 2005, but it kept the top ruling echelons out of its purview. The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, an essential accompaniment to the RTI, was passed in 2014 and diluted by an amendment in 2015. These dilutions undermined the effectiveness of RTI. The UPA implemented the various ‘safety net’ provisions under the rights to food, employment and education. But Singh and his two senior colleagues on economic matters resisted them since these were not in consonance with market functioning. They also invoked the shortage of resources. However, Sonia Gandhi, the head of the National Advisory Council, stood firm and these rights were adopted. Inability to be firm Corruption, inequality, poverty, unemployment and policy paralysis during UPA rule were invoked by Modi before coming to power in 2014. Letting these issues fester eased the path of the Right. Even to this day, these earlier weaknesses are used to divert attention from the present day non-performance of the government. They are also used to threaten the opposition leadership with prosecution so as to prevent them from developing a counter-narrative. Singh was squeaky clean but did not check corruption all around him. Any number of examples of his honesty and simplicity are presented by his admirers. But, honesty is indivisible – it has to be systemic and not just personal. This weakness manifested itself during his term as FM and as PM. He also could not rein in his ministers. The nationalist-minded businessmen who saw the danger of the indiscriminate opening up of the economy formed the Bombay Club. It folded up prematurely due to government pressure. The opportunity it provided to Singh to soften the NEP by claiming resistance in the country was not exploited since he could not stand against the pressure from foreign capital. Unlike China, which exploited the WTO after joining it to become a superpower in two decades, India did not move strategically. Singh could have tested the waters by acting more firmly. After all, Sonia Gandhi also needed him. For example, as a former academic, he could have insisted on greater allocations to education and health to fulfil the goals of 6% of GDP for education and 3% for health. The secret of China’s dramatic rise lay in its prioritisation of these social sectors and R&D. Marketisation also led to growing consumerism post-1991 and helped the ruling establishment divert the people’s attention from the real issues of unemployment, price rise, etc. It favoured the organised sector, which led to rising unemployment and inequality. It has caused the share of profits in the GDP to rise and fuelled inequality. This has narrowed the base of growth, which has not only made it unstable, but dependent on foreign markets and foreign capital flows and in a vicious cycle that requires giving more and more concessions to businesses. Conclusion Tributes to Singh as a person are well-deserved, but the focus needs to be on his contributions to the nation’s journey. As an economist, he knew of the adverse impact of the paradigm shift he set in motion in 1991. He wrote about it in the South Commission report. If he had been more firm and helped moderate the impact on the marginalised, today the Right may not have become the dominant force in Indian politics and society. In the 1980s too, he did little to head off the impending crisis that analysts were pointing to. His contribution to policy was the implementation after 1991 of the World Bank and IMF programme on behalf of international finance capital. That endeared him to these forces and the Indian elite, which wanted to link up with the global elite. This led India into the strategic orbit of the US rather than towards an independent path and into marketisation and atomisation, which helped the Right to push its ideology. Equity was dropped from the policy agenda so that the welfare of the collective was pushed to the margins. All this created the fertile ground for the nation to swing to the Right.

Russia: Getting Alternative Civilian Service ‘A Hellishly Difficu...	By Victoria Arnold Military officials in Russia are continuing to deny many young men the opportunity to perform Alternative Civilian Service (ACS), rather than military service, despite their demonstrating their pacifist convictions to the military authorities. If a Conscription Commission refuses ACS and the man does not appear when called up for military service, he is vulnerable to prosecution under Criminal Code Article 328 ('Evasion of conscription into military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). This can incur large fines or up to 2 years' imprisonment (see below). A court in Krasnoyarsk Region found Baptist Zakhar Asmalovsky guilty under this Article in November 2024 and fined him 60,000 Roubles, about three weeks' average local wages. Krasnoyarsk Region Military Commissariat did not respond to Forum 18's questions, including why it had refused Asmalovsky ACS. The court did not respond to questions as to why it convicted him despite his requests for ACS (see below). Conscripts who want to do Alternative Civilian Service (ACS) can be caught up in a cycle of repeated applications, refusals, and lawsuits which can last years, and may result in their being sent to military units anyway. German Strelkov, another Baptist from Khanty-Mansi Autonomous District, has applied unsuccessfully for ACS at least three times. He is currently going through his fourth round of legal proceedings in his attempt to realise his right to conscientious objection (see below). The authorities do not disclose the number of applications for ACS, but human rights defenders – including from Call to Conscience, and human rights group Citizen.Army.Law - think that the number is rising. Sergey Krivenko, director of Citizen.Army.Law, thought in May 2024 that the numbers may have risen two or three times. Human rights defenders also think that Conscription Commissions are increasingly rejecting such requests, and courts in their turn are increasingly failing to uphold the right to alternative service on grounds of conscience (see below). Both these trends appear to have resulted from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent mobilisation of reservists (men who have already completed conscript service) in 2022. The numbers of those who are doing ACS have also significantly risen. According to Russian federal statistics, 1,199 young men were doing ACS in the first half of 2023, and by the first half of 2024 the number had risen to 2,022 (see below). 'After the war began, the situation changed dramatically, and now it has become very difficult to obtain ACS,' a Seventh-day Adventist from Krasnodar Region, Andrey Bondarenko, commented to Forum 18 from outside Russia. He noted that even a staff member at the military registration and enlistment office had told him that 'getting ACS is now a hellishly difficult task' (see below). 'In my opinion, the situation will only get worse, and if obtaining alternative service now is a lottery, where you can either get it or not, then soon it will be completely impossible to do,' Bondarenko added (see below). Many young men who apply for Alternative Civilian Service (ACS) are members of the Council of Churches Baptists, which has a strong pacifist tradition. While the church does not formally oppose the undertaking of military service, when Baptist conscripts apply for ACS, church communities tend to support them in collating documents for the Conscription Commission and going to court if refused. Other ACS applicants are known to come from the Seventh-day Adventist and other Protestant traditions and occasionally from Orthodox backgrounds, or describe themselves simply as Christian. Others are pacifists without a religious motivation. Until their organisations were liquidated and their activities banned as 'extremist' in 2017, Jehovah's Witnesses constituted approximately 60 per cent of applicants for alternative civilian service and were usually successful, Sergey Krivenko of the human rights group Citizen.Army.Law observed to Radio Liberty's Sibir.Realii. Now, however, young Jehovah's Witness men risk investigation and prosecution for 'continuing the activities of an extremist organisation' if they cite active involvement in their religious communities as evidence of their beliefs. International human rights law The United Nations (UN) Human Rights Committee, in General Comment 22 on Article 18 ('Freedom of Thought, Conscience or Religion') of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), states that 'the right to refuse to perform military service (conscientious objection)' derives from Article 18. Similarly, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) also states that conscientious objection to military service comes under ICCPR Article 18 and has recognised 'the right of everyone to have conscientious objection to military service as a legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'. The OHCHR also notes in its Conscientious Objection to Military Service guide that Article 18 is 'a non-derogable right .. even during times of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation'. In 2022 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated (WGAD-HRC50) that 'the right to conscientious objection to military service is part of the absolutely protected right to hold a belief under article 18 (1) of the Covenant [the ICCPR], which cannot be restricted by States.' The Working Group also stated that 'States should refrain from imprisoning individuals solely on the basis of their conscientious objection to military service, and should release those that have been so imprisoned.' Russia (as the Soviet Union) ratified the ICCPR in 1973. Alternative Civilian Service: Background All Russian men must carry out military service for 12 months between the ages of 18 and 30 (raised from 27 in January 2024). After this they are enrolled in the reserves (and thereby become subject to mobilisation – as occurred in autumn 2022). It is possible to gain exemption on medical grounds, or deferrals for medical or educational reasons and in certain family situations. Conscripts also have the right, enshrined in the Constitution, 'to replace [military service] with Alternative Civilian Service [ACS]', and instead work in a state or municipal institution, or in a civilian role in the armed forces, for a longer period. As yet, the explicit right to Alternative Civilian Service exists only for conscripts, with no equivalent provided for in law for mobilised men. Some have been able to avoid mobilisation to fight in Ukraine by applying for ACS anyway. Applicants for ACS who are not from Russia's indigenous peoples must demonstrate that military service is contrary to their beliefs. Under the 2002 Law on Alternative Civilian Service, 'Citizens who have expressed a desire to replace conscripted military service with Alternative Civilian Service must substantiate [their claim] that military service is contrary to their beliefs or religion', and set out 'the reasons and circumstances [prichiny i obstoyatelstva] that prompted [them] to apply for this'. If a Conscription Commission does not accept that a conscript genuinely holds such beliefs, then it can refuse his application. Russian and international human rights bodies - including the Movement of Conscientious Objectors and the European Bureau for Conscientious Objection - argue that such procedures are often not carried out fairly or independently. Military officials put undue pressure on ACS applicants, and decisions are largely taken by military commissars, despite Conscription Commissions being ostensibly independent organs chaired by local civilian officials. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Russian Federation, Mariana Katzarova, stated in her 28 October 2024 report (A/79/508) that 'torture and ill treatment have been used by Russian army commanders against conscientious objectors, mobilized men and regular servicemen who refuse to obey orders to fight against Ukraine'. Katzarova called on the Russian authorities to 'Guarantee consistent application of the process for the evaluation of citizens requesting to undertake alternative civilian service'. The Conscription Commission may refuse an application if: a) the deadline is missed or the procedure incorrectly followed; b) the submitted documents and other information 'are not in accordance with the citizen's arguments that military service is contrary to his beliefs or religion'; c) the submitted information is false; d) the individual has twice failed to appear at meetings of the Conscription Commission; e) an individual has previously been granted ACS and has failed to do it. Russia's Constitutional Court ruled on 17 October 2006 that a missed deadline should not be grounds for outright refusal to consider a request for ACS on its merits. This remains, however, the most common reason for denying ACS. The conclusion that an individual's submitted information does not back up his professed beliefs is the second most common reason. If an applicant is unsuccessful, he can either appeal to a higher-level Conscription Commission or file an administrative lawsuit at a district-level court, requesting that the Conscription Commission's decision be ruled unlawful. Going to court means that the implementation of the Conscription Commission's decision is suspended until the court's decision enters into legal force. If a lawsuit is initially unsuccessful, the plaintiff has one month to appeal, and the decision does not enter legal force before the appeal ruling. It is therefore likely that the call-up period will end before the lawsuit is resolved, meaning that the individual is not liable to be conscripted immediately even if his legal challenge fails. He can then make a new application for alternative service in the next call-up period. Alternative Civilian Service increasing in popularity? On 1 January 2024, an amendment to the Law on Military Service came into force which raised the upper age limit for conscription from 27 to 30, thus creating a much larger pool of potential conscripts. The lower limit remains at 18. According to Russian federal statistics, 1,645 young men were doing Alternative Civilian Service (ACS) in the second half of 2023. This was a 37 per cent increase on the 1,199 young men doing ACS in the first half of 2023. It was also the first time the figure had exceeded 1,200 since records began in 2013, from which the average number to 2024 was about 1,150 young men doing ACS. In the first half of 2024, the number rose again to 2,022. (This data is published with a six-month delay, so the first half of 2024 is the latest period for which figures are available.) No statistics are available on the filing of applications for ACS, but 'our feeling is that the number of people interested in this has increased two to three times', Sergey Krivenko, director of human rights group Citizen.Army.Law, commented to Radio Liberty's Sibir.Realii on 14 May 2024. (Citizen.Army.Law informs conscripts of their rights and helps them prepare applications for alternative civilian service. The Justice Ministry added the organisation to its register of foreign agents on 3 December 2021.) Despite the rise in the number of applications, 'We see a negative trend, when both Conscription Commissions and courts are increasingly trying to refuse citizens in their desire to undergo ACS, and refuse them without reason', Krivenko noted. According to Krivenko, ACS numbers are possibly under 0.1 per cent of the entire conscription cohort, 'but for some reason, military registration and enlistment offices regard this as a threat', particularly since the invasion of Ukraine. Krivenko thinks that rising interest in the alternative service option is because of the 'high risks for conscripts' – that they will be coerced into signing a contract, or sent to guard border areas, where they may be subjected to Ukrainian shelling or cross-border raids by Russian troops fighting on the Ukrainian side. Criminal prosecution of Zakhar Asmalovsky, Krasnoyarsk Region Baptist Zakhar Igoryevich Asmalovsky, from Krasnoyarsk Region, has applied for Alternative Civilian Service three times since September 2023. Officials have refused every application. After he did not turn up when summoned by the military registration and enlistment office, Berezovka District Court fined him 60,000 Roubles (about three weeks' average wages in Krasnoyarsk Region) under Criminal Code Article 328, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription into military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service') on 29 November 2024. Asmalovsky has lodged an appeal. 'We testify to the faith of our brother Zakhar, [and] his beliefs, and are ready to speak for him in court, about which written testimony was also prepared', Council of Churches Baptists noted on Telegram on 27 September 2024, before Asmalovsky's criminal conviction. 'We ask you to pray for him that God will help him remain faithful, grant him spiritual strength and wisdom to maintain his Christian testimony before the world, and also for the mercy of the Lord when his [criminal] case is heard in court.' Asmalovsky has twice challenged military officials' refusal to allow him ACS in court. His first administrative lawsuit was unsuccessful at Berezovka District Court on 7 September 2023 and he appealed unsuccessfully at Krasnoyarsk Regional Court on 24 November 2023. After the Conscription Commission again denied Asmalovsky ACS in the spring of 2024, Berezovka District Court refused to uphold his second lawsuit on 27 May 2024 (unsuccessful appeal on 13 August 2024). Asmalovsky later made a third application for ACS – with this one, he missed the deadline, a fellow Baptist told Forum 18 on 4 December 2024. He does not appear to have lodged another administrative suit. Having considered Asmalovsky's first lawsuit, the District Court judge concluded that neither Asmalovsky's autobiography nor the reference from his place of study 'indicates that [his] beliefs and religion preclude conscripted military service' and 'the mere fact that he is a believer and attends church cannot serve as an unconditional basis for replacing his military service with Alternative Civilian Service'. In spring 2024, Asmalovsky 'went away and did not appear when summoned', his fellow Baptist explained to Forum 18. Prosecutors then charged him under Criminal Code Article 328, Part 1 ('Evasion of conscription into military service in the absence of legal grounds for exemption from this service'). This carries the following possible punishments:- a fine of up to 200,000 Roubles;- up to 2 years' assigned work;- up to 6 months' 'arrest' (defined by Criminal Code Article 54 as 'holding the convicted person in conditions of strict isolation from society'); or- up to 2 years' imprisonment. Forum 18 wrote to Krasnoyarsk Region Military Commissariat on 14 January 2025, asking:- why it had denied Asmalovsky's requests for Alternative Civilian Service (ACS);- what he should do to realise his constitutional right to ACS;- why he was subject to criminal prosecution;- and whether he would now be liable for conscription in the spring 2025 call-up.Forum 18 had received no response by the end of the working day in Krasnoyarsk Region of 24 January. Forum 18 also asked Berezovka District Prosecutor's Office and Krasnoyarsk Regional Prosecutor's Office why prosecutors had opened a criminal case against Asmalovsky and whether he would now be liable for conscription. Berezovka District Prosecutor Aleksey Nosovets replied on 22 January 2025. He confirmed that his office had opened a criminal case against Asmalovsky on 17 May 2024 but did not explain the reasons. He noted that individuals with unspent or unexpunged convictions are not subject to conscription. Berezovka District Court registered the criminal case against Asmalovsky on 31 May 2024. After six hearings, Judge Artur Nikitin found him guilty on 29 November 2024 and fined him 60,000 Roubles. Asmalovsky lodged an appeal on 10 December 2024. Krasnoyarsk Regional Court has not yet listed any hearings. If Asmalovsky's criminal conviction enters legal force, he will have an active criminal record (sudimost) for one year after he pays his fine. During this time, he cannot be called up for military service. Forum 18 asked Berezovka District Court why it had found Asmalovsky guilty, given that he had submitted several requests for Alternative Civilian Service. Forum 18 had received no response by the end of the working day in Krasnoyarsk Region of 24 January. German Strelkov, Khanty-Mansi: Multiple lawsuits, still no ACS Baptist German Aleksandrovich Strelkov, from Khanty-Mansiysk, appears to have made four applications for Alternative Civilian Service (ACS). Military officials rejected all of them, despite his providing evidence of his pacifist beliefs. He lodged administrative lawsuits challenging these decisions, but Khanty-Mansiysk District Court refused to uphold any of them. He now has until 28 January 2025 to file an appeal against the most recent court decision. Baptist Council of Churches brothers German and Daniil Aleksandrovich Strelkov first requested ACS in autumn 2023. Khanty-Mansiysk Military Commissariat and Conscription Commission rejected their applications. Khanty-Mansiysk District Court rejected their legal challenges on 27 November 2023, despite both brothers providing evidence of and witnesses to their Christian pacifist beliefs. Neither appears to have appealed. According to court records, Daniil Strelkov lodged no further lawsuits. It is unclear whether he was subsequently successful in realising his right to ACS, or whether he is now performing military service. The Khanty-Mansiysk military authorities continued to deny German Strelkov's repeated applications for ACS. He was unsuccessful in challenging these refusals on 23 May 2024, with unsuccessful appeals on 10 September 2024 at the Court of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Region and on 24 December 2024. He withdrew another lawsuit from consideration on 20 November 2024, apparently in advance of a further meeting of the Conscription Commission. This nevertheless rejected his latest application on 26 November. According to the 24 December court decision, seen by Forum 18, the Khanty-Mansiysk Conscription Commission refused to allow German Strelkov to do ACS on the grounds that the information he had submitted did not support his argument that military service would go against his beliefs. 'From the documents submitted by the administrative plaintiff .. it does not objectively follow and is not discernible that G.A. Strelkov actually has stable convictions, confirmed by his way of life [and] the nature of his social behaviour, over a significant period of time, which conflict with military service,' Judge Valery Cherkashin concluded. German Strelkov explained in his application that he had become a Christian at the age of 15, attends a Baptist Council of Churches church, and refuses to take up arms or study military matters, and included a petition from members of his church and testimonials from four fellow Baptists. Council of Churches Baptists have a strong pacifist tradition. Despite this, Judge Cherkashin decided that the application did not 'contain information indicating the formation of sincere and deep convictions in the applicant that make it impossible for [him] to perform military service'. Judge Cherkashin characterised German's repeated unsuccessful requests for ACS and the court's previous rulings against him as 'aimed at abusing the right to judicial protection, as well as the right to lodge an application for ACS'. Before the beginning of the working day of 24 January, Forum 18 asked Judge Cherkashin in writing why he had dismissed German Strelkov's evidence of and witnesses to his deeply-held Christian pacifist beliefs, and had refused to allow him to undertake ACS. Forum 18 had received no reply by the end of the court's working day in Khanty-Mansiysk of 24 January. Khanty-Mansiysk District Court had on 28 November granted German Strelkov a 'preliminary protection measure' suspending his conscription until any court decision came into force. Judge Cherkashin nevertheless overturned this in the 24 December ruling. The ruling is due to come into force one month after publication of the full written verdict, i.e. 28 January, if no appeal is lodged. Forum 18 has repeatedly asked the Khanty-Mansiysk Military Commissariat why it has repeatedly refused to allow German Strelkov to do Alternative Civilian Service (ACS), and what else he would need to include in his application in order to realise his right to ACS. Forum 18 had received no reply by the end of the working day in Khanty-Mansiysk of 24 January. Andrey Bondarenko, Seventh-day Adventist, Sochi Andrey Ilyich Bondarenko is a fifth-generation Seventh-day Adventist from the Black Sea city of Sochi. Adventists have a long-standing strong pacifist tradition. Officials refused Bondarenko Alternative Civilian Service (ACS) in April 2023 on grounds of missing the application deadline. The refusal came despite the Constitutional Court's 2006 ruling that this should not be a reason for not considering an application on its merits. Bondarenko's treatment at Sochi's military commissariat attests to the increasing difficulty conscripts have been facing in attempting to realise their right to ACS in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and to the aggressive attitude held by many officials towards 'non-traditional' religious denominations. Bondarenko, an undergraduate student, had an academic deferral from military service. This became invalid, however, when he transferred from one institution to another in 2022, as a result of a mistake by his first university. After his subsequent unsuccessful request for ACS, the academic deferral was reinstated once the universities clarified the matter with the military authorities. Nevertheless, the military authorities told Bondarenko he would have to return to the military commissariat in September 2023. 'Being on the watchlist of the Russian authorities and the military registration and enlistment office, I fled from this 'Evil Empire' [Russia] at the first opportunity, without waiting for the date indicated on the summons,' he explained to Forum 18 in January 2025. He and his family are now seeking asylum abroad. Upon applying for ACS, Bondarenko underwent a medical examination. Despite his having two 'significant' health issues, military medics passed him at the highest fitness level. Like other conscripts, he also had to see a psychologist. 'It was interesting to watch how, with all the guys ahead of me, [the psychologist] asked only a few basic and standard questions, like 'Do you have depression?', 'Do you have suicidal thoughts?' and after that he filled out the form and sent them away,' Bondarenko told Forum 18. 'And when it was my turn, he opened the computer (with information about me, as I understand it), his face changed greatly, and he began to ask me in a rude tone why I was a sectarian, why I didn't love my Motherland, whether I was an agent of Israel and the USA, and that THEY (the military registration and enlistment office) knew for sure that I was,' Bondarenko added. 'This nonsense continued for so long that a crowd of people formed around us, who watched this very strange process with interest. After an overly long interrogation, he shoved a piece of paper at me and let me leave the office.' Bondarenko nevertheless thought that he would be allowed to undertake ACS, given that other young men from his church had succeeded in doing so (including those who had missed the application deadline). They, however, had applied before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This was a time when, in Bondarenko's view, ACS was 'quite easy to obtain, since the state did not create any obstacles to it, as a result of the fact that .. officials simply had no time for this – they calmly took bribes, stole from state programmes and state orders, and did not particularly create obstacles to the observance of civil rights'. After the war began, 'the situation changed dramatically', Bondarenko thinks. 'Even the woman at the military registration and enlistment office who helped me collect the documents said that now getting ACS is a hellishly difficult task.' In online chats and communities for ACS applicants, 'everyone noticed the same thing: that a huge number of people were denied [ACS], and precisely at the beginning of the war', Bondarenko observed to Forum 18. 'Often, an attempt to send a person to war by the state is connected precisely with his political opinion, and anti-war activities, as well as his 'non-traditional religion', as it was with me.' Bondarenko described his experience at the meeting of the Conscription Commission on 4 April 2023 in an account for Christians Against War on 26 November 2024. A Federal Security Service (FSB) Colonel ('spitting all over the office in the heat of anger', as Bondarenko later told Forum 18) 'took my folder of papers and contemptuously threw it on the edge of the table, telling me that he would not read it, and shouted, literally: 'What kind of scum have we raised over 30 years of democracy that does not want to defend the Motherland! Explain to me what is wrong with going and killing those who have encroached on the Orthodox Church in Ukraine? Now you, a sectarian, will go to defend and fight for the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, for 200,000 Roubles. You have been denied alternative service, you will go to war as a normal soldier'.' The minimum monthly salary for a Russian soldier fighting in Ukraine is approximately 200,000 Roubles. All the other men who requested ACS on the same day (apparently on grounds of non-religious pacifist beliefs) also had their applications for ACS refused, Bondarenko noted. Bondarenko received a document, seen by Forum 18, refusing him ACS on grounds of missing the deadline. The Conscription Commission told him to report to a military commissar for a summons to military service on 11 April 2023. The missed deadline, Bondarenko observed to Forum 18, is the 'most convenient way' to refuse ACS: 'Considering that I was literally dragged to the military registration and enlistment office in the middle of the academic year, I physically could not submit an application on time, so such a response was a really vile bureaucratic trick.' The military commissar initially would not consider delaying the summons to allow Bondarenko either to finish the academic year or have the necessary treatment for his medical conditions. He also attempted to discourage him from going to court, since he 'would be drafted into the army right from the courtroom', Bondarenko wrote in his account for Christians Against War. Despite this, the commissar then agreed not to issue a summons for 11 April 2023 and gave Bondarenko a few days to get his academic deferral reinstated. Bondarenko's original university eventually did this, but 'Having seen the hand of God in receiving this deferral, we did not hesitate any longer, realising that in September I could be drafted into service, and if they did not draft me in September, they would draft me later and certainly to war, as this FSB officer had promised'. Bondarenko left the country later in 2023 with his family. Forum 18 wrote to Sochi City Conscription Commission on 17 January 2025 to ask:- why it had denied Bondarenko alternative civilian service for missing the application deadline when the Constitutional Court has ruled that this should not be a reason for refusal; and- why Bondarenko had been subjected to derogatory remarks about his religious affiliation by both the psychologist and a member of the commission.Forum 18 had received no reply by the afternoon of the working day in Sochi of 24 January 2025. Russia 'does not care about the law and the Constitution in which civil rights are written' 'I had to endure all this only because I am a Protestant,' Seventh-day Adventist Andrey Bondarenko told Forum 18. He noted that 'After the war [against Ukraine] began, we saw the acceleration of long-running processes that first of all hit civil rights and freedoms .. a systematic return to the times of the USSR.' While before it was possible to realise one's right to Alternative Civilian Service, now 'Russia needs soldiers, and it absolutely does not care about the law and the Constitution in which civil rights are written,' Bondarenko commented. 'Everyone who can be is mobilised for war, and often Protestants are deliberately forced to take up arms, knowing that they cannot do so.' Bondarenko added that some churches fear 'a complete ban as happened to Jehovah's Witnesses', and therefore shy away from helping their church members. (Russia's Supreme Court banned all Jehovah's Witness activity as 'extremist' in 2017. Courts have since then convicted hundreds of Jehovah's Witnesses on 'extremism'-related criminal charges, handing down long jail terms, suspended sentences and fines.) Bondarenko thinks the situation will only get worse. 'If now getting alternative service is a lottery, where you can either get it or not, then soon it will be completely impossible to do,' he told Forum 18. 'And the proof of this is in the war. There are thousands of photos on the Internet of the so-called 'torture pits' into which Russian soldiers who refuse to take up arms are thrown, where they sit for weeks without food and endure torture and beatings. All that remains is to pray to God that he intervenes and resolves this situation.' The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Russian Federation, Mariana Katzarova, stated in her 28 October 2024 report (A/79/508): 'At least 15 unofficial places of detention exist close to the front line where hundreds are kept and subjected to torture to punish them.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im2_wEODyNaIi_	2025-01-26T17:02:23-08:00	
How The US Became So Dysfunctional, Oligarchic, And Corrupt – OpE...	By Finn Andreen Why has the United States’ government become so politically dysfunctional? How can it be that the nation—partially founded on John Locke’s principles of liberty and Montesquieu’s concept of separation of powers—today has such a corrupt and oligarchic federal government? As the young political union that it was in 1781, based on the Articles of Confederation, the United States was unique. Unlike the nation-states of the Old Continent, it was based on the principle of limited government, natural rights of its citizens, and popular sovereignty. Yet, today, the federal government in Washington, DC is pursuing a policy incompatible with these principles, not only towards Americans themselves, but also abroad. Domestic politics in the US is, superficially, dominated by incessant public fights between different factions of the two ostensibly rival parties, thanks to the collaboration of establishment media and many social networks. Less obvious to the majority, the oligarchic and bipartisan character of the federal government consists in using the enormous political and financial means of the United States mainly to the benefit of a small minority. The majority gets the crumbs spread among a decaying infrastructure. In terms of foreign policy, the US government can be considered 'imperialist' since it tries to impose its will through legal, commercial, and military means, disregarding international law, if necessary. The idea of unipolarity—with the pole in Washington, DC—dates back to the end of the Cold War, but the hegemonic instincts go deeper. US territorial expansion was based on the concept of 'Manifest Destiny' already in the early 19th century. The federal government showed, at that time, the same commercial ambitions of domination, as those expressed today in often self-defeating excess and with such dire consequences worldwide. Notably, the US federal government invented a pretext to attack Mexico (1846-1848), overthrew the independent kingdom of Hawaii (1893), declared war on Spain on another pretext (1898), and whipped the Filipinos submission into (1899-1902). Clearly, Washington, DC pursues a domestic and foreign policy that goes against the founding principles of the United States. This has been possible due to the progressive subjugation of the States to a federal government with messianic ambitions of hegemony. The two critical moments happened—during the drafting of the Constitution, and later, during the Civil War. The Constitution Became Federalist The years following the creation of the United States are important to understand the ascendancy of its federal government, today alarmingly unbridled and unchecked. It is necessary to recall first the great debate that took place between Federalists and Anti-Federalists around the new Constitution. This debate clearly showed that, among the Founding Fathers, there were already some who were alarmed by the power that the new Constitution would confer on the new federal government at the expense of the states and the people of the United States. Indeed, the Anti-federalists—among them also Thomas Jefferson—were opposed to a ratification of the Constitution (1787) to replace the Articles of Confederation (1781), as they thought the latter better guaranteed the rights of the independent states in the Union. Thus, some Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution because they thought that a constitutionally strong federal government would threaten the rights of the states. Other Anti-Federalists argued that a new centralized government would take on all the characteristics of the despotism of Great Britain, from which they had just recently seceded. And still others feared that the new government would threaten their individual liberties. They were all right in their premonitions. The Anti-Federalists’ insistence nevertheless allowed the Bill of Rights to be adopted in 1791, spelling out Americans’ rights in relation to their government. They also persisted in seeing the states as being bound by the Compact Theory (the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 and 1799), thus confirming the legal and political supremacy of the states over the federal government. This would give, among other things, the right to each state to nullify (i.e. invalidate) any federal law that it considered to be unconstitutional. But it would soon become apparent that these initiatives were not enough to protect the liberties of the states, and the citizens of those states, from the encroachment of the federal government. It soon became apparent that foreign nations were not protected either. It should be remembered, though, that the Constitution does not explicitly authorize the federal government to bring new lands into the Republic, either through war or through trade (the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803 was controversial for this reason). The Constitution, in theory, limits the areas of responsibility of the federal government. But the lack of detail and, therefore, the freedom of interpretation of this document have contributed to giving the federal government, over time, a power that is unconstitutional. This is precisely the two-centuries-long confrontation between two radically different interpretations: the 'living constitution' and 'originalism.' The former view is largely responsible for the following federal laws: military conscription, 'Jim Crow' laws, the income tax, the Federal Reserve, Roe v. Wade, the Social Security Act, anti-drug laws, the Patriot Act, etc. Furthermore, representative democracy was not constitutionally provided for the executive and legislative branches in Washington, DC, as it was at the local level. As long as the federal government was small and weak—a political subject to the states—as was the intention of the Founding Fathers (at least the Anti-Federalists), this lack of democracy at the federal level mattered little. The Civil War Sealed the Fate of the States The power of the states was further eroded by the Civil War (though more properly called the 'War Between the States'). If the states of the Union were sovereign and independent—as the Articles of Confederation had made clear—why were they not also permitted to leave the Union? Indeed, no article in the Constitution restricts a state’s right to secede. This point became crucial during the Civil War, which was primarily an economic conflict between the Northern and Confederate States. It was through this war that President Abraham Lincoln consciously decided to seal the fate of the United States as a federal republic, and to definitively take the road that the Anti-Federalists had so feared. Lincoln’s letters show that he knew full well that, when he unconstitutionally ordered the federal government to militarily prevent the secession of the Confederate States, he was choosing to save the political United States of 1861 by going against its Constitution. Thomas DiLorenzo has thus showed that the Civil War was the moment when the modern state also arrived to America: the federal government then took definitive political ascendancy over the states, and the constitutional limits on its power were irremediably weakened. Indeed, after the Civil War, the federal government began to intervene more heavily in the US economy as well as militarily abroad for both commercial as well as expansionist reasons. The power relationship had been reversed from the original intent of the Anti-Federalists when the Constitution was signed. Today, this is also reflected in the fact that the states are heavily dependent on federal transfers; it now represents about a third of the states’ budgets. Lincoln’s responsibility for the political dystopia that the United States has become today was, therefore, decisive. But the federal government naturally sees his role in a very positive light, as shown by the never-ending veneration of Abraham Lincoln for a century and a half. It is instructive to compare the US with Europe in this regard. As European states moved from absolutism to parliamentarism and universal suffrage, both of which can act at times like a conduit for public opinion, such a conduit is far weaker in the US since the federal government is once removed from the people and yet no longer de facto subjected to the states. For libertarians—and especially those who know some European history—the conclusion is obvious: no document, however 'sacred,' can be a definitive protection against the will to power of the state and against its violations of individual freedom. It is, therefore, not enough to demand a strict constitutional framework of the 'originalist' type in the United States, but to fight by all means for a reduction of the power of the state. This is what defines the political action of the libertarian, not only in the United States, but everywhere a central government has gained the upper hand over society.

Musk’s Security Is A Concern – OpEd	By Kung Chan After co-chairwoman of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party Alice Weidel had a conversation with Elon Musk, the support rate for her party reached a historic high. If a federal election were held now, the party would rank second, with its support rate at the highest level in a year. Musk is now viewed by the left-wing sphere, which refers to left-wing parties and political supporters in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and other countries, as the embodiment of evil, believing that as long as Musk holds influence, the support for right-wing parties will rise. Voices of hatred from the left are growing louder, and if 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest, these voices are now approaching a level of 10. While politicians in the UK and Europe have been harshly criticizing Donald Trump for almost four years, and Musk has only made a few comments, yet the left-wing forces in the UK and Europe almost unanimously believe that Musk has 'interfered in European politics'. From an informational perspective, the outrage from the left is rapidly increasing and is nearly at its peak. Musk’s number of flights has been too frequent; although he has security, it is only the most basic form of protection. If we assess Musk's current security level, with 1 being the lowest danger and 10 being the highest, his security risk is now almost at a level of 8 to 9. In fact, we believe that Musk is almost completely exposed to danger.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im26XJv3kvIivN	2025-01-26T16:55:46-08:00	
China May Now Dare To Challenge The US Dollar – OpEd	By Jiahao Yuan Since the last fiscal quarter, the United States has officially started to cut interest rates. This is not surprising, but the extent of the rate cut exceeded many expectations. Even so, the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the US — colloquially referred to as 'the Fed' — envisions four more rate cuts in 2025 and 2026. If this continues, it will likely negatively impact the US financial market and cause China’s currency, called the renminbi (renminbi), to strengthen in the long run. It is even possible that the US will be 'harvested' by China in reverse. US may lose the dominant position in the US-China 'competition' Over the past half-century, due to its so-called advantages such as autocratic politics, the whole-nation system and unfair competition, China has developed rapidly in the fields of economy, science and technology. However, China’s bandit development logic over the years has also caused extreme dissatisfaction among most democratic countries in the world. This includes, most importantly, the US. In 2018, under the impetus of President Donald Trump’s administration, Western countries led by the United States launched a 'trade war' against China. Since the US holds the most powerful weapon in global trade — the dollar — China has been forced into a very passive position regarding global trade. However, it is unrealistic for the US to defeat communist China with a few trade barriers. The competition between major powers is often a long-standing game that depends not only on who has the bigger fist but also on who has a stronger determination. However, no one expected that in a few years, the US macro-economy would be in trouble. Since 2020, the US has experienced severe inflation. Usually, this requires the Fed to raise interest rates, but this is not the case. With the US debt hitting new highs, breaking through the $35.5 trillion mark at the end of 2024, the Fed is forced to lower interest rates in order to halt the debt pressure. If the Fed continues to cut interest rates, the advantage the US dollar has accumulated over the years will disintegrate more quickly. Many countries are now promoting a 'multi-currency' settlement system under the active advocacy of China. China is also eroding the original advantages of the dollar bit by bit. Last August, as soon as the news of the Fed’s upcoming interest rate cut was released, the renminbi roseby more than 1,000 basis points within just one week. It can be said that the losses the renminbi suffered due to past US interest rate hikes were all compensated at once. China is about to reap the US in reverse The US is currently at a crossroads: raising interest rates is not feasible with the current debt situation, but lowering interest rates further will cause extreme consequences. First, when the dollar depreciates, or loses value, capital suddenly becomes the most mischievous troublemaker. Investors are likely to go to other places such as China to find better investment returns. Capital is profit-seeking, and investors will go wherever the profit is higher. This means that more dollar funds would flow into China. Second, if the renminbi appreciates, or increases in value, it will boost the real purchasing power of Chinese consumers. This will substantially minimize the Chinese people’s dissatisfaction with the government. Third, there is a deeper 'currency war' brewing behind the scenes. The dollar’s global dominance has caused other countries to offload dissatisfaction onto the dollar. In other words, dissatisfaction with US monetary policy has reinforced China’s ability to challenge the United States to a certain extent. Fourth, although the depreciation of the dollar might result in sluggish exports for China, the appreciation of the renminbi may buy China more bargaining chips in the global game. The macroeconomic situation of the US is not very optimistic. Under such circumstances, the turmoil brought about by this wave of interest rate cuts in the US may open up more strategic opportunities for China. Therefore, in the coming year, any minor strategic mistake in US monetary policy is likely to lead to a fierce and fatal counterattack from China, which has been eyeing the US for a long time.

Unlike Stalin, Putin Will Leave Behind Not A Strong State But Onl...	In a new book, Amusing Russia. 228 Answers, Sergey Shelin argues that Vladimir Putin is concerned only with himself and his own survival and as a result is not so much building a new political system as destroying its existing institutions. He will thus leave behind him not a strong state as Stalin did but only 'ruins.' The murder of Muamar Qaddafi shocked Putin and led him to conclude that the West was after him and that he must do everything possible to save himself regardless of the consequences for Russia or for the international system, the Russian commentator says (severreal.org/a/posle-putina-ostanutsya-razvaliny-228-otvetov-na-vse-voprosy-o-rossii/33283990.html). That fear, Shelin continues, has put Putin on a very different trajectory than Stalin followed despite the frequent comparisons with the late Soviet dictator that are often made. 'Stalin,' he writes, 'adapted the state system of the USSR to himself and then worked to protect it.' 'Putin in contrast hats the state institutions of the Russian Federation' as constraints and has 'managed to destroy them all.' That has consequences for the future: 'After Stalin, a totalitarian dictatorship remained; after Putin, only ruins will be left' with the need to rebuild almost everything. According to Shelin, 'Stalin viewed the USSR as his ceation, but Putin looks at the Russian Federation as an instrument for his hobbies. All his feelings and interests are focused on himself. All his feelings and interests are focused on himself. That is why his state adventurism knows no bounds: he is not responsible to anyone for anything not even in his imagination.' Putin’s exclusive focus on himself is not unique to Russian leaders, but it is an extreme form of that disease and one that shows what can happen when institutions designed to limit such people instead are destroyed by them and then have to be rebuilt from the ground up, Shelin’s book suggests.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im27zdeg1qAiu3	2025-01-26T16:41:58-08:00	
With Trump In Power, US Quickly Deporting Undocumented Migrants	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. authorities are now arresting hundreds of undocumented migrants per day and sending them back to their home countries, carrying out President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign pledge to deport masses of migrants who have illegally entered the United States. 'We’re going to enforce immigration laws,' Vice President JD Vance told CBS News’ 'Face the Nation' on Sunday. More than 1,000 migrants were arrested with hundreds repatriated to other countries, including Guatemala last week, during the first days of the new Trump administration, according to figures compiled by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the White House. 'It’s going very well. We’re getting the bad, hard criminals out,' Trump told reporters Friday during a trip to North Carolina to view the flood recovery efforts from Hurricane Helene. Without evidence, he said, 'These are murderers. These are people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as anybody you’ve seen. We’re taking them out first.' The White House released photos of shackled migrants boarding a C-17 military transport aircraft for flights out of the United States. Trump’s 'border czar,' Tom Homan, told ABC’s 'This Week' show Sunday, 'There will be more arrests nationwide.' Trump authorized sending 1,500 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Homan said, 'You’ll see the numbers increase. They’re down there to create a secure border.' He said the U.S. is deporting 'as many as we can' arrest, with the focus first on those convicted of U.S. crimes and then moving on to detain and deport those whose asylum requests have been rejected by U.S. officials. 'We’re in the beginning stages,' Homan said. 'It’s not OK to violate the laws of this country,' Homan said. He urged undocumented migrants, even those who have not been ordered out of the U.S., to return to their home countries voluntarily. About 11 million undocumented migrants are believed to be living in the U.S., a staggering number that most officials believe will be impossible to deport. 'We’re going to do what we can with the money we have,' Homan said. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, urged his Republican colleagues in Congress to authorize more spending for the deportation effort. 'We haven't given the Trump team the resources,' Graham said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press' show. He said Homan 'needs to substantially hire more [immigration] agents. He needs to finish the [border] wall [with Mexico] and technology. He needs to go from 41,000 detention beds to 150,000 detention beds to make this work.' 'So, to my Republican colleagues, particularly in the House [of Representatives], as we fiddle, our immigration plans are hitting walls. We're not building walls, we're hitting walls. We need to give Tom Homan the money now to execute the plan that he's come up with. And without congressional funding this is going to hit a wall,' Graham declared. The Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants waiting in Mexico to request asylum through a mobile app, but Trump’s anti-immigration edicts are facing legal challenges. One judge has already temporarily blocked Trump from declaring that he no longer recognizes constitutionally guaranteed citizenship for children of undocumented migrants born in the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im20SSDNs-XzyJ	2025-01-26T16:37:29-08:00	
8 Questions For Philippine Sen. Risa Hontiveros About Her Adolesc...	By Jason Gutierrez In an interview with BenarNews, Philippine opposition Sen. Risa Hontiveros defended her controversial bill that seeks to address teenage pregnancy through a comprehensive sex education campaign, amid criticisms from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and conservative religious groups over its alleged provisions. Hontiveros, the principal author and sponsor of Senate Bill 1979, or the Adolescent Pregnancy Bill, submitted a new version of the proposed measure on Wednesday, following the backlash that forced some senators to withdraw their support. The controversy erupted as the Philippines struggles with the problem of rising teenage pregnancies. More than 500 adolescents become pregnant and give birth every day, giving the country the dubious distinction of having the highest adolescent birth rate in the region, according to the United Nations Population Fund. 'As the author of the bill, I am both surprised and disappointed at some of the lies spread on social media,' Sen. Hontiveros told BenarNews this week, referring to backlash over her proposed legislation. 'We all want what’s best for our children, but outright lies, disinformation and misinformation can lead to more harmful decisions about our teens’ lives,' she said. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. earlier promised to veto the bill, claiming the first version of the proposed measure contained shocking and explicit provisions. 'It is a travesty of what sexual and sex education should be to the children,' the president said on Monday, adding the bill contained 'woke absurdities' that were inappropriate for younger children. 'You will teach four-year-olds how to masturbate. That every child has the right to try different sexualities,' he said, referring to the alleged provisions of the bill’s first version. 'This is ridiculous.' 'If this bill is passed in that form, I guarantee all parents, teachers and children – I will immediately veto it,' Marcos said. 'I am a parent and I’m a grandparent. So, I feel very strongly about this.' Marcos’ outburst came out after Project Dalisay, an initiative of the National Coalition for the Family and Constitution – a church-backed conservative group – began an online petition against the bill. In this predominantly Catholic nation – 80% of Filipinos subscribe to the religion – the church has campaigned hard against sex education, with some conservative groups saying the bill could encourage more pregnancies among teens. Project Dalisay said the proposed law 'introduces policies that could undermine the innocence of our youth and traditional family structure.' Its proponents said the bill would 'hypersexualize children at a very young age' and among others, encourage 'early childhood masturbation.' But a quick study of the first version of the bill did not appear to include such provisions. Rather, there is a provision declaring that comprehensive sex education (CSE) in schools should be 'guided by international standards,' which Hontiveros says may have been misinterpreted as too liberal by the bill’s opponents. BenarNews had reached out to Hontiveros this week to ask her eight questions about her bill: BenarNews: President Marcos has said that the bill contained 'absurd' and 'shocking' provisions, is this true? Risa Hontiveros: No, it is not true. It is very clear that the bill does not include shocking provisions, not even the word 'masturbation.' Nowhere does it also say 'try different sexualities.' BN: Mr. Marcos vowed to veto the bill in its present form unless changes are made. Do you agree? RH: No. The bill contains the very same things that Mr. Marcos supports – teaching kids anatomy and the consequences of early pregnancy. That is what I am pushing for. I am willing to accept amendments to refine the bill, so we can steer it to passage. BN: Are legislators facing pressure from the Catholic Church or other religious groups? RH: No comment on that. BN: How big of a problem is sex education, or the lack thereof, among Filipino teenagers in the conservative Philippines? RH: The National Economic Development Authority has said that teenage pregnancies are a national and social emergency. That is the reason why we are working to have the Adolescent Pregnancy Bill passed in Congress, so we can help, support and protect the youth. This bill is not just necessary. It is urgent. We cannot ignore this issue anymore. As the author of the bill, I am both surprised and disappointed at some of the lies spread on social media. We all want what’s best for our children, but outright lies, disinformation and misinformation can lead to more harmful decisions about our teens’ lives. These outrageous claims from Project Dalisay were pulled out of thin air. As a mother of four, three of whom are girls, and faithful to the church, I will not stand for these lies. I am appealing on our stakeholders to have their voices heard to stop the spread of this fake news. BN: Why do you think that faith-based groups are engaged in 'fake' news to discredit the bill? RH: I don’t have a problem with different stakeholder organizations that are against this [bill]. But it should be all on the basis of facts, especially since the proposed law is aimed at protecting a very vulnerable sector of our society to the point that teenage pregnancy is considered a national and social emergency. BN: What happens now after you filed a substitute bill and after several senators withdrew their support? RH: We’ve filed the substitute bill. It is now very clear in its provision that it guarantees academic freedom and religious freedom …. I hope this brings us all together to finally pass a prevention of adolescent pregnancy bill that we so desperately need. The substitute bill clearly states that those who will be given comprehensive sexuality education are (children) 10 years old and above. And what they were earlier saying that the old version includes zero to 4-year-olds was a complete fabrication, 'fake' news and a lie. I hope the present form is now acceptable to everyone. BN: What is the implication now of the withdrawal of signatures [of the other senators who earlier supported the bill]? RH: I told them to re-study the substitute bill, which I think will unite the senators to address this national emergency BN: Were those opposing the bill properly represented when the bill was going through the committee-level hearings? RH: Yes. There were various organizations called and different faith communities too, including some who belong to Project Dalisay.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im2zcODhEWHFgj	2025-01-26T16:33:20-08:00	
The Ban On The Ukrainian Orthodox Church: An Overview Of The Situ...	The much-suffering eastern branch of Christianity—Orthodoxy—endured a challenging 20th century that tested its very existence. The horrors of confiscation of church property, the closure of monasteries and churches, and the seizure of church lands during the 1917 Revolution and under the Bolsheviks left deep scars. One might think that the 21st-century democracies of Eastern Europe would bring peace to religion, but unfortunately, we are facing new challenges today, right in the sacred city for Orthodoxy—Kyiv. In this article, I aim to delve into the overgrown field of national conflict, which remained quiet for many years but has recently flared up with explosive intensity. Each new headline further erodes Ukrainians' faith—in their state, their fellow citizens, and God. It also damages faith in oneself, for when chaos tears apart the old world and your voice is unheard, it is devastating. I hope to uncover whether this conflict was deliberately orchestrated—a cruel political maneuver allowing the ruling elites to further divide and conquer the population while waging two wars simultaneously: the external war with Russia and the internal war against democracy. After all, when elites fight their own people, can there be hope for victory in any war? The Beginning: 2014 and the Poroshenko Era (2014–2019) The first tremors of the conflict began during the war in 2014 and worsened over time. Until the Unification Council in December 2018, Ukraine had only the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), which had existed since October 1990. At this council, Epiphanius (Dumenko) was elected Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine. In January 2019, the Ecumenical Patriarchate granted the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) a tomos of autocephaly, recognizing its independence. In August 2024, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the law 'On the Protection of the Constitutional Order in the Sphere of Activities of Religious Organizations,' aimed at banning religious organizations associated with Russia. The law primarily targeted the UOC-MP, accused of supporting Russian aggression and spreading pro-Russian propaganda, according to Radio Svoboda. Under the law, religious organizations connected to Russia must sever all ties with the Moscow Patriarchate within nine months or face a ban on their activities in Ukraine. The law aims to strengthen Ukraine's spiritual independence and prevent Russia from influencing the country through religious structures, as reported by Korrespondent. 'At the height of societal tension, there is a clear understanding that the UOC is not a Ukrainian church.' – Mykhailo Podolyak, Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine. Society Divided The law’s adoption split public opinion. According to polls by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), about 66% of Ukrainians support banning the UOC-MP. This is unsurprising, given allegations of spies and FSB agents within the Ukrainian church. The UOC-MP did not recognize the legitimacy of the Unification Council and continues to consider the OCU a non-canonical structure. Many parishes and monasteries remain under the jurisdiction of the UOC-MP, maintaining ties with the Moscow Patriarchate. Transitions and Conflicts From 2022 to 2024, there has been a trend of religious communities transitioning from the UOC-MP to the OCU: 496 communities in 2022, 471 in 2023, and 218 in 2024. Despite these transitions, many parishes and monasteries remain under UOC control, preserving their connection to the Moscow Patriarchate. However, these transitions have not always been peaceful. Sometimes they escalated into violent clashes, with those unrelated to religion storming churches and using violence against priests, monks, and parishioners. One of the most horrific incidents occurred in Cherkasy, where the Archangel Michael Cathedral transitioned to the OCU on October 17, becoming a garrison church and a center for national-patriotic education. In response, UOC-MP priests and parishioners barricaded themselves inside the church early in the morning. Police arrived, followed by nationalists who stormed the building. Inside, violent clashes broke out. Nationalists used tear gas against UOC clergy and parishioners, with reports of beatings using sticks and threats with firearms. Many elderly women were injured, suffering fractures and mucosal burns. However, the church interior remained mostly undamaged. The police opened a case for hooliganism related to the events in the church, said National Police representative Zoya Volk. But in most cases, police and the state, instead of resolving conflicts, take sides—often against citizens accustomed to the UOC due to territorial traditions. This was evident during an attempted takeover of a church in Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi. Around midnight, nationalists arrived to break locks and seize the UOC Cathedral of the Savior Not Made by Hands. The police, present at the scene, negligently stood by. 'They went beyond the bounds of human nature.' – Ioann Nalapko, builder of the church. 'All seizures are carried out under the clear guidance, control, and strategic planning of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the police.' – Artem Dmytruk, Ukrainian MP. Conclusion This article reveals a horrifying picture: a religious schism among Ukrainian citizens, accompanied by the inaction—or even participation—of the authorities. The ruthless violence against priests, monks, and women, carried out by people in military uniforms, adds to the tragedy. War-torn Ukrainian society easily turns on a new enemy like a pack of dogs. I call on Christians worldwide to pray for goodness and faith in God’s work. Amen.

US May Put Bounty On Taliban Leaders Over Hostages, Rubio Says	(RFE/RL) -- The United States may place a bounty on the top leaders of the Taliban, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on January 25 after finding out that the group may be holding more American hostages in Afghanistan. 'Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has been reported,' Rubio said on X. 'If this is true, we will have to immediately place a very big bounty on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on bin Laden,' he added, referring to the Al-Qaeda leader and mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Bin Laden was killed in 2011 by the U.S. military in a nighttime raid in Pakistan. U.S. officials and media confirmed earlier this week the release of two Americans held in Afghanistan in exchange for a Taliban man imprisoned for life in California on drug and terrorism charges. The two Americans who were set free were not identified by the Afghan Foreign Ministry, but according to U.S. media reports and family members, they were Ryan Corbett and William McKenty. No mention was made of two other U.S. citizens -- George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi-- who have been held by the Taliban since 2022. It was unclear whether these were the hostages that Rubio referred to. The member of the Taliban who was released was Khan Mohammed, who had been sentenced to two life terms in 2008. The Afghan Foreign Ministry said his release came 'as a result of long and fruitful negotiations' between Afghanistan and the United States. A member of the new administration of President Donald Trump told reporters in Washington that the deal was brokered by President Joe Biden’s team before he left office on January 20. Details of the negotiations were not revealed. The United States, like most countries, does not recognize the Taliban -- which seized power in Kabul in mid-2021 -- as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan. White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement on January 21 that the Trump administration 'will continue to demand the release of all Americans held by the Taliban, especially in light of the billions of dollars in U.S. aid they’ve received in recent years.' Rubio's bounty comment came two days after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) said that he has requested warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, and the head of Afghanistan's Supreme Court, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. Karim Khan announced that he is seeking arrest warrants for the alleged persecution of Afghan women and girls, an accusation the Taliban-run Foreign Ministry called 'baseless.' In a statement, Khan said based on evidence collected thus far in an investigation reopened in October 2022 there were grounds to believe Akhundzada and Haqqani 'bear criminal responsibility for the crime against humanity of persecution on gender grounds.' Mir Abdul Wahid Sadat, head of the Afghan Lawyers Association, told RFE/RL, that the ICC decisions and actions 'have strong consequences' and said Khan's announcement was 'a big threat to the Taliban.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im2zu5aiHOBFZ0	2025-01-26T16:28:19-08:00	
Turkey Sentences 6 Journalists Over Terrorism Charges	A Turkish court has sentenced six journalists to prison on terrorism charges due to their alleged links to the Gülen movement. The 25th High Criminal Court of Istanbul found Yakup Çetin guilty of 'membership in a terrorist organization' and sentenced him to six years and three months in prison. Five other journalists involved in the case were sentenced to two years and one month for 'aiding a terrorist organization.' However, Ali Akkuş was acquitted due to a lack of evidence, reports Turkish Minute. The retrial followed a 2020 ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeals, which had annulled previous sentences, citing insufficient evidence. The court had determined that the journalists' alleged connections to the Gülen movement were not conclusively proven. The journalists had previously worked for media outlets linked to the Gülen movement. After the attempted coup, their social media posts and journalistic work were used as evidence against them.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im21ykU-QRFq_o	2025-01-26T16:26:30-08:00	
Monotheistic Holy Pilgrimages Made By Humans And God – OpEd	Holy pilgrimages to mountains are made by Gods because no number of humans alone can make a mountain. Sacred pilgrimages that are made by the one and only God and humans must be made jointly. Non Abrahamic religions have many pilgrimage sites; the Abrahamic religions have just two: one in Macca and one in Jerusalem. Tens of thousands of Hindu naked ascetics and millions of other pilgrims have come to bathe in the water of three sacred rivers in northern India. Such baths are a major part of the Maha Kumbh festival, the largest religious pilgrimage on Planet Earth. Holding tridents, swords, spears and small two-headed drums, ash-smeared Hindu holy men marched and rode chariots at sunrise toward the confluence of two rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna with the now all dried up ancient Saraswati river. Hindus believe that bathing at this river confluence will cleanse them of their sins and release them from the cycle of rebirth.The festival is held every 12 years. Over a six-week span, it's expected to draw 350-400 million people, many will take part in elaborate religious rituals. The origins of the Maha Kumbh Mela are deeply entwined with Hindu mythology, particularly the story of the Samudra Manthan, or the churning of the ocean by gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras) to retrieve the nectar of immortality (Amrita). As the celestial pot of nectar emerged, a divine tussle ensued, resulting in drops spilling at four locations on Earth, sanctifying them for eternity. These places became the venues for the Kumbh Mela. Historically, the festival is documented as far back as the 7th century CE At the same time in the ancient town of Ouidah in southern Benin, in Africa, a place where dozens of gods and spirits come together, people were celebrating the annual Voodoo festival that brings a mix of religions into a clash of cultures, with the ability for ancient traditional beliefs to adapt to modern life. Mass pilgrimage is one of the most ancient religious activities of Homo sapiens. Featuring traditional ceremonies, dance events, and rituals in the form of incantations, adulations and offerings, Voodoo dates back to the 1400s and draws heavily from the mythology and cultural displays of Yoruba people of Nigeria's southwest. Göbekli Tepe, located in southern Turkey near the Syrian border, is the oldest [10,000 BCE] human selected religious pilgrimage site discovered anywhere in the world. It attracted worshippers from up to 150 km away. Many of its stone pillars are decorated with carved animal reliefs such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelles, snakes and birds, particularly vultures. There are very few human figures in the art at Göbekli Tepe. The Göbekli Tepe structures predate pottery, metallurgy, and the invention of writing or the wheel, and were built before the Neolithic Revolution, which marks the beginning of agriculture, animal husbandry, and year around settlements around 9,000 BCE. A new layer was discovered and it is now considered to have reached 14,000 years back. Then, at the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE, Göbekli Tepe lost its religious significance for the region's inhabitants that it had for the previous thousand plus years. If Prophet Adam or Prophet Noah had lived at that time, it is possible that one of them might have influenced the people living in that area (about 10,000 years ago) to bury Gobekli Tepe. Or this could be evidence that one of Allah's earliest monotheistic prophets like Idris/Enoch [Qur'an 19:56-7, 21:85], from the southern lands of Babylonia, had reached the area of Göbekli Tepe and convinced the people there to abandon their pilgrimage to Göbekli Tepe; and wait patiently for Prophets Abraham and Ishmael to rebuild the Ka'ba at Mecca. And then later enabled Prophet Solomon to build a Temple in Jerusalem that, unlike the Ka'ba, would allow both Jews and non-Jews to pray at the places where Prophets Abraham, Ishmael and Issac were tested by God. 'Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, but has come from a far country for Your name's sake (for they will hear of Your great name and Your strong hand and Your outstretched arm), when he comes and prays toward this temple, hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You.' (1 Kings 8:41-43) As a twenty-first century Reform Rabbi, I offer this narration that was transmitted orally in both Arabic and Hebrew throughout many centuries and finally written down in several slightly different versions in the mid 19th century. As the poet Muriel Rukeyser said: 'The universe is made of stories, not of atoms.' Two brothers who had inherited land from their father, divided the land in half so each one could farm his own section. One brother's land was mostly on a hillside; the other brother's land was mostly in a valley on the other side of the hill. Over time, the older brother married and had four children, while the younger brother was still not married. One year there was very little rain, and the crop was very meager. This was at the beginning of a long term drought that would turn the whole valley into an arid, treeless, desert where grain did not grow and all the springs dried up. The younger brother lay awake one night praying and thought. 'My brother has a wife and four children to feed and I have no children. He needs more grain than I do; especially now when grain is scarce.' So that night the younger brother went to his silo, gathered a large bundle of wheat, and climbed the hill that separated the two farms and over to his brother's farm. He left his wheat in his brother's silo, and returned home. Earlier that very same night, the older brother was also lying awake praying for rain when he thought. 'In my old age my wife and I will have our grown children to take care of us, as well as grandchildren to enjoy, while my brother will probably have no children. He should at least sell more grain from the fields now, so he can provide for himself in his old age.' So that night, the older brother also gathered a large bundle of wheat, climbed the hill, left it in his brother's silo, and returned home. The next morning, the younger brother was surprised to see the amount of grain in his barn seemed unchanged. 'I must not have taken as much wheat as I thought,' he said. 'Tonight I'll be sure to take more.' That same morning, the older brother standing in his barn, was thinking the same thoughts. After night fell, each brother gathered a greater amount of wheat from his barn and in the dark, secretly delivered it to his brother's barn. The next morning, the brothers were again puzzled and perplexed. 'How can I be mistaken?' each one thought. 'There's the same amount of grain here as there was before. This is impossible! Tonight I'll make no mistake - I'll take two large sacks.' The third night, more determined than ever, each brother gathered two large sacks of wheat from his barn, loaded them onto a cart, and slowly pulled his cart through the fields and up the hill to his brother's barn. At the top of the hill, with only a little light from a new moon, each brother noticed a figure in the distance. When the two brothers recognized the form of the other brother and the load he was pulling they both realized what had happened. Without a word, they dropped the ropes of their carts, ran to each other and embraced. Christians and Jews believe the hill is Jerusalem. Muslims believe the valley is Mecca. I believe they are both right and God willing, someday everyone may see both cities and their sanctuaries as a pair of lungs; that are central to humanity's spiritual inspiration by, and connection to, the One God of Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac. Only God can make a geographical place into a holy space. Thus God's prophets later knew that brotherly love and concern for each other had made this space into two holy places, as a pair of spiritual lungs for two holy sanctuaries on which the descendants of these two brothers will each build and rebuild a holy House for this world's spiritual revival. As the Qur'an states: ''Believers, be steadfast in the cause of God and bear witness with justice. Do not let your enmity for others turn you away from justice. Deal justly; that is nearer to being God-fearing.' (5:8) When all those, both near and far, who revere their house as a standard for the world, and share it in love with everyone else who reveres it, then God will help them do, as Abraham will request: 'Make this a land of Peace, and provide its people with the produce of of the land'. (Qur'an 2:126). May the inspiration of this ancient tale, transmitted orally for so many centuries in both Arabic and Hebrew, help Christians, Jews and Muslims overcome the many hate filled actions occurring in today's world. As the Qur'an states: 'Good and evil deeds are not equal. Repel evil with what is better; then you will see that one who was once your enemy becomes your dearest friend...' (Qur'an 41:34) May the one pair of lungs provide the spiritual energy all humans need to live according to God's peace: 'Say: the Holy Spirit has brought the Revelation from your Lord in Truth, in order to strengthen those who believe, and as guidance and glad tidings to Muslims.' (Qur'an 16:102) And as the Hebrew Prophet Joel (2:28-9) states: in Messianic times the Holy Spirit will be poured out upon all the People of Israel. And according to a statement in the seventh century rabbinic Midrash Tanna debe Eliyahu, (Friedman edition): the Holy Spirit will be poured out equally upon Jews and non-Jews, men and women, freemen and slaves. Also there is vacant land on the Temple Mount, and a 3D digital broadcast Jewish house of worship could be rebuilt as a virtual replica like those made by the Factum Foundation, a Madrid-based nonprofit that creates high-resolution digital replicas of the world's cultural heritage; could be built about 600 feet north of the Al-Aqsa, near the Dome of the Rock, provided the Muslims would cooperate. This would fulfill Prophet Isaiah's statement that in the early part of the Messianic Age: 'Torah will be broadcast from Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.' (Isaiah 2:3) Most observers agree that anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be very important. Anyone who can bring Jews, Christians, and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions: 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach warfare.' (Isaiah 2:4) Just as millions of Muslims can join every day with tens of thousands of Muslims pilgrims praying and circling around the cube-shaped Kaaba at Islam's most sacred site; Jews would be able to strap on a headset and enter the holy city of Jerusalem, and see and hear Jewish prayers at the Western Wall, and someday God willing, as broadcast from the virtual reality Jerusalem Temple, without ever leaving their own homes. Then the descendants of Abraham will learn to live in Holiness, Peace and Prosperity. And as Prophet Isaiah predicted (19:23-25): 'On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. The Lord Almighty will bless them, saying, 'Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.' Most observers agree that anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be a Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5) Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be very important, and any leaders who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions, 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, such Jewish/Christian/Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its leadership to be the Messiah and this would fulfill the just cited verse of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy, as enlarged upon by the prophet Micah. 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him, for it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' (Micah: 3-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im27bxGkpaS-gs	2025-01-26T16:23:20-08:00	
CIA Says Covid-19 Probably Escaped Chinese Lab But Doesn’t Rule O...	By Nicholas Wallace (EurActiv) -- The US Central Intelligence Agency says Covid-19 probably leaked from a Chinese research lab but has 'low confidence' in its conclusion, according to the Associated Press and other international media. The global pandemic has killed some 7 million people since it brought the world to a virtual standstill in 2020, according to the World Health Organisation. At the height of the crisis, suggestions that the virus could be the product of research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were dismissed as conspiracy theories. Social media companies suppressed posts making the claim. Yet the CIA now suspects that the 'lab-leak theory' is more likely than not to be true. The agency had previously been on the fence as to the pandemic's origins. However, in a declassified report released on Saturday, the CIA said it only had 'low confidence' in its conclusion. It said the new conclusion does not rule out the possibility that Covid-19 was of natural origin. It said the 'CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,' according to the Financial Times. The new report was commissioned by the previous Biden administration and the now-departed CIA director William Burns, the Associated Press reports. Newly-elected US President Donald Trump appointed John Ratcliffe as the new CIA director on Thursday. Ratcliffe ordered that the report be declassified and released.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im22SGgqUU2Ifs	2025-01-26T16:21:50-08:00	
Iran: IRGC Uses AI-Powered Missiles In Naval War Game	The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy’s drones fired missiles featuring artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities during a large-scale exercise in the Persian Gulf. Speaking to reporters in Iran’s southern port city of Bushehr on Sunday, IRGC Navy Commander Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri said his forces have launched various coast-to-sea and ground-to-ground missiles on the second say of the ‘Payambar-e Azam (The Great Prophet)’ war game underway in southern Iran. He noted that IRGC experts have equipped the Mohajer-6 and Ababil-5 military drones with a new version of Qaem and Almas missiles that incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities to hit targets. The IRGC Navy has for the first time launched Navvab missiles to provide aerial protection for the ‘martyr Soleimani’ warship, the general said. According to the commander, the IRGC naval forces have also fired cruise and ballistic missiles, as well as the upgraded version of Qadr missiles whose range and precision have been improved for electronic warfare. The IRGC Navy and the Iranian Defense Ministry have manufactured cruise missiles with ranges above 1,000 kilometers with the help of artificial intelligence that can detonate aerial targets at different altitudes, he added. Admiral Tangsiri noted that the purpose of the war game is to enhance coordination and preparedness of the IRGC naval forces and convey the message of peace and friendship to the neighboring countries.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im25Sc96iO33yr	2025-01-26T16:20:13-08:00	
Offshore Wind Farms Could Cause Significant Ecosystem, Economic A...	The materials used to protect wind turbines from corrosion leach into the surrounding water, which could pose risks to ecosystems, seafood safety and human health, new research from the University of Portsmouth has found. Offshore wind farms release thousands of tonnes of metals such as aluminium, zinc and indium each year. This is expected to grow dramatically as wind farms are set to play a major role in reducing the world’s carbon emissions. The UK currently has 13 gigawatts of offshore wind power generating capacity and a government target of reaching 100 gigawatts by 2050. Professor Gordon Watson, from the University’s School of the Environment and Life Sciences, said: 'Offshore wind farms are a vital part of our clean energy future, but at the moment there is limited data on how these metals affect the environment near operational offshore wind farms, so it’s hard to assess the full risks. 'We are definitely not saying stop building offshore wind farms, we just need to monitor them appropriately - especially as they continue to expand. The plans to scale up are ambitious and come with challenges that must be addressed.' To protect turbines from rusting, corrosion-protection systems are used, which can release metals into the ocean over time. The study, published in Nature’s npj Ocean Sustainability, estimated annual inputs of metals from current European wind farms to be: 3,219 tonnes of aluminum 1,148 tonnes of zinc 1.9 tonnes of indium For zinc, this already exceeds the sum of all known direct inputs and river discharges into the North Atlantic from key European countries. Locating seaweed and shellfish farms in close proximity to offshore wind farms, like the world’s first co-located commercial-scale seaweed farm in the North Sea, could see metals from turbines build up in these species, leading to concentrations that could exceed safe limits for human consumption. For example, consuming oysters with high levels of zinc could surpass the recommended weekly intake for adults, posing risks to human health. Professor Watson added: 'Under current government expansion plans, these inputs could increase 12-fold by 2050, which raises serious concerns about the potential accumulation of metals in marine species like oysters, mussels, and seaweed, which are also likely to be cultured near wind farms. 'Our research highlights the importance of keeping a close eye on the chemicals released by offshore wind farms, so we can monitor and manage the environmental impact.' The scientists are calling for more comprehensive monitoring of water and sediments around wind farms, using corrosion-protection systems with fewer environmental impacts, and strong monitoring guidelines for co-locating aquaculture with wind farms. Professor Watson said: 'There are solutions to address these issues, but we need to take steps now to mitigate risks. We hope this research will provide a roadmap for policymakers and the wind energy industry to tackle these challenges effectively before they cause unnecessary harm.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im28xiu-GT8KMd	2025-01-26T16:18:01-08:00	
New Measurements Turn The Hubble Tension Into A Crisis	The Universe really seems to be expanding fast. Too fast, even. A new measurement confirms what previous — and highly debated — results had shown: The Universe is expanding faster than predicted by theoretical models, and faster than can be explained by our current understanding of physics. This discrepancy between model and data became known as the Hubble tension. Now, results published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters provide even stronger support to the faster rate of expansion. 'The tension now turns into a crisis,' said Dan Scolnic, who led the research team. Determining the expansion rate of the Universe — known as the Hubble constant— has been a major scientific pursuit ever since 1929, when Edwin Hubble first discovered that the Universe was expanding. Scolnic, an associate professor of physics at Duke University, explains it as trying to build the Universe’s growth chart: we know what size it had at the Big Bang, but how did it get to the size it is now? In his analogy, the Universe’s baby picture represents the distant Universe, the primordial seeds of galaxies. The Universe’s current headshot represents the local Universe, which contains the Milky Way and its neighbors. The standard model of cosmology is the growth curve connecting the two. The problem is: things don’t connect. 'This is saying, to some respect, that our model of cosmology might be broken,' said Scolnic. Measuring the Universe requires a cosmic ladder, which is a succession of methods used to measure the distances to celestial objects, with each method, or 'rung,' relying on the previous for calibration. The ladder used by Scolnic was created by a separate team using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which is observing more than 100,000 galaxies every night from its vantage point at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Scolnic recognized that this ladder could be anchored closer to Earth with a more precise distance to the Coma Cluster, one of the galaxy clusters nearest to us. 'The DESI collaboration did the really hard part, their ladder was missing the first rung,' said Scolnic. 'I knew how to get it, and I knew that that would give us one of the most precise measurements of the Hubble constant we could get, so when their paper came out, I dropped absolutely everything and worked on this non-stop.' To get a precise distance to the Coma cluster, Scolnic and his collaborators, with funding from the Templeton foundation, used the light curves from 12 Type Ia supernovae within the cluster. Just like candles lighting a dark path, Type Ia supernovae have a predictable luminosity that correlates to their distance, making them reliable objects for distance calculations. The team arrived at a distance of about 320 million light-years, nearly in the center of the range of distances reported across 40 years of previous studies — a reassuring sign of its accuracy. 'This measurement isn’t biased by how we think the Hubble tension story will end,' said Scolnic. 'This cluster is in our backyard, it has been measured long before anyone knew how important it was going to be.' Using this high-precision measurement as a first rung, the team calibrated the rest of the cosmic distance ladder. They arrived at a value for the Hubble constant of 76.5 kilometers per second per megaparsec, which essentially means that the local Universe is expanding 76.5 kilometers per second faster every 3.26 million light-years. This value matches existing measurements of the expansion rate of the local Universe. However, like all of those measurements, it conflicts with measurements of the Hubble constant using predictions from the distant Universe. In other words: it matches the Universe’s expansion rate as other teams have recently measured it, but not as our current understanding of physics predicts it. The longstanding question is: is the flaw in the measurements or in the models? Scolnic’s team’s new results adds tremendous support to the emerging picture that the root of the Hubble tension lies in the models. 'Over the last decade or so, there's been a lot of re-analysis from the community to see if my team’s original results were correct,' said Scolnic, whose research has consistently challenged the Hubble constant predicted using the standard model of physics. 'Ultimately, even though we're swapping out so many of the pieces, we all still get a very similar number. So, for me, this is as good of a confirmation as it's ever gotten.' 'We’re at a point where we’re pressing really hard against the models we’ve been using for two and a half decades, and we’re seeing that things aren’t matching up,' said Scolnic. 'This may be reshaping how we think about the Universe, and it’s exciting! There are still surprises left in cosmology, and who knows what discoveries will come next?'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im220w25waxoWd	2025-01-26T16:11:04-08:00	
Finding Better Photovoltaic Materials Faster With AI	Perovskite solar cells are a flexible and sustainable alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells. Researchers at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) are part of an international team that was able to find – within only a few weeks – new organic molecules that increase the efficiency of perovskite solar cells. The team used a clever combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated high-throughput synthesis. Their strategy can also be applied to other areas of materials research, such as the search for new battery materials. The researchers report their findings in Science . In order to find out which of a million different molecules would conduct positive charges and make perovskite solar cells particularly efficient, one would need to synthesize and test all of them – or do as the researchers headed by Tenure-track Professor Pascal Friederich, who specializes in the applications of AI in materials science at KIT’s Institute of Nanotechnology, and Professor Christoph Brabec from the Helmholtz Institute Erlangen-Nürnberg (HI ERN). 'With only 150 targeted experiments, we were able to achieve a breakthrough that would otherwise have required hundreds of thousands of tests. The workflow we have developed will open up new ways to quickly and economically discover high-performance materials for a wide range of applications,' Brabec said. With one of the discovered materials, they increased the efficiency of a reference solar cell by approximately two percentage points to 26.2 percent. 'Our success shows that enormous amounts of time and resources can be saved by applying skillful strategies for the discovery of new energy materials,' Friedrich said. The starting point at HI ERN was a database with structural formulae for approximately one million virtual molecules that could be synthesized from commercially available substances. From these virtual molecules, 13,000 were selected at random. The KIT researchers used established quantum mechanical methods to determine their energy levels, polarity, geometry and other properties. Training AI with Data from Just 101 Molecules From the 13,000 molecules, the scientists chose 101 with the greatest differences in their properties, synthesized them with robotic systems at HI ERN, used them to produce otherwise identical solar cells, and then measured the efficiency of the solar cells. 'Being able to produce truly comparable samples thanks to our highly automated synthesis platform, and thus being able to determine reliable efficiency values, was crucial to our strategy’s success,' said Brabec, who headed the work at HI ERN. Using the molecules suggested by the AI, it was indeed possible to build solar cells with above-average efficiency, including some exceeding the capabilities of the most advanced materials currently used. 'We can’t be sure we’ve really found the best one of a million molecules, but we’re certainly close to the optimum,' Friederich said. AI Versus Chemical Intuition Since the researchers used an AI that indicates which of the virtual molecules’ properties its suggestions were based on, they were able to gain some insight into the molecules it suggested. For example, they determined that the AI-suggestions are based in part on the presence of certain chemical groups, such as amines, that chemists had previously neglected. Brabec and Friederich believe that their strategy holds promise for other applications in materials science or can be extended to the optimization of entire components. The findings, which are the result of research conducted in collaboration with scientists from FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, South Korea’s Ulsan National Institute of Science, and China’s Xiamen University and University of Electronic Science and Technology, were published recently in the prestigious journal Science.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdXt07VX4Im28i6QlmHplcK	2025-01-26T16:04:25-08:00	
The Ancient Precursor To IMEC – Analysis	By Sifra Lentin The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), first announced by Prime Minister Modi on 9 September 2023 on the sidelines of India’s G20, will accelerate under the new Trump Presidency and the likely resolution of the Israel-Hamas war, a prelude to which is the latest 45-day ceasefire between the warring parties. The vision for this corridor[1] is based on the Abraham Accords brokered by Trump during his first presidency, which normalized Israel’s ties with the UAE and Bahrain on 15 September 2020 and is hopeful of doing the same for its relationship with Saudi Arabia once they both sign. Eight countries will participate in the IMEC – India, UAE, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., Germany, France, Italy and the EU – which will connect India to the Gulf, and via Jordan and Israel, connect the Gulf to the Mediterranean. (See Map 1) India is the originator country, and it’s appropriate. For though IMEC appears to be the latest corridor in the dozens being envisaged and built around the world, ever since China’s Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) began in 2014, it is in fact, not a new passageway, but a revival of an ancient route which carried a thriving trade between these same countries. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC). Source: Lowy Institute What was the original corridor and what does history tell us of its political and economic sustainability? This trade route began to be used 2300 years ago, well before the well-known 1 BCE to 4 CE trade between the Romans and the contemporaneous Mauryan and then Gupta empires on the Subcontinent. Archaeological finds of Harappan seals in Mesopotamia and Mesopotamian seals in Harappan sites have established that trade between the two seas, Arabian and Mediterranean, was established via the Persian Gulf ports and not the Red Sea channel which is used today. [2] [3] Although the main corridor to the Mediterranean then was via the riverine cities on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present day Iraq, a recent steatite seal[4] discovery in the Harappan site of Lothal near the head of the Gulf of Khambhat (in India’s Gujarat state), points to a network of merchant interlocutors from the eastern littoral regions of the Arabian Peninsula that include present-day Oman, UAE, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia – quite specifically, the IMEC corridor region. The steatite seal found in Lothal[5] is believed to belong to the region of Dilmun, which archaeologists have linked to excavated sites in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Qatar. The trade between this network of Gulf ports and caravan routes in their hinterlands, are linked not just to high value goods from the Indian subcontinent like pepper, cotton piece goods, ivory, but specific goods from this region itself, and which find mention in the Judaic and Christian traditions of the region. The Arabian Peninsula was famous for its incenses like Frankincense and Myrrh, copper and diorite, gold, and crystalline semi-precious stones like carnelian. The expansion of trade between the Mesopotamian (also known as Sumerian) and Harappan civilisations was expanded by the Sumerian King Sargon after he integrated the independent southern cities into his kingdom. Sargon’s cuneiform from 2300 BCE shows the presence of Meluhhans, i.e. merchants, mariners and migrants from the Harappan civilisation, who settled there. Sargon expanded trade greatly between the Harappans and his region and westward to the east Mediterranean coast, although his focus always remained on the thriving Indian Ocean. [6] Interesting from the IMEC lens is that the interlocutors of trade with Sargon’s kingdom were the traders of Magan – today’s modern-day UAE, Oman and possibly the Makran Coast – who supplied copper and diorite to Mesopotamia[7]. There were also merchants from Dilmun – today’s Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar – who traded actively with southern Mesopotamian cities. Sargon’s territorial expansion enabled merchants to travel in safety from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean.[8] They reached the Mediterranean Sea by the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. It is likely that overland caravan routes in West Asia were also active corridors for transporting goods. There is another indicator of the importance of this Persian Gulf route: Alexander the Great’s search for an alternative to it. After turning his army back from the Beas River (in present-day Punjab) to begin his march home, Alexander undertook a sea voyage from the Indus, along the Makran Coast, to reach the Persian Gulf. He had tasked two small groups of his soldiers to explore the Persian Gulf and one group to sail down the Red Sea to the south coast of Yemen.[9] Before he could realise his dream of discovering the feasibility of a Red Sea route to the Gulf, he died in Babylon in 323 BCE. The Red Sea route was only made viable a century later by descendants of his Macedonian General Ptolemy I Soter, who went on to rule Egypt. After the 1st century CE, the older Persian Gulf ports and their hinterland of caravan routes and caravanserai like Palmyra (Syria) and Petra (Jordan) and network of ports on the Mediterranean coast, coexisted alongside Red Sea ports like Berenice, from where caravans carried goods to the river Nile. Reed sailing boats known as Feluccas, then voyaged downriver to the former Ptolemaic capital of Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast. Both routes to the Mediterranean from the Indian Ocean were active even after the discovery by the Portuguese of a direct sea route from Europe round the Cape of Good Hope to India.[10] The old overland routes from Persian Gulf ports, particularly the popular Basra-Baghdad corridor, continued, with Indian merchants sending caravans as large as 25-30,000 camels till the late 17th century, each camel carrying 400-500 pounds of cloth, across West Asia to reach the Ottoman Empire, North Africa, and Europe. [11] Traders from West Asia like Arabs, Jews, Armenians, Persians were known to travel for trade to India’s west coast. A few families made India their home thereby creating a transnational network for the exchange of goods, information, credit, and to facilitate the mobility of people. From the Indian subcontinent, the Jain and Kutchi Bhatia communities were early pioneers in the maritime Persian Gulf trade. They were followed by Memons, Bohra, Khoja, Lohanas, and Sindhis. It was the inauguration of the Suez Canal in 1869 that made the Red Sea route dominant, and this was because it is the shortest and most economical passage between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The attacks on shipping by the Houthis have discredited this route and accelerated the pursuit for alternatives like IMEC. The history of trade between the Western Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea shows that trade like water, it seeks its own level. Economic corridors like the IMEC will be successful if they ensure ease and speed of transit, security, and higher profits than competing routes, much as its ancient predecessors did.

[2] Red Sea ports like Socotra (an island in the Gulf of Aden), Berenice, and Myos Hormuz (both in Egypt) were developed and popularised by Ptolemaic (Greek) Egypt’s King Antiochus the Great and his successors about 300 BCE, who developed this route as an alternative to the older Persian Gulf ports and their hinterlands that connected to the Mediterranean. Ptolemaic Egypt was a Greek polity founded in 305 BCE by the Macedonian General Ptolemy I Soter, and ruled by his dynasty till the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BCE.

If there was a caravan of 25,000 to 30,000 camels this will be about 200 million yards of cloth exported from India to Turan, Russia, Persia, Ottoman Empire, North Africa and Europe.

Why The World Is Giving Up On Birthright Citizenship – Analysis	By Ryan McMaken Earlier this week, Donald Trump signed a new executive order which attempts to end so-called 'birthright citizenship' in the United States. During the signing ceremony, Trump declared that the United States is 'the only country in the world that does this with birthright…' This is untrue and the Washington Post, among other publications, was quick to declare that Trump 'falsely claimed' that the US is the only country with birthright citizenship, also known as the legal principle of unrestricted—or 'pure'—jus soli. Trump would have been accurate, however, had he said that birthright citizenship is becoming rare, and that it is especially rare among those wealthier countries that experience positive net in-migration. In many countries, as generous welfare states attract growing numbers of migrants, the idea of unrestricted jus soli has become less popular. Indeed, Europe no longer contains any states that offer birthright citizenship, and others have added new restrictions to what jus soli provisions they have. Decline of Jus Soli in Europe Since the early modern period, migration between European states has been a significant phenomenon, and these numbers increased many times over during the Industrial Revolution. It was often the case, however, that these migrations were seasonal or limited to relatively small enclaves of minority populations. Moreover, many areas of Europe were experiencing labor shortages since, throughout most of this period, Europe was a continent of emigration rather than immigration. After all, during the nineteenth century alone, millions of Europeans emigrated to the Americas. After the Second World War, however, things began to change due to decolonization and growing human mobility. As a 2018 report from the European commission puts it: Large-scale immigration into Europe began after the Second World War as a consequence of decolonisation and of economic reconstruction. Although several north-west European countries, such as Germany and France, put specific immigration programmes in place to attract the desired workforce, most post-war immigration into Europe was spontaneous and unregulated. The general expectation in the receiving countries was that immigration was temporary and that immigrants would return to their countries when their labour was no longer needed. However, this expectation proved to be misguided. Although restrictions to immigration were imposed in the 1970s, following the economic stagnation caused by the oil crisis, the number of immigrants continued to rise. A new wave of immigration occurred after 1990, following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the launching of eastern EU enlargement. In the UK, for instance, mass immigration from the colonies and from wartime ally states such as Poland intensified after 1945. As the second half of the century wore on, however, the prospect of continued migration drove new policies on naturalization and migration. For example, although the UK had long employed a liberal jus soli policy, the Commonwealth Immigration Act 1968 introduced patriality, which required those seeking British citizenship to prove they had a parent or grandparent who already possessed British citizenship. This move saw the beginning of a shift in British citizenship from jus soli to jus sanguine or citizenship passed on by parental lines rather than place of birth.1 Over the past thirty years, some countries have expanded the use of jus soli but only in restricted form. This proved to be part of a larger trend across Europe toward restriction on just soli naturalization and this has meant that the number of countries that offer merely facilitated naturalisation is becoming smaller as more states introduce ius soli at birth conditional on legal long‐term parental residence, or, after birth, as an option at majority. The group of countries with double ius soli has also been strengthened through the recent reforms in Luxembourg and Greece. Ius soli citizenship has also become more politicised, and, as in the case of adult naturalisation, has become increasingly conditional, through the introduction of more stringent residence requirements for parents, and of additional requirements for facilitated naturalisation, such as continuous residence, public order conditions, and language and civic knowledge tests. In 2004, when Ireland abolished its unrestricted jus soli provisions, Europe ceased to have any states that offered 'birthright citizenship.' Rather, European states have tended to add new jus sanguinis elements—requirements based on the origins of the child’s parents—to restrict jus soli. Today, nearly all member states of the European Union require that at least one parent be born in the country (i.e., 'double jus soli') in order to obtain automatic citizenship. Similar trends have happened in the European 'outposts' of Australia and New Zealand. Unrestricted jus soli had existed in Australia, but this was abolished in 1986. Birthright citizenship was abolished in New Zealand in 2006. Why Does Unrestricted Jus Soli Decline? As migration flows increase, native populations often respond with calls for more restrictions on naturalization. It is easy to imagine the reasons for this. Given that citizenship and naturalization offer access to political participation, and also provide full access to the local welfare state, native populations may often conclude that rising numbers of new citizens from various 'outgroups' could be a politically destabilizing factor. Other natives may fear that large numbers of new migrants place fiscal strain on public benefits. This illustrates the interplay between immigration policies and naturalization policies. Strictly speaking, immigration and naturalization are separate phenomena, but in practice, high levels of immigration tend to lead to calls for restricting new migrants’ access to citizenship. The reverse is often true as well. In a 2010 empirical study on the determinants of new restrictions on naturalization, Graziella Bertocchi and Chiara Strozzi conclude that high migration levels impel local policymakers to introduce new restrictions on jus soli: our results suggest that migration moves national legislation in the direction of jus sanguinis, not jus soli. In particular, when we take into account the legal tradition governing citizenship, we find that countries with a jus soli origin react to increasing migration by adding jus sanguinis elements. … Our investigation reveals that migration has an overall negative effect on liberalization of citizenship legislation and adoption of jus soli elements. Moreover, a country’s legal tradition affects the way that it responds to migration. In particular, jus soli countries react to increasing migration through restriction.2 On the other hand, those countries that have generally leaned toward jus sanguinis policies react to migration with fewer policy changes. These conclusions also suggest it is not a coincidence that there are so few unrestricted jus soli states with positive net migration rates. Worldwide, nearly all states with unconditional jus soli are found in Latin America and the Caribbean.3 The countries in these regions are nearly all net out-migration countries, or countries with very little in-migration. Only three countries outside the Americas have unconditional just soli: Chad, Lesotho, and Tanzania. All of these countries are net-outmigration countries.4 As we see in the graph below, the countries with unconditional jus soli (colored red) are countries like Mexico, Peru, and Cuba. Migrants primarily flow out of these countries, not into them. Sources: CIA Factbook; World Population Review. Canada and the United States are clearly outliers in that they have both birthright citizenship and positive net in-migration. .5 In nearly every other country with positive net in-migration, we find the state has either abandoned unconditional jus soli—like the UK, Ireland, and Australia—or never had it—such as Japan, Korea, and Switzerland. The United States and Canada are Outliers Not surprisingly, high migration levels combined with liberal naturalization policies are becoming a matter of increasing controversy in both the US and Canada. Donald Trump, of course, won re-election largely on an anti-immigration platform, partly fueled by public concerns over the growth of the welfare state and political destabilization due to widespread naturalization. Meanwhile in Canada, following years of high immigration levels, the BBC reports there is 'dwindling public support for immigration.' A September poll of Canadians also showed that 'for the first time in a quarter century, a majority now say there is too much immigration.' What all this suggests is that over the longer term, unrestricted jus soli is a luxury for countries with negative rates of in-migration which do not face the political and fiscal consequences of large waves of foreign nationals arriving locally. Eventually, both the United States and Canada are likely to follow the same path as other countries that have abandoned unrestricted jus soli in recent decades, regardless of what the law might currently say. 1 William Shankley and Bridget Byrne, 'Citizen Rights and Immigration,' in Ethnicity and Race in the UK (Bristol, UK: Bristol University Press, 2020), p. 37. 2 Graziella Bertocchi and Chiara Strozzi, 'The Evolution of Citizenship: Economic and Institutional Determinants,' The Journal of Law & Economics 53, no. 1 (February 2010): 126 3 One reason the states of the Americas have long tended toward unrestricted jus soli is that the Americas have long been subject to ongoing labor shortages. See the chapter 'Global Frontiers and the Rise of Western Europe (from 1500 to 1914)' in Edward B. Barbier, Scarcity and Frontiers,(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011). 4 Arguably, one could include Pakistan in this list of non-American states with unrestricted jus soli, although Pakistan does not grant birthright citizenship to refugees. 5 Outside the US and Canada, the largest net in-migration states with birthright citizenship are Costa Rica and Panama with 5.04 million people and 4 million people, respectively. In both these cases, the migrant stock is overwhelmingly Spanish-speaking people from neighboring Latin American countries. All other countries with both positive net in-migration and birthright citizenship are Caribbean micronations. Chile, with a migration rate of 0.3 is effectively a break-even state.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqogKIJ90E2uk2	2025-01-25T17:45:36-08:00	
Could Belarus’s Presidential Election Be Lukashenko’s Last? – Ana...	By Luke Allnutt (RFE/RL) -- As opposition-minded Belarusians will tell you, the country's presidential election on January 26 isn't a real election. Independent media has been gutted, or forced abroad, there are no credible opposition candidates, and the vote is merely an exercise in consolidating President Alyaksandr Lukashenka's grip on power. It will be anything other than free or fair. After two politicians were denied registration, there are only five candidates running, including Lukashenka, who has been in power since 1994. Of those, three represent pro-government parties, and one, Hanna Kanapatskaya, is formally independent but accused by many in the opposition of being a stooge for the regime. What About Belarus's Opposition? For the last presidential election in 2020, something happened that hadn't been seen in years. After several opposition leaders were jailed before the election campaign, another leader, Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, emerged. And, on a fair playing field, she was thought to have a decent chance of winning. In the end, in an election that the international community decried as fraudulent, Tsikhanouskaya lost. But her campaign gained remarkable traction, revitalizing the ailing Belarusian opposition and bringing tens of thousands of people out on the streets to protest the election result. The protests were brutally broken up. Thousands of people were arrested by security forces, with many claiming to have been mistreated or tortured in custody. Tsikhanouskaya was forced to flee and continue her work from Lithuania. Now, facing certain arrest if she returns to Belarus, Tsikhanouskaya's hands are tied. She has urged citizens to refrain from protesting, fearing there will be a repeat of the crackdown. Instead, she has called on Belarusians to vote 'Against All' on their ballots or abstain completely. Brutal Crackdown Still Casts A Long Shadow The crackdown has had a chilling effect on the Belarusian opposition, extinguishing even the faintest hopes for the country's liberalization. Many opposition protesters fled the country or were jailed. Independent media, including RFE/RL, was either closed down, blocked, or forced to operate from abroad. According to monitoring conducted by the Belarus-based watchdog Lawtrend, 1,161 NGOS have been forced to close since 2020. Belarus currently has around 1,300 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize-winning activist Ales Byalyatski and three journalists who have worked for RFE/RL's Belarus Service. Held in deplorable conditions, they are denied access to medical care or contact with their relatives. Ahead of the election, pressure on the opposition has grown. The authorities carried out over 100 raids in November 2024 connected to the opposition Coordination Council. Twenty academics, journalists, and activists were found guilty of alleged ties to Tsikhanouskaya and sentenced in absentia. The Government Is Nervous The government is undoubtedly concerned about a repeat of the 2020 protests, and, in its messaging, is pushing the narrative that the election is a fait accompli rather than a high-stakes referendum on Lukashenka's popularity. Instead of hard politics, state media and pro-government social-media accounts often play up Lukashenka's supposed everyman qualities, running footage of the president playing ice hockey or chopping wood. Even Lukashenka doesn't seem to think the presidential election is that important. In one pro-government video on TikTok -- where the regime is cautiously attempting to engage young people -- Lukashenka does mention the election but says bluntly, 'There is no need to engage.' Still, the authorities are taking precautions, also running programs on state TV about the extensive security measures in place for the vote in an attempt to keep young protesters at home. In the event of mass protests, Lukashenka has also threatened to shut down the Internet, and the authorities have banned people from taking photos of completed ballot papers as they were widely used in 2020 by citizens to highlight fraud. This year, there will also be no polling stations abroad, likely an attempt to silence the largely anti-Lukashenka diaspora. What Can The West Do? On January 17, then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Belarus's 'repressive environment' prevents a legitimate democratic presidential election. And on January 22, the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the election as a sham. Such statements, however, are unlikely to move the needle in Belarus and of little consequence for Lukashenka. Over the past few decades, the Belarusian leader has occasionally made overtures to the West, with diplomats and pundits periodically talking about Belarus breaking ties with its main ally Russia and 'coming in from the cold.' Those days are long gone. Since 2020, Minsk has deepened its ties with Moscow, notably in the military sphere by providing its territory for Russian attacks on Ukraine and hosting joint military drills. While both the EU and U.S. have imposed sanctions on Belarus, including asset freezes, travel bans, and trade restrictions, the Belarusian economy has weathered the storm, helped along by Russian support, including cheap gas, debt relief, and priority access to the Russian market. Is Lukashenka On His Way Out? The wild card here is Lukashenka himself. Now 70, with persistent rumors about his ill health, he has spoken in recent months about the need for a generational change in Belarusian politics, leading to conjecture that this could be his last presidential term. The $64,000 question is who -- or what -- next. There has been speculation about one of Lukashenka's sons taking the reins, notably his youngest, Mikalay, known as Kolya, who is just 20. There has also been talk of Lukashenka giving more power to the Security Council or the All-Belarusian People's Assembly, an advisory body chaired by Lukashenka that was elevated to a constitutional body in 2022. Whatever the arrangement, unless there is a dramatic change of leadership in Russia, Minsk will likely continue to deepen its ties with Moscow, a one-sided arrangement that could see Belarus increasingly become just a vassal of the Russian state.

The Return Of The Vortex In South Korea And The Turbulence Ahead ...	By Daniel Sneider In his seminal work on South Korean politics, The Politics of the Vortex, the late Gregory Henderson concluded that ‘political incohesiveness against both internal and external threat is a theme of Korean history, chronic, endemic, extreme’. The dramatic events of the past weeks in South Korea would seem to confirm the continued relevance of that judgement. In swift succession, a series of stunning events laid bare a deeply polarised society, with lines of division hardening with each step. The present crisis of South Korean democracy unfolded in almost unbelievable fashion. On 3 December 2024, President Yoon Suk-yeol went on television to declare martial law, dispatching armed forces to arrest elected officials and bar the National Assembly from convening. That de facto coup attempt was thwarted by parliament only hours later, after two-thirds of the legislature voted to lift martial law. On its second try, the National Assembly impeached Yoon two weeks later on 14 December. Investigations of Yoon by law enforcement authorities for the crime of insurrection are ongoing, while the Constitutional Court considers whether to uphold his impeachment. But while centralisation of power and intense factionalism is still a feature of South Korean political life, as Henderson’s analysis contended, there has also been a growth of civil society and a spread of political participation. That deepening of democratic institutions fuelled the resistance to Yoon’s shocking reversion to the insertion of the military into politics, something not seen since the 1980s. ‘It was a huge miscalculation, because nobody in Korea supported him in doing this’, commented eminent American political scientist Francis Fukuyama. Yoon has now been arrested and charged with attempting insurrection. The Constitutional Court is conducting a parallel investigation which will culminate in a vote on whether to uphold the impeachment resolution. Yoon is resisting all these efforts, insisting his martial law declaration was a lawful response to political paralysis and foreign-backed election fraud. Despite these efforts, the likelihood is that Yoon will be impeached and an election for the presidency would then take place. The conservative People Power Party (PPP) has been placed in an unenviable position, trying to separate themselves at first but now rallying behind the embattled President. The likely progressive standard bearer, Lee Jae-myung, who faced Yoon in the last election, faces multiple charges of corruption and is not widely popular. Yet he appears to be positioned to lead a shift in power in Seoul to the Democratic Party (DP) and its allies on the left. As is visible across the country, there is mobilisation of protest politics on both the left and the right. Yoon’s followers, fed by conspiratorial ideas on right–wing YouTube channels, have framed this as a battle against North Korean and Chinese agents. The left holds equally unyielding views of the illegitimacy and criminality of their foes. The future of the rule of law in South Korea is far from clear. The consequences of ongoing political turmoil in South Korea and a vacuum of leadership are amplified by the arrival to power in Washington of Donald Trump. South Koreans anticipaterenewed pressure on Seoul on a variety of issues — trade, defence spending and host nation support for the US troop presence, moves to reduce, if not withdraw, the US military presence and perhaps even an effort to return to a diplomatic bargain with North Korea, this time without the participation and consent of South Korea. All these ideas were pursued during the first Trump administration but there are no longer forces within the Trump circle ready to resist them, as happened during his first term. These concerns about a rift in the US—South Korea alliance also anticipate the shift to a progressive administration in Seoul, one that will likely be opposed to the construction of a trilateral security partnership with Japan and resistant to American efforts to draw South Korea into an anti-Chinese containment strategy. ‘If the government’s diplomatic tone changes to a pro-China, anti-Japan line’, wrote veteran former Foreign Ministry official Chun Young-woo in the conservative daily Chosun Ilbo, ‘Korea’s strategic value to Trump, who has set containing China as his top foreign policy goal, will disappear’. The likely ascension to power of DP leader Lee is particularly worrying given his history of criticism of Yoon’s foreign policy. But some observers reject the assumption that tension between Lee and Trump is inevitable. ‘Lee’s criticism of the US in the past has contributed to crafting his anti-American populist image’, acknowledges Yonsei University’s Moon Chung-in, a close advisor to past progressive administrations. But Moon also states that Lee’s ‘top priority’ is preventing war with North Koreaand that he understands the utility of the US alliance to deter such a contingency. Former US Ambassador to South Korea Kathleen Stephens, who has long experience dealing with the progressive camp in South Korea, shares the view that Lee is more of a pragmatist than an ideologue, though he articulates the broad critique of conservative policy. Stephens argues ‘the left in Korea has always been more about Korean nationalism, rather than pro-Chinese’. But all South Korean governments, including conservatives, know that it is essential to manage relations with China and to avoid engaging in a confrontation driven by geopoliticians in Washington. Perhaps the most likely shift will be on the approach to Japan, to slow if not halt the movement toward trilateral security integration pushed by Yoon and promoted by the Biden administration. But even there, it may be Trump and Washington who are more likely to bring that progress to a halt.

What Are Scam Parks? – Analysis	By Abby Seiff Cyber scam compounds made international headlines this month after a Chinese actor was rescued from Myanmar’s notorious KK Park. In late December, Wang Xing flew to Mae Sot, Thailand on the promise of an acting gig. Instead, he was kidnapped and hustled across the border into a compound where victims like him are forced to trick others out of their savings. If they fail to do so, they are often violently punished. What is extraordinary about Wang’s case is not the fake job ad, the kidnapping or the cross-border smuggling into a compound filled with thousands of victims from around the world. Rather, it is his rescue that is unusual. Across the region, hundreds of thousands of people are locked away in similar circumstances. Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar have all seen a massive proliferation of scam compounds in recent years. Run by a range of organized crime groups, the compounds are often linked to powerful local individuals and operate with impunity. Where did scam compounds come from? More than a decade ago, cheap internet made Cambodia an early hotspot for Chinese and Taiwanese phone scammers. Pretending to be officials from the government, insurance companies or other businesses, scammers used Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to call victims in their home countries – most frequently China – and trick them or threaten them into transferring money out of their bank accounts. Early scam operations run out of Cambodia, Kenya, Malaysia and elsewhere bankrupted countless individuals and netted billions of yuan. While thousands of people have been arrested and deported over the years, those early operations were never fully stamped out and instead proliferated and grew more sophisticated and broad-reaching. In Cambodia, a 2019 ban on online gambling followed by a mass exodus of Chinese expats and tourists during the pandemic saw casinos increasingly repurposed as scam centers. Special Economic Zones created in Laos and other countries to foster new businesses became hubs of criminality due to lax regulations. In Myanmar, meanwhile, the coup and resulting civil war expanded business opportunities for would-be criminals while lessening the likelihood of enforcement. Couple the endemic corruption with a global pool of relatively educated but desperately poor job seekers and you get the makings of an unprecedented criminal opportunity. Estimates of money stolen by criminal groups operating out of lower Mekong nations now range from U.S. $18 billion a year to upwards of $40 billion. How do the scams work? Tricking victims into believing their accounts have been compromised remains a common scam in much of the world. But compounds in Southeast Asia have heavily focused on 'pig butchering' scams in recent years. A loose translation of sha zhu pan (杀猪盘), 'pig butchering' refers to the process of fattening up a victim before sending them to the slaughter. If these scams take more time and energy, they also appear to net higher gains. After messaging millions of people – often with innocuous messages that are written off as simply a wrong number – scammers then focus their energies on the few who reply, slowly building up a friendship or romantic relationship. Over time, victims are convinced to invest in crypto or other business opportunities, with small returns often shared back to them. Having seen this 'proof' of their loved one’s business prowess, the victim is then convinced to make a much more significant 'investment.' In this way, victims routinely lose thousands, hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. Who are the scammers? But the victims often include the scammers themselves. While it is clear that some scammers are willingly employed, drawn by the promise of large salaries in countries where poverty is rife, many compounds continue to rely on large pools of trafficked labor. As in Wang’s case, victims are often lured with the promise of a well-paid job that draws on the language and computer skills many of the region’s underemployed youth hold. Reports from former scammers suggest some who are successful in defrauding victims stand to make good money and not all are employed forcibly. But far more reports have emerged of scammers being tied to their phones through stark violence. Beatings, electroshock, withholding of meals and other forms of abuse and torture appear common at such compounds, with escapees often sharing devastating stories. Those operating the scam compounds also earn money in more straightforward ways, such as ransoming kidnapped victims back to their friends and family. A Taiwanese fire dancer who was kidnapped in Thailand and brought to a scam park last month was forcibly trained as a scammer and told he would be freed only if his family paid $30,000. While he was released after a joint operation between Taiwanese and Thai police, many of those who make it out of compounds do so only after their families have paid up. It is exceedingly difficult to know how many people are being held against their will in such centers, but estimates are in the hundreds of thousands, with the U.N. suggesting upwards of 100,000 people have been trafficked into Cambodia and another 120,000 in Myanmar. While operators are generally understood to be tied to Chinese crime groups, trafficked workers come from across the globe. In recent years, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Nepal, Kenya, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Uganda, Kenya and more have rescued citizens or seen them escape from compounds in Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqon4u0l1Tok2g	2025-01-25T17:27:11-08:00	
Russia-Iran Treaty Signifies A ‘Breakthrough’ In Ties – OpEd	Russia and Iran, as two immediate neighbours and great powers with a glorious history, had a difficult, chequered relationship through centuries. It goes to the credit of Iranian pragmatism that it learned to live with the consequences of Tsarist Russia’s expansionism rather than getting locked in eternal enmity. In some ways, it also shared the plight of China at the hands of predatory powers. Such bitter experiences inevitably get embedded in a nation’s psyche. Therefore, the signing of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty between Iran and Russia on January 17 in Moscow is indeed a poignant landmark signifying the mutual acceptance as partners in an equal relationship. It is also an attempt to build guardrails so as to enable a new trajectory of relationship in mutual interests. The Russian President Vladimir Putin aptly called it a 'breakthrough'. The negotiations were protracted and the signing of the document by the two presidents Vladimir Putin and Masoud Pezeshkian itself got postponed. But anyone who has negotiated with Iranians would know they often scramble at the last minute with fresh proposals and are at all times tough negotiators — especially, in strategic areas like energy. On the other hand, both Russia and Iran are intensely conscious that this is a top-down relationship. Russians are quite aware that they are dealing with a new leadership in Tehran that prioritises the improvement of Iran’s relations with the West and focuses on its Gulf neighbours who are close allies of the US. Although Putin approved the draft treaty as far back as last September, the signing of the document itself was deferred. Russia appreciates the rationality and self-restraint that Iran exercises in the development of nuclear programme and its brilliant achievement to attain deterrent capability without developing nuclear weapons. Conversely, Russians would certainly know that Iranians will never barter away their sovereign prerogatives and strategic autonomy with any country. However, the transition in Tehran following the death of former president Ebrahim Raisi introduced created an element of uncertainty as the ensuing closely-fought election and formation of a new government turned out to be a 'regime change' of sorts. The foreign policy strategy of the new government led by Pezeshkian — improving Iran’s ties with Gulf neighbours (and the West) — is pivoted on the resolution of the nuclear question with the US, which holds the key to the lifting of western sanctions that is the pathway to Iran’s economic recovery. That said, the political will at the leadership level for building a strategic partnership in a long-term perspective is not in doubt. Both Russia and Iran envisage tactical and strategic advantages in working together closely in the conditions under sanctions. Interestingly, Article 19 of the Treaty devotes much attention to the sharing of experiences on how to push back the draconian western sanctions. Pezeshkian underscored that ahead of his visit to Moscow, he spoke with the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who emphasised 'how important it is to develop comprehensive relations with Russia.' The warm, respectful and trustful interaction between Putin and Khamenei has been the lodestar of the relationship in the recent decade. Much will depend on the leadership position after Khamenei, 86, the Vali-e Faqih or supreme jurisprudent who exercises ultimate authority over all branches of the government, and is Iran’s commander-in-chief. The salience of the treaty lies in the expansion and deepening of military cooperation, a big leap forward in energy ties with some mega projects on the anvil such as oil swaps and a brand new gas pipeline through Azerbaijan with a planned capacity of 55 bcm, joint efforts on de-dollarisation and clearing system in local currency and, on the whole, a qualitatively new level of coordination in the foreign policy strategies of the two countries in both bilateral and multilateral framework such as EAEU, BRICS and SCO. However, integration into the Eurasian matrix may suit Iran only up to a point, since Tehran gives the highest importance to its strategic autonomy and historically lacked a 'bloc mentality.' Curiously, Article 3 of the treaty painstakingly flags the maleficent activities that neither side should undertake against the other! Iran doesn’t face the threat of foreign aggression and the agreement falls short of the mutual defence treaty Russia has with North Korea or the US has with over half a dozen Latin American countries and the Philippines (but not Israel.) Nonetheless, Pezeshkian has said that a full-fledged military cooperation with Russia is now possible. 'The enemy should have no illusions that we can easily be defeated,' he remarked and left it at that. The treaty does not obligate the two countries to come to the other’s defence if one is attacked; they agree, instead, not to provide military or other assistance to the aggressor! Suffice to say, the treaty falls short of an alliance while it could, arguably, have the 'butterfly effect' of an alliance on regional politics. Iran has experienced that Russia remained passive vis-a-vis the intensive and relentless Israeli air attacks against its deployments in Syria. Moscow even put in place a deconfliction mechanism in place bilaterally with Tel Aviv to prevent mistaken attacks on each other — although Russia and Iran were fighting on the same side as comrades-in-arms during the Syrian civil war. The treaty will be severely tested if a US-Iran rapprochement gets under way during President Donald Trump’s presidency — however preposterous that might seem. But Iran’s dependence on Russia will only increase if Trump reverts to the 'maximum pressure' strategy and works to undercut the growing Saudi-Iranian amity to persuade Riyadh to normalise with Israel in the spirit of the Abraham Accords and reset its foreign policy compass to the default position casting Iran in adversarial terms. Prima facie, this is unlikely to happen, since a Middle Eastern conflict is not in Trump’s agenda. In fact, the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s call to Trump on Wednesday highlighted an offer to invest $600 billion, underscoring the shift in the Kingdom’s regional priorities. The White House readout also stressed 'efforts to bring stability to the Middle East, bolster regional security, and combat terrorism… and Saudi Arabia’s international economic ambitions over the next four years as well as trade and other opportunities to increase the mutual prosperity.' There was no reference to Iran. Agreements per se do not change anything. The key lies in their implementation. The construction of Bushehr nuclear power plant got unduly delayed as Russians dragged their feet under pressure from the US and Israel forcing Tehran to file a case claiming damages. Of course, circumstances are different today but how far Russia will be willing to transfer advanced military technology to Iran remains an open question. The prospects of the Russia-Iran treaty becoming a game changer in regional politics will also depend on the current transformation in Saudi-Iranian normalisation and the related trends in regional politics consolidating. Russia becomes a stakeholder in reinforcing such trends. There is no question that with growing uncertainties in Russian-Turkish relations and the rivalries in the Black Sea (which is no longer a 'Russian lake'), Iran becomes a key partner in Russia’s regional connectivity. Unsurprisingly, the treaty acknowledges that cooperation in the Caspian Sea region is vital. Russia’s keenness to get the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) fully operational is self-evident. The treaty (Articles 20 and 21) dwells on the transportation sector as a strategic area in the Russian-Iranian relationship. Iran stands to gain in its positioning as a dependable regional hub connecting Russia with some of the key countries in the Global South, including India and Pakistan.

Why Some People Turn To Authoritarianism In The Name Of Freedom –...	By Benjamin von Wyl Just six days after the storming of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, prominent historian Quinn Slobodian and Harvard political scientist William Callison tried to make sense of what had happened in the Boston Review. Just who were the insurgents who had stormed and vandalised the Capitol building? The brightly painted Vikings and cowboys didn’t fit the usual image of far-right vandals. They seemed more like people who wanted to be perceived as individuals. Slobodian and Callison recognised a political dynamic among many of those involved in the riots which they called 'diagonalism'. They coined the term from the term 'diagonal thinkers', as the radical opponents of Covid-19 pandemic measures in German-speaking countries called themselves. 'At the extreme end, diagonal movements share a conviction that all power is conspiracy,' Slobodian and Callison wrote. Many of them believe that public power cannot be legitimate. In many ways, they are 'descendants of the extra-parliamentary New Social Movements of the 1970s' who have shifted from left to right – without idealism or the desire for collective action and liberation. Slobodian and Callison also referred to a study by the University of Basel, led by the sociologist Oliver Nachtwey, on the radical opponents of Covid-19 measures. From cosmopolitans to ardent far-right supporters Nachtwey and his team were the first to analyse the attitudes of opponents of Covid measures in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. They concluded that some of the protesters originally came from left-wing and ecological circles, but had evolved to now only trust far-right parties – if anybody. In an interview with SWI swissinfo.ch, Amlinger and Nachtwey recall their initial surprise on realising that there are people 'who saw themselves as cosmopolitans and who are now strong supporters of the Alternative for Germany (AfD)'. Nachtwey encountered something similar back in 2017 in interviews with supporters of the German online campaign platform Campact. The platform advocates 'progressive politics', often on environmental and social issues. So it was all the more surprising when some of the platform’s own supporters expressed outrage over a petition against the far-right AfD. Joe Rogan, Robert F. Kennedy, and the ‘world’s coolest dictator’ During the pandemic, Amlinger researched how and why some German intellectuals were sliding from liberal positions towards right-wing authoritarianism. The sociologists Amlinger and Nachtwey – who in private life are a couple – discussed their research topics and started to wonder: 'are we actually both looking at the same phenomenon?' That is, people who adopt authoritarian positions in the name of freedom – and the question of how and why this happens. The ensuing discussions resulted in the jointly authored book Offended Freedom: The Rise of Libertarian Authoritarianism, the English translation of which has just come out in the UK. It will also be published in the US in February. Offended Freedom is based on interviews in German-speaking countries, but it creates links with other international phenomena which seemed like political outliers for many: the popular US podcaster Joe Rogan, for example, who backed left-wing Democrat Bernie Sanders in 2020 before supporting Donald Trump in 2024; Bitcoin fans who enthused about the 'world’s coolest dictator' in El Salvador; or the enthusiasm for anti-vaccination figure Robert F. Kennedy. Amlinger and Nachtwey describe supporters of authoritarian politics and politicians who do not see themselves as followers of a leader, but as individualists and rebels. 'Many of those interviewed described the feeling that they no longer understood the world because it had turned against them,' Amlinger explains. ‘Like foreigners in our own country’ Many had suffered specific grievances. Amlinger gives the example of someone who was refused service by migrant workers at a petrol station. 'Many use the phrase ‘foreigners in our own country’. And they blame migrants or non-binary people for this sense of alienation,' she says. However, the feeling of alienation and offence stems from other causes, Amlinger and Nachtwey claim. In particular, it derives from the unfulfilled promise of social advancement and the weakening of civil society. 'Modern society is a fiendish construct,' Nachtwey says. 'On the one hand, many people are better off. For instance, it’s no longer the norm for four children to share a room. But on the other hand, individualism conveys a promise of advancement which – in Germany, for example – no longer works.' At the same time, the role of 'places which build a sense of community', such as trade unions, clubs and churches, is waning. From ‘post-democracy’ to ‘offended freedom’ The British political scientist Colin Crouch recommended Offended Freedom to its English-language publisher for translation. Crouch’s most famous work is Post-Democracy, which at the turn of the millennium made him a favourite author among those who wanted to understand political developments from a left-wing perspective. Today, Canadian sociologist Slobodian and – now also accessible in the English-speaking world – Amlinger and Nachtwey occupy a similar role. At the time, Post-Democracy traced how democratic discourse was disappearing due to the professionalisation of public relations thinking and the influence of private television. Offended Freedom can now be read as explaining the reciprocal effect of this development described by Crouch 25 years ago. Many people are lonely and their prospects do not look bright. 'In the 1960s, the thinking was: ‘My children will at some point be better off’,' says Nachtwey. 'But today, in countries like Germany, the promise of social advancement no longer works.' The future no longer seems like something to be actively designed, because 'even those in denial secretly know that climate change is striding forwards'. Why the fascination with Musk? It seems fitting that Offended Freedom will be published in the US in February. In the first few weeks of 2025, Elon Musk got involved in the politics of many countries. The multi-billionaire in the new Trump administration has himself followed a diagonal political path – from an economic liberal with progressive views to a 'chief amplifier of authoritarianism'. This is how Amlinger and Nachtwey recently described him in the conservative German paper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The Basel sociologists often feature in the German media, for instance to explain Javier Milei’s success in Argentina – or the Musk phenomenon. 'When Elon Musk gives right-wing extremists a platform, this ties into the idea of disruptiveness: that liberal democracies and their institutions must first be destroyed in order to build something new and different,' Amlinger says. The idea of creative destruction is now being transferred to the shaping of society. This appeals to many people on an emotional level, 'because they have the feeling in everyday life that society is paralysed, at a standstill, not developing at all or developing in the wrong direction,' says Amlinger. 'Rebels already appeared in the classic critical theory of the 1930s and 1940s – but as fringe figures,' says Nachtwey. 'Today they are no longer on the fringe.' Criticism of Offended Freedom Many German-language media published highly favourable reviews of Offended Freedom. The Süddeutsche Zeitung called the book 'almost a page-turner', thanks to the breadth of its theory and scope of its ambitions. The liberal Neue Zürcher Zeitung, meanwhile, took a more critical view. Although the work is 'theoretically original, empirically substantiated and accessibly written', the authors’ own definition of freedom places too much importance on solidarity, the reviewer concluded. This leads to a lack of understanding for those who rebelled against the restrictions on freedom during the pandemic – for instance the fact that, over a given period, only those who had been vaccinated against or had recovered from Covid-19 were allowed into all shops in Germany. According to the NZZ reviewer, the social sciences in Germany are coloured by these experiences, giving rise to a different type of debate than in the English-speaking world. The Basel sociologists’ view of 'negative freedoms' – that is, freedom from restrictions – is too critical: 'it is not freedom but its restriction that needs to be justified', the review stated. The understanding of freedom may be open to dispute, but reality is not. Like Slobodian in his analysis of the vandals who stormed the Capitol, Offended Freedom also reveals the paranoid worldview that many of these new, libertarian autocrats espouse. ‘Lack of self-criticism’ among politicians and authorities Nonetheless, Nachtwey and Amlinger believe that the impulse to be critical of power and to get involved is the right one. In their book, they advocate 'a vital critique of power from below that does not deny reality, but rather tries to change concrete conditions'. In the interview, the sociologists also make it clear that they are not uncritical of liberal democracies. 'It is not simply a conspiracy theory that the promises of modern society are often not kept,' says Nachtwey. 'At the very least, liberal democracies lack the ability to self-criticise.' Politicians and authorities must 'learn from their mistakes and name them'. What is needed is a more self-critical attitude and a different way of dealing with justified criticism. This, the sociologists conclude, would possibly prevent some people from getting entangled in conspiracy narratives and turning against democracy and its institutions in the name of freedom.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqok-bWcJSA7qf	2025-01-25T17:17:59-08:00	
Biden’s Last-Minute Actions Were A Catastrophic Own Goal – OpEd	By Andrew Morrow Just before US President Donald Trump returned to his rightful place on January 20, the outgoing Joe Biden administration decided to add just a couple more entries to the catalog of egregious and/or maliciously stupid actions it has filled out over the past four years. One of these, in particular, practically gift-wrapped Trump the ability to remake the country in a way that hasn’t been seriously considered for generations. Opening up a dump truck of worms On Friday afternoon, January 17, in the final business hours available to the Biden administration, staffers posted a bizarre and bewildering series of tweets. (I won’t say Biden did, since the man can hardly string two sentences together, and him managing his own tweets would be too great a stretch of the imagination.) These posts purported to amend the constitution by declaring the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) enacted. The ERA was one of those left-wing policy experiments that cropped up in the 1970s which, had it passed, would have removed any legal distinction between the sexes. This may sound like a good thing, but it would not have been if you think about it for about ten seconds. For example, if the ERA had passed, sex-specific restrooms would not ever be a thing. Nevertheless, it got a lot of traction, but it failed to clear the required number of state ratifications before the legal deadline and was dropped. However, the presidential X account announced that, based on some subsequent, symbolic state adoptions of resolutions supporting the ERA, the amendment had cleared the required hurdles to become the '28th Amendment' and was now the law of the land. Of course, it isn’t; nevertheless, this did not stop the vice presidential X accountand a host of Democrat gubernatorial and legislative accounts from echoing the assertions that the ERA was now the law of the land. Let’s pause for a moment and reflect on the wisdom of setting the precedent of amending the constitution by tweet just days before Donald Trump retakes power. You know, the Shitposter-in-Chief. Did anyone consider that? No, they didn’t, of course. Leftists aren’t very good with second-order consequences in the best of times, certainly not in a moment of such high stress as the return of Orange Hitler. And of course, Biden’s interns and lackeys didn’t actuallymanage to legally amend the constitution — but if anyone might be capable of doing that, it would be Trump. They should not have given him the idea. Questionable legality begets questionable legality As if that bit of political brilliance wasn’t enough, the administration followed it up on the morning of the inauguration with a number of last-minute preemptive pardons to people such as: (1) Anthony Fauci, who totally didn’t commit any crimes related to the COVID-19 vaccine, guys — just don’t pay attention to how his pardon covers the time when doing gain-of-function research was specifically barred. (2) General Mark Milley, the general who totally didn’t commit stand-you-against-the-wall-without-trial treason by doing things like contacting a Chinese general and sharing military secrets and saying he would defy Trumps’ orders or lying to Trump about the presence of US soldiers in Syria in order to prevent the president from having control over his own troops. (3) The rest of the president’s family, other than his son Hunter whom he pardoned back in December. Remember that accepting a pardon is an admission of guilt, so the Bidens are, evidently, a crime family. But even this will pay dividends. Biden and prominent other Democrats such as Senator Adam Schiff (a beneficiary of one of Biden’s last-minute pardons himself) have previously said they believe preemptive pardons to be lawless behavior. Now, these last-minute excesses have lent Trump all the legitimacy he needed to issue a raft of blanket pardons to January 6 hostages and promulgate a batch of executive orders to do things like (1) withdraw the USA from the World Health Organization, (2) mandate that the government recognize only two sexes and, the crown jewel, (3) end birthright citizenship for both birth tourists and anchor babies. Though Trump knows that last one is going to provoke a tough legal fight, I’m very certain he wouldn’t have done it if he wasn’t sure of ultimate victory. I myself have written about how the theory behind undoing birthright citizenship is solid, and I expect to see Trump’s Department of Justice push it across the finish line. The idiocy of the Biden administration in trying to govern by tweet and upend 'norms' has gifted Trump the ability to do what needs to be done to push his agenda forward, and I have 100% confidence that the team Trump has in place right now has the stones to see it done.

The Big Freeze At HHS, CDC, And NIH – OpEd	Part of the sweep of government in the first days of the Trump administration has been a freeze on communications. The explosion has hit the whole of public health bureaucracies, which Trump personally blames in part for the meltdown of his previous term of president in his last year. The pause in operations is designed to figure out exactly what is going on. It is certainly not the case that Donald Trump wants you to die, contrary to Paul Krugman’s claim. No longer writing at the New York Times, he reserved his rather extreme view for his Substack account. Recall that Krugman was 100 percent for lockdowns and all the rest including the fake science behind vaccine mandates. While most of the world was in cages, he was proclaiming the dawn of the great reset. With that reversed, he has reverted to form. What actually seems to be dying the death is the public health bureaucracy. As the Wall Street Journal explained in their story headlined 'Swaths of U.S. Government Grind to a Halt After Trump Shock Therapy:' 'While glitches aren’t uncommon during the early days of presidential transitions, some longtime federal employees said the chaos seemed more extreme this week due in part to wide-spanning differences between the agendas of the previous administration and the new one. The stalled initiatives extended far beyond Trump’s cancellation of federal DEI programs.' I seriously doubt that public opinion registers much concern. Let’s take a look at the actions of these agencies in the pre-inauguration days before the freeze. The Department of Health and Human Services announced on January 17, three days before the inauguration, a jaw-dropping $590 million grant to Moderna, a driving force behind global vaccination with mRNA shots during Covid. The announcement of this grant changed the fortunes of the company’s stock price, which had been in a two-year slide. The timing alone cries out for explanation. Was this to dump largess on the deep-state partner before Trump could stop it? Or was it tacitly approved by the incoming administration in order to keep Trump’s fingerprints from it? We’ll know based on whether this goes ahead. It will certainly be a test of the agency’s future under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., provided he is confirmed by the Senate. For now, it has all the earmarks of an old regime grabbing whatever it can on the way out. Over at the CDC, which exists as part of a suite of agencies under the control of HHS, we have one last communication dating also from January 17. It was to announce the 'first-ever National One Health Framework to Address Zoonotic Diseases and Advance Public Health Preparedness in the United States.' David Bell at Brownstone has been writing about this for longer than a year. As he describes it: 'Those pushing it envision a world in which any lifeform is considered intrinsically equal worth to others. If you must choose between your daughter and a rat, the choice should weigh the probability of survival of each, or may do the least harm to other lifeforms after being saved. Within this ‘equitable’ worldview, humans become a pollutant. Ever-growing human populations have driven other species to extinction through environmental change, from the megafauna of ancient Australasia to the plummeting insect populations of modern Europe. Humans become a plague upon the earth, and their restriction, impoverishment, and death may therefore be justified for a greater good.' The connection here to Fauci et al, and their view concerning spillover diseases from animals to humans – a major reason why they were so insistent on the zoonotic origins of Covid – is rather obvious. In the middle of the worst part of US lockdowns, Fauci and his co-author David Morens wrote an article for Cellin which they explain that the real problem with life on earth began 12,000 years ago when 'human hunter-gatherers settled into villages to domesticate animals and cultivate crops. These beginnings of domestication were the earliest steps in man’s systematic, widespread manipulation of nature.' It’s always with the same theme. If there were fewer of us, had we never had much contact with each other, if we never dared to cultivate crops, domestic animals, store water, and move around, we could have been spared all diseases. The real problem is what we call civilization itself, which is why the article ends with an assault on 'overcrowding in dwellings and places of human congregation (sports venues, bars, restaurants, beaches, airports), as well as human geographic movement,' all of which 'catalyzes disease spread.' The only solution, in this view, is 'rebuilding the infrastructures of human existence, from cities to homes to workplaces, to water and sewer systems, to recreational and gatherings venues.' One Health, as newly embraced by the CDC, amounts to a radical transformation of the basis of social order itself, under the guidance of god-like scientists who alone know how to structure the best life for all living things, even if that comes at the expense of human flourishing. David Bell describes this creepy strain of belief as a 'cult' but it might also be described as an ideology very different from the dominant ones in the 20th century. Socialism might have proven unworkable but at least it aspired to the improvement of human life. Capitalist ideology was the same. This is something different, with more in common with the far-flung imaginings of Rousseau or the Prophet Mani who shared in common the belief that all attempts to create what we call civilization are inherently corrupting of our perfect state of nature. This was part of the underlying philosophical infrastructure of lockdowns and vaccine mandates, not merely a public health establishment doing crazy things that happened to be captured by high-powered industrial interests. There was a dreamy and ultimately ghastly utopianism backing all of these actions, stemming from hot-house salons of government-funded science cabals where they not only refuse to speak to normal people; they have nothing but disdain for the aspirations of the common folk and their attachments to property, family, and tradition (which includes, for example, home remedies on dealing with infectious disease). How it came to be that our main engines of public health came to be captured in whole by such a crazed ideology would require a deep and expansive investigation. Certainly, it happened gradually and largely out of the public eye, so much so that even our best investigative writers are still trying to wrap their brains around it all. Whatever this ideology is, it captured nearly the entire planet Earth in the years 2020-2023 or thereabouts and resulted in a health crisis without precedent in modern times. Part of the result of that grand experiment was the unseating of a variety of populist leaders in the US, UK, and Brazil. This seems to have set in motion what Walter Kirn has called 'a coup against a coup,' as the astonishing avalanche of executive orders reveals. The flurry of news – including a full reaffirmation of free speech, a purge of all DEI edicts, a deletion of previous dictates on Central Bank Digital Currencies, and a full hiring freeze in the federal government – has been so massive that the pundit class has been left gasping to stay on top of it all. As for NIH, Jay Bhattacharya has been tagged to head the agency. As he awaits Senate confirmation, the acting head is Dr. Matthew Memoli, an award-winning vaccinologist who has worked at NIH for 16 years. In defiance of the regime, he argued in 2021 that 'with existing vaccines, blanket vaccination of people at low risk of severe illness could hamper the development of more-robust immunity gained across a population from infection.' Our own Fellow Bret Swanson took note of this one dissident within the Fauci ranks and celebrated his resolve to speak truth to power, in a complete takedown of evil four years ago. The doctor came under fire for daring to disagree. Now Dr. Memoli heads the agency he defied. He remains in that position until the man once called a 'fringe epidemiologist' by the previous head of NIH takes full control. This is as close to revolution and counterrevolution as you will find in a democratic society. Something big and potentially wonderful is happening in the realm of public health, which was deployed for egregious purposes only a few years ago. It is a turning point of some sort, and one can hope that the results are consistent with the health, well-being, and freedom of everyone. For now, there doesn’t seem to be too much in the way of public panic about the big freeze at HHS-related agencies, much less the removal of Anthony Fauci’s expensive security detail.

Trump Seizes The Initiative With Ultimatum On Ukraine – Analysis	By Luke Coffey During a presidential debate in Philadelphia last September with Vice President Kamala Harris, Donald Trump made a bold prediction about Ukraine. In response to a question from the moderator, Trump said: 'That is a war that’s dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president.' He also frequently claimed that he could end the war within 24 hours of entering the Oval Office.However, since winning the presidential election in early November, Trump has changed his tone quite a bit on the issue of Ukraine. He even acknowledged that the situation is more complex and harder than he had originally thought, suggesting it could be even more difficult than brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.While speaking to the press in the Oval Office on the evening of Jan. 20, the first day of his second term, Trump was asked if he could still meet his one-day deadline to bring the war to an end. He joked with journalists that he still had 'half a day' left to achieve this.It is clear that much of what Trump said over the past year was purely for the campaign trail. It is likely he never truly believed he could end the war quickly, and the conflict would have to be taken seriously, a point underscored by the people he has appointed to work on this issue. While in other government departments, such as the Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services, and the FBI, Trump has selected unconventional and unorthodox leaders, he has chosen more traditional and orthodox appointees for his national security adviser, secretary of state, and special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.When it comes to Ukraine, two themes have already emerged from the second Trump administration. First, there is a recognition that resolving Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will take far longer than many around Trump expected. This has been made clear through public statements by senior Trump appointees, and by Trump’s directive giving his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general, 100 days to find a solution to the war.Second, and more surprisingly, Trump and his appointees have been more instinctively sympathetic to Ukraine’s position in the conflict. This has come as a surprise to many, especially given the perception that some vocal Trump supporters in the media have parroted Kremlin talking points about Ukraine. Kellogg has publicly supported the continuation of military aid to Kyiv. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, said during his confirmation hearing: 'We know who the aggressor is. We know who the good guy is. We’d like to see (the resolution of the war be) as advantageous for the Ukrainians as possible.' Robert Wilkie, head of Trump’s Pentagon transition team, told the BBC in a recent interview that the president will tell Putin to stop the war in Ukraine or 'we’ll give Zelensky everything he needs.' Trump himself has also placed significant blame on Moscow. In a message to the Kremlin posted on social media this week, he said: 'I’m going to do Russia, whose economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big favor. Settle now, and stop this ridiculous war.' He demanded that Russia agree to a deal to end the conflict, suggesting that Moscow was the primary obstacle to progress. After threatening further economic sanctions and tariffs targeting Russia, Trump said: 'We can do it the easy way, or the hard way — and the easy way is always better.'This ultimatum from the US president to his Russian counterpart has placed Moscow in a difficult position. Some commentators and Russian media outlets have already expressed regret that Joe Biden is no longer in the White House. Meanwhile, while the situation remains dire for Ukraine on the front lines, there are reasons for optimism. President Volodymyr Zelensky has played his political cards well. While it was fashionable for Western leaders to criticize Trump over the summer, Zelensky continued to engage with Trump’s inner circle, securing a key meeting in late September in New York. Within 24 hours of Trump’s election victory, the two leaders spoke by phone. On a personal level, the two seem to get along well.Also, six months after their audacious intervention into Russia’s Kursk region, the Ukrainians have successfully repelled multiple Russian counterattacks, some involving soldiers from North Korea. Kyiv’s ability to hold territory inside Russia provides valuable leverage for any future negotiations.Zelensky has worked tirelessly on the international stage, particularly with countries from the Global South, to craft a fair and just peace plan. Multiple Ukrainian-led peace summits have been held in locations such as Saudi Arabia, Malta, and Switzerland, with participation from dozens of nations. Meanwhile, Russia has struggled to secure meaningful support or consensus at international forums, including the recent BRICS summit in Kazan. Ukrainian diplomacy is paying off, framing the groundwork for potential future talks.So, what comes next? There is no denying that Trump is sincere in his desire to end the war. The big question is how he will achieve this. Although US foreign aid has been suspended for 90 days pending further review by the new administration, it has been clarified that this does not apply to military aid for Ukraine. Open-source intelligence indicates that US cargo planes, presumably filled with aid for Ukraine, have landed at a Polish airfield near the Ukrainian border. For now, Trump has adopted a position of arming Ukraine, while pressuring Russia.Ultimately, Trump aims to appear competent and strong on the global stage. He understands that any resolution to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that leaves Ukraine weaker or more vulnerable will be seen as a Russian victory and an American defeat.One week into the Trump administration, there is cause for cautious optimism on Ukraine. So far, so good. Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqovHVhF0_XvMh	2025-01-25T16:49:26-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The India Ties – OpEd	The Horn of Africa States and India have a long history together although this is not talked about much. It was not only commerce and trade that connected them but they were connected as people of the same origin and through empires and empire building. They were connected through spirituality, religiosity and writing. Indeed, the Indian Ocean basin, was once the center of world commerce and especially the northern part, the Somali Sea, where trade flourished between the region and the sub-continent. Indians, like in many other countries of the world, had always had a prominent presence either as traders, quasi-citizens/residents and/or clerks and soldiers for the British Empire, which deployed them in the vast number of countries, it controlled during the colonial period. Many have stayed and many of them have inter-married with Horn Africans while still others have become prominent personalities in the political life of the world and the region where they have fathered or mothered many of the politicians of the region. During the periods that followed the independence of the region, many have stayed and did not return to India. They literally became the backbone of trade and business of East Africa and even Somalia and other countries of the region. However, after the collapse of the civilian and military governments of the region in the early nineties, the region is marked by the absence of India and Indians from the region. This may be understandable for the Indian individuals, because of the chaos and massive insecurity in the region, involving terror groups and infights based on tribal and clan affiliations of the locals, but inexplicable for the Indian government. Its security envelope must have contingencies for the Horn of Africa States region, a geostrategic location which links Asia, Africa, Arabia, and the rest of the world through the Suez Canal. The only time India participated and showed its interest with respect to the region was its participation in the early nineties in the United Task Force (UNITAF), and the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM), when 4,600 Indian peacekeepers participated in UNSOM II and UNITAF participated in patrolling the coasts of Somalia to fight piracy. It also participated in the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) since 2009. In all cases, India acted only as a participant in efforts generated by others, but it never on its own initiated a project to protect its interests nor help the region as a partner in business and security. It is even stranger to note that one of the leaders of the region, President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud of Somalia, is reported to have studied in India and it should have been one of the early contacts in the foreign policy of his administration. However, despite travelling extensively and being accused of being both the country’s foreign minister and president at the same time, the President appears not to see India as a potential partner. Neither does India see Somalia as a potential partner in its security apparatus involving the Indian Ocean, where both are members of the rim countries of the Indian Ocean. Somalia is one of the countries which qualify for India’s Duty-Free Tariff Preference (DFTP), which is a government of India unilateral scheme for least developed economies – part of the South-South arrangements initiated by India. Somalia’s foreign trade, however remains small compared to other countries such as the Arabian countries of Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates, and even distant China. Because of the lack of basic statistics in Somalia, it is difficult to provide exact statistical numbers for the volume of trade of Somalia. However, neighboring Ethiopia, a member of the Horn of Africa States region, reports that it trade volume with India is on the rise. According to New Business Ethiopia, the trade volume between the two countries in 2019 – 2020, recorded US$ 1.27 billion, with Ethiopia exporting products like coffee, pulses and clothing to India and importing pharmaceuticals, machinery and equipment, textiles and garments, electronic products and others from India. Djibouti and Eritrea also deal with India but trade volumes remain minuscule compared to trade volumes with other competitor countries like China. India suffers from terrorism as much as Somalia does, and the region in general. Other than traditional trade, this would be an area where the two regions, and more specifically Somalia and India, should have worked together to create collectively a stable, peaceful and secure environment. Somalia could benefit from the counter-insurgency experiences of India in tackling the terror groups in its country. The Horn of Africa States region is busy on its own travails and perhaps does not see beyond its nose. It is where India, is perhaps required to take first steps in the direction of building closer ties and in particular since both regions know each other throughout history. India should ally its foreign policy to the beleaguered region and especially Somalia which faces it across the Indian Ocean.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqonXE1_pr51G-	2025-01-25T16:44:48-08:00	
Thousands Of Slovaks Take To The Streets Against PM Fico’s Pro-Ru...	By Charles Szumski (EurActiv) -- The streets of Bratislava turned into a sea of dissents on Friday as tens of thousands rallied in Freedom Square against Prime Minister Robert Fico's pro-Russian and anti-Western stance. The protest was orchestrated by the civic group Mier Ukrajine (Peace for Ukraine) to rally against Fico's policies, particularly his perceived pro-Russian leanings. Organisers pegged the crowd at around 60,000 – a quadruple attendance compared to the last demonstration two weeks ago, according to Reuters. The anti-government sentiment wasn't confined to the capital as similar protests popped up in 20 other cities across Slovakia, with news website Dennik N estimating at least 100,000 participants. Popular uproar against Slovakia's left-wing populist prime minister heightened after Fico's undisclosed trip to Moscow to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin in December. Critics have interpreted the trip as a shift away from EU and NATO alignment towards a pro-Russian stance, particularly as it came after Slovakia was forced to find new gas supply routes following Ukraine's refusal to extend transit agreements with Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Friday's demonstrations with a supportive statement on X, writing in Slovak: 'Bratislava is not Moscow. Slovakia is Europe,' and echoing protesters' calls for a stop to Russian influence. Earlier this week, Fico accused political opponents of trying to sow chaos, warning that protestors might organise a 'Maidan'-style revolution – in reference to the wave of civil unrest that occurred in 2013 in Ukraine – occupy government buildings, call a national strike, or confront security forces. Our reporters on the ground were able to confirm, however, that the demonstrations were peaceful and calm, both on the part of the demonstrators and the police, which the organisers thanked for its cooperation. On Tuesday, opposition parties sought a no-confidence vote against Fico's government, although they later withdrew the motion, stating they would soon table a new request. The Slovak prime minister has so far looked set to survive a possible vote as he maintains a thin majority, Reuters reported. Pressure is now mounting on Fico, as the current demonstrations will no doubt remind him of the events of 2018, when mass protests following the murder of journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová ultimately forced him to resign as prime minister. Natalia Silenská and Zuzana Gabrizová took part in reporting.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqopwYJfkpHXD_	2025-01-25T16:36:50-08:00	
Global Hyper Shift: Why The Right-Wing Turn Is A Light? – OpEd	An epoch is an interval on the time scale with a rich historical context, where there is a clear storyline: beginning - climax - end. An epoch is also a very personal concept on the same time scale - but an individual scale. And according to the theory of fractals, quite significant for holistic synthesis. Now we have to recognize: we, with all our individual dimensions of 'epoch' live in a situation of historical growing tension, macro-slump, shift of the usual paradigm of economic and political processes. Institutional erosion, or changes in norms, rules, values and procedures entail changes in the global social and institutional structure and the linkages that define that structure and those linkages. We cannot say for sure that we are witnessing a historical epochal culmination, but it is hard to deny that we are indeed living in times of great change. Underlying any event are causal factors that are not always directly traceable to the actual outcome. A clear view of the causation of a phenomenon - albeit not without its attendant errors - is the first step towards a sober understanding of reality (the totality of observed phenomena and their interrelationships) and the ability to see the future. The global macro-factor instability of today is clearly expressed in geopolitical conflicts and ethical and cultural polarization, the intensity and expansion of regional armed confrontations, macro-social stratification, strengthening and consolidation of repressive political regimes, the growth of etatism and social paternalism in the democratic world (Western world), the accelerating disintegration and fragmentation of global and pre-modern economic and socio-cultural ties. These processes are based on quite material, economic and even biological drivers. Being an opponent of Huntington's anthropocentric and, in my opinion, almost esoteric, but witty assumptions about the clash of civilizations, I have to admit: from the point of view of today, there is a rational grain in the concept of civilizational clash. At least at the level of first sight, at the level of first impression. If we talk about a critical substantive analysis of such a clash, the study of the economic factors of global socio-political erosion may become one of the most obvious and potentially convincing points of reference in the attempt to understand the causes that have shaped our reality today. After all, economics is simply the exchange of extracted and/or created values that ensure individual and group success: survival and maximization of the number of viable reproductive offspring under conditions of group and ecological competition. This means that economics can be considered as a fundamental prime basis for any changes in population and social formations, including states, nations and even civilizations (if such a term has the right to exist at all). It is pointless to deny the global expansion of etatism in the last 25-30 years. The strengthening of the state is a worldwide social, political and economic trend, expressed in the expansion and deepening of the distributive mandate of successful political entrepreneurs, whom we call political power and bureaucracy. The inevitable consequence of this is the increasing role of state presence in all spheres of public and individual life, since maximizing rents of any nature is the raison d'être of political entrepreneurship. As a result, the concentration of authority over the distribution of public values leads to state paternalism and the propaganda of the 'welfare state', and in reality - to the strengthening of the political establishment's power of retaliation. So, the horizontal exchange of values between free economic agents is destroyed, individual civic consciousness is atrophied, and competitive ambitions to achieve social population success are reduced. A new social contract emerges, within which it seems convenient to sacrifice the natural right to individual freedom and productive entrepreneurial success in exchange for the protection of Leviathan. As a result of state hypertrophy, Western democracies have fallen on the left side of 'socialism' and significantly distorted the market basis of social economic competition, with all the corresponding, extremely negative externalities, which will be discussed below. The Third World countries - developing resource and production donors - have hit the ceiling of their economic opportunities and have chosen to tighten their political regimes regardless of ideological trends (right-wing fascization in Russia or strengthening left-wing authoritarianism in China). Instead of political institutional liberalization and the formation of inclusive institutions as the most effective stimulus for further economic and social development, the countries of the global south took the road backwards - social atavism and political biologization: the construction of a vertical social hierarchy with the dominant right of the superior subject to one or another part of the property of the inferior subject. This backwardization of the distribution of rights and material values can be traced in the strengthening of authoritarianism, tightening of conditions for political competition, usurpation of access to resources, expansion of extractive institutions, suppression of individual self-consciousness, restriction of civil rights, intensification of repressive pressure, and so on. Institutional liberalism and cultural westernization, which became the basis of economic and social progress of the Third World countries in the last third of the 20th and early 21st centuries, are being rapidly discounted as the prime value of the social contract. This is the usual goal of any authoritarian political elites, uncontrolled by society and trying to maximize power and stretch its life cycle: to vacuum public and individual consciousness into ideological narratives about an external enemy and the threat to sovereignty, national greatness, a special historical path, an exceptional cultural code, unconditional traditional values, and so on. Geopolitical aggressiveness of developing authoritarian dictatorships of third countries in the conditions of economic growth slowdown and logical necessity of institutional transformation is a natural movement in the political rut formed by them. Further economic growth and development require modernization (or rather elimination) of extractive institutions and political liberalization, i.e. transition to an inclusive institutional environment with maximum expansion of the number of participants in the creation of added value. Such an environment promotes the development and proliferation of technologies, growth of productivity and added value, expansion of economic diversification, and, as a consequence, improvement of individual welfare. Reduction of institutional transaction costs, which is achieved, among other things, by a clear division of competencies of the successive authorities, unlimited social control and unconditional primacy of equality, with the simultaneous weakening of political restrictions have a positive impact on the expansion of economic initiative and competitive efficiency, and thus enhance economic development and ensure growth in the long term. Such a scenario, however, presupposes the refusal of authoritarian elites from the policy of 'sedentary bandit', i.e. rent exploitation: maintaining uncontrolled access to national resources and their unrestricted use in their own interests. This means political democratization, primarily the removal of repressive restrictions on political competition, as well as the restoration of an independent judicial and legal system and ensuring civil individual freedoms. There are not many examples of such modernization. There are far more examples of institutional restrictions, political tightening and physical aggression in a situation where an authoritarian power has exhausted most of the economic possibilities of its regime to maintain the existing social contract. *That is when erosions occur, subsequently leading to vulcanization, and ultimately to changes in the landscape. This is true for both revolutionary and reactionary scenarios. This is the kind of global process we are witnessing today. Nearly twenty-five years of relentless growth of statism in developed democracies - expanding the state's mandate to redistribute resources and value-added - have actually ended in intense economic deglobalization, as well as sociocultural polarization and political fragmentation, both at the country and global levels. Third World countries, which have greatly improved their prosperity by focusing on industrial production and natural resource extraction in global economic distribution chains, are tightening their authoritarian political regimes as the low base effect is exhausted. In addition, the aspirations of their elites to maintain resource and rent control lead to atavistic goals of geographical, or rather biological, expansion of resource rents - military aggression and attempted annexation of other territories for free access to their aggregate resources. Moreover, in the post-industrial phase of economic development of developed countries and against the background of their actual geopolitical inaction, political conformism and production dependence on industrial and resource autocracies, these autocracies are clearly transforming into totalitarian political regimes. In addition, they are actively increasing their efforts to combine their economic and military potentials, as well as to combine similar ideological narratives into a unified doctrine of 'traditional values'. The concept of 'traditional values', despite detailed differences in specific cultural and traditional contexts, is generally reduced to the rejection of the individual's right to freedom, collectivism and the dominance of collective interests over individual interests, and, ultimately, the sacralization of power. Such sacralization concerns any superior social subject up to the state prime elite and the highest power beneficiary in the country. This is a dichotomous opposition to the socio-ethical and cultural norms of Western countries based on individual freedom, competition, the rule of law and political democracy. The big trouble is that this opposition is now characterized not just by rhetoric or propaganda, but by attempts at aggressive, including pro-active military geopolitical expansion by authoritarian regimes. Finally, the desire to capitalize on their apparent 2 to global dominance. The widespread and currently exploited term 'multipolar world' quite clearly characterizes the intentions of the advantages. By steadily reducing the production and industrial base through the transfer of facilities to developing countries of the Third World to reduce production costs and ensure the growth of consumer opportunities of the population, developed economies encouraged the expansion of the service component in GDP. Of course, this hindered economic growth, since the service multiplier is much smaller than the production multiplier, which, however, was considered normal in a creative 'world' where each global economic agent could create added value corresponding to its competitive capabilities. The threat appears to be that Western countries are now in an extremely vulnerable position against the backdrop of the growing aggressive ambitions of the 'global south', and in fact - in a significant economic, or rather production dependence on it. The aggravation of global competition - geopolitical, economic, ethical and cultural - is too poor a definition to characterize the current state of affairs. This is not a creative progradational competition within the framework of a single solidarity-accepted paradigm of the world order. It is now an open aggressive conflict, which could be characterized as a 'clash of civilizations', if we follow Huntington's doctrines. Such a conflict could also be called a struggle between freedom and unfreedom, according to the idealistic definitions of political philosophers. However, I believe that the notion of 'intensified evolutionary competition' more biologically, and thus accurately and fundamentally captures the essence of contemporary global conflict. How quickly the countries of the Western world, primarily the United States, will be able to compensate for their lost industrial and military power advantage will determine their success in the competitive confrontation with the growing tyrannies. Having given up its productive potential to authoritarian regimes and entered the phase of the post-industrial cycle, the West was unable to ensure a controlling foreign policy aimed at preventing the growth and expansion of authoritarianism in the countries concerned. On the one hand, integration and co-optive processes with these countries were clearly insufficient for the sustainable proliferation of Western socio-institutional values and did not stimulate the Third World establishment to move towards a 'unipolar' creative Western world. On the contrary, closure in its own isolated sphere became a natural vector of political tightening and building societies of closed-access orders with all the accompanying externalities. On the other hand, the conciliatory position of the 'collective West' for the sake of tactical economic benefits - outsourcing of low-cost industrial production and obtaining inexpensive natural resources - has led to the fact that the authoritarian world is now trying to take a position of strength in the global competitive aggravation. The concept of 'non-interference' in internal affairs and the absence of an effective political (e.g., sanctions and stimulus) response to the first steps to strengthen authoritarianism and repressive pressure in developing countries allowed the elites of these countries to finally usurp power and establish a regime of authoritarian dictatorship with ambitions for aggressive territorial and cultural expansion. Thus, globalization, which began as a natural, competitive and positive process of geo-market economic diversification - (natural optimization of the distribution of production, technological, investment and consumer exchange) - within a single paradigm of progressive and humanizing universal values, has not led to the 'end of history' as Francis Fukuyama suggested. On the contrary, the world has entered a stage of acute conflicts- value (ethical and cultural) and material-physical (economic, technological and military). How did the political discourse of Western countries, especially the US, contribute to this Global Hyper Shift? This is an important question because the answer reveals the underlying cause, which is the Left-Keynesian model of economic and social policy. (Learn more about the causes of the Global Hyper Shift here: It is these policies that have allowed the Western political establishment - political entrepreneurs and bureaucracies - to strengthen and expand their administrative, fiscal, distributive and rent-seeking power. It is these policies that have transformed: primacy of the values of individualism - into vicious dogmas of social responsibility, market competition - into state paternalism, freedom of expression - into a culture of abolition, freedom of opinion - into social censorship, equality - into reverse discrimination and dictatorship of minorities, economic incentives - into direct administrative redistribution, free markets - into a dictatorship of state regulation, economic competitive advantage into a threat to economic security, liberalism into bureaucratic socialism, globalization into centrifugal fragmentation, productive default of the Western world and industrial strengthening of authoritarian dictatorships, propagation of the values of freedom, competition and democracy into the maturation of authoritarian tyrannies. The strengthening of right-wing concepts and their growing popularity in Western Europe and the United States is a direct consequence of the degeneration of left-liberal ideology, which has been exploited by political elites in the conduct of economic and social policy for more than 30 years. Conceptual changes in economics, geopolitical strategies and socio-cultural narratives through the prism of the 'rightward shift' (i.e. the reduction of the state, the absolutization of the value of social competition and the unconditional assertion of the supremacy of individualism over collective interests) are a necessary and, if anything, inevitable stage of historical movement, when we try not to fall into the abyss of aggressive barbarization and social atavism, as in the 30s of the 20th century. We can see initial successes on this path already now in Argentina. There is a very high probability that with the Republican Party coming into wide power in the US, we can also hope to correct the Keynesian-ethicist distortions in economics and politics that were the triggers of the Global Hyper Shift. I'll talk about this in detail and substance in the next essay.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqoqc_Eiiu8w62	2025-01-25T16:33:36-08:00	
Indonesia: 100 Days Of Prabowo Presidency Marked By Free-Lunch Fu...	By Pizaro Gozali Idrus Prabowo Subianto’s first 100 days as Indonesian president were marked by policy flip-flops and a choppy start to a flagship school-lunch initiative that have led to growing market apprehension about his lofty economic goals, analysts said. However, average Indonesians gave the ex-army general a top-notch report card according to a survey released this week, with nearly 81% of respondents expressing satisfaction with his performance so far. One public policy expert, Trubus Rahadiansyah from Trisakti University, however, cast doubt on the method of the Kompas Research and Development survey that was conducted from Jan. 4 to Jan. 10, and polled 1,000 respondents. This survey might have not represented 'the full spectrum of society,' Trubus told BenarNews, 'Many government programs are not functioning optimally,' he added, citing early setbacks in the implementation of Prabowo’s flagship school lunch program. 'The free meal program isn’t efficient.' Prabowo’s long-planned flagship program – free lunches for schoolchildren – was launched earlier this month and has reached 650,000 students, according to the National Nutrition Agency. While the initiative has been lauded as a positive step toward reducing child hunger, its content and execution have been panned by nutritionists and other experts. The meal costs 10,000 rupiah (60 U.S. cents) per portion, typically comprises eggs and chicken, and is nearly the same day in and day out, noted Ali Khomsan, a nutritionist at the Bogor Agricultural University. 'Options like fish and beef would provide more diversity, but they come with higher costs,' Ali told BenarNews. 'It is crucial for the government to evaluate how much food is being wasted because students find the meals too monotonous.' Reports of food poisoning among students at two schools have also raised concerns about the quality of the meals, while logistical hurdles have led to distribution problems and delays in implementation in some areas. Prabowo was sworn in on Oct. 20 after a landslide victory in the February 2024 presidential elections. In addition to free school lunches, Prabowo had said that his other priority initiatives included social assistance for low-income groups, salary hikes for teachers and civil servants, and free health check-ups for citizens on their birthdays. For many Indonesians, though, economic concerns are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. The cost of essential items such as rice, chilies, and cooking oil has increased. For instance, cooking oil costs have risen to around 16,500 per liter from 15,000 in late October, although prices vary slightly across regions within the country. Muhammad Fiqruddin, a 32-year-old social worker in Bekasi, West Java, told BenarNews that the many continuing subsidy programs 'mainly target those at the very lowest income level.' 'Those who fall just above that threshold are still struggling to meet basic needs,' he said. But the Kompas survey’s respondents perceived Prabowo as 'people-oriented' and decisive, leading to his approval rating exceeding that of his predecessor, Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, who received 65% early in his presidency. Some of Prabowo’s populist moves have helped him gain such approval. In early November, his government announced a debt forgiveness plan for small businesses, writing off about 10 trillion rupiah in bad debts. Later that month, Prabowo announced a 6.5% increase in Indonesia's minimum wage for 2025, a move praised by Arnod Sihite, deputy chair of the Confederation of All Indonesian Workers Unions. And hours before a 1% rise in value-added tax meant to apply to nearly all goods starting Jan. 1, the government limited the tax hike to luxury goods after a public outcry and street protests. While the scale back to this hike was welcomed, some experts such as analyst Wahyudi Askar at the Center for Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS) believe that moves such as a VAT increase do little to address larger economic issues. 'Instead of taxing the rich more or focusing on big industries, the government relies on policies like increasing VAT,' he told BenarNews. In fact, a more critical CELIOS survey suggested that not everyone is impressed with the Prabowo administration’s early performance. Of 95 journalists surveyed, 49% rated Prabowo’s cabinet as performing poorly, while only 8% gave it a 'good' rating. Economic pressures have also been exacerbated by weakening market indicators. The uncertainty created by the VAT increase U-turn may have rattled some investors, indicated economist Eko Listiyanto from the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance 'The market does not fully trust Prabowo,' Eko told BenarNews. ‘I don’t work with a target’ Prabowo’s foreign policy, meanwhile, has drawn mixed reactions. His decision to join the BRICS economic bloc, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has drawn both praise and criticism. While some view it as a strategic move to enhance Indonesia’s bargaining power, others argue it may increase the country’s reliance on China. As it is, in November, China and Indonesia signed $10 billion worth of deals covering sectors such as food and technology. Meanwhile, Prabowo said he didn’t believe in markers like the 100 day-performance. 'I don’t work with a target of hundreds of days or months,' he told a recent cabinet meeting. He also said at a business forum on Jan. 6 that he remains hopeful about the future. 'The more I study our economic situation, the more confident and optimistic I become,' he said. 'I believe that we will achieve and even possibly exceed the 8% growth target.' Nazarudin Latif and Arie Firdaus in Jakarta contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqovLJPAPE1F9h	2025-01-25T16:28:53-08:00	
Taliban Conditionally Agree To Allow Afghan Girls To Study In Pak...	By Ayaz Gul Taliban authorities in Afghanistan reportedly have agreed to allow female students to pursue higher education in Pakistan, provided that their male guardians also are granted visas to accompany them, according to officials privy to the understanding. The revelation comes as hundreds of Afghan students took entrance examinations on Saturday to secure admission to graduate, postgraduate and Ph.D. programs in Pakistani universities. Officials reported that Afghan refugees living in Pakistan attended designated centers in the cities of Peshawar and Quetta to take their exams, while students in Afghanistan are scheduled to participate online over the next few days. Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan's special envoy for Afghanistan, announced in the lead-up to the tests that nearly 21,000 Afghan candidates, including more than 5,000 females, had submitted their applications for the upcoming summer academic sessions. His office reported 'a significant turnout' of Afghan students at the designated test centers on Saturday but did not provide specific numbers. The Higher Education Commission of Pakistan is conducting entrance tests to select up to 2,000 Afghan students, with one-third of the selected candidates being female. Pakistan expressed its 'profound gratitude' to the Kabul government 'for agreeing to allow successful female candidates to pursue their education, provided that their mahrams [chaperones] are granted visas to accompany them,' said a government official in Islamabad, requesting anonymity due to a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly with the media. The official stated that visas would be issued to chaperones 'to allow them to accompany female students, as mandated by Afghan law,' to study in Pakistani institutions. The Taliban did not immediately comment on Pakistani assertions that they would let Afghan girls pursue higher education in the neighboring country. Pakistan offers fully funded scholarships to thousands of students from its war-ravaged, poverty-stricken neighbor. The program for female students was halted, however, after the hardline Taliban regained power in 2021 and banned girls’ education past the sixth grade. They also prohibited Afghan women from traveling or flying without a chaperone. The Higher Education Commission website states that the scholarship program is designed to foster stronger ties with Afghanistan by providing high-quality education to Afghan students in diverse fields, including medicine, engineering, agriculture, management and computer science. The entrance examinations for Afghan students come amid bilateral tensions that have escalated lately over allegations that anti-Pakistan armed groups are using Afghan territory to launch cross-border terrorist attacks. The Taliban deny claims of allowing or sheltering foreign militants that threaten neighboring countries. After assuming office last month, Sadiq visited Afghanistan, where he held extensive talks with Taliban leaders on ways to stabilize bilateral political, security and trade cooperation. He described his meetings with de facto Afghan officials as productive but did not elaborate. The envoy, while addressing a gathering of Afghan and Pakistani civil society and trade representatives in Islamabad this week, said the two countries are collaborating closely to reduce tensions and enhance economic ties and trade. In addition, he said they are trying to strengthen people-to-people connections through cooperation in education and other sectors. Since sweeping back to power 3½ years ago, the Taliban have instituted sweeping restrictions on Afghan women, barring most of them from seeking public and private sector employment and requiring they cover their faces in public. The United Nations has labeled the curbs as 'gender apartheid' and persistently demanded their reversal. The Taliban defend their governance as being in line with Islamic law, or Sharia, and Afghan culture, rejecting criticism and calls for reversing their policies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqoqiyDL3osMgn	2025-01-25T16:27:53-08:00	
Indian State Of Maharashtra Was Epicentre Of Anti-Muslim Rioting ...	South Indian States displayed communal amity, says a study by the Centre for Study of Society and Secularism (CSSS). India's Western States, particularly Maharashtra, had emerged as the 'epicentre' of communal rioting in India in 2024, according to an all-India study done by the Mumbai-based Centre for Study of Society and Secularism (CSSS). Maharashtra accounted for 12 of the 59 riots in 2024. India, as whole, witnessed 59 communal riots in 2024, a significant rise compared to 32 riots in 2023, an 84% increase. These incidents resulted in 13 deaths—10 Muslims and 3 Hindus, the study states. The 'cow belt' comprising Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and others like Gujarat and Bihar, saw a higher number of communal riots along with Maharashtra. But, as per tradition, the southern states of India reported a far lesser number of communal riots. The same is the case with the state of West Bengal. There has been no change in this regional pattern. Since 2022, there had been a spike in communal riots in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. In 2024, Maharashtra had 12 riots, Gujarat 5, Madhya Pradesh 5, and Rajasthan 3. With 25 communal riots, these states accounted for 42% of the total cases of communal rioting in 2024. Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Haryana reported 13 communal riots – 22% of the total. Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha, saw 13 riots or 22% of the total cases. Karnataka and Telangana in the South reported seven communal riots constituting 12% of the total. The North Eastern region reported only one riot, and that was in Tripura. However, Manipur had been having continuous ethnic and religious rioting. But this was not Hindu-Muslim rioting. In India the term communal rioting applies only to Hindu-Muslim riots. Most communal riots are between Hindus and-Muslims. The CSSS's study was based on reports from prominent newspapers- the Mumbai editions of The Times of India, The Hindu, Indian Express, Sahafat (Urdu), and Inquilab (Urdu). Most communal riots were triggered during religious festivals, especially religious processions. There were four riots during the Pran Pratishthan ceremony at Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in January, seven during Saraswati Puja idol immersion ceremonies, four during Ganesh festivals, and two during Bakr Eid. Religious celebrations were used to fuel communal tensions for political mobilization. Electoral Polarization The spike in the number of communal riots in India in 2024 may be partly attributed to the general elections that were held in April/ May, 2024. Similarly, riots occurred when important States held assembly elections. Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand had elections in 2024. Hate speeches with communal overtones were used to polarize communities on religious lines. But a part of the spike could be attributed to the ecosystem of impunity that was promoted by governments specially those of the Bharaiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled States. Ideology of the Regime Out of the 59 communal riots in 2024, 49 took place in States where the BJP was ruling either on its own, or in coalition with other parties. Coalition partners included Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction) and National Congress Party (Ajit Pawar faction) in Maharashtra and Janata Dal in Bihar. Seven out of 59 communal riots took place in States ruled by the Indian National Congress (INC) while three took place in West Bengal, where the Trinamool Congress was in power. This data can be interpreted to mean that the BJP-ruled States took little or no action to deter communal violence and religious polarization. State authorities had used bulldozers to fatten houses or shops of Muslims as punishment for allegedly breaking the law. The non BJP ruled states had desisted from such actions and that deterred communal riots. In the recent years, riots have been spontaneous events with no pre-planning, unlike in the past. According to the study, this is because anti-Muslim feeling is already embedded in communities and a small spark can trigger a riot. Even arguments on personal mundane issues between individuals from two different religious groups, had triggered riots. Hindu Rashtra Communal riots in 2024 were marked by the bold assertion of Hindu right-wing power in public spaces. Processions deliberately passed through Muslim-majority neighbourhoods with loud music and provocative slogans. Numerous right-wing Hindu groups were emerging at the grassroots level, and to gain popularity and influence, they organized processions or protests in front of mosques and in Muslim neighbourhoods, aiming to provoke or humiliate the community. Three Trends Recent communal riots point to three trends, the study says. The first is the domination or hegemony of public spaces by Hindu right-wing groups. The second is implication of Muslims in serious criminal cases, and the third a trend of meting out collective punishment to Muslims by the demolition of their properties, like houses and mosques. Domination involves provoking and humiliating the Muslim community by Hindu right-wing groups. Retaliation from the Muslim community was used as a pretext to disproportionately arrest Muslims or invoke the severest provisions of the law. Even when Hindu right-wing groups marched aggressively in Muslim-majority areas and vandalized their property, a large number of Muslims were named by the police. These were charged with serious offenses, and investigations were handed over to the National Investigating Agency (NIA), linking them to terrorism. In January in Mumbai, government demolished 15 properties belonging to Muslims in Haidary Chowk on Mira Road after communal riots took place. In Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, known for arbitrary demolitions, the state demolished 11 houses of Muslims after communal riots took place during Muharram procession on 18th July. Contested Places of Worship The year 2024 witnessed six communal riots over places of worship, triggered by Hindu right-wing fringe groups alleging that the mosques and dargahs were illegal or that they were built on Hindu place of worship. The total number of lives lost in such cases was ten (nine of Muslims and one Hindu). Nearly all the arrested were Muslims.It is notable that most of these conflicts were in the Northern states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. Mob Lynching India witnessed 13 incidents of mob lynching in 2024. These ncidents resulted in 11 deaths: one Hindu, one Christian, and nine Muslims. This is a decline from 21 incidents of mob lynching recorded in the year 2023. But the persistence of such attacks remains a concern. The decline in the number of incidents of mob lynching may be attributed to a ruling of the Supreme Court on this matter. Mob lynching by cow vigilantes continues. There were seven incidents of lynching linked to cow vigilantism or accusations of cow slaughter. Other cases of lynching had to do with accusations of interfaith relationships, targeting Muslims. Maharashtra accounted for three lynching cases long with Uttar Pradesh. Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, and Haryana each reported two incidents. Karnataka recorded one. Seven out of thirteen, that is over 50% of the cases, could be attributed to cow slaughter. On June 7, 2024, Chand Miyan (23) and Guddu Khan (35) from Uttar Pradesh were lynched by cow vigilantes near the temple town Arang, in Chhattisgarh, while transporting buffaloes. Saddam Qureshi, the third victim, survived with critical injuries. On August 28, 2024, Munyar boarded a train from Chalisgaon in Jalgaon district to visit his daughter who lives in Kalyan. Munyar was travelling alone in a general compartment where over a dozen men began to harass him. The goons slapped and kicked him on his face constantly, asking him to show what he was carrying in his bag. Munyar was begging with folded hands to spare him as the assaulters threatened to call the Bajrang Dal to chop his body into pieces. The police filed a case but it didn't include section 307- attempt to murder. Love Jihad Accusations of interfaith romance or relationships, termed as 'love jihad' has been used to foment communal tensions and target people. A 19 year old Muslim student of Savitribai Phule Pune University was attacked by five persons who accused the student of 'love jihad'. According to the police, the attack took place on 8th April when the male student was accompanying two female students on the campus. They started questioning the student and asked him to show his Aadhaar card. Upon seeing the student's Muslim man, the assailants attacked him. The police registered FIR against unidentified persons.

Secretary Hegseth’s Message To The Force – Statement	It is the privilege of a lifetime to lead the warriors of the Department of Defense, under the leadership of our Commander in Chief Donald J. Trump. We will put America First, and we will never back down. The President gave us a clear mission: achieve Peace through Strength. We will do this in three ways — by restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding our military, and reestablishing deterrence. o We will revive the warrior ethos and restore trust in our military. We are American warriors. We will defend our country. Our standards will be high, uncompromising, and clear. The strength of our military is our unity and our shared purpose. o We will rebuild our military by matching threats to capabilities. This means reviving our defense industrial base, reforming our acquisition process, passing a financial audit, and rapidly fielding emerging technologies. We will remain the strongest and most lethal force in the world. o We will reestablish deterrence by defending our homeland — on the ground and in the sky. We will work with allies and partners to deter aggression in the Indo-Pacific by Communist China, as well as supporting the President's priority to end wars responsibly and reorient to key threats. We will stand by our allies — and our enemies are on notice. All of this will be done with a focus on lethality, meritocracy, accountability, standards, and readiness. I have committed my life to warfighters and their families. Just as my fellow soldiers had my back on the battlefield, know that I will always have your back. We serve together at a dangerous time. Our enemies will neither rest nor relent. And neither will we. We will stand shoulder to shoulder to meet the urgency of this moment. Like each of you, I love my country and swore an oath to defend the Constitution. We will do that each and every day, as one team. Together we will accomplish the President's mission to deter war, and if necessary, defeat and destroy our enemies. Godspeed!	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqoiZJQ0R2gIFG	2025-01-25T16:18:24-08:00	
Secretary Of Defense Pete Hegseth Begins ‘Most Important Deployme...	By Jim Greenhill Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was sworn into his new role leading America's 3.5 million service members and civilians by Vice President JD Vance this morning, following Hegseth's Friday evening Senate confirmation. 'When President Trump chose me for this position, the primary charge he gave me was to bring the warrior culture back to the Department of Defense,' Hegseth said during his Jan. 14 confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'He, like me, wants a Pentagon laser-focused on lethality, meritocracy, warfighting, accountability and readiness.' Hegseth listed restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding the military and reestablishing deterrence as the ingredients needed to bring back warfighting. Calling himself a change agent, Hegseth outlined a vision of a culture of accountability, high standards, performance, readiness, rapid innovation and merit across the Defense Department. 'We share the same goals,' he told the committee. 'A ready, lethal military; the health and well-being of our troops; and a strong and secure America.' He also said he would trim the bureaucracy and reallocate resources to the warfighter. 'We won World War II with seven four-star generals,' he said. 'Today we have 44. … There is an inverse relationship between the size of staffs and victory on the battlefield. We do not need more bureaucracy at the top. We need more warfighters empowered at the bottom. So, it is going to be my job … to identify those places where fat can be cut, so it can go toward lethality.' A former Army National Guard officer, Hegseth, 44, served as an infantryman leading troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and guarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay. His military awards include two Bronze Star Medals, the Joint Commendation Medal, two Army Commendation Medals, the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Expert Infantryman Badge. Hegseth said his role as the 29th secretary of defense is 'the most important deployment of my life.' Hailing from Minnesota, Hegseth graduated from Princeton University in 2003 and earned a master's degree from Harvard University in 2013. He has led organizations advocating for veterans, served as a Fox News host and published several books. Hegseth and his wife, Jennifer, have seven children.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqovIBbbVNaE-u	2025-01-25T16:15:55-08:00	
Pope Sees ‘Providential’ Moment As Catholics, Orthodox Hope They ...	By AC Wimmer Pope Francis posed Jesus’ profound question 'Do you believe this?' to Christians worldwide during an ecumenical vespers service Saturday evening, as momentum builds for Catholics and Orthodox to consider celebrating Easter on the same date in this historic anniversary year. Speaking at the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls at the conclusion of the 58th Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, the pontiff reflected on Christ’s encounter with Martha following the death of Lazarus, emphasizing that hope 'rises from the ashes of death.' 'This tender encounter between Jesus and Martha teaches us that even in times of deep desolation, we are not alone and we can continue to hope,' the pope said during his homily, which centered on the week’s theme 'Do you believe this?' from John 11:26. The celebration on Jan. 25 marked the solemn conclusion of this year’s Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, which the pope linked to the ongoing Jubilee Year. 'This message of hope is at the heart of the Jubilee we have begun,' Francis said, citing the Apostle Paul’s words to the Romans that 'hope does not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit' (Rom 5:5). Earlier on Saturday, the pope urged journalists at the Jubilee of the World of Communications to tell 'stories of hope', echoing the strong appeal to hope in the papal message for the 59th World Day of Social Communications. At the vesper service, the pope noted that this whole Jubilee Year’s focus is on hope and 'providentially' coincides with the 1700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea. He emphasized that the council’s profession of faith 'transcends all the divisions that have riven the Body of Christ over the centuries.' Cardinal Kurt Koch, prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Christian Unity, addressed the Holy Father before the apostolic blessing. He recalled the pope’s historic 2014 visit to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), where Francis had affirmed that 'the Catholic Church does not intend to impose any requirements except the profession of common faith' for achieving full unity. This hope for unity has gained momentum in recent months. Last November, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople confirmed ongoing conversations between Church representatives about establishing a common Easter date, potentially beginning in 2025. 'In this Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, we can live the anniversary of the Council of Nicaea as a call to persevere on the path toward unity,' the pope said on Saturday, renewing his appeal that Christians might take 'a decisive step forward towards unity around a common date for Easter.' Highlighting the 'providential' timing, Francis noted that Easter will fall on the same date in both the Gregorian and Julian calendars this year. 'Let us rediscover the common roots of the faith,' the pontiff urged. 'Let us preserve unity!' Representatives from various Christian Churches and ecclesial communities present in Rome participated in the evening celebration, including Metropolitan Polycarp representing the Ecumenical Patriarchate and Archbishop Ian Ernest of the Anglican Communion, who is concluding his service.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWep2HaD1HMqomdrYb-F7Qyk	2025-01-25T16:13:42-08:00	
Argentine President Javier Milei’s 2025 Address To World Economic...	This is an AI-generated transcript of President Milei's full address at Davos 2025 as released by the World Economic Forum Good morning everyone. And how much has changed in such a short time. A year ago, I stood here before you, alone, and spoke some truths about the state of the Western world that were met with some surprise and astonishment by much of the political, economic and media establishment of the West. And I must admit that, in a way, I understand it. A president from a country that, as a result of systematic economic failure for more than 100 years, as a result of having the country taken weak stances in major global conflicts, and as a result of us having closed ourselves off to trade, we had lost practically all international significance over the years. A president of such a country stood on this stage and told the entire world that they were wrong, that they were headed for failure, that the West had gone astray, and that it needed to be redirected. The president of that country, Argentina, who was not a politician, who had no legislative support, no backing from governors, business leaders or media groups. In that speech, here standing before you, I told you it was the beginning of a new Argentina, that Argentina had been infected with socialism for far too long, and that with us it would once again embrace the ideas of freedom – a model that we summarize as the defence of life, liberty and private property. And I also told you that in a way, Argentina was the 'ghost of Western Christmases yet to come', because we had already experienced everything you were going through, and we already knew how it would end. A year later, I must say that I no longer feel so alone. I don't feel alone, because the world has embraced Argentina. Argentina has become a global example of fiscal responsibility, of commitment to honouring our obligations and, obviously, a commitment to solve the inflation problem. Also, we are an example of a new way of doing politics, which is about telling people the truth to their faces and trusting that they will understand. Nor do I feel alone because over the course of this year, I have found allies in this fight for the ideas of freedom in every corner of the world – from the amazing Elon Musk to that fierce Italian lady, my dear Giorgia Meloni; from Bukele in El Salvador to Viktor Orbán in Hungary; from Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to Donald Trump in the United States – slowly an international alliance has been forming among all those nations which, like ours, want to be free and believe in the ideas of liberty. And slowly, what once seemed like the absolute global hegemony of the woke left in politics and educational institutions, in the media, in supranational organizations, or even in forums like Davos, has begun to crumble. And I hope for the ideas of freedom is starting to emerge. Today I've come here to tell you that our battle is not yet won. And although hope has been rekindled, it is our moral duty and our historical responsibility to dismantle the ideological edifice of sickly wokeism, until we have succeeded in rebuilding our historical cathedral, until we have ensured that the majority of Western countries once again embrace the ideas of liberty. Until our ideas become the common currency in the halls of events such as this one, we can't let our guard down. Because I must say that forums like this one have been protagonists and promoters of the sinister agenda of wokeism that is doing so much damage to the Western world. If we want to change, if we truly want to defend the rights of citizens, we must first begin by telling them the truth. And the truth is that there is something badly mistaken about the ideas that have been promoted through forums such as this one. And I would like to take a few minutes today to discuss some of them. Today, few will deny that winds of change are blowing in the West. There are those who resist change, those who grudgingly accept it, but accept it nonetheless. There are the new converts who appear when they see it as inevitable. And finally, there's those of us who have fought all of our entire lives for change to arrive. Each one of you will know which group you belong to. Surely there may be a bit of each within this auditorium, but you will all surely recognize that the times of change are knocking on our doors. Historic moments of change have a unique characteristic. The times when formulas that have been in place for decades become exhausted. The methods once considered the only way of doing things cease to make sense and what, to many, seemed unquestionable truths is finally called into question. These are times when the rules get rewritten, and therefore these are times that reward those who have the courage to take risks. But much of the free world still prefers the comfort of what is familiar, even though it may be the wrong path. And they will insist on applying the recipes of failure and the great burden that is the common denominator among the countries and institutions that are failing is the mental virus of woke ideology. This is the great epidemic of our time that must be cured. This is the cancer we need to get rid of. This ideology has colonized the world's most important institutions – from the political parties and governments of leading Western nations to global governance organizations, even NGOs, universities and media outlets. It has also set the tone of the global conversation over the past decades. Until we remove this abhorrent ideology from our culture, our institutions and our laws, Western civilization – and even the human species – will not be able to return to the path of progress demanded by our pioneering spirit. It is essential to break these ideological chains if we want to usher in a new golden age. That is why today I would like to take a few minutes to breaking those chains. But first, let's talk about what we are fighting for. The West represents the pinnacle of human achievement on the fertile ground of its Greco-Roman heritage and Judeo-Christian values. The seeds of something unprecedented in history were sown after definitively overcoming absolutism. Liberalism inaugurated a new era in human existence, and within the new moral and philosophical framework, which placed individual liberty above the whims of tyrants, the West was able to unleash man's creative capacity, initiating an unprecedented process of wealth generation. The data speaks for itself. Until the year 1800, the world's per capita GDP remained virtually constant. However, from the 19th century onwards, and thanks to the Industrial Revolution, per capita GDP multiplied by 20, lifting 90% of the global population out of poverty, even though the population itself increased eightfold. And this was only possible thanks to a convergence of fundamental values, respect for life, liberty and property, which enabled free trade, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the other pillars of Western civilization. In addition, our inventive Faustian exploratory, pioneering spirit, which is constantly testing the limits of what is possible, and that's a pioneering spirit that today is represented, among others, by my dear friend Elon Musk, who has been unjustly vilified by the wokism ideology in recent days for an innocent gesture that simply reflects his enthusiasm and gratitude towards people. In summary, we invented capitalism on the basis of saving, investment, labour and reinvestment, and hard work. We got every worker to multiply tenfold or 100-fold, or why not even a 1,000-fold? Their productivity thus overcoming the Malthusian trap. Yet at some point in the 20th century, we lost our way and the liberal principles that had made us free and prosperous were betrayed. A new political class, driven by collectivist ideologies and taking advantage of times of crisis, saw the perfect opportunity to accumulate power. All the wealth created by capitalism until then and into the future would be redistributed through some scheme of centralized planning, setting in motion a process whose disastrous consequences we are suffering today. By promoting a socialist agenda while insidiously operating within the liberal paradigm, this new political class distorted the values of liberalism, and so they replaced freedom with liberation, using the coercive power of the state to redistribute the wealth created by capitalism. Their justification was the sinister, unjust and abhorrent idea of social justice, complemented by theoretical Marxist frameworks aimed at liberating individuals from their needs. And at the core of this new value system lies the fundamental premise that equality before the law is not enough, as hidden systemic injustices exist which must be rectified, an idea that serves as a gold mine for bureaucrats who aspire to omnipotence. And this is fundamentally, fundamentally what wokeism is about, the result of the reversal of Western values. Each of our civilization's pillars has been replaced by a distorted version of itself through various mechanisms of cultural subversion. Negative rights to life, liberty and property were transformed into an artificially and artificial and endless list of positive rights. First it was education, then housing, and from then on, absurdities like access to the internet, televised football, theatre, cosmetic treatments and an endless number of other desires that were turned into fundamental human rights. Rights that, of course, someone has to pay for, and which can only be guaranteed through the infinite expansion of the abhorrent state. In other words, we moved from the concept of freedom as the fundamental protection of the individual against the intervention of the tyrant to the concept of liberation through state intervention. On this foundation, wokeism was built – an ideology of monolithic thinking upheld by various institutions whose purpose is to penalize dissent, feminism, diversity, inclusion, equity, immigration, abortion, environmentalism, gender ideology, among others. These are all various heads of the same beast aimed at justifying the state's expansion through the appropriation and distortion of noble causes. Let us look at some of these. Radical feminism is a distortion of the concept of equality, even in its most benevolent form, it is redundant – as equality before the law already exists in the West. Everything else is a quest for privileges, which is what radical feminism truly seeks, pitting half of the population against the other half, when they should both be on the same side. We have even got to the point of normalizing the fact that in many supposedly civilized countries, if you kill a woman, it is called femicide. And this carries more serious punishment than if you kill a man simply based on the sex of the victim – legally making a woman's life be worth more than that of a man. And that they carry the banner of the gender-based wage gap. But when you look at the data, it is clear that there is no inequality for the same work, but rather that most men tend to choose better paying professions than most women. However, they don't complain about the fact that most prison inmates are men, or that most plumbers are men, or that most victims of robbery or murder are men – let alone the majority of people who have died in wars. But if you raise these points in the media or even at this forum, you are considered a misogynist simply for defending an elementary principle of modern democracy and the rule of law, which is equality before the law. And of course, defending the data as well. Wokism also manifests in sinister radical environmentalism and the climate change agenda, preserving our planet for future generations is a matter of common sense. No-one wants to live in a landfill. But once again, wokeism has managed to pervert this fundamental idea. From preserving the environment for human enjoyment, we have shifted to a fanatical environmentalism, where we humans are seen as a cancer that must be eradicated and economic development is considered little more than a crime against nature. And yet, when we argue that the Earth has already gone through five abrupt temperature change cycles, and that during four of those men was not even around, we are called ‘Flat Earthers’ in order to discredit our ideas, even though science and the data are on our side. It is no coincidence that these same groups are the main promoters of the bloody, murderous abortion agenda, an agenda designed on the basis of the Malthusian premise that overpopulation will destroy the Earth, and that we must therefore implement some form of population control. In fact, this has been carried to such an extreme that today on Earth we start to see a population growth rate starting to look like a problem and talk about a job they've done by promoting abortion. And these forums promote the LGBT agenda, attempting to impose the idea that women are men and men are women simply based on self-perception. And they say nothing about when a man dresses as a woman and kills his opponent in a boxing ring, or when a male prison inmate claims to be a woman and ends up sexually assaulting women in prison. In fact, just a few weeks ago, there were headlines around the world regarding the case of two gay Americans who championed the banners of sexual diversity and were sentenced to 100 years in prison for abusing and filming their adopted children for more than two years. I want to be clear when I say abuse, this is no euphemism because in its most extreme forms, gender ideology is outright child abuse. They are paedophiles. So, I want to know who would support that kind of behaviour. Healthy children are being irreversibly harmed through hormone treatments and mutilation, as if a five-year-old child could possibly consent to such things, and should their family not agree to this, there will always be state agents ready to step in in favour of what they call the best interests of the child. And believe me, the scandalous experiments in the name of this criminal ideology will be condemned and likened to those committed in the darkest periods in our history. And covering this multitude of abhorrent practices is the eternal victimhood narrative, always ready to hurl accusations of homophobia, transphobia and other fabricated terms, whose sole purpose is to silence those of us who dare to expose the scandal – one of which both national and international authorities are complicit. Meanwhile, in our businesses, public institutions and educational establishments, merit has been cast aside in favour of the doctrine of diversity, which represents a regression to the aristocratic systems of the past. Quotas are invented for every minority politicians can come up with, which ends up undermining the excellence of institutions. Wokeism has also distorted the issue of immigration, the free movement of goods and people is a fundamental pillar of liberalism. We know this well. Argentina, the United States and many other countries became great thanks to immigrants who left their homelands in search of new opportunities. However, we have shifted from attracting foreign talent to foster development to now embracing mass immigration, driven not by national interests but by guilt. Since the West is supposedly the root cause of all of the world's evils in history, it must redeem itself by opening its borders to everyone, which leads to a form of reverse colonization that resembles collective suicide. So, this is how we now see images of hordes of immigrants who abuse, assault, or even kill European citizens, whose only sin was not adhering to a particular religion. But when someone questions these situations, they are immediately labelled racists, xenophobic or even Nazis. Wokeism has penetrated our societies so deeply, promoted by institutions like this one, that it has even led to questioning the very concept of biological sex through the disastrous influence of gender ideology, which has resulted in even greater state intervention through absurd legislation – such as the state having to fund expensive hormone treatments and surgeries to fulfil the self-perception of certain individuals. Only now are we beginning to see the effects of an entire generation that has mutilated their bodies, encouraged by a culture of sexual relativism, and these people will have to spend their entire lives in psychiatric treatment to cope with what they have done to themselves. Yet no one dares to speak about these issues. Not only that, but the vast majority have also been subjected to the misguided self-perceptions of a tiny minority. And wokeism also seeks to hijack our future because by dominating the faculties of the world's most prestigious universities, it is shaping the elites of our countries to reject and deny the culture, ideas and values that made us great, further damaging our social fabric. What future do we have if we are teaching our young people to feel ashamed of our past? All of this was incubated and increasingly developed over the past decades, after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Curious enough, free nations began to self-destruct when they no longer had adversaries to defeat. Peace made us weak. We were defeated by our own complacency. All these and other aberrations which we can't enumerate due to time constraints, are the threats that today endanger the West. And unfortunately, these are the beliefs that institutions like this one have been promoting for 40 years, and no one here can feign innocence. For decades, there has been a worship of a sinister and murderous ideology, as if it were a golden calf, moving heaven and Earth to impose it on humanity. And this organization, along with the most influential supranational bodies, have been the ideologues of this barbarity. Multilateral lending organizations have been instruments of extortion, while many national governments, and especially the European Union, have acted as their armed wing. Is it not true that right now, as we speak, in the UK citizens are being imprisoned for exposing horrifying crimes committed by Muslim migrants, crimes that the government seeks to conceal? Or didn't the bureaucrats in Brussels suspend Romania's elections simply because they didn't like the party that had won? Faced with each of these discussions, wokeism’s first strategy is to discredit those of us who challenge these things first by labelling us and then by silencing us. If you're white, you must be racist. If you're a man, you must be a misogynist or part of the patriarchy. If you're rich, you must be a cruel capitalist. If you're heterosexual, you must be heteronormative, homophobic or transphobic. For every challenge, they have a label, and then they try to suppress you by force, or through legal means. Because beneath the rhetoric of diversity, democracy and tolerance that they so often preach, what truly lies is their blatant desire to eliminate dissent, criticism and ultimately freedom, so they can continue to uphold a model in which they are the main beneficiaries. Haven't we heard only recently how certain European leading authorities and quite reddish, I should say, actually have made open appeals to censorship. Actually, there is no censorship, but rather this idea that you need to silence those who don't partake in the woke ideology. And what kind of society can wokeism create? A society that replaced the free exchange of goods and services with the arbitrary distribution of wealth at gunpoint. One that replaced free communities with forced collectivization. One that replaced the creative chaos of the market with the sterile and sclerotic order of socialism. A society filled with resentment where there are only two types of people – those who are net taxpayers, on the one hand, and those who are beneficiaries of the state on the other. And by this, I don't refer to those who receive social assistance because they don't have enough to eat. I'm talking about the privileged corporations, the bankers who were bailed out during the sub-prime crisis, the majority of media outlets, the indoctrination centres disguised as universities, the state bureaucracy, the unions, social organizations and the crony businesses that thrive off the taxes paid by hard-working individuals and taxpayers. I'm talking about the world described by Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged, which unfortunately has become a reality. It is a system where the big winner is the political class, which becomes both a referee and stakeholder in this redistribution game. I say it again, the political class is a referee and stakeholder, an interested party in this redistribution. Of course, the one who redistributes is the one who keeps the lion's share. And despite the cosmetic differences between various political parties, they share interests, partners, deals and an unshakable commitment to maintaining the status quo. That is why I call them all the party of the state, a system that hides behind well-meaning rhetoric claiming that the market fails and that they are the ones responsible for correcting the failures through regulations, force and bureaucracy. But there is no such thing as market failures. Market failures, I say this again, do not exist. Since the market is a mechanism of social cooperation where property rights are voluntarily exchanged, the very concept of market failures is a contradiction in terms. The only thing such intervention achieves is the creation of new distortions within the price system, which in turn hinders economic calculation, savings and investment – ultimately leading to even more poverty in its wake or a mesh of abhorrent regulations, such as is the case in Europe, which kills economic growth. As I often say in my speeches, if you believe there is a market failure, go and check to see if the state is not involved. And if you find that it isn't, check again because you got it wrong. For this same reason, since wokism is nothing more than a systematic plan by the party of the state to justify state intervention and increase public spending, this means that our first and foremost mission – if we truly want to reclaim the West's progress and build a new golden era – has to be the drastic reduction in the size of the state. Not only in each of our countries, but also the drastic reduction of all supranational organizations, as this is the only way to root out this perverse system, draining its resources in order to give back to taxpayers what belongs to them, and to put an end to the sale of favours. There is no better method to end state bureaucracy than to have no opportunity for such favours to be sold in the first place. The functions of the state must once again be limited to defending the right to life, liberty and property. Any other function the state assumes will come at the expense of its fundamental role and will inevitably lead to the ‘omnipresent Leviathan’ that we all suffer under today. Today we are witnessing the global exhaustion of this system that has dominated us for the past few decades. Just as has happened in Argentina, the rest of the world is seeing the deepening of the only truly relevant conflict of this century, and of all previous ones – the conflict between free citizens and the political caste that clings to the established order, doubling down on its efforts aimed at censorship, persecution and destruction. Fortunately, throughout the free world, a silent majority is organizing. And in every corner of our hemisphere, the echo of this freedom cry resonates. We are facing a change of era, a Copernican shift, the destruction of a paradigm and the construction of another. And if globally influential institutions like this one wish to turn over a new leaf and participate in good faith in this new paradigm, it will have to take responsibility for the role played over the past decades, acknowledging to society the Mia culpa that is being demanded of them. To conclude, I wish to speak directly to the world's leaders, to all those who lead both national states, and also to major economic groups and influential international organizations, whether present here today or listening from their homes. The political formulas of the past decades, which I have referred to in this speech, have failed and are now collapsing under their own weight. This means that thinking like everyone else does, reading what everyone else reads, and saying what everyone else says, can only lead to error. Even though many still insist on marching towards the precipice. The script of the last 40 years has run out, and when a system runs out, history opens up. That is why, to all global leaders, I say it is time to break free from that script. It is time to be bold. It is time to dare to think and to dare to write our own verses. Because when the ideas and narratives of the present all say the same thing – and they say the wrong things – being brave means standing outside of time. It means looking backwards, not being dazzled by the transient, losing sight of the universal. It means reclaiming truths that were obvious to our ancestors and that are at the core of Western civilization success, but which the regime of monolithic thinking of recent decades has persecuted as if they were heresies. As Churchill once said, the farther back you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see. In other words, we must reconnect with the forgotten truths of our past, to untangle the knots of the present and take the next step forward as a civilization towards the future. And what do I see when I look back? That we must once again embrace the last proven thesis of economic and social success. This is the model of freedom, once again embracing the ideas of freedom. Going back to libertarianism. That's what we're doing in Argentina. That is what I trust President Trump will do in the new America. And this is what we invite all the great nations of the free world to do if they wish to halt in time what is clearly a path leading to catastrophe. So ultimately, what I'm proposing is that we make the West great again today. Today, just as 215 years ago, Argentina has broken its chains and invites us – as our national anthem declares – invites us, all mortals of the world to hear the sacred cry: ‘Freedom, freedom, freedom! May the forces of heaven be with us.’ Thank you all very much and long live freedom, damn it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12ycTq3AwOrFJ	2025-01-24T17:49:43-08:00	
Arakan Army’s Growing Influence In Myanmar: Implications For The ...	By Sreeparna Banerjee In a significant turn of events, after days of relentless battles, the Arakan Army (AA) seized control of the Maungdaw and Taungup townships, securing a 270-kilometre (km) stretch along Myanmar's border with Bangladesh last month. This victory cements the dominance of the AA and its political wing, the United League of Arakan (ULA), in Rakhine State, and shifts the region’s dynamics, putting the junta on the back foot. The capture of hundreds of soldiers, weapons, and the infamous Brigadier General Thurein Tun marks a significant blow to the junta. The subsequent fall of Ann, the Western Military Command headquarters, was yet again a historic setback. It marks the second military command being taken over by resistance forces, after the capture of the Northeastern Command in August last year. With AA gaining control of 14 of Rakhine’s 17 townships, and the junta scrambling to retain its grip, the resistance forces now control a total of over 93 towns and cities, six critical border trading posts, two key airports, Thandwe in Rakhine and Lashio, and several key connectivity projects with neighbouring nations. The fighting to capture the remaining territories is still ongoing. As the AA solidifies its hold over Rakhine, its relationship with the Rohingya community remains fraught. The junta's practice of forcibly conscripting Rohingyas into its fight against the AA has worsened tensions. Many Rohingya conscripts have been captured or killed, further entangling the displaced people in a conflict that they did not initiate. For the stateless and marginalised Rohingya, the AA's rise presents new uncertainties—whether it will lead to coexistence or deepen divisions is an open question in Rakhine’s turbulent future. Rise of the AA Rakhine State, a region marked by economic underdevelopment and ethnic diversity, has long been a focal point of Myanmar's complex political and social landscape. Among the various forces shaping its future, the AA has emerged as a key player, commanding significant territorial control and public confidence. Formed in 2009, the AA has grown into one of Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed groups, with an estimated 30,000 soldiers. There are three reasons for this growth. First is the group’s dynamic leadership, with figures like Major General Twan, Mrat Naing, and Brigadier General Nyo Twan Awng, who have built a cohesive team, incorporating leaders from earlier revolutionary movements, thus making the AA more unified than its predecessors. Secondly, its 'Arakan Dream 2020' and the 'Way of Rakhita' vision for self-governance have rallied public support, positioning the AA as a symbol of hope for Rakhine nationalism. Frustration with political suppression, such as the marginalisation of Rakhine aspirations by the National League for Democracy Party (NLD), and incidents like the 2018 Mrauk U protests have further fuelled AA’s rise as an alternative to traditional political avenues. Thirdly, the AA has also gained strength through alliances. Early Kachin Independence Army (KIA) support provided training and combat experience to the paramilitary group. At the same time, ties with the Northern Alliance and backing from the United Wa State Army (UWSA) have bolstered its resources and operations. Stance towards Rohingyas The AA has a complicated stance towards the Rohingya. While it doesn’t openly target or blame the Rohingya in most of its statements, it has historically expressed strong resentment towards them, reflecting broader tensions in Rakhine State. Initially, the AA referred to Rohingya militants as 'terrorists' and criticised them after attacks in 2016, vowing to protect Rakhine State. However, over time, the AA shifted its tone to avoid being seen as anti-Rohingya or promoting religious or ethnic hatred. For example, in 2020, the AA stated that it represents all people in Rakhine, regardless of religion or ethnicity, and emphasised its respect for human rights and religious freedom. At the same time, the AA denies accusations from the Myanmar military that it collaborates with the Rohingya armed group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). The AA instead focuses on its fight against the military forces and has always blamed the central government for creating divisions between Rakhine communities and the Rohingya. Overall, the AA has avoided overt hostility toward the Rohingya and it maintains a cautious attitude. Its actions and rhetoric are shaped by both local tensions and the need to maintain an international reputation, as any violence against the Rohingya could harm its standing globally. Following the coup and Operation 1027, the ULA has demonstrated goodwill, and its decision to lift travel restrictions for the Rohingya in central Rakhine State and Paletwa has earned support from some quarters. Concerns, however, about the well-being of the Muslim community have intensified, particularly amidst ongoing violence in Rakhine. Reports indicate counter-attacks on Rohingya households by the AA, allegedly instigated by the military junta, which has reportedly used the Rohingyas to target the AA. The heightened hostility of the ethnic armed organisation (EAO) toward the Rohingya can be partly attributed to a shifting military dynamic. Specifically, three prominent Rohingya armed groups—ARSA, the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO) and the Arakan Rohingya Army (ARA)—are reportedly aiding the junta in its conflict with the AA, and are accused of forcibly recruiting youth from Myanmar and even Bangladesh refugee camps, worsening the already fragile situation and amplifying humanitarian concerns in the region. Adding to the complexity, the AA’s recent use of the derogatory term 'Bengali Muslim' to describe the Rohingya in its August 2024 statement denying allegations of harming the Rohingya with arson attacks echoes rhetoric historically used to delegitimise the Rohingya, by framing them as foreign immigrants. This narrative has been instrumental in denying them citizenship and perpetuating their marginalisation, deepening mistrust and complicating efforts for peace in Rakhine. Situation in Bangladesh Bangladesh has been hosting the Rohingya population since 1978. It has always maintained a strict policy of repatriation to Myanmar through negotiation with the Myanmar regime in power, despite its shortsightedness in looking into the welfare of the displaced people. However, the current political changes within Bangladesh and the civil war situation at Rakhine, with no progress on fundamental issues of citizenship, safety, and the repatriation of a million displaced people sheltered in Bangladesh (who the Bangladesh government refers to as Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals), there seems no viable resolution in sight. Amid declining donor funding, conditions in Rohingya camps have worsened, with only 53 percent of the US$852.4 million required for 2024 raised by September. Reduced food rations, deplorable living conditions with landslides, fires, and limited opportunities have pushed many into illegal activities, whether knowingly or unknowingly, raising security concerns. Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, is reevaluating its Rohingya policy after seven years of failed repatriation attempts. Faced with the arrival of 60,000 additional displaced people and shifting dynamics in Myanmar and Rakhine, the interim government has indicated an interest in semi-formal engagements with non-state actors like the AA while maintaining diplomatic ties with Myanmar’s regime and seeking regional cooperation from India, China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Khalilur Rahman, the High Representative for the Rohingya crisis and Priority Issues, plans a UN-backed conference later this year to mobilise funds, refocus global attention, and explore a UN-guaranteed safe zone in Rakhine for repatriation. This dual approach reflects the complexity of balancing humanitarian needs with geopolitical realities. Road ahead For the Rohingya, caught between a repressive military regime and an ascendant AA, the future remains uncertain. The AA's rise may offer a glimmer of hope for better governance in Rakhine, but the group’s relationship with the Rohingya has been marked by mistrust and sporadic violence. Whether this new power dynamic will lead to coexistence or further conflict depends on whether the AA can embrace inclusivity and recognise the rights and aspirations of the Rohingya community in a post-junta Rakhine. For now, the region’s destiny hangs in a delicate balance, with the Rohingya still searching for a place to call their own in a land long shadowed by strife.

Jammu And Kashmir Elections Reveal Enduring Political Fault Lines...	By Arun Swamy Both regional and national elections were held in India’s troubled Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region in 2024 for the first time since its autonomy was drastically downgraded in 2019. But despite successful elections in the region plagued by complex territorial disputes and enduring insurgencies, early signs suggest that decades-old patterns of political allegiance remain largely unchanged. J&K, formerly a princely state with a Hindu ruler with a majority-Muslim population and three distinct cultural regions — Jammu, the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh — has been claimed by both India and Pakistan since 1947 when a brief war left each controlling a portion of it. It has been the focus of both China–India and Pakistan–India wars, as well as the subject of UN resolutions calling for a territorial plebiscite. An insurgency began in Kashmir in 1989 with covert support from Pakistan and has continued with varying degrees of intensity to the present day. In 2019, the newly re-elected government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi repealed Article 370 of the Indian constitution which had given J&K special status and allowed the state its own constitution. This had long been promised by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but the government went further by dividing the state into two regions and downgrading both to union territories. An appeal to the Supreme Court failed in December 2023. For the next five years, both union territories — J&K and Ladakh — were administered by the central government as it sought to stamp out the insurgency and improve its own standing in the region. Incidents of stone-throwing in 2019 declined steadily to zero by 2023 and other types of protests and violence declined sharply. This paved the way for the first national and regional elections in 2024. Elections to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the national parliament, were held in April and May 2024. The newly truncated J&K has five seats in the Lok Sabha — two in Jammu and three in Kashmir. The BJP, contesting only in Jammu, won both seats there and beat the Indian National Congress (INC) by wide margins. But despite the BJP’s efforts to rally support for third parties in Kashmir, the INC-aligned Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) won two of three seats. The Lok Sabha results influenced the INC to ally only with the JKNC for elections to the J&K Legislative Assembly in September 2024. The alliance won despite some controversial measures that had improved the BJP’s chances, including redrawn constituency boundaries, which the JKNC criticised as equalising Jammu and Kashmir’s representation despite Kashmir’s larger population. The central government’s representative, the lieutenant governor, was also allowed to appoint five members to represent various marginalised constituencies, which was viewed by many as a ploy to give the BJP a majority if the election was close. The marginalised communities in this case were migrants or refugees from Pakistani-occupied sections of Kashmir and Kashmiri Pandits — ethnic Kashmiri high-caste Hindus. Since the onset of the current insurgency in 1989, over 100,000 Kashmiri Pandits — the overwhelming majority — left the Kashmir Valley in the 1990s. For the BJP, returning the Hindu Pandits to the Valley has become a rallying cry. In the 2024 election, the government announced efforts to expand the ability of Kashmiri Panditsresiding outside the Valley and Hindu refugees from Pakistani-held portions of Kashmir to vote in Kashmir. These efforts, along with legal changes following the abrogation of Article 370 that allowed outsiders to buy land in J&K, have led some to believe that the BJP was attempting to change the composition of the electorate population. Despite the controversies, the assembly elections were a relative success. Turnout was quite high at 64 per cent overall and over 56 per cent in Kashmir. The JKNC–INC alliance won a clear majorityof seats, rendering concerns about appointed legislators holding the balance moot. But the BJP won a large majority of seats in Jammu. Exit polls indicated that voters’ principal concerns were the economy and restoration of statehood, with a sizable portion of the electorate favouring a restoration of Article 370. While restoring statehood is supported in principle by all parties, the JKNC-led government’s call to also restore Article 370 has caused the BJP to walk out over the issue. It is unclear if the events of the last five years have significantly changed the political situation in J&K. The Modi government can take credit for increased electoral participation and declining violence. Yet traditional Kashmiri parties, especially the JKNC, remain the principal political forces in the region. The majority do not seem reconciled to the loss of Article 370 so much as united in their desire to see it restored. The real test will come when New Delhi decides to restore J&K statehood without the special provisions of Article 370. If the demand for restoration fades, the policy can be deemed a success. If not, it will be back to square one. About the author: Arun Swamy is Professor of Political Science at the University of Guam.

Amnesty International Warns About Imminent Execution Of Six Polit...	Six Iranian men are at imminent risk of execution after being sentenced to death in October 2024 by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran after a grossly unfair trial, Amnesty International has warned. Amnesty International has called on authorities to immediately halt these executions, citing the arbitrary nature of the detentions and serious due process violations. The men — Abolhassan Montazer (65), Akbar Daneshvarkar (58), Babak Alipour (33), Mohammad Taghavi Sangdehi (58), Pouya Ghobadi (31), and Vahid Bani Amerian (32) — were convicted of 'armed rebellion against the state' (baghi) amid allegations of torture and forced confessions. The convictions stem from accusations of affiliation with the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), the main opposition group to the Iranian regime. Amnesty International reports that their trial, which lasted just two hours, was marred by serious violations of fair trial standards, including limited access to legal counsel and reliance on confessions extracted under duress. The six men were arrested between December 2023 and February 2024 and detained in Tehran’s Evin Prison under the control of the Ministry of Intelligence. Amnesty International cites numerous accounts of torture and ill-treatment, including beatings, floggings, prolonged solitary confinement, and death threats at gunpoint, to coerce confessions. Specific instances of abuse include eye injuries and severe physical pain suffered by Vahid Bani Amerian during his arrest, as well as restricted access to medical care for several detainees, including Mohammad Taghavi Sangdehi, who was denied necessary medication for gout. Despite these allegations, the Revolutionary Court failed to investigate claims of torture or the credibility of the so-called confessions. The six men’s case is part of a larger wave of repression in Iran following the nationwide uprising in 2022. Amnesty International reports a sharp rise in executions, with at least 853 carried out in 2023 alone, a 48% increase from the previous year. In 2024, the regime topped it with more than 1,000 executions. Activists and dissidents, particularly those affiliated with ethnic minorities or opposition groups like the PMOI, have faced harsh penalties, including death sentences issued after secretive, summary trials. Among those at imminent risk of execution are Behrouz Ehsani and Mehdi Hassani, who were sentenced to death in early January 2025 after the Supreme Court upheld their convictions related to alleged support for the PMOI. Their cases, like many others, have been criticized for reliance on coerced confessions and grossly unfair trials. Revolutionary Courts, criticized for their lack of independence and susceptibility to their ties to intelligence institutions, have played a key role in the crackdown. Amnesty International notes that such courts routinely flout international standards of justice, making fair trial violations a systemic issue in Iran’s judiciary.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC127x2UGGU3cuU	2025-01-24T16:58:53-08:00	
The Warped Ethics And Tainted Politics Of Presidential Pardons – ...	By Graham J Noble There have been times when certain presidential pardons have raised an eyebrow or two, but few considered them a big deal – save the pardon of Richard Nixon by President Gerald Ford. But then, Joe Biden, on his way out the door of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., started handing them out like Reese’s Pieces on Halloween. Pre-emptively pardoning several members of his own family was bad enough – many would argue this amounted to an unintentional admission that some of the Bidens had indeed been engaged in corruption, influence-peddling, and money laundering, which some people had suspected. Extending this executive absolution to Democrats (and two Republicans) who investigated the events of Jan. 6, 2021, was beyond the pale. Of course, those are not the pardons that upset Democrats and their stenographers in the media. When President Donald Trump followed through on his promise to pardon the Jan. 6 protesters, one would have thought from the uproar that he had just announced he was replacing JD Vance with Vladimir Putin as his vice president. When the president held his first press conference on Jan. 21, announcing the roll-out of a massive AI infrastructure project, the only thing reporters seemed interested in asking him about was the pardons he issued to those imprisoned for taking part in the Jan. 6 demonstration. Police as Political Pawns The most extreme of those on the left would probably have preferred to see every single one of those demonstrators, around 1,500, rotting in prison for another 15 or 20 years at least. But they can’t admit that, so they pretend to be troubled that among the recipients of pardons were people who had attacked police officers. The lack of self-awareness is certainly jaw-dropping. It’s as if the Black Lives Matter (BLM) riots of 2020 never happened. After BLM and various other extreme left-wing groups decided to use George Floyd’s death as an excuse to go on a rampage, violent mobs blazed – quite literally – a trail of destruction and chaos across several American cities. Businesses were looted and burned, cars were destroyed, at least one police precinct was set on fire, and a number of police officers suffered serious injuries. An officer in Ferguson, MO, suffered brain damage after being attacked by BLM rioters. These same activists marched in the streets, openly calling for the murder of law enforcement. Of those arrested during the 2020 riots, many had their charges dropped, and the same people who now claim to be outraged by President Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons were practically cheering the rioters on. Funds were set up to bail them out – promoted by elected Democrats, including Kamala Harris. The sympathizers even objected to the use of the words 'looters' and 'rioters' to describe these criminals. Certainly, not a single prominent voice on the left was raised in anguish over police officers being attacked. And none of them have expressed more than a token word or two of sympathy over the injuring or killing of any police officer in the United States either before or since the 2021 Jan. 6 protest. Jan. 6 Pardons Right a Terrible Wrong On that day in the nation’s capital, no police officers were killed – despite false media reports. None sustained life-threatening or life-changing injuries (because the establishment media would have paraded like circus elephants any who did). No businesses were destroyed, no cars were set on fire, and no stores were looted. The Jan. 6 protesters, if one wishes to call them rioters, might’ve been the most well-behaved and disciplined rioters in history – except for perhaps 20 or 30 individuals, who may or may not have even been Trump supporters. The extent of the damage? A few windows in the Capitol building were broken, and a few items were pilfered – items paid for with American tax dollars. The worst thing that happened that day was the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman by a Capitol Police officer – whom the Capitol Police and congressional Democrats then went to extraordinary lengths to protect. Yet those 1,500 or so people who turned out because they genuinely believed Trump was robbed of victory in the 2020 election and have since been charged seem to have been railroaded out of sheer malice, spite, and hatred of Trump. President Trump – and many of his supporters, if not most – see this wave of pardons as righting a wrong that was both a symptom and a cause of the political divisiveness that has scarred the nation for too long. By contrast, Joe Biden handed his son an 11-year blanket of immunity. He spared brutal killers the death penalty, protected several other family members – even though they have supposedly done nothing wrong – and immunized congressional investigators who, if Trump is to be believed, destroyed evidence in order to present a one-sided show at trial. The ethical contrast between the current president and his predecessor could not be more obvious. And if the pardoning power of the president has been tainted at all, there can surely be little debate about which of them is responsible.

Ralph Nader: To Thwart Trump’s Tyranny, The Media Must Cover Resi...	A lawless madman, with cunning political skills, is at large in our White House. After less than five days in office, he has set a record for flamboyantly issued executive orders, many violative of federal statutes and the Constitution. A partial list: he has withdrawn the U.S. from the World Health Organization (e.g., damaging international coordination regarding pandemics), quit the Paris Climate Accords (e.g., nations working together against climate violence), selected corporate ideologues to run regulatory agencies (the purpose of which is to save lives, prevent injuries and stop consumer rip-offs), unleashed ICE to crash schools looking for undocumented kids to take away, threatened the media, readied more tax cuts for the super-rich and big companies, and halted the hiring of I.R.S. staff needed to stop massive tax evasions by the plutocracy. He has moved to make massive cuts in spending for programs protecting children and the sick (e.g., slashing Medicaid), lifting controls over oil & gas drilling, reducing support for solar and wind energy, and gutting the civil service. Meanwhile he, a convicted felon, is pardoning hundreds of convicted jailed felons who assaulted Capitol Hill police on Jan. 6, 2021, who will now be vengefully on the streets. The terrifying list goes on. (See the Brookings Institution tracking of regulatory changes in the second Trump administration: These actions harm all Americans – that is, they produce indiscriminate injustice against both liberal and conservative low-wage workers, consumers, parents, and children. This strengthens the resistance from the people with a more unified opportunity to stop Trump. Already the first torrent of federal and state lawsuits are being filed to block Trump’s power grab. Certainly, many state attorneys general are readying lawsuits. However, comfortable with his dominance over Congress and the Supreme Court, Trump’s response is one he has previously used – figuratively mocking so sue me, ha, ha, ha. In anticipation of the Trump rampage, the New York Timespublished a lead editorial on January 18, 2025, titled: 'Are We Sleepwalking Into Autocracy?' The newspaper’s answer is 'Yes,' unless: 'Defenders of democracy have to stay united, focusing on ensuring that checks and balances remain intact and that crucial democratic watchdog institutions (my emphasis) elude capture.' Nice words. But the Times and other large newspapers and magazines have largely avoided a critical responsibility since the 60s and 70s. That is, without their covering the actions, litigation, initiatives, and reports of civic institutions and labor unions, little or nothing will flow from their efforts. The Times editors know full well that without reaching millions of people, influential groups and lawmakers, the power of civic/labor community is very significantly reduced. This lack of media coverage has been happening for the past forty years. Mass media coverage based on newsworthiness and editorializing empower these groups, gets the attention of more supporters and makes it more difficult for the forces of often secret autocratic government to roll over the citizenry. The regular reporting about what activists were doing in the 1960s and 1970s made possible the consumer, environmental, labor, and freedom of information laws. Similar efforts now cannot gather momentum with media visibility. Legislative hearings, prosecutions, and regulatory actions cannot get jumpstarted just by the people insistent on a just and democratic society. Over the years I’ve highlighted this exclusion coupled with suggesting newsworthy stories to hundreds of reporters, editors, and a few publishers. To little avail. Look at the scene at the Times and the Washington Post. How often do you see op-eds from civic/labor advocates? How often do you read reviews of their books? How often have the groundbreaking studies by Public Citizen, Common Cause, Center for Science in the Public Interest, Veterans for Peace, Union of Concerned Scientists Et. al received coverage? Look at the profitable Washington Post Live podcasts and see how civic and union leaders have been back-handed. How often do the celebrated Times and Post podcasts interview them? The exclusions are overwhelming, even when compared with the access extreme right-wingers receive, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Grover Norquist. Some may say, well, they can always use social media. It is too cluttered, too fractured, and too impulsive. Whether we like it or not, the major newspapers’ original content feeds the radio and television stations and still has an unchallenged impact on getting attention for agendas underway that may have been floating around on the Internet for years and going nowhere. The same situation exists for local journalism which could feed local TV and radio were it to stop ignoring incipient efforts from community activism, whistleblowers, or simply good stories called into them by alert citizens. Official source journalism presently reigns. Our democracy can’t afford redundant and tepid reporting in the coming days. For example, there are about 500 full-time reporters covering Congress. The mostly ditto-head reporting misses all kinds of stories. We started the quarterly forty-page newspaper, Capitol Hill Citizen (capitolhillcitizen.com) to expose some of the goings on in Congress that fall under the rubric of ignored unofficial journalismto illustrate this point. In an era of closing weekly and daily newspapers, one might expect some coverage of this unique effort reporting on Congress, the most important and potentially most powerful institution that can turn around our deteriorating democracy. For nearly three years, none of the major newspapers and news magazines have told their readers about this rising journalistic beacon. To sum up: the reporters and editors at the Times, Post and the rest of the national, local newspaper, radio, and TV media must rise to higher levels of their own significance and give voice to the aroused resistance against the onrushing Trumpian dictatorial regime imposing fascistic government and more concentrated corporate power. If they cave, if they cower, as Thomas Jefferson warned, the main bulwark for our Republic crumbles. More citizens then withdraw and give up. That calamity would freeze Congress and the people who are the last ultimate rescuers of our besieged constitutional Republic.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12wxo4PYwiEd6	2025-01-24T16:50:13-08:00	
As One Cycle Ends, Another Begins Amid Growing Divergence – Analy...	We project global growth will remain steady at 3.3 percent this year and next, broadly aligned with potential growth that has substantially weakened since before the pandemic. Inflation is declining, to 4.2 percent this year and 3.5 percent next year, in a return to central bank targets that will allow further normalization of monetary policy. This will help draw to a close the global disruptions of recent years, including the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which precipitated the largest inflation surge in four decades. Though the global growth outlook is broadly unchanged from October, divergences across countries are widening. Among advanced economies, the United States is stronger than previously projected on continued strength in domestic demand. We have raised our growth projection for the US this year by 0.5 percentage point, to 2.7 percent. Growth in the euro area, by contrast, is likely to increase only modestly, to 1 percent from 0.8 percent in 2024. Headwinds include weak momentum, especially in manufacturing, low consumer confidence, and the persistence of a negative energy price shock. European gas prices remain about five times as high as in the United States, versus twice as high before the pandemic. In emerging market economies, growth projections are broadly unchanged, at 4.2 percent and 4.3 percent this year and next. Elevated trade and policy uncertainty is contributing to anemic demand in many countries, but economic activity is likely to pick up as this uncertainty recedes. This includes China, where we now project 4.5 percent growth next year, up 0.4 percentage point from our prior forecast. Some divergence between large economies has been cyclical, with the US economy operating above its potential while Europe and China are below. Under current policies, this cyclical divergence will dissipate. But the divergence between the US and Europe is more due to structural factors, and the disconnect will linger if these are left unaddressed. It reflects persistently stronger US productivity growth, particularly but not exclusively in the technology sector, linked to a more favorable business environment and deeper capital markets. Over time, this translates into higher returns on US investment, increased inbound capital flows, a stronger dollar and US living standards pulling away from those of other advanced economies. For China, it is notable that potential growth is now more like that of other emerging market economies. Economic policy uncertainty is elevated, with many governments newly elected in 2024. Our projections incorporate recent market developments and the impact of heightened trade policy uncertainty, assumed to be temporary, but refrain from making assumptions about potential policy changes that are currently under public debate. In the near term, a constellation of risks could further exacerbate these divergences. European economies could slow more than anticipated, especially if investors grow more concerned about public debt sustainability in more vulnerable countries. The main risk is that euro area monetary and fiscal policy could simultaneously run out of room if weaker economic activity pushes interest rates back toward the effective lower bound just as insufficient fiscal consolidation raises risk premia, in turn further constraining fiscal policy. In China, should fiscal and monetary measures prove insufficient to address domestic weakness, the economy is at risk of a debt-deflation stagnation trap, where falling prices raise the real value of debt, undermining activity further. The sharp decline in Chinese government bond yields, seen as haven for local investors, shows rising investor concern. Both in China and Europe, these factors could lower inflation and economic growth. By contrast, while many of the policy shifts under the incoming US administration are hard to quantify precisely, they are likely to push inflation higher in the near term relative to our baseline. Some indicated policies, such as looser fiscal policy or deregulation efforts, would stimulate aggregate demand and increase inflation in the near term, as spending and investment increase immediately. Other policies, such as higher tariffs or immigration curbs, will play out like negative supply shocks, reducing output and adding to price pressures. A combination of surging demand and shrinking supply would likely reignite US price pressures, though the effect on economic output in the near term would be ambiguous. Higher inflation would prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates and could even require rate hikes that would in turn strengthen the dollar and widen US external deficits. The combination of tighter US monetary policy and a stronger dollar would tighten financial conditions, especially for emerging markets and developing economies. Investors already anticipate such an outcome, with the US dollar gaining around 4 percent since the November election. Overall, these near-term risks could lead to further divergence across economies. In the medium term, about five years, the positive effects of the US fiscal shock may dissipate and could even reverse if fiscal vulnerabilities increase. Deregulation efforts can boost potential growth in the medium term if they remove red tape and stimulate innovation. However, there is a risk that excessive deregulation could also weaken financial safeguards and increase financial vulnerabilities, putting the US economy on a dangerous boom-bust path. Medium-term risks to economic output would be heightened by restrictive trade policies and stricter migration limits. Renewed inflation pressures, should they arise so soon after the recent surge, could well de-anchor inflation expectations this time around, as people and businesses are now much more vigilant about protecting their real income and profitability. Inflation expectations are further away from central bank targets than in 2017–21, which suggests increased risks of higher inflation. In this environment, monetary policy may need to be more agile and proactive to prevent expectations from de-anchoring, while macro-financial policies will need to remain vigilant to avoid a buildup of financial risks. The issue is likely to be exacerbated for emerging market economies, given the passthrough of dollar exchange rates to domestic prices and the effects of weaker domestic growth in China. In most cases, the appropriate policy response in emerging market economies will be to let currencies depreciate as needed while adjusting monetary policy to achieve price stability. However, in cases where inflation dynamics have become clearly unanchored or where there are financial stability risks, capital flow management and foreign exchange interventions could help, as long as these are not a substitute for necessary macroeconomic adjustments, in line with the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework. For several countries, fiscal policy efforts have been delayed or insufficient to stabilize debt dynamics. It is now urgent to restore fiscal sustainability before it is too late and to build sufficient buffers to address future shocks that could be sizable and recurrent. Additional delays could trigger a worrying spiral where borrowing costs keep rising as markets lose confidence, further increasing adjustment needs. Recent strains in Brazil’s financial markets, like the reaction to the UK’s September 2022 mini-budget, underscore how funding conditions can deteriorate suddenly. While any sizable fiscal consolidation is bound to weigh on economic activity, countries should take special care to preserve growth as much as possible along the consolidation path, for instance by focusing the adjustment on reducing untargeted transfers or subsidies rather than government investment spending. To achieve this—and help overcome persistent structural differences driving growth divergences—there should be renewed focus on ambitious structural reforms to directly boost growth. These include targeted reforms to better allocate resources, increase government revenues, attract more capital, and foster innovation and competition. Finally, additional efforts should be made to strengthen and improve our multilateral institutions to help unlock a richer, more resilient, and sustainable global economy. Unilateral policies that distort competition—such as tariffs, nontariff barriers, or subsidies—rarely improve domestic prospects durably. They are unlikely to ameliorate external imbalances and may instead hurt trading partners, spur retaliation, and leave every country worse off.

Global Energy Will Face Severe Overcapacity In 2025 – Analysis	By He Yan Given the increasing volatility in the global economy and the growing uncertainty in geopolitical dynamics, along with fluctuations in oil and gas supply and the continued growth of renewable energy generation, the current global energy system is significantly impacted. Looking back at 2024, China’s oil companies took over large oil fields in the Middle East from ExxonMobil. Meanwhile, oil giants Shell and Norway’s Equinor paved new paths by merging their oil and gas assets in the North Sea, creating the largest oil company in the region. These major events have greatly influenced the oil and gas industry. As the industry continues to adapt to the changing environment, a series of trends are emerging, including shifts in geopolitical balance, breakthroughs in low-carbon technologies, the growing influence of artificial intelligence (AI), and the ups and downs of hydrogen energy development. First, geopolitical tensions remain a major risk factor for energy security and emissions reduction efforts. The new U.S. administration and its evolving approach to U.S.-China relations will be a focal point of global attention. At the same time, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and the situation in Ukraine will continue to draw widespread international concern. Furthermore, the increasingly unstable state of the Global South, the continued fragmentation of international alliances, and the revolutionary impact of AI will collectively shape a new global order. In the economic realm, the imminent threat of a global trade war triggered by U.S. tariffs could hinder economic growth and fuel protectionist policies. In this process, American liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports may become an important bargaining chip in global trade negotiations. After the Trump administration took office, its push for energy dominance policies could accelerate LNG exports through regulatory relaxation, faster approval processes, and infrastructure development, thus boosting the growth of American oil and gas production and LNG exports. According to reports, during the Trump 1.0 period in 2019, the U.S. became a net energy exporter. By 2023, it became the world's largest LNG exporter. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, by 2028, North America's LNG export capacity is expected to more than double, where one-third of this growth will come from LNG projects in Canada and Mexico. This indicates that during Trump's second term, the U.S. will fully leverage LNG exports as a powerful tool in energy diplomacy. However, the acceleration of these projects could lead to a growing oversupply of LNG on the global market. This increased supply may undermine price stability, especially if trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalate once again. Such tensions would negatively impact U.S. producers and LNG developers, as American LNG projects rely heavily on steady demand from China. Additionally, Trump is attempting to strike a delicate balance between fostering the growth of American LNG exports to Europe and managing his stance on Russia. As Europe’s demand for LNG continues to rise, Trump views this as an opportunity to reduce Russia’s influence. However, as he has repeatedly pointed out, in order to bring an end to the war in Ukraine swiftly, it may be necessary to consider easing sanctions on Russia. Therefore, Trump’s role in shaping the U.S. and global energy markets through his 2025 energy agenda is especially significant. Secondly, supply chain challenges will continue to impact the global energy market. Over the past year, as global demand for energy has surged, not only in traditional oil and gas sectors but also in the low-carbon energy industry, energy supply chains have faced significant challenges. In the oil and gas industry, both buyers and suppliers have been struggling with high input costs. Although these costs have come down from historical highs, they are still expected to remain at elevated levels. Rystad Energy predicts that by 2025, high investment levels in both oil and gas and new energy sectors will exacerbate the already strained supply chains. In the offshore oil and gas industry, bottlenecks in floating production storage and offloading units (FPSOs), subsea equipment, drilling rigs, and other related vessels are expected to persist, continuing to delay the progress of capital projects. In North America, capital optimization and increased efficiency have further intensified overcapacity, putting pressure on the earnings of oilfield services companies. In the new energy sector, overcapacity in battery and solar photovoltaic manufacturing will continue to grow, fundamentally lowering prices. However, protectionism and tariffs will drive up costs for importers and force manufacturers to shift more of their operations to domestic outsourcing and overseas markets. Overall, as suppliers prepare for the new world order, divestments and mergers and acquisitions will become a key feature of the entire energy supply chain. Furthermore, driven by efforts to decarbonize industries, the rise of electric vehicles, and the rapid expansion of data centers, global electricity demand is entering a new phase of accelerated growth, which will continue to fuel the expansion of the low-carbon energy market. Goldman Sachs predicts that, globally, data centers currently consume an average of 1% to 2% of total global electricity, but driven by AI technologies, their energy consumption is steadily increasing. It is expected that by 2030, this share will rise to 3% to 4%. As a result, tech companies have become one of the key buyers in the power purchase agreement (PPA) market. Oil giants have already taken note of this market opportunity and begun entering the electricity market. In order to meet the 24-hour electricity demand, some tech companies are also turning to other base-load power sources, including signing power purchase agreements with traditional nuclear power plants. At the same time, these companies are showing strong interest in new small modular reactor (SMR) technologies. However, due to the still-high development costs of nuclear power and the need for further verification of technical feasibility, the primary focus remains on purchasing low-carbon energy for now. Therefore, in the short term, renewable energy will continue to be the priority for electricity investment. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has stated that by 2025, solar power is expected to meet more than half of the world's new electricity demand. In addition, the hydrogen energy sector may receive more policy support but will also face an increasing number of stalled projects. For instance, in the hydrogen subsidy final plan released by the Biden administration in January this year, the electricity consumption time standard for electrolyzers in hydrogen production was relaxed from 'hourly' to 'annual', and subsidies for hydrogen production from sources like nuclear power and biomass power generation were also introduced. This field has bipartisan consensus, hence one can expect to see strong continuity after the Trump administration takes office. Meanwhile, Germany, as one of the major markets for clean hydrogen, will make its political support and commitment to hydrogen energy even clearer after its elections. Both China and India will also continue to push forward agendas related to clean hydrogen and its derivatives. However, in mid-2024, many hydrogen projects faced suspension or cancellation. This includes Kansai Electric Power’s pull out from the Australian green hydrogen project, Shell’s suspension of the Norwegian blue hydrogen project, Repsol’s suspension of its Spanish green hydrogen development, and multiple large-scale hydrogen projects in Inner Mongolia, among others. On the whole, these projects face numerous challenges, including R&D costs, hydrogen source supply, technical standards, hydrogen storage and transportation, and talent shortages. By 2025, many large-scale hydrogen projects that were launched earlier will likely face similar difficulties and may start to fall by the wayside. Final analysis conclusion: As the energy industry continues to adapt to a changing environment, a series of trends are emerging. First, American LNG exports may become an important bargaining chip in global trade negotiations. At the same time, the risk of oversupply in the global market, influenced by this trend, could undermine price stability. Second, the global energy market will continue to face supply chain challenges. Furthermore, the accelerated growth of global electricity demand will continue to drive the development of the low-carbon energy market. Lastly, while the hydrogen energy sector will receive more policy support, it will also face an increasing number of stalled projects.

Will Trump Spark A Mineral ‘Gold Rush’ In Greenland? – Analysis	By Henry Ridgwell The mineral wealth on the Arctic island of Greenland is in the global spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants to take control of the territory from Denmark, prompting alarm from European allies. Trump's words were echoed in a January 12 interview on 'Fox News Sunday' by Vice President JD Vance, who said, 'There is a deal to be made in Greenland,' and that the island has 'a lot of great natural resources.' Until now, Greenland's mining industry has struggled to turn a profit, but could that be about to change? 'Full of minerals' Greenland currently has only one active commercial mine — White Mountain —located north of the capital, Nuuk, and gets its stark, monochrome color from anorthosite rock, which is rich in calcium deposits and other minerals. The mine's operator, Lumina Sustainable Materials, ships the rock from Greenland's western coastline to Asia, Europe and North America, where it is used to make a variety of products such as fiberglass, paint, fillers, cement and polymers. Efforts are under way to exploit aluminum deposits within the anorthosite. 'Greenland is a country full of minerals. We have, literally, minerals available all over the place,' Bent Olsvig Jensen, Lumina's managing director in Greenland, told VOA in an interview. Dozens of other mining companies from around the world are conducting exploration and feasibility studies across Greenland, although White Mountain remains the only commercial operation currently trading. China competition The minerals include plentiful rare earth elements such as lithium and scandium, which are critical for devices such as batteries. Global supply chains for those elements are currently dominated by China. Trump has repeatedly said that U.S. control of Greenland is necessary for 'international security.' His comments caused a political storm in Greenland and Denmark, but mining companies see an opportunity. 'His interest in Greenland can actually help the industry get access to further investment, which is needed for the industry to develop in Greenland,' Jensen said. 'So, yes, I definitely welcome it. And I think it's important that both from the industry side but also from the political side in Greenland that we position ourselves towards Trump and the U.S.' 'Not for sale' Greenland's government is largely autonomous, although Denmark is responsible for the island's security. Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for resources, emphasized the government's long-held response to Trump's interest: Open for business, but not for sale. 'We do want American investments. We do want collaboration with the U.S. State Department, and we've been trying to advocate for that for some time,' she told VOA. Greenland signed a deal with Trump during his first administration in 2019 to boost the mining industry. 'The U.S. funded our direct marketing towards investors all over the world, and this agreement has just come to its end. So we've been trying to … get engagement from the U.S. for some time now in order to renew this deal,' Nathanielsen said. Challenges Despite widespread recognition of Greenland's mineral wealth, attracting investment in mining has been a long-term problem. 'For many years now, we have seen that there has been some hesitance in the investor environment to engage in high-risk, long-term projects. We only have one American-owned license at the moment. In comparison, we have 23 from Canada, 23 from the U.K. and about 10 from Denmark. So, it's not an area where you see a lot of U.S. engagement as of now. Of course we welcome it, and there's plenty of opportunity,' Nathanielsen said. Greenland's government is pushing for full independence from Denmark. Supporters hope the island's mineral wealth could one day provide the economic foundation for full statehood. But there's a long way to go, said Ulrik Pram Gad, an analyst at the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen. 'If you want minerals out of the ground and financing Greenlandic self-sufficiency economically, then you will need to have the uptake in the international processing going,' Gad told VOA. 'And then, probably you'll have to think very closely about how to make sure that these mining projects benefit people who live close to them, rather than being a new version of imperialist extraction. Because then, the Greenlanders might not want it in the end,' he explained. The risk doesn't always end in reward. Rubies and pink sapphires were extracted at the Aappaluttoq mine until 2023, when its operator, Greenland Ruby, went bankrupt, $71 million in debt. The company is restructuring and seeking new investors, with a goal of restarting operations. Greenland's 2.1 million square kilometers of land is icebound for much of the year. 'Obviously, we are in the middle of the Arctic, so there are some logistical challenges,' Jensen of Lumina said. 'Not all of Greenland is open all year round. However, that is something that we can plan our way out of.' Jensen added that investors must have patience to make a profit. 'It takes time to develop a project from the early-stage exploration until you actually have a mine where you can extract and start selling. And as we all say in mining, 'Time is money.''	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12xf8vwH-iTCL	2025-01-24T16:34:09-08:00	
US-Saudi Ties Set For New Chapter In Trump’s Second Term – Analys...	By Hassan Al-Mustafa Following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election, Saudi Arabia moved swiftly to reinforce its diplomatic ties through multiple channels. King Salman’s congratulatory message highlighted 'the excellence of the historic close relations between the two friendly countries and peoples.' The Saudi monarch emphasized the shared commitment to 'strengthen and develop them in all fields.' The diplomatic outreach continued as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally called Trump to convey his congratulations. During the call, the crown prince emphasized 'Saudi Arabia’s aspiration to strengthen the historical and strategic relations between the two countries.' Responding to these warm sentiments, Trump expressed gratitude to the crown prince for his congratulations and acknowledged his goodwill toward the American people. Beyond traditional diplomatic exchanges, Saudi Arabia demonstrated its pragmatic approach through informal channels. On Nov. 17, social media buzzed with images and footage of Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, at UFC 309 in New York in the company of President-elect Trump and his newly appointed government efficiency czar Elon Musk. This high-profile gathering, which also included several other key figures, signaled Riyadh’s sophisticated approach to relationship building. By engaging with Trump’s inner circle in casual settings, Saudi Arabia demonstrated its commitment to establishing personal connections with influential members of the incoming administration. Saudi Arabia’s current proactive diplomatic approach builds upon decades of US-Saudi relations. The Kingdom pursues a strategy aimed at creating resilient ties that can withstand shifts between Democratic and Republican administrations. This approach operates on two tracks: first, by deepening institutional cooperation between the two governments and, second, by cultivating broad networks among American political, economic and intellectual leaders. Through transparent engagement and emphasis on shared interests, Saudi Arabia works to steadily strengthen these relationships, while developing mechanisms to address any points of disagreement between the nations. During Monday’s inauguration of President Trump, Princess Reema bint Bandar, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the US, highlighted the enduring bond between the two nations. She emphasized the deep historical ties spanning eight decades, noting how their strategic partnership has enhanced regional stability and security, while successfully navigating various political and economic challenges. The ambassador reaffirmed Saudi Arabia’s commitment to continued collaboration with the US, stressing their shared goal of advancing the well-being of both peoples, the region and the global community. In an interview with Al-Arabiya last October, then-presidential candidate Trump expressed his intention to collaborate with the crown prince on regional peace initiatives. Trump dubbed the Saudi leader a 'visionary.' He commended the crown prince’s achievements, saying that 'he has done things that nobody else would have even thought about.' He said he is a 'great guy' and lauded his approach to leadership. Trump’s laudatory remarks signal a clear diplomatic overture to Riyadh, indicating his readiness to cultivate stronger bilateral ties during his administration. By offering such explicit praise, he seeks to differentiate his approach from the more contentious stance adopted by Democrats, particularly contrasting with President Joe Biden’s initial critical rhetoric toward the Kingdom during his campaign and early tenure. Saudi Economy Minister Faisal Al-Ibrahim has emphasized the Kingdom’s willingness to maintain continuity in Saudi-US cooperation, while expressing readiness to address global economic challenges alongside Trump’s administration, especially the economic growth slowdown affecting the international community. This economic focus reflects Riyadh’s strategic assessment of Trump’s business-oriented approach and his priorities: tackling US inflation, boosting employment, enhancing income levels, managing Chinese trade competition and navigating EU economic relations. The Kingdom aims to leverage economic cooperation as a primary channel for engaging with the incoming administration, viewing it as a pathway to secure advanced technology transfers and attract the foreign investment crucial for achieving the objectives of Vision 2030. While economic engagement offers significant opportunities, it also presents potential areas of tension due to divergent priorities between Saudi Arabia and the US. Trump’s proposed policies — including new tariffs on Chinese exports, potential trade restrictions on EU and Canadian goods, expanded domestic oil exploration and economic pressure on China and Russia — may conflict with Saudi Arabia’s existing international partnerships. The Kingdom maintains substantial trade and energy relationships with China, India, Russia and the EU, with China serving as its primary oil customer. Additionally, Trump’s support for increased US oil production, aimed at lowering energy prices, could undermine Saudi Arabia’s fiscal objectives by pushing oil prices below the Kingdom’s budgetary targets. These details are extremely important and influential, not just in Saudi-US relations but also in the latter’s relations with the entire world. The Middle East peace process represents another domain where Saudi-US engagement may simultaneously foster collaboration and reveal policy differences. The Kingdom advocates for a comprehensive peace framework grounded in ending Israeli actions against Palestinians, upholding international legal standards and establishing Palestinian sovereignty. The crown prince has articulated this position unequivocally, declaring the Palestinian issue as Saudi Arabia’s primary regional concern. He has firmly stated that the Kingdom’s diplomatic recognition of Israel remains contingent upon the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Meanwhile, President Trump has his own vision, this week saying that 'I think Saudi Arabia will end up being in the Abraham accords.' Riyadh has established clear conditions for joining the Abraham Accords, centered on securing a verifiable pathway to peace that explicitly guarantees Palestinian statehood. This stance is interlinked with other Saudi priorities, including a US defense pact, civilian nuclear program development and additional bilateral agreements under discussion. The trajectory of Trump’s approach to the two-state solution remains uncertain, with his administration’s position on these fundamental issues likely to emerge in the early stages of his presidency. The scope of Middle East peace extends beyond the Palestinian issue, encompassing the complex Saudi-Iranian relationship, which saw notable improvement following the March 2023 Beijing Agreement. Through this diplomatic breakthrough, Riyadh aimed to establish a framework for managing bilateral tensions with Tehran, while seeking to curtail Iranian support for militant groups operating within Saudi territory and potential threats to the Kingdom’s critical infrastructure. The Saudi-Iranian diplomatic thaw, despite proceeding with measured caution, represents a strategic pillar of Saudi foreign policy aimed at preventing military escalation in the Gulf region. This position was articulated by Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan during the World Economic Forum annual summit in Davos, Switzerland, this week. He underscored Saudi Arabia’s commitment to regional conflict prevention, while calling for constructive Iranian engagement in the Gaza ceasefire process. He also expressed confidence that the incoming US administration would not heighten regional military tensions. Prince Faisal’s remarks reflect Saudi Arabia’s nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics between Washington and Tehran. His address acknowledged that progress in US-Iranian relations requires a pragmatic approach rooted in meaningful dialogue to address multiple interconnected challenges: Iran’s nuclear program, its ballistic missile development and broader regional security concerns affecting both the Arab Gulf states and the wider Middle East. The foreign minister’s message emphasizes Saudi Arabia’s conviction that diplomatic engagement, rather than military confrontation, remains the most viable path forward in resolving these critical issues. Despite Trump’s rhetoric about potential military action against Iran — a stance aligned with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s preferences — his administration is likely to prioritize economic leverage over military confrontation. This approach would revive the 'maximum pressure' strategy, using economic tools to extract concessions from Tehran. Such compromises, while politically costly for Iran, could prove essential in mitigating the regional instability stemming from the aftermath of the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. Saudi Arabia aims to cultivate constructive engagement with the Trump administration while maintaining its strategic autonomy. The Kingdom will pursue this collaboration without compromising its core economic and political interests, its relationships with major powers like China and Russia or its fundamental prerequisites for normalizing relations with Israel. Drawing on its diplomatic experience, Riyadh possesses the capability to navigate these complexities through pragmatic solutions, trust-building initiatives and win-win proposals that advance mutual interests without generating friction with the incoming White House administration. • Hassan Al-Mustafa is a Saudi writer and researcher interested in Islamic movements, the development of religious discourse and the relationship between the Gulf Cooperation Council states and Iran.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12714x1bwtfM-	2025-01-24T16:32:33-08:00	
The Venetian Republic Offers Powerful Lessons To An American One ...	The Venetian Republic's political system, emerging alongside those of other Italian city-states, was founded on collaboration and power distribution. Its rise and decline highlight the importance of adaptability in the face of shifting global political dynamics. Over more than a thousand years, Venice transformed from a modest refuge into a dominant Mediterranean power. Despite various crises and encircling empires, the Venetian Republic avoided foreign rule, revolution, and collapse. It developed an adaptable and efficient political system, building on its semi-independence from the 5th century until Napoleon's conquest in 1797. In an international system dominated by self-proclaimed democratic republics, the longevity and eventual downfall of Venice's oligarchic republican model provides insights for tailoring governance to contemporary challenges. Its unique political structure inspired founding fathers of the United States, like Alexander Hamilton and John Adams, who looked to Venice's early system when shaping the republic. By blending Roman legal principles, Byzantine refinements like the Justinian Code (a compilation of Roman laws shaped by Greek traditions that codified and systematized legal practices), and its original innovations, Venice became a symbol of stability, endurance, and independence. The Origins of Venice and Its Push for Independence Venetian society was deeply paternalistic, governed by a hereditary elite with limited public participation, and yet it contained many elements of distribution of powers and checks on authority that are ubiquitous today. Geopolitically savvy and culturally diverse, Venice was open to new and foreign influence while preserving its traditions. Venetian diplomat Gasparo Contarini's 16th-century account, shaped by his family's central role in Venetian politics, alongside other sources, highlights Venice's self-proclamation as the Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia—the Most Serene Republic of Venice. Venice's origins, according to tradition, trace back to 421 AD, when Roman refugees fleeing invasions in northern Italy established self-governed settlements in the Venetian Lagoon. The Rialto, which became synonymous with Venice, only emerged as the city's center 400 years later. The collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 left northern Italy contested, with instability driving more settlers to the lagoon. During the 5th and 6th centuries, trade networks and influential families began to shape the region. They reflected a mix of loyalties: pro-Byzantine landowners tied to the mainland coexisted with a rising merchant class seeking autonomy, along with the Frankish factions loyal to Rome. These groups dominated the informal councils, assemblies, and tribune leadership roles that governed early Venetian society. By the 7th century, Venetian settlers recognized Byzantine authority in exchange for protection and securing vital trade access. Historian John Julius Norwich emphasized the Byzantine's role in shaping Venice's identity, alongside its Roman heritage. In 697 AD, the lagoon's settlers elected their first doge (duke), marking the beginning of Venice's independence. Initially, the doge's authority required approval from Constantinople, but Byzantine authority in the region was never strong and gradually faded. Seeking stronger local governance to navigate the delicate political landscape, Venetians resisted certain Byzantine decrees and a revolt in 726 saw them elect their own doge without outside interference. In the early 9th century, Venice successfully secured greater autonomy from the Byzantine Empire while keeping the Frankish Empire at bay by playing a crucial role in mediating peace between them, a settlement later known as Pax Nicephori. Over the following centuries, Venetian autonomy increased as it forged ties with Rome to enhance its influence in Europe. Venice's role in the 1204 sack of Constantinople, led by Latin forces, solidified its independence as a sovereign republic, coinciding with the rise of powerful republican city-states across Italy. Its push for independence was vital in shaping a political system aligned with Venice's unique needs, values, and aspirations as a sovereign state. Constraining Doge Power and Creating a Republic Like the Roman Republic, Venice lacked a formal written constitution or judicially enforced laws. Instead, its political system relied on unwritten customs, allowing flexibility in responding to new challenges, and also demonstrating that the republican culture depends on habits of the heart and mind more than documents that record statements of principle. Though dominated by a hereditary elite, Venice's republican system prioritized power decentralization, an unusual approach at the time that encouraged a balance of authority and political stability. Early doges ruled autocratically for life, often attempting to establish dynasties, leading to rivalries, assassinations, and exiles. By 1032, Venetian patricians chose to abolish de facto hereditary dogeship, and though the doge retained a lifetime title, they could be deposed or pressured to resign. Secrecy was essential to shielding political affairs from outside influence. With few grand political rallies or public speeches, rivalries were mostly confined to private councils. This restraint also helped prevent stirring up public sentiment, avoiding sensationalism, and maintaining a sense of calm and order in the city. Venetians were willing to adapt when necessary, but once a solution proved effective, they stuck with it. The threat of factionalism over the doge's position, led by the Tiepolo and Dandolo families in the 1200s, prompted patricians to introduce a unique voting process for the doge in 1268. Combining lotteries and voting, this system would remain largely unchanged for the next 500 years. Council members gathered and drew from an urn containing hundreds of balls (ballotta)—30 gold and the rest silver; those drawing gold advanced, while those who picked silver exited. The ballottino, a young attendant, managed the urns. The 30 who picked gold then repeated the lottery, reducing their number to nine. These nine members then deliberated and agreed on 40 candidates, each requiring a minimum of seven votes from the group of nine to be considered. The process continued: the 40 were reduced to 12, who nominated 25; the 25 to nine, who nominated 45, and finally, the 45 to 11, who selected 41 electors. The final electors deliberated and voted on the doge, who required a minimum of 25 votes to win. The process combined the impartiality of lotteries with the selectivity of voting, minimizing the chance for corruption while ensuring the legitimacy of decisions through broad consensus. The often weeks-long change broke the families' duopoly, and ensuing elections often took weeks. Contarini observed that doges were neither glorified nor vilified. Their terms were subject to posthumous review, with poor leadership censured or erased from public memory, while the contributions of effective rulers were recognized. This helped to ensure that leadership was viewed as a collective effort rather than the achievement of any single individual. Fear of the doge's authority also led patricians to steadily decentralize power into hereditary committees, integrating government expertise within the oligarchy. This ensured balanced decision-making and reduced the risk of autocratic rule. In 1142, the Minor Council was established as a small executive body to assist and monitor the doge. This was followed by the Great Council in 1172, which became the foundation of Venetian governance and the principal legislative body, severely limiting the doge's power. Membership in the Great Council was a lifetime privilege for patrician males. From 1179, judicial authority was invested in the Quarantia Criminale(criminal law), followed later by two other Councils of Forty (highest appeal court). By the early 13th century, the Senate emerged from the Great Council, focusing on trade and foreign policy, and was composed of serving and former officials. Meanwhile, in response to the failed 1310 revolt by Bajamonte Tiepolo, the Council of Ten was created to track down conspirators, later evolving to handle crises, conduct investigations, and oversee internal security. Despite rising governmental complexity, Venice's bureaucracy remained efficient and avoided runaway growth. Political offices outside the dogeship also faced constraints. Terms were typically limited to one year to prevent consolidation of power and reelections often required formal approval. Close relatives were prohibited from holding the same office, running in the same election, or voting in elections involving each other to prevent familial monopolies. Contarini noted that accountability was shared among the elite. Nobles who supported candidates were held financially liable if those candidates were later convicted of embezzlement and unable to repay the amount. Corruption resulted in punishments such as property confiscation and exile, with the competitive noble families keeping each other in check. As the doge's role became largely symbolic, real power shifted to the Council of Ten, the Great Council, and the Senate. These bodies dominated Venetian politics during its Golden Age, Renaissance, and eventual collapse, adapting to changing needs while maintaining cohesion and expertise through overlapping membership. The Arengo or Concio, a general assembly of Venetian general citizens, initially played a strong political role alongside the doge. However, Venice's noble families were similarly distrustful of commoner influence through democracy. Public participation in governance declined sharply after the Serrata of 1297 or the closing of the Great Council, which solidified hereditary governance and saw the Arengo lose its political authority before it was formally abolished in 1423. These decisions effectively ended democracy in Venice and ensured political power remained concentrated among the nobles. Given the rarity of democracy at the time, this approach nonetheless permitted greater political stability by minimizing potential disruptions from populist movements. Social Hierarchy and Economic Opportunities in Venice The late 13th and early 14th centuries 'marked the formal separation of the nobles from the rest of the population,' entrenching Venice's oligarchy and placing the non-patrician majority—approximately 95 percent of the city's population—under elite control. The disconnect between the elites and commoners could be stark—Contarini praised Venice's commitment to protecting commoners during crises like the plague, but later accounts paint a less charitable picture. Despite limited political representation and rigid social classes, Venice's nobles managed to maintain enough support for the political system to survive. A tiered hierarchy emerged under them, with the cittadini—a privileged class of merchants, skilled artisans, notaries, and administrators—forming approximately eight percent of the population, while the majority were commoners (popolani). Social hierarchy in Venice was strictly enforced, with laws dictating what each class could wear. Intermarriage between patricians and cittadini was rare, though the latter class experienced regular turnover. Richer cittadini often surpassed certain aristocratic families in wealth, while patricians invested in merchant enterprises, creating economic interdependence. The cittadini also controlled the civil service, led by the Grand Chancellor of Venice—the highest-ranking non-noble official. Through the Order of Secretaries, the cittadini served as notaries, clerks, tax collectors, and judicial officers. The wealthiest of their families with long-standing Venetian roots (cittadini originari) were included in the Book of Silver and granted additional opportunities in committees. Granting the cittadini some political influence prevented the patricians from completely dominating government affairs and ensured efficiency through their administrative expertise. Despite the large and relatively powerless commoner class, Venice avoided the social upheavals common in other Italian city-states. According to Dennis Romano, professor emeritus of history at Syracuse University, 14th-century Venice remained stable because patricians and commoners were less rigidly separated, and tradition coexisted with flexibility. Social networks could overlap and legal and moral boundaries occasionally blurred during this period. Social rules were relaxed during holidays and festivals, elevating a sense of civic community, while commoners could participate in religious roles, including as members of the clergy. Symbols of unity, such as the Venetian mask, the lion of Saint Mark, and the figure of the doge, reinforced civic identity. Legal protections through the Avogaria de Comun (public prosecutors), established in the late 12th century, ensured justice for commoners and legal representation for the poor. The state also supported infrastructure projects, welfare institutions, and charities, and wealthy nobles were expected to engage in philanthropy without fanfare and provide financial aid to the state during crises. Venice's economic allure and social mobility opportunities were, however, arguably the most crucial factors in maintaining stability. Venetian contract law ensured trust and stability in trade. The republic's vast commerce and trade networks and position as a vital connector between the East and the West offered opportunities to commoners rarely found elsewhere. While they suffered more during conflicts, famines, and plagues, the diverse composition of the popolani made it difficult for them to unite around common grievances. Additionally, Venice's stable governance and potential for social mobility left them better off than those in neighboring city-states and empires. As a result, though commoners were excluded from major political decisions, they accepted their limited role, trusting in the fairness and accountability of Venice's governing class, institutions, and rule of law. Within the city, a thriving retail sector and diverse economic opportunities complemented a strong manufacturing base. Venice became a leader in shipbuilding, wool and silk cloth production, and glassmaking, attracting talent and investment. Commoners could also join merchant guilds and trade associations along with cittadini, gaining modest political representation and participation in collective decision-making. In later centuries, Venice evolved into a hub of printing and intellectual life, eventually becoming a center for culture and leisure, renowned for its prestige as a museum city. Venice's economic adaptability, driven by both patricians and the merchant class, was key to Venice's sustained prosperity, driving innovation and supporting the city's ability to respond to shifting trade and political dynamics. Military Strength, Foreign Holdings, and Diplomacy But Venice's survival and success also came from its military strength. Surrounded by larger states, its central hub in the Venetian Lagoon provided a defensible core for its navy. The state-owned Arsenal, a pioneering shipyard, and private enterprises enabled the mass production of ships, blending commerce and defense. Merchant ships were often fitted for combat, doubling as warships to protect trade routes, while military expeditions were self-sustaining through trade conducted en route. Boasting the strongest navy in Europe, Venice compensated for its limited land power by employing professional mercenaries and condottieri (or military commanders). The republic avoided overextension, focusing on maintaining positive relations with its limited territories. Mainland cities enjoyed considerable autonomy, with several independent city-states voluntarily joining the republic. During the War of Cambrai (1508 to 1516), Venice contemplated ceding mainland territories, but revolts in occupied cities in support of Venice helped drive out invaders. At its height in the 16th century, Venice's dogado around the lagoon housed approximately 150,000 inhabitants, with its wider territories encompassing 2.3 million people. The Domini da Tera administered mainland Italy, while the Domini da Mar governed overseas colonies. Venetian military officials, like their political counterparts, were rotated regularly to avoid power accumulation and provide numerous nobles with administrative and military experience. Revolts in Crete against Venetian rule exposed governance flaws in its territories, but efforts to promote greater equality between Venetian settlers and local populations eventually brought peace and showcased Venice's adaptability in managing overseas territories. Venice also maintained its independence through skilled diplomacy and a calculated focus on the balance of power. Supported by an expansive network of spies, diplomats, and agents, the small republic successfully navigated challenges from larger, powerful rivals, including Byzantium, the Carolingians, the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottomans, France, and Spain. An early strategic alliance with Byzantium secured access to key ports, while ties with Rome and trade posts as far as China reinforced its position as a reliable trading partner and intermediary. Ties with entities like the Hanseatic League (a trading network) further expanded Venice's global reach. Even during its economic decline, Venice played a powerful diplomatic role. Several Venetian popes were elected from the 1400s to 1700s, and Venetian diplomat Alvise Contarini played a crucial role in mediating the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, ending the Thirty Years' War. Steady Decline The seeds of Venice's decline were nonetheless sown early into its foreign expansion. The Fourth Crusade in 1204 enriched Venice and expanded its territories but strained its relations with Eastern Orthodoxy. The smaller, weakened Byzantine Empire, restored after the crusade, could not withstand the rising Ottoman Empire, whose conquest of Constantinople in 1453 disrupted Venice's critical eastern trading routes. Venice maintained a strong presence in the Mediterranean, but logistical challenges, heavier taxation, and growing Ottoman competition gradually pushed it into a defensive retreat. In 1492, Spain's accidental arrival in the Americas marked a shift in global trade and the need for larger, ocean-bound ships. Venice's lack of access to the Atlantic, which would fuel later European empires, was soon compounded by the Portuguese voyage to India via Africa in 1498, further undercutting its trade with the East. Venetians later established footholds in cities like Paris, London, and the Low Countries to collaborate with the rapidly growing Atlantic powers, but they struggled to keep pace. The city's preference for autonomy left it isolated in a rapidly changing European geopolitical landscape. While Venice's early history of isolationism gave way to expansion, the city reverted to a more defensive and conservative isolationism in a world dominated by global powers. Repeated outbreaks of plague, particularly in 1575 to 1577 and 1630 to 1631, devastated Venice's population and weakened its economic and military foundation. By the 17th century, Venice's once-adaptative nobles and political system had come to resist reform. Venice's oligarchic social and political structure, as noted by historian John Norwich, had become rigid and highly corrupt. The nobility, formerly active merchants, had become passive investors, landowners, or city administrators. Destitute aristocrats could no longer sustain their privileges, weakening both their status and the socio-political hierarchy. Political activists, inspired by French Jacobin ideals and Italian nationalism, became increasingly vocal. Venice's system had also arguably become too outdated by the 18th century. Nation-states and the modern concept of nationalism simply overwhelmed merchant republics in demographics, territory, and wealth. Napoleon's revolutionary changes in both warfare and social systems allowed the French military to take Venice without a fight. The Great Council then voted itself out of existence, and France transferred the region to Austria, which shifted the center of the regional government to Milan and prioritized nearby Triest as a port instead. Venice was later incorporated into Italy in 1866, which it has remained part of ever since. Venice's Strengths and Other Former Republics Other Italian city-state republics also achieved prominence. Florenceflourished with its banking sector, textile industry, and legal protections afforded to its citizens. Lucca maintained independence longer than Venice, while Pisa and Siena enjoyed periods of prominence. Genoa emerged as a significant maritime power, rivaling Venice for centuries. However, Florence shifted to hereditary and dynastic rule under the Medici family in the 16th century and conquered Pisa and Siena. Lucca lacked Venice's scale and influence, while Genoa, despite its strengths, struggled with internal tensions. Merchants and aristocrats were often at odds, as were rival noble clans who reverted to warring among themselves during peacetime. This instability often required foreign mediation, gradually eroding Genoa's autonomy, while its later alliance with Spain further subordinated Genoa's independence. In contrast, Venice managed to avoid conquest, retaining its republican system, political autonomy, and global significance long after many of its counterparts had faded or been absorbed. Even centuries after its fall, no other Italian republic holds the same mystique of Venice. The city's cultural impact alone was immense, producing creative figures like Tintoretto, Antonio Vivaldi, and Giovanni Bellini, and attracting Andrea Palladio and Titian. Its architectural beauty, set against the lagoon and emulating Roman styles, remains an international draw. Venice's maintenance and adaptation of Greek and Roman political influences created a system that lasted centuries, which though weakened by the time of French conquest, may have had the potential to rebound. Venice's independence movement, which has accelerated since 2014, is unlikely to achieve secession due to significant barriers, including the constraints of Italy's constitution, lack of international recognition, and disputes over the territorial feasibility of such a split. The city's modern economy is driven by tourism, with more than 5.7 million visitors in 2023. Other Italian city-states survive in their own ways: Genoa revived as a key port city in the 1800s and remains so today. The Grimaldi family, originally from Genoa, meanwhile, seized control of Monaco in 1297 and has ruled the country ever since. San Marino, a city-state republic with a claim to a 1700-year-old history, successfully diplomatically negotiated its independence in 301 AD. Other republics outside Italy emerged during Venice's time but struggled to endure. The Novgorod Republic established in 1136 in modern Russia, thrived on trade and featured a large assembly, term limits, and checks on elite power. However, its lack of a strong military left it vulnerable, and Moscow captured it in 1478. The Dutch Republic, established in 1588, decentralized government between provinces and the States General for shared decision-making. It prioritized legal protections, religious tolerance, trade, literacy, and social mobility, though the Dutch East and West India companies undermined republican ideals through colonization and slavery. In 1795, the Dutch Republic fell to France and was replaced by the centralized Batavian Republic, which struggled with regionalism and reliance and dominance by France. By 1810, it became a French-controlled monarchy, until Dutch independence in 1813 reintroduced a monarchy that persists today. Modern Republican Rule Modern republics remain young and show a range of adaptations. Parliamentary republics rely on coalition-building, but this risks marginalizing even the most popular parties. Votes of confidence can swiftly remove leaders, but shorter political terms can lead to prioritizing short-term visions. Presidential systems can, meanwhile, run the risk of autocracy, particularly with longer-term limits and incumbency advantage. Other challenges include promoting democratic participation without runaway populism, balancing decentralization and centralization, creating effective political bodies without needless bureaucracy, and striving for peace while remaining prepared for conflict. Switzerland stands out for its sustained stability, avoiding revolution, occupation, or imperialism since its unification in 1848. It combines regional and international autonomy, open trade, and its role as a global financial and diplomatic hub. Seasonal canton voting embodies direct democracy and encourages citizen participation. However, universal suffrage faces resistance tied to immigration, with referendums on non-citizen voting rights from 1992 to 2016 struggling in areas with higher foreign populations, reflecting concerns over integration and 'over-foreignization' in the country. Singapore, an independent city-state republic since 1965, has thrived and maintained its autonomy by emerging as a trade hub, balancing Cold War powers and rising U.S.-China tensions over the last 20 years. Despite its nominally democratic and republican system, governance has remained centralized under the People's Action Party, dominated by Lee Kuan Yew's family and close allies. The Need for Greater Corporate Accountability The discussion of decentralized leadership should extend beyond nations to the private sector. Early corporations like the British East India Company, as well as modern constitutional republics, were modeled on medieval chartered towns that were given powers to legislate, imprison, and wage conflicts. Modern multinational corporations operate globally, influencing markets, negotiating with governments, and increasingly having access to armed forces. Their growing autonomy has led to efforts to link corporate governance with civic responsibility, including proposals to replace the hijacked democratic 'one share, one vote' system that has allowed major shareholders to consolidate power and exploit corporate governance in recent decades. The likelihood of self-imposed corporate accountability is low. However, introducing more layered governance with checks and balances could improve oversight, as private governing entities continue to evolve. Increasing experimentation with private cities globally signals a resurgence of corporate governance, seen more than a century ago in the U.S. with company towns. Similarly, Próspera, a private charter city on Roatán Island in Honduras, is run by a U.S. corporation with a proclaimed commitment to libertarian ideals. It's important to view the workers and communities these corporations interact with as similar to state subjects. The growth of corporate power challenges the classical liberal idea that contracts between companies and workers should be free of authority. Republican-style corporate leadership in such projects could address concerns about civic participation, autocracy, and the rule of law. Venice's Lessons for Modern Democracies Many factors contributed to Venice's success: expansive trade networks, social mobility, technological innovation, geographic advantages, military power, and diplomatic prowess. These elements were mutually reinforcing, underpinned by political stability achieved through distributing authority across collaborative bodies. While Venice's oligarchy compromised the non-hereditary ideal of republicanism, it effectively prevented dynasties and upheld the principle of power distribution. The public largely trusted the nobles, though the exclusive nature of the noble class contributed to their decline in later centuries. Venice's political evolution and trajectory are a priceless repository of history for modern democracies to study. The presence of a non-hereditary figure like the doge provided a unifying focal point for governance, helping to anchor symbolic authority and reduce factionalism. A commitment to checks and balances allowed for a balanced distribution of power. Economic opportunities were cultivated by elites and merchant classes and embraced by the commoners, driving Venice's prosperity and social mobility. Its ability to continuously adapt its political and economic systems was similarly a major reason for its long-term survival. Today, frequent power and public opinion shifts, coupled with the influence of wealth and corporations, are fueling instability and gridlock, undermining the long-term effectiveness of democratic institutions. History shows that democratic societies have voted to unintentionally dismantle their own democratic and republican systems, and contemporary voters have often turned to populism and autocracy in the 21st century out of frustration. But how much power should rest with individuals? Governance could be strengthened by withholding our tendency to center authority in people and instead placing it into political bodies. Venice's system, for all its strengths, failed to create a fully open, meritocratic system, but its emphasis on collaborative bodies within a professional political class is something modern democracies may need to reconsider. Had Venice's republican system continued to adapt rather than become increasingly rigid, it may have endured to this day. About the author: John P.

Sovereignty Under Siege – A Global Chessboard – OpEd	Donald Trump’s rhetoric about ‘the 51st state’ is treated by many as political theatre – a ploy by the president-elect to, perhaps, destabilize the opposition. But his remarks allude to something much less innocuous – something a bit more unsettling. By now, all of us have heard the rather boisterous rhetoric of the former president. The headlines are ever present: From Foxnews, 'Trump suggests Canada become 51st state after Trudeau said tariff would kill economy.' Politico reports, 'Trump threatens to retake Panama Canal.' And from AP, 'Trump again calls to buy Greenland after eyeing Canada and the Panama Canal.' Admittedly, audacious remarks from Trump are neither new nor are they taken too seriously in many quarters – just more political messaging by an incoming president with much to live up to. Yet, Donald Trump's bold talk about these states does mine something much deeper than mere rhetoric. And while his admonitions may not eventuate – that is beside the point. President-elect Trump is stirring the cauldron of world politics. Comments about tariffs as well as annexing, buying, and reclaiming sovereign territories have elicited both a caustic response as well as its own share of media humor. Beyond its entertainment value, Trump’s provocations (even if he is not aware of it), do point to a subtle and potentially more dangerous issue: Could nation-state sovereignty no longer be the inviolable precept we have believed in since the Peace of Westphalia in the 17th century? Although the concept of the 'sovereign nation-state' has its origin in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia and the end of the Thirty Years’ War of Religion, the 'inviolability of borders' is a relatively recent phenomenon. The idea of a 'right to statehood' emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, embraced by two counterposing entities: the Bolsheviks of Russia and the liberal US President Woodrow Wilson. Both sought to dismantle empires – Russia’s for ideological reasons and the US to expand its own influence. The result was a proliferation of relatively weak, dependent states that (for all practical purposes) became tools of Moscow and Washington foreign policy. The sovereignty of these 'neo-states' was little more than a bargaining chip – the latter essentially reliant on foreign support (militarily, economically and politically) for their existence. This dynamic has persisted beyond the Second World War into the neoliberal era of today. In fact, nearly every conflict until the mid-20th century ended with redrawn borders. So, here's the question: Are we not doing the same thing – today in Ukraine? Certainly, there have been previous examples of sovereignty being sacrificed for 'peace': the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia (1938), Serbia/Kosovo (1999) and others. In a world where power increasingly relies on military might, sovereignty has shifted from being a precept of international law to an issue of practical control. And the control comes from beyond the borders of the alleged sovereign state –often for the benefit of foreign power agendas. Ukraine's sovereignty is contested for reasons that have little to do with the country itself. Consider the turn of events in Ukraine. Since Moscow’s 2022 'Special Military Operation,' (i.e. invasion) that country has been unable to maintain control over about one-fifth (20%) of its sovereign territory. Moreover, its prospects for regaining it are diminishing daily. At the same time, those countries supporting Ukraine militarily and financially with billions of dollars are now urging Kiev to stop the war and consider ceding territory for peace. The borders of Ukraine are being redrawn and its sovereign territory redefined by powers external to the country. In this shifting global landscape, it seems that territory and external control are once again becoming central to international politics. Given this reality, the idea of sovereigty (and the US-led 'rules-based order' which preserves it) must not become a casualty of flawed political initiatives. Trump’s comments about annexing Canada, taking back Panama and buying Greenland from a country that doesn't have the legal right to sell it highlight the subtle hypocrisy in the international community. Sovereignty, once treated as sacrosanct, increasingly seems to be giving ground to political agendas of assorted foreign policies East and West. Westphalian nation-state sovereignty is built on a key premise: The principle of non-interference asserts that no state should interfere in the internal affairs of another state. It upholds the idea that each state has the right to govern itself without external intervention. The entire Ukraine debacle is antithetical to this principle. The Western-engineered coup of 2014, the Russian invasion, the sabotage of the 2022 peace talks and the hundreds of thousands killed, speak to the critical lack of regard for the concept of sovereignty within the international community. Globalism and a dysfunctional EU (united only in name) are symptoms of this underlying malady – an assault on sovereignty. Today, Ukraine is sovereign in name only with the UK, US, EU and Russia (ultimately deciding) through territorial concessions and political control -- what its 'sovereignty' will look like. In the 21st century sovereignty is under assault and American dominance is being challenged – we must never take America's sovereignty – and the freedom it secures for granted. Just ask the people of Ukraine, the Sudetenland and Serbia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC120af8lkWfLmH	2025-01-24T16:29:25-08:00	
Britain Should Join America And Sanction Putin’s Puppet In Georgi...	By Nate Sibley The British Overseas Territories (BOTs) have long been seen as tax havens. But in recent years, their related role as global money laundering hubs has come under scrutiny. Like the Conservative government before it, the ruling Labour government in the United Kingdom is under pressure to strengthen corporate transparency and drive out dirty money. While they work to do so, ministers should also take advantage of the fact that so many of the West’s enemies depend on the financial secrecy Britain’s offshore empire offers. BOTs are mostly small island nations in remote locations with few natural resources (besides fish). As globalization expanded development opportunities, tourism and professional services became the two obvious paths for these territories, especially given that the latter only needs an internet connection. In addition to low (or no) taxes, BOTs offer discretion in the form of few (or no) know-your-customer regulations. But policies designed to attract the wealthy also attracted criminals, who for obvious reasons were similarly concerned with keeping their financial arrangements hidden from authorities in their own countries. The UK therefore bears some responsibility for facilitating the rise of China, Russia, Iran, and other kleptocratic dictatorships that, having consolidated their rule at home, now turn their sights on upending the global order and supplanting the West. But it also means that the UK possesses potential leverage over these regimes—should the government be brave enough to use it. One urgent example of this is Bidzina Ivanishvili, the would-be dictator of Georgia. His ruling political party, Georgian Dream, has made no secret of its plan to subvert the population’s aspirations for European Union membership and instead drag Georgia back under Russia’s control. Ivanishvili has also opened his country, and Europe, to the pernicious influence of the Chinese Communist Party by inviting US-sanctioned Chinese state-owned companies to build a strategically significant deep-water port. In December, the UK joined the United States in sanctioning five senior Georgian officials for their roles in violently suppressing pro-democracy protests. In January, the US went one step further and imposed long-overdue sanctions on Bidzina Ivanishvili himself. The UK has yet to follow, while the EU has been unable to act because of the now-predictable vetoes by Russia-friendly Hungarian and Slovak leaders. Transparency International Georgia has identified 95 companies controlled by Ivanishvili that are registered in the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. As BOTs, these islands are required to enforce the sanctions by banning any transactions with the companies and freezing any assets owned by them. Kleptocrats like Ivanishvili are rarely foolish enough to keep all their eggs in one basket. It is unlikely that his overseas financial assets are in BVI or Cayman bank accounts but located in other jurisdictions with similarly lax oversight but better financial sectors. Fortunately, the threat of sanctions is often sufficient to convince banks in other jurisdictions to stop turning a blind eye and boot the suspicious customer. Given the US dollar’s global role, Washington has by far the most clout in this respect. But the UK, as home to the world’s second biggest financial center, also holds significant influence. James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat member of Parliament, has introduced an early day motion (a nonbinding resolution somewhat akin to a sense of Congress) calling on the Labour government to impose sanctions on Ivanishvili. So far just 15 MPs, mostly from his own party, have joined him. Not all MPs regularly sign EDMs, but this is nevertheless a paltry show of support. MacCleary is not the only parliamentarian to have noticed the UK’s strange delay in acting against Ivanishvili. Representative Joe Wilson (R-SC), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and chair of the Helsinki Committee in Congress, has also called on the UK to 'immediately sanction CCP crony Bidzina Ivanishvili, his immediate family, and his network of enablers.' To his great credit, Foreign Secretary David Lammy has committed to ending London’s role as a one-stop shop for foreign kleptocrats to launder their stolen funds and whitewash their reputations. But extending this crusade to the BOTs will take much political wrangling with their local governments, who are resentful of what they see as London’s interference in their internal affairs (or, more likely, simply unwilling to tamper with their main source of revenue). While Lammy is busy fixing this broken net, he should be careful not to discard the fish that it has already caught. Kleptocrats like Ivanishvili should never have been able to exploit the BOTs to launder their stolen wealth. But if they continue to do so, they should henceforth live in fear that the UK will use its sanctions power to hold them accountable.

The Fight Against Disinformation: A Persistent Challenge For Demo...	By Kateryna Odarchenko Introduction (FPRI) -- Disinformation, the deliberate dissemination of false or misleading information to deceive or manipulate public opinion, represents a profound and ongoing threat to Western democracies. It erodes trust in institutions, fuels polarization, and undermines decision-making processes. Russian disinformation campaigns, in particular, showcase a sophisticated, multilayered system of narratives tailored to exploit societal vulnerabilities. Understanding their architecture and methodologies is critical for crafting effective countermeasures to safeguard democratic systems. Moscow’s disinformation campaigns have achieved significant victories in reshaping public opinion and influencing geopolitical trajectories. In Georgia, Russian narratives have successfully steered segments of the population away from a Western-oriented path, fostering skepticism toward European integration and NATO membership. Similarly, these campaigns have undermined international support for Ukraine by spreading false narratives about the conflict, portraying Ukraine as a failed state or aggressor, and sowing doubts about the necessity of Western involvement. Moreover, Russia’s strategic use of disinformation has eroded trust in NATO, amplifying fears of alliance overreach and internal divisions. These successes highlight the dangerous efficacy of disinformation in advancing Moscow’s geopolitical agenda and emphasize the urgent need for robust counter-strategies. Ways and Means of Disinformation Russian disinformation operates as a well-coordinated ecosystem capable of deploying and adapting diverse narratives across multiple platforms. These narratives are strategically designed to evolve in intensity and variation, targeting the unique characteristics of the media environments and societies they infiltrate. Countries with complex media landscapes are especially vulnerable due to the multiplicity of audiences and channels. Key narrative categories include the 'Russian World' (Russkiy Mir), which solidifies identification with Russia among Russian-speaking populations, particularly in nations like Latvia, Estonia, and Ukraine. The narrative of Slavic Unity leverages shared ethnic and historical ties to bolster support for Russia’s geopolitical agenda. Similarly, nostalgia for the Soviet era challenges Western-dominated global systems by portraying Russia as a counterbalance to perceived Western hegemony. Other narratives focus on 'anti' rhetoric against the European Union, NATO, and liberal democratic values, resonating with far-right and nationalist movements in Europe. Finally, the strategy of presenting alternative and conflicting information seeks to erode the concept of objective truth, creating confusion and mistrust of credible sources. The systemic nature of these campaigns relies on a network of state institutions, including the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Federal Security Service, alongside state-controlled media and private actors. Even the Russian Orthodox Church plays a strategic role in amplifying these messages. Counteracting such interconnected networks requires a holistic and targeted approach that goes beyond addressing individual narratives to dismantle the broader infrastructure. A particularly insidious component of this ecosystem is the role of the Russian Orthodox Church and its affiliated organizations in advancing Kremlin-aligned narratives. Under the guise of anti-cult activities, these efforts marginalize minority religious communities while promoting Russian imperialist ideologies. The Russian Association of Centers for the Study of Religions and Sects (RACIRS), led by Alexander Dvorkin, exemplifies this strategy. Through seminars, publications, and collaborations with media outlets, RACIRS propagates divisive rhetoric abroad, often justifying Russia’s foreign and domestic policies, including the invasion of Ukraine. For instance, RACIRS has engaged in partnerships with pro-Russian groups in Central and Eastern Europe to influence public opinion. Countering These Ways and Means Disrupting the financial and logistical mechanisms supporting these operations is essential to countering their destabilizing effects. Moscow’s disinformation campaigns rely heavily on a robust infrastructure of media outlets, online platforms, and state-sponsored entities that require consistent funding and operational resources to maintain their reach and influence. Cutting off financial resources can weaken their ability to hire skilled propagandists, purchase ad space, and amplify narratives through social media algorithms. Similarly, targeting logistical support—such as the technological infrastructure used to disseminate content or the networks facilitating coordination between actors—can severely hinder operational efficiency. By focusing on these critical pillars, the international community can degrade the capacity of disinformation networks, making them less effective in shaping public opinion or sowing discord globally. The significance of this approach becomes evident in examining cases like Viktor Medvedchuk, whose activities epitomize the Kremlin’s reliance on financial and logistical networks to fuel its influence campaigns. The case of Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch and close confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, further illustrates the Kremlin’s strategy of leveraging influential figures to disseminate propaganda. Medvedchuk’s control of Ukrainian TV channels such as 112 Channel, News One, and Zik allowed him to saturate the media landscape with anti-Western narratives, particularly in Ukraine’s eastern and southern regions, where pro-Russian sentiment was already present. His activities were financed through Russian oil profits, and he employed social media troll factories to amplify his messaging and electoral bribery through the provision of 'gifts' like food or cash during elections. Despite his arrest and subsequent exchange in 2022, Medvedchuk’s legacy underscores the need to dismantle the financial and media infrastructures that enable such disinformation. In addition to Ukraine, cases of electoral bribery orchestrated by Russian actors have also been documented in Estonia and Latvia. Investigative reports indicate that pro-Russian groups engaged in distributing money and goods to Russian-speaking minorities during local elections in these Baltic states, aiming to secure votes for candidates aligned with Kremlin interests. In Estonia, instances of cash payments and organized transportation to polling stations were linked to pro-Kremlin organizations, while in Latvia, similar tactics were employed in regions with significant Russian-speaking populations, leveraging socio-economic hardships to sway voter loyalty. The export of Russian disinformation campaigns extends beyond Ukraine, as evidenced by case studies in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Since 2014, pro-Russian narratives have infiltrated Slovakia’s information ecosystem, leveraging embassies, intelligence operatives, and social media to position Russia as a protector of traditional values and a natural ally for Slavic nations. Historical revisionism and cultural appeals have bolstered support for pro-Kremlin parties like SMER-SD, led by Robert Fico. Fico’s rhetoric, which undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and aligns Slovakia with Moscow’s interests, exemplifies the potent influence of these campaigns. Similarly, in the Czech Republic, media outlets such as 'Voice of Europe,'linked to Medvedchuk’s network, disseminate narratives that oppose EU policies and undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty. Investigative reports reveal covert funding of pro-Russian candidates during European elections, often using cryptocurrency with obscure origins. However, the Czech Republic has demonstrated resilience through proactive measures, including government sanctions and public awareness campaigns, highlighting the effectiveness of coordinated counter-disinformation strategies. Addressing the challenge of Russian disinformation requires a multifaceted approach, with a primary focus on dismantling the financial and logistical networks that sustain these operations. The interconnected nature of these supply chains—spanning state institutions, media outlets, private actors, and ideological platforms like RACIRS—demands a comprehensive response targeting the root of these campaigns. Efforts should prioritize cutting off funding sources, whether through sanctions or stricter regulations on the flow of dark money, cryptocurrencies, or other opaque financial channels used to support disinformation. The Medvedchuk case illustrates how a robust disruption of financial supply chains can neutralize even well-entrenched propaganda operations. Moreover, combating logistical mechanisms such as troll farms, pro-Kremlin NGOs, and media outlets is essential to crippling the disinformation network’s reach and adaptability. By severing these critical lifelines, democracies can prevent the amplification of falsehoods and reduce the effectiveness of Kremlin-aligned narratives. Complementing these actions, public education initiatives and media literacy programs are vital for empowering citizens to resist manipulation. The examples of Slovakia and the Czech Republic underscore both the vulnerabilities inherent in democratic systems and the resilience that coordinated strategies can foster. Disrupting these supply chains will protect institutions, rebuild public trust, and safeguard democratic values against the corrosive threat of Russian disinformation. This systematic approach ensures that the fight against disinformation is not merely reactive but anticipates and neutralizes threats at their origin. Moreover, Moscow often leverages the same financial backers and logistical frameworks across multiple disinformation channels, creating interconnected networks that amplify their influence while simultaneously presenting multiple points of vulnerability. These entities, such as the notorious Internet Research Agency, receive substantial funding from state-controlled sources, enabling them to sustain large-scale operations that flood information ecosystems with pro-Kremlin narratives. Logistically, Russian disinformation operations frequently utilize Telegram, a messaging platform with robust encryption and minimal content moderation, making it an ideal tool for coordinating campaigns and disseminating false information. The platform’s ability to create and manage numerous channels and groups allows disinformation actors to operate covertly, evading detection by traditional monitoring systems. Additionally, Yandex, Russia’s dominant search engine and technology provider, plays a dual role by not only supporting state-sponsored media outlets but also by developing algorithms that can be manipulated to prioritize Kremlin-aligned content. These examples illustrate how intertwined financial and logistical support systems not only sustain disinformation operations but also create multiple avenues for intervention. By targeting key financial institutions, and regulating platforms such as Telegram and Yandex, the international community can effectively disrupt the lifelines of Russian disinformation campaigns. Enhanced transparency in financial transactions, stricter regulations on digital platforms, and international cooperation in monitoring and sanctioning involved parties are essential steps toward dismantling these pervasive networks. Furthermore, the use of cryptocurrencies presents both a challenge and an opportunity. While they offer a means to obscure financial transactions, advancements in blockchain analysis and international regulatory frameworks can mitigate their misuse. Initiatives like the Financial Action Task Force guidelines on virtual assets are crucial in closing the loopholes that disinformation actors exploit to fund their operations anonymously. Conclusion Understanding the specific financial backers and logistical supporters of Russian disinformation campaigns reveals critical vulnerabilities that can be targeted to dismantle these operations effectively. By implementing comprehensive strategies that address both the monetary and operational aspects, democracies can significantly weaken the infrastructure that enables sustained and impactful disinformation efforts. This proactive approach not only curtails the immediate threat but also fortifies democratic institutions against future attempts at manipulation and destabilization.

Will Any Federal Officials Pay For What They Did? – OpEd	The biggest scientific con of the century is finally being exposed. But will any politicians or government officials ever be held responsible for the carnage they unleashed on Americans? In early 2020, when the Covid pandemic was starting to ravage America, federal bureaucrats and politicians rushed to suppress any suggestion that the pandemic originated from a Chinese government lab bankrolled by US government agencies. Key Biden administration officials effectively exonerated the Chinese government even though the Chinese completely stonewalled any outside investigation into the origin of the Covid virus, as the Wall Street Journal recently revealed in a front-page scoop. The FBI’s top expert concluded that the virus leaked from the lab but he was derailed by the Biden administration, blocked from presenting his evidence at a key White House meeting in August 2021. Three scientists at the National Center for Medical Intelligence, part of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that Covid leaked from a lab but they were muzzled. The Inspector General is conducting an investigation to determine why those experts were silenced. The Department of Energy also concluded that Covid originated in a lab. In September 2023, a senior CIA analyst told a Congressional committee that six key CIA analystshad been bribed by the agency to abandon their conclusion that Covid originated in a lab leak. The Chinese government first admitted that a pandemic had broken out in the city of Wuhan in early 2020. Though the Chinese military-affiliated Wuhan Institute of Virology had been experimenting with bats for years, the Chinese government insisted the new virus came from a nearby marketplace. But the lead scientists involved with bat research had all been struck down by Covid-19 symptoms shortly before the Chinese government denied any responsibility. There was a deluge of circumstantial evidence quickly linking the new virus to the lab. The outbreak of Covid-19 spurred one of the most brazen cover-ups in modern US history. The National Institute for Health had been financing gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That type of research seeks to genetically alter organisms to enable the spread of viruses into new species. Such research is extremely dangerous; as MIT professor Kevin Esvelt asked in 2021, 'Why is anyone trying to teach the world how to make viruses that could kill millions of people?' The risks were compounded because the Wuhan Institute had a very poor safety rating. Two years earlier, the State Department confidentially 'warned other federal agencies about safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat Covid,' but the public disclosure of that alert was delayed until 2022. In January 2020, top federal scientists recognized that the pandemic could obliterate their reputations. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes for Health, wrote in an email that 'a swift convening of experts in a confidence-inspiring framework is needed or the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to science and international harmony.' The 'conspiracy' was the facts of the matter. Anthony Fauci, the chief of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), speedily enlisted a handful of trusted scientists to gin up a paper supposedly 'proving' that the virus could not have originated in the lab. A top NIAID scientist accepted the task of debunking the lab-leak story because, as he emailed a colleague, 'Tony doesn’t want his fingerprints on origin stories.' The Lancet, one of the most respected medical journals in the world, enlisted in the cover-up with an op-ed by 27 scientists who proclaimed: 'We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin.' Maybe the same scientists also sent an addendum to NIH: Keep giving us grant money or your reputation will 'swim with the fishes.' Further 'proof' was provided by a torrent of accusations of racism against anyone who publicly suggested that the virus originated in a Chinese lab. The State Department’s Global Engagement Center added a federal fist to the debate, pressuring Twitter to suppress hundreds of thousands of accounts (including thousands of average Americans) in early 2020 for the crime of suggesting that Covid originated in a lab. Bureaucrats secretly decided that wildly exaggerated forecasts of pandemic mortality made the First Amendment null and void. If Covid-19 had been initially recognized as the result of one of the biggest government boondoggles in history, it would have been far more difficult for American politicians and government scientists to pirouette as saviors as they seized sway over daily life. The virus that the NIH financed provided push-button dictatorial power to politicians at every level of government. In the name of saving lives, politicians entitled themselves to destroy an unlimited number of livelihoods. Most governors responded to Covid-19 by dropping the equivalent of a Reverse Neutron Bomb — something that destroys the economy while leaving human beings unharmed. But the only way to assume people were uninjured was to presume that their lives were totally detached from their jobs, bank accounts, mortgage and rent payments, and friends and family. A virus with a 99+% survival rate spawned a 100% presumption in favor of despotism. From the start of the pandemic, many people who swore allegiance to 'science and data' also believed that absolute power would keep them safe. Doubters became dissidents who deserved to be covertly silenced. Shutdown advocates appealed to science like righteous priests invoking God and the Bible to sanctify scourging enemies. But the 'science' was often farcically unreliable. Mandatory mask mandates became the new version of the Emancipation Proclamation. Fauci and other top officials deceived Americans into believing that cloth masks offered far more protection than they delivered. Do Americans finally recognize that the federal government was the biggest source of disinformation during the pandemic? A century ago, historian Henry Adams declared that politics has 'always been the systematic organization of hatreds.' Covid-19 policies were so disruptive in part because politicians intentionally sought to maximize fear and rage against anyone who refused to submit to any dictate. After the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines collapsed, Biden responded by dictating that a hundred million American adults must get injected based on his personal decree. A few weeks later at a CNN town hall, Biden derided vaccine skeptics as murderers who only wanted 'the freedom to kill you' with Covid. A few months later, a Rasmussen poll found that 59% of Democratic voters favored house arrest for the unvaccinated, and 45% favored locking the unvaxxed into government detention facilities. Almost half of Democrats favored empowering the government to 'fine or imprison individuals who publicly question the efficacy of the existing Covid-19 vaccines on social media, television, radio, or in online or digital publications.' But hatred proved to be as ineffective as the Pfizer vaccine when it came to fighting Covid-19. Fauci, who was also Biden’s chief medical advisor, justified Covid mandates because average citizens 'don’t have the ability' to determine what is best for them. But Congressional investigations revealed that Fauci was at the center of string-pulling to shirk responsibility for the Wuhan debacle. After Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) suggested prosecuting Fauci for false testimony on bankrolling 'gain-of-function' research, Fauci howled that his critics are 'really criticizing science because I represent science. That’s dangerous.' But not nearly as dangerous as vesting vast power in secretive federal agencies. On September 20, 2023, the Biden administration belatedly banned the Wuhan Institute of Virology from receiving any US government research funding for 10 years as punishment for its unauthorized gain-of-function experiments on bat coronaviruses. But why did the Biden administration omit the same condemnation and similar prohibitions from any American scientist, institute, or government officials that had any role in this debacle? Instead of Tony Fauci bobbleheads, the slogan 'Your Government at Work' superimposed atop a million American caskets captured the reality of Covid-19.

New Solar Plants Expected To Support Most US Electric Generation ...	In our latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), we expect that U.S. renewable capacity additions—especially solar—will continue to drive the growth of U.S. power generation over the next two years. We expect U.S. utilities and independent power producers will add 26 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity to the U.S. electric power sector in 2025 and 22 GW in 2026. Last year, the electric power sector added a record 37 GW of solar power capacity to the electric power sector, almost double 2023 solar capacity additions. We forecast wind capacity additions will increase by around 8 GW in 2025 and 9 GW in 2026, slight increases from the 7 GW added in 2024. In contrast to solar and wind, generating capacity for most other energy sources will remain mostly unchanged in 2025 and 2026. Natural gas-fired capacity growth slowed in 2024, with only 1 GW of capacity added to the power mix, but natural gas remains the largest source of U.S. power generation. We forecast U.S. coal retirements will accelerate, removing 6% (11 GW) of coal generating capacity from the U.S. electricity sector in 2025 and removing another 2% (4 GW) in 2026. Last year, coal retirements represented about 3 GW of electric power capacity removed from the power system, which is the lowest annual amount of coal capacity retired since 2011. We expect that planned renewable capacity additions will support most of the growth in U.S. electric power generation, which we expect will increase by 2% in 2025 and by 1% in 2026. The U.S. electric power sector produced a total of 4,155 billion kilowatthours (kWh) of electricity in 2024, up 3% from 2023. Natural gas In 2024, U.S. natural gas-fired power plants generated a total of 1,767 billion kWh, 4% more than in 2023. Natural gas-fired power accounted for around 42% of the U.S. electricity mix, mostly unchanged compared with 2023. We expect natural gas generation will decline in 2025 by 3% to 1,712 billion kWh and decrease a further 1% to 1,692 billion kWh in 2026. Renewables We expect renewable power generation will increase 12% in the United States to 1,058 billion kWh in 2025 and increase a further 8% to 1,138 billion kWh in 2026. Renewable sources were the second-largest contributor to U.S. power generation in 2024 and accounted for 945 billion kWh, up 9% from 2023. Nuclear We expect U.S. nuclear power generation to grow 2% to 796 billion kWh in 2025 and increase a further 1% to 800 billion kWh in 2026. Nuclear power generation in 2024 was up slightly from 2023, totaling 781 billion kWh. Increased nuclear generation in the forecast is partly due to the addition of the two Vogtle power plant units that began commercial operations in July 2023 and April 2024, as well as the expected restart of the Palisades power plant in October 2025. Coal We expect U.S. coal power generation to remain unchanged at around 640 billion kWh in 2025 and 2026. Coal electricity generation was 647 billion kWh in 2024.

Salvini Threatens To Withdraw Italy From WHO	By Emma Pirnay (EurActiv) -- Matteo Salvini, Italy's deputy prime minister, has proposed a bill to withdraw Italy from the World Health Organization (WHO), following Donald Trump’s executive order on Monday. 'I presented this morning at the Chamber of Deputies, the League's bill to leave the WHO (World Health Organization), as did the United States with Donald Trump,' said Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, on X. Salvini’s proposal comes as the world body is freezing hiring and applying cuts to travel budgets following the US withdrawal, which contributed around 15 percent of its budget. The WHO budget for 2024-25 was set by its member states at $6.83 billion (€6.52 billion). 'Italy no longer has to deal with a supranational power centre – handsomely funded by Italian taxpayers – that goes hand-in-hand with multinational pharmaceutical companies,' said Salvini, adding that Italy should use what he called '€100 million' in contributions to instead fund 'our hospitals and doctors.' According to the WHO's funding data, Italy has donated €66 million to the body for the 2024-25 funding period, of which €34 million were membership fees. Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni – a Trump ally – has not yet given a public position on Salvini's proposal. On Tuesday, Germany’s health minister Karl Lauterbach said he hoped to convince President Trump to not leave the WHO, calling the decision a 'serious blow to the international fight against global health crises,' reported Reuters. Similarly, former EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said on Wednesday that the US’ withdrawal from WHO causes 'grave concern,' and hoped that 'this decision will be reconsidered for the benefit of millions of people around the world.' Current health commissioner Olivér Várhelyi, who is affiliated with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's Fidesz party, has not yet publicly commented on the US president’s decision to withdraw.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12_6JRaz_A9-4	2025-01-24T16:07:11-08:00	
The West Needs To Take A Hard Look At Georgian Dream’s Propaganda...	By Luke Linich (Eurasianet) -- In confronting daily anti-government protests, the ruling Georgian Dream party in Tbilisi has fashioned itself as a bulwark against what its leaders describe as liberal fascism. That many Georgians buy into the double-think notion of Lockean tyranny is a testament to the effectiveness of anti-Western, Russian-style propaganda which is the staple of Georgian Dream-aligned media outlets today. For most of the 21st century, Georgia prioritized integration with the West, even enshrining a commitment to seek membership in the European Union in the country’s constitution. But Georgian Dream over the past 18 months has reversed course, adopting illiberal legislation, such as the ‘foreign agents’ law, which critics say can be manipulated to muzzle watchdogs and dissent. At the same time, pro-government media outlets, including Imedi TV, have fed citizens a steady diet of slanted anti-Western coverage, fueling societal polarization. An egregious, but not unusual example of Imedi disinformation was a social media postDecember 9 on its branded channel accusing pro-EUprotesters of purposefully burning a coffin containing a likeness of Jesus Christ. In reality, the crowd was burning an effigy of Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili. The Imedi post cast the protest and its participants enemies of core Georgian values. Opinion polling conducted by the International Republican Institute in 2023 highlighted the polarization trend. Georgia suffered a disastrous defeat in its five-day fight against Russia in 2008, and Russia occupies the Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, yet IRI polling found that one third of respondents support 'further dialogue' with Moscow with another third opposed. The results also showed that almost three-quarters of Georgians favored EU membership, even though it seems many believe Georgian Dream-propagated arguments that Western values are at odds with Georgian traditions, and that EU integration would threaten Georgian sovereignty and culture. In late 2024, shortly after Georgian Dream claimed a mandate to govern in what observers described as heavily manipulated parliamentary elections, party leaders suspended EU integration efforts. This brazen move to ignore the constitutional mandate and popular will, steering the country away from the West and back into Russia’s orbit, prompted mass protests across the country that have gone on for almost two months. The polarization of society has accelerated since the start of fall protests, with support for EU integration equally met by those who justify GD officials’ u-turn and their use of force against protesters. Georgia’s ideological transformation has real consequences for its citizens. It has had a profound impact on my own family. As someone with an American father and a Georgian mother, I have witnessed Georgia’s evolving attitudes firsthand. My father, renowned for his work in Georgian polyphonic music, once helped symbolize strong Georgian-American ties. In the late 2000s, my family participated in the Chveneburebi Festivals, an initiative by then-president Mikheil Saakashvili to promote Georgian culture domestically and abroad. At the time, our Americanness was celebrated as a bridge connecting Georgia to the West. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this admiration has faded. A relative who once cherished our American connection now accuses us of being enemies of Georgia and products of a 'sinful union.' On a recent visit to a church near Chiatura, my father encountered a priest who declared Westerners unwelcome—an unprecedentedly hostile gesture never previously experienced in the 30 years of my parents’ marriage. Such incidents aren’t limited to my own family’s experience. A viral 2024 video showed a priest at TbilisiHoly TrinityChurch verbally assaulting a Georgian-American visitor, calling him a 'Soros Agent' out to destroy Georgian traditions. There are many more examples of anti-Western rhetoric and actions, an odd juxtaposition considering former US president George W. Bush, the only US leader to have visited Tbilisi, still has a street named after him in the Georgian capital. The outcome of Georgia’s current political crisis remains uncertain. Protesters are pushing for a new parliamentary vote. In a genuinely fair election, Georgian Dream’s ability to remain in power is no sure thing. But anti-government forces appear to lack the strength to compel Georgian Dream to accede to their demand; at the same time, incumbent authorities, despite the widespread use of brutal police tactics, lack the muscle to sweep the protesters off the streets. As the crisis grinds toward a denouement, one thing is certain: mass media will exert heavy influence in shaping citizens’ views. Those wanting to see Georgia get back on a Western track need to face up to the fact that Georgian Dream’s skillful use of Russian-style messaging has had, and will continue to have a significant, even decisive impact on public opinion. State-aligned media’s constant portrayal of the West as a cultural and moral threat deepens feelings of alienation among Georgian from the West and nudges the country closer to its authoritarian, historical enemy, Russia. The stakes are enormous. Losing Georgia to Russian influence would mean the collapse of one of the most promising experiments in post-Soviet democratization, as well as a strategic setback for the West. It would embolden Russia’s ideological warfare across the region and encourage more ideological expansion, undermining efforts to promote rules-based economic and political systems in the post-Soviet space. Georgian Dream’s chief purveyors of propaganda, including those in charge of Imedi TV and PostTV, should face sanctions and other punishments for spreading disinformation. In addition, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, could take a stand against the willful distribution of disinformation on its platform by banning Imedi, PostTV and other disseminators of untruths. Such action could have a considerable impact, given that many Georgians obtain their news from social media. Georgian Dream’s disinformation operation should not be given more space and time to warp public attitudes.

You’re On Your Own, Tony – OpEd	Outgoing president Joe Biden may have given former NIAID Director Anthony Fauci a 'pass' in the form of a pre-emptive pardon for any crime he may have committed, including creating or spreading 'Covid 19,' but he wasn’t able to keep the discredited former bureaucrat in the style in which he had become accustomed. Just hours after US Sen, Rand Paul (R-KY) provided the necessary documentation and argumentation to end Fauci’s lavish perks… Screenshot …President Donald Trump has pulled the plug on Fauci’s 24/7 limo and security detail, which has cost the US taxpayer an estimated $15 million since 2022. This indignity for the man once known as 'The Science' may not be the final one he suffers. As Constitutional Scholar Jonathan Turley has written, these 11th hour pardons may be a double-edged sword as Congress can subpoena Fauci or any other recipient of Biden’s largesse and under oath – i.e. under penalty of prosecution – question any of them on their past activities. They will not be able to plead the Fifth Amendment because they would be in no danger of self-incrimination having already received a pardon. Senator Paul has on many occasions accused Fauci of lying to the US Senate while under oath and with his newfound authority as Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee he is in a unique position to get to the bottom of the Fauci business. We are at the moment stocking up on popcorn. In the meantime, someone needs to let Fauci know that while it may not compare to having a 24/7 limo at your beck and call, Uber Black does provide luxury vehicles to those with more discerning tastes… This article was published at Ron Paul Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12_nYK1so0SVc	2025-01-24T15:59:50-08:00	
EU Suspends Visa-Free Regime For Georgian Diplomats	Permanent representatives of the European Union's 27 member states decided on Friday to temporarily suspend the visa-free regime for holders of Georgian diplomatic passports, TASS reported citing a source from one of the EU Council delegations. 'Yes, permanent representatives reached an agreement this morning to suspend the visa-free regime for Georgian diplomatic passports,' the source said. According to the diplomat, the decision must still be formally approved by the EU Council, which could happen at the upcoming meeting of the 27 foreign ministers scheduled for January 27. On December 20, the European Commission officially proposed suspending the visa-free regime for Georgian officials and diplomats, citing increasing diplomatic setbacks in the country. Meanwhile, parliamentary elections held in Georgia on October 26 have heightened domestic political tensions. According to official results from the Central Election Commission, the ruling party 'Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia' secured 53.93% of the vote, winning 89 out of 150 parliamentary seats. However, four opposition parties that surpassed the 5% threshold refused to recognize the election results, claiming they were rigged. Since November 4, opposition leaders have been organizing protests.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC120ZWHIOukhKO	2025-01-24T15:58:12-08:00	
Analyzing Trump’s Inauguration Ceremony Through Facial Expression...	By Zhao Zhijiang Under the watchful eyes of many, Donald Trump recently took the oath of office as the 47th President of the United States in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. In his inaugural speech, he proclaimed to the world that America has entered a 'golden age', and that he was saved by God to 'make America great again'. The message Trump aimed to convey was simple: America would return to common sense, prioritize domestic affairs, and become great once again. In his speech, Trump also outlined a very detailed to-do list, previewing the series of policies that the new administration would pursue. Compared to his first inaugural address eight years ago, which was filled with anger with wordings like 'American carnage', this speech was more positive and optimistic, filled with hope for the future. Amidst the cheers, Trump 2.0 has truly arrived. The entire world has already watched this ceremony, and everyone has their own thoughts and feelings. The media, experts, and various individuals are all interpreting and commenting on Trump's speech, predicting America's 'grand plan'. For them, every word spoken by Trump and his aides could contain important signals that need to be carefully and promptly analyzed. However, a senior researcher at ANBOUND believes that too much focus has been misplaced on what Trump and his associates said. What is more important is to approach it from different angles and information points, such as facial expressions, relationships, and body language, so as to deduce the development trends of the Trump team and the longer-term future. Trump's inauguration ceremony was a indeed grand stage showcasing political group portrait. Whether it was American politicians, tech giants, or influential figures like Argentina's Javier Milei, all were displaying themselves through their expressions, attitudes, and body language. Their facial expressions, postures, gestures, distance, and interactions with others are often overlooked by the outside world, but they provide crucial clues for making predictions and discoveries. JD Vance's interaction with Trump is a great example. By carefully observing their interaction, one can see that Trump behaves like a godfather while Vance, wearing a bright red tie, has clearly adapted to this dynamic as the 'underling'. After entering the scene, they appeared very close, with only Trump's youngest son Barron Trump standing nearby. Even after sitting down, they continued to whisper to each other. During this time, even when they were not speaking, Vance could be seen sitting attentively, always ready to respond to Trump. Researchers at ANBOUND believe that these details suggest Trump has not built a typical government team but rather a political team loyal to him. It can be inferred that, given Vance's proper positioning, their cooperation will likely be smooth over the next four years. This strong partnership will lay a solid foundation for Vance's future political career. It should be noted that although Vance had previously criticized his 'current boss' on social media, he has clearly evolved into an ideal Trumpist. Four or eight years from now, he will be more mature and could potentially inherit Trump's position, becoming the next Republican president of the United States. Based on their interaction during the inauguration, this prediction of a 'President Vance' seems quite logical and plausible. For China, this is also a major challenge. It means that Trumpism will become long-lasting, likely to be the dominant theme in the U.S. for a long period of time. The opposing voices from the establishment, such as liberalism and progressivism, will weaken over time. This will lead to a new political landscape in the world. Looking ahead, it is expected that conservative politics in Europe will also take the stage, and the global space will become more fragmented. The wave of conservatism will sweep the world, not just the United States. In this situation, China faces both opportunities and challenges. Even though the future may be harsh, it would be wise for China to continue exporting as a channel for economic growth. As long as demand exists and products are competitive, exports will continue. In fact, 'exports' are currently the only thing China has that has a real influence internationally. In the global trade game, even though China will face long-term economic populism from the West, it should not fall into the trap of trade extremism. Back to the inauguration ceremony, aside from the interaction and body language between Vance and Trump, another important figure's performance is worth noting: the current Secretary of State, Marco Rubio. The Secretary of State is the most important position in the U.S. government, equivalent to a 'foreign minister' in other countries, but the U.S. Secretary of State wields greater power, oversees a broader range of responsibilities, and holds a more influential political status. According to the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, if the President vacates the office, the Vice President, Speaker of the House, President pro tempore of the Senate, Secretary of State, and key cabinet members follow in succession. The Secretary of State ranks fourth in this order, underscoring their importance. However, what is odd is that throughout the entire inauguration ceremony, Rubio's whereabouts were unknown. U.S. media reports and related information confirm that Rubio attended Trump's inauguration, but at no point during the event was there any visible communication or interaction between Trump and Rubio. What is the implication of this? Rubio is a person with political ambitions. He comes across as someone who is dissatisfied and has his own independent views. Rubio and Trump also have a history of conflict. In 2016, he criticized Trump and called him a 'con artist' who had hijacked the conservative movement. Trump, in turn, mocked Rubio for wearing makeup and called him a 'nervous basket case' who perspires too much. Based on this past history and the events at the inauguration, it can be roughly inferred that there may be some issues in the future regarding the cooperation between Rubio and Trump. Unlike Vance, who relies on Trump, Rubio's political base is in the Senate, and his appointment as Secretary of State was approved with zero opposition votes in the Senate. Therefore, ANBOUND believes that the relationship between Rubio and Trump could face various problems down the line. Rubio and Trump may have disagreements, and it is even possible that Rubio might not complete his term due to such conflicts. Similar situations have occurred before. In 2018, Trump nominated then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. Trump complained that he and Tillerson had differing views on many issues and that their ideologies were completely incompatible. He was dissatisfied with Tillerson's 'establishment' style and felt he had made a wrong choice initially. The two disagreed on major issues such as climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, North Korea, and U.S. Middle East policy. A similar situation could occur with Rubio as well. When it comes to building his team, Trump is likely to make changes in batches. The individuals chosen this time may have their positions replaced in one or two years. Therefore, it's uncertain whether Rubio will serve a full four years as Secretary of State. From the information available, it appears that Rubio and Trump do not share consistent attitudes or views. Rubio clearly has his own ideas and is only maintaining a superficial alignment with Trump for the time being. From China's perspective, it may be better to avoid direct face-to-face meetings with Rubio. The most important thing is to seek direct talks with higher-level figures, such as Trump himself, so that Rubio's attitude and position will no longer matter. Some might say that focusing on body language and facial expressions is making groundless associations. Yet, this is a legitimate method of information analysis; it just manifests in behavioral science. It is not dissimilar to how businesses use behavioral science to understand preferences, actions, and consumption patterns. Marketers do this, as do policy departments. Information analysis sometimes seems a bit mysterious, but that is exactly how it works. Final analysis conclusion: The whole world has seen Trump's inauguration ceremony, but focusing solely on the speech is far from sufficient. On this political stage, everyone has their own performance. By observing facial expressions, postures, gestures, and interactions among people, we can gain insights into the development trends of Trump's team and make predictions about the more distant future.

No Room For Illness: Myanmar Migrants’ Silent Struggle in Thailan...	By Dr. Htet Khaing Min Myanmar refugees in Thailand face hardship and uncertainty, struggling with poverty, discrimination, and the constant fear of deportation, all while their access to healthcare remains limited. Key Takeaways Myanmar migrants in Thailand face financial, legal, and language barriers that restrict access to healthcare. Limited healthcare access for migrants worsens issues like malaria, TB, and maternal health, impacting migrants and Thailand's healthcare system. Expanding insurance, improving rural care, addressing language barriers, and ensuring legal protections are vital for migrant health and Thailand’s public health. As of 2024, over 4.18 million Myanmar migrants reside in Thailand, many in irregular status, working in low-wage sectors like agriculture and construction. These migrants face significant barriers to healthcare, impacting both their well-being and Thailand’s public health system. This article explores the healthcare-seeking behavior of Myanmar migrant workers, the challenges they face, and the broader implications for Thailand’s healthcare system. 1. Background of Migration Myanmar migrants make up one of Thailand’s most significant foreign worker populations, driven by economic instability, political turmoil, and ethnic conflicts, especially after Myanmar’s 2021 military coup. While 90,000 refugees live in border camps, millions live outside in precarious conditions. Around 1.8 million migrants are in irregular status, facing exploitation and limited access to essential services, including healthcare. Migrants enter Thailand through formal channels like MoU agreements or informal routes. While MoU workers have some legal protections, irregular migrants face significant barriers to healthcare and social services. 2. Current Migrant Healthcare Landscape in Thailand To understand the migrant healthcare system in Thailand, it is essential to examine the broader landscape of the healthcare system first. While Thailand boasts a dual healthcare system comprising public and private sectors, access to these services remains challenging for many migrants. 2.1 Private Healthcare: Costly and Out of Reach Thailand’s private healthcare sector offers high-quality services but at a steep cost. General practitioner consultations range from $30 to $80, while specialist consultations cost between $45 and $120, excluding additional hospital, treatment, and transportation charges. For migrant workers earning an average monthly income of $290 to $320, private healthcare is largely unaffordable. Additionally, medical expenses in Thailand, which have been steadily rising since 2020, are expected to climb by an additional 15% in 2025. And these rising medical costs worsen healthcare access for underpaid migrant workers. Low wages make quality care unattainable, and unresolved pay issues heighten barriers. Addressing wage inequality and improving healthcare affordability is essential to protect the well-being of vulnerable migrants. 2.2. Public Healthcare: Affordable but Limited The public sector, including government hospitals and clinics, provides cost-friendly healthcare options. However, irregular migrants face significant barriers due to their legal status. Fear of deportation or arrest often deters them from seeking care at public facilities. Language and cultural differences further complicate their access to essential services. 2.3. Insurance Schemes and Their Shortcomings To address these challenges, Thailand has introduced several health insurance schemes over the years, including Social Security Fund (SSF) (1991), Workman’s Compensation Fund (WCF) (1994), Migrant Health Insurance Scheme (MHIS) (1998), Migrant-Fund (M-Fund) (2017), and Health Insurance for Non-Thai People (HINT) (2024). While these schemes aim to provide coverage, their impact has been limited. The SSF, WCF, and MHIS cater primarily to specific employment sectors and exclude undocumented migrants. The M-Fund and HINT are designed to address these gaps, offering access to irregular migrants. However, challenges remain in raising awareness among migrants about these schemes and ensuring they understand how to utilize the benefits effectively. 2.4. Rural and Border Areas: A Greater Challenge Healthcare access is even more restricted in rural and border areas, where many migrants reside. Free clinics run by NGOs and INGOs, such as the Mae Tao Clinic, World Vision, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), fill healthcare gaps. However, these services are often insufficient to meet the growing demand. 2.5. Migrant Health Volunteers: Bridging the Gap Migrant Health Volunteers (MHVs) connect migrants to healthcare services, particularly in remote regions. Working alongside local NGOs, MHVs raise awareness about available services and rights as a crucial link between migrants and healthcare providers. 3. Impact of Migration on Thailand's Public Health Sectors The recent surge of migrants from Myanmar into Thailand, especially after Myanmar’s February 2024 conscription law, has raised concerns in Thailand’s public health sector, with challenges in disease prevention, healthcare coverage, and achieving a sustainable healthcare system. Key health concerns include: Malaria: Migrants in border provinces like Tak face heightened malaria risks due to limited access to prevention and healthcare services. In 2023, Thailand reported nearly 17,000 malaria cases, a sharp rise from 9,989 in 2022, with 42% imported from neighboring countries, primarily Myanmar. Tak province, a hotspot for malaria, accounted for over half of these cases, experiencing sporadic outbreaks. Challenges in addressing malaria among migrants include their mobility, remote living conditions, and social barriers such as isolation, discrimination, and limited community integration. Tuberculosis (TB): TB remains a critical issue for migrant workers in Thailand, especially in border regions with rising cases and drug-resistant strains. In 2023, TB incidence increased to 157 per 100,000 from 143 per 100,000 in 2021. Tailored community programs integrating TB, HIV/AIDS, and maternal health services can improve education, diagnosis, and treatment adherence. HIV and Syphilis: Unsafe sexual practices and inadequate access to sexual health education have led to elevated rates of HIV and syphilis among migrant populations in Thailand. Research shows that migrants from neighboring countries face an HIV prevalence up to four times higher than that of the general Thai population. Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Health (MNCH): Migrant women, especially those with irregular status, face numerous obstacles in accessing maternal care and sexual health services. Financial constraints, limited MHIS coverage, and discrimination, including refusal to renew MHIS during pregnancy, exacerbate these challenges. Fear of deportation and high healthcare costs often force undocumented pregnant women to choose unsafe home births over essential hospital services. Vaccination: Immunization rates among migrant children in Thailand, particularly those from Myanmar, remain suboptimal. The lack of access to routine vaccination services is exacerbated by irregular migration status, geographical isolation, and language barriers. 4. Limitations in Access to Healthcare Despite the availability of healthcare resources, Myanmar migrants in Thailand face numerous challenges in accessing adequate medical care. These barriers are multifaceted, rooted in policy gaps, socioeconomic factors, and legal constraints, creating a complex landscape for healthcare access. 4.1. Policy Gaps and Financial Barriers Eligibility for social protection programs like the Social Security Fund (SSF) and Workmen’s Compensation Fund (WCF) is often tied to specific employment sectors and statuses, leaving many migrants without coverage. Data from the Thailand Migration Report 2024 reveals that as of February 2024, only 51% of migrants were enrolled in a health insurance scheme, indicating that nearly half of eligible workers lack health insurance. For those without coverage, the steep upfront costs of healthcare services significantly deter seeking timely medical attention. This financial strain is particularly severe for irregular migrants, who face disproportionate challenges in accessing affordable care. 4.2. Geographical and Gender-Based Challenges Migrants in remote or border regions face significant healthcare access challenges, with long travel distances adding financial and time burdens. Female migrant workers, especially those in domestic roles, encounter additional barriers, such as clinic hours conflicting with work schedules, unwelcoming attitudes from healthcare providers, and clinic distances. These factors limit their access to essential sexual and reproductive health services, exacerbating gender-based health disparities. 4.3. Socioeconomic and Legal Factors A significant portion of Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand earn below the minimum wage, with 37% earning less. Women earn an average of 350 THB per day, compared to 400 THB for men, and migrants in provinces like Tak earn even less. These low wages make healthcare and insurance unaffordable, while limited education leaves many unaware of their health rights, contributing to the underutilization of healthcare services. 4.4. Language Barriers and Communication Challenges Language barriers are a critical challenge for migrant workers in accessing healthcare, leading to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and delayed treatment. Without adequate language support, many migrants resort to drug stores for minor ailments, risking improper medication. The lack of translators in healthcare facilities further exacerbates these communication issues, limiting access to essential care. 4.5. Fear of Legal Repercussions Fear of legal repercussions is a significant barrier for irregular migrants in Thailand seeking healthcare. Many avoid medical facilities to prevent arrest or deportation, leaving health issues unaddressed. Without legal status, they rely on health posts or free clinics but face risks of arrest or bribery near official healthcare services, perpetuating mistrust and inadequate care. 5. Conclusions and Recommendations The healthcare challenges faced by Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand are multifaceted, involving a complex interplay of legal, financial, geographic, and socio-cultural factors. To improve access to healthcare, Thailand must address the systemic barriers hindering migrant workers' access to essential services. Key recommendations include: Enhancing Health Insurance Coverage: Expanding migrant health insurance schemes to cover all migrant workers, regardless of their legal status, is essential. Increasing Awareness and Outreach: Expanding awareness campaigns and outreach programs targeting migrant communities, especially in remote areas, can help increase knowledge of available healthcare services. Improving Healthcare Infrastructure in Rural Areas: Expanding healthcare facilities in rural and border regions and providing mobile health units will help bridge the access gap. Addressing Language Barriers: Increasing the availability of translators and culturally sensitive healthcare services will improve communication and reduce misunderstandings. Strengthening Legal Protections: Reducing the fear of deportation by strengthening legal protections for migrants seeking healthcare will encourage timely treatment and reduce the burden of preventable diseases. In conclusion, addressing the healthcare needs of Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand is not only a moral imperative but also essential for safeguarding public health. By addressing these challenges through comprehensive policy changes, Thailand can ensure that all workers, regardless of their legal status, have the healthcare they need to lead healthy, productive lives. It can also help Thailand build a more inclusive and sustainable healthcare system that benefits migrants and the broader population.

Moscow And Minsk Attack Catholicism To Defend Lukashenka And Russ...	Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka has long viewed Roman Catholics, who form 9-14 percent of the Belarusian population, with hostility and suspicion, given their opposition to his candidacy in 2020 (Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, September 5, 2020; see EDM, December 22, 2020). This perception persists despite relatively good official ties with the Vatican, one of the few foreign states willing to receive him (Fondsk.ru, January 9). Now, Lukashenka has launched a broad attack on Catholics and Catholicism in advance of his sham re-election scheduled for January 26, 2025. That crackdown has been widespread and harsh, with the number of Catholic parishes in Belarus declining and ever more priests sentenced to as much as 11 years in prison for 'treason' (Belstat, December 31, 2024; The Tablet, January 22). Moscow has joined this effort not only to help Lukashenka but also to defend Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 'Russian world' (Russkiy Mir; Русский мир) and challenge efforts inside Belarus to seek autocephaly (self-governance) for the Belarusian Orthodox Church as well. That last concern has also led officials in both capitals to attack the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople and Uniatism (sometimes referred to as Eastern Catholicism) in Belarus, Ukraine, and elsewhere (Fondsk.ru, January 9; Rubaltic.ru, January 19). At least some of these efforts will probably ebb after Lukashenka is safely 're-elected,' but Russian and Belarusian hostility toward Roman Catholicism makes it unlikely that these efforts will disappear altogether. For example, one Russian commentator has gone so far as to say that Roman Catholics are just as 'extremist' as the Jehovah’s Witnesses, which have been the subject of the longest and harshest anti-religious campaign in recent Russian history (Materik.ru, June 25, 2020). Even authoritarian states have found that it is much easier to stoke such hostility than it is to snuff it out. Due to this, Russian-Belarusian official anti-Catholicism will further exacerbate problems between Moscow and Minsk, on the one hand, and Western capitals, on the other. Relations between the two Slavic states and Roman Catholicism have long been fraught and have only been exacerbated by recent events. The story of medieval Russian Prince Aleksandr Nevsky’s relationship to Catholicism is present in modern Russian and Belarusian perceptions of the religion. Nevsky made an alliance with the Mongols because he was fighting against not only the Teutonic knights but also Roman Catholic missionaries whom they believe wanted to convert Russians from Orthodoxy and place them under the control of the Pope (Epiphany Cathedral in Elokhov, September 11, 2019). Putin ideologists, since the start of Putin’s expanded invasion of Ukraine, have frequently repeated that argument (Ritm Eurasia, April 22, 2024). That historical memory may be less important at present than the relations between Catholics in Belarus and their co-religionists in Ukraine and how these relations are viewed in Minsk and Moscow. The Belarusian Greek Catholic Church is closely connected with the Greek Catholics (Uniates) of Ukraine, as Russian and Belarusian commentators are now given to repeating (Rubaltic.ru, January 19). Many of its priests were trained in western Ukraine, and unsurprisingly, they and their flocks have supported Ukraine since Putin launched his expanded invasion in February 2022, which is yet another reason for Moscow’s opposition to Catholicism in Belarus. (On these interrelationships, which undoubtedly inform fears among Belarusian and Russian officials, see EurAsia Daily, April 7, 2023; Dekoder, January 24, 2024.) Minsk and Moscow are inclined to view the Belarusian Catholics, therefore, as 'a fifth column,' a group that could pose an immediate challenge to the Belarusian regime and its Russian ally. In line with this view, Minsk has adopted new laws affording the government greater powers to interfere and limit the growth of Roman Catholicism in Belarus, which moves Moscow’s support (Legislation of CIS Countries, December 20, 2023). Yet another issue animates this anti-Catholic campaign, although it may seem far removed. Both Minsk and Moscow are worried that some within the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is officially an exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus under the Moscow Patriarchate, may seek to become independent of Moscow. This would involve gaining autocephaly as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church did in 2019 with the blessing of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople (see EDM, August 12, 2021). Several Belarusian Orthodox priests have fled to Lithuania and been taken under that patriarchate’s protection (Window on Eurasia, March 24, 2023). Neither the Roman Catholics of Belarus nor the Vatican have any involvement with such moves. Russian and Belarusian commentators, however, are convinced that this drive is part of a broader Western effort to break ties between Belarus and Russia and project Western power more deeply into 'the Russian world.' Consequently, such commentators argue that the actions of those seeking autocephaly are simply allies of the Roman Catholics and that Minsk and Moscow must attack both or face the prospect of the West stealing another march on 'the Russian world' (Rubaltic.ru, January 19). Many are likely to assume that this Belarusian-Russian attack on Roman Catholicism, however distasteful it may be, will not matter very much now that the world appears to be entering into a more tough-minded 'realist' approach to international relations. Even in recent years, there has been a decline in attention to those who are victimized by the Belarusian or Russian state for religious reasons. The anti-Catholicism of Belarus and Russia, however, is different and likely to have other consequences in international relations. On the one hand, however dismissive realists may be about the power of the Pope, the Vatican, both directly and through its networks of bishops, is able to attract far more attention to the repression of its followers. Similarly, objections from the Vatican are able to have an outsized impact on the countries where Catholics are numerous and followers of that denomination are found in the leading ranks of the realists. On the other hand, it is now obvious to an increasing number of people in the West that anti-Catholicism in Belarus and Russia is a euphemism for anti-Westernism. To the extent that that understanding spreads, it will be more difficult for Western leaders to ignore attacks on Catholics in the two Slavic countries, however 'realist' they profess to be. Consequently, Western leaders are unlikely to be able to dismiss what Minsk and Moscow are saying about—and doing to—Catholics. This makes it likely that the current attacks will cast not only a dark but a long shadow on the future.

Rebuilding Syria’s Infrastructure A Critical Priority – Analysis	Rebuilding Syria’s infrastructure is a monumental task that must be prioritized by the new government following the fall of the Assad regime. After nearly 14 years of protracted conflict, the country faces an overwhelming challenge in restoring its basic services, industries and economy. The devastation wreaked by war has left much of Syria's infrastructure in ruins, with cities like Aleppo and Homs bearing many scars. Roads, bridges, hospitals, schools and power plants have been destroyed, leaving millions of Syrians without access to essential services. Understanding how Syria came to be in this dire state underscores the urgency of focusing on reconstruction. The conflict, which began in 2011, was a multifaceted war involving numerous factions, foreign interventions and devastating humanitarian consequences. The relentless fighting, airstrikes and sieges obliterated industrial zones, agricultural land and public infrastructure. Urban centers, once vibrant hubs of economic activity, have been reduced to rubble. Nearly half of Syria's population has been displaced, either internally or externally, creating a refugee crisis that has strained neighboring countries and Europe. The collapse of infrastructure has compounded the suffering, with limited access to clean water, electricity and healthcare further exacerbating the dire living conditions. Prioritizing the reconstruction of infrastructure is essential for Syria’s recovery. It will not only address the immediate needs of the population but also serve as a foundation for economic revival and social stability. Rebuilding transport networks, for instance, will enable the movement of goods and people, revitalizing trade and commerce. Restoring energy facilities will provide electricity to households and businesses, jumpstarting production and creating jobs. Reviving water and sanitation systems will improve public health, reducing the spread of diseases and enabling communities to rebuild their lives. Beyond the practical benefits, infrastructure reconstruction holds symbolic value. It signifies a commitment to rebuilding the nation and restoring normality after years of devastation. It also fosters a sense of unity and shared purpose, as communities come together to rebuild their towns and cities. For a nation emerging from conflict, such collective efforts can contribute to healing and reconciliation, laying the groundwork for a more cohesive society. The issue of sanctions, however, remains a significant obstacle to Syria’s recovery. Many Arab countries have urged the West to lift the sanctions on Damascus, recognizing that these restrictions hinder reconstruction efforts. While the sanctions were imposed to pressure the Assad regime, they also impede the delivery of humanitarian aid and the rebuilding of critical infrastructure. Sanctions limit access to financial resources, restrict trade and deter foreign investment, all of which are essential for recovery. Lifting or easing the sanctions would enable the new government to access international funding, procure construction materials and attract foreign expertise. Rebuilding Syria’s infrastructure also requires a multipronged approach from the new leadership. Political stability is a prerequisite for attracting investment and securing international support. The government must demonstrate a commitment to democratic principles, human rights and transparent governance. This will not only gain the trust of the Syrian people but also encourage the international community to engage constructively in the country’s recovery. Public-private partnerships can play a crucial role in accelerating reconstruction by involving private enterprises in projects such as energy production, transport and housing. This collaboration can harness additional resources and expertise, ensuring efficient rebuilding efforts. Syria also has an opportunity to invest in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. With its traditional energy infrastructure heavily damaged, renewable energy projects can address electricity shortages while positioning Syria for a more sustainable and energy-independent future. Countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, with their expertise in renewable energy, could provide valuable support in this area. Combating corruption is another critical aspect of reconstruction. Corruption has historically plagued Syria and rebuilding efforts must include strict measures to ensure transparency and accountability. Reconstruction funds must be utilized effectively, reaching intended projects without mismanagement or diversion. Capacity-building is equally important, as rebuilding infrastructure requires a skilled workforce. Investments in education and vocational training can equip Syrians with the necessary skills for construction, engineering and technology-related fields. This not only supports reconstruction efforts but also reduces unemployment and helps reintegrate displaced persons and former combatants into the workforce. Rebuilding Syria’s infrastructure will have transformative benefits for the nation. It will reestablish Syria as a functional state capable of engaging meaningfully in regional and global affairs. A strong infrastructure supports internal development and would position Syria as a potential trade hub, given its strategic location at the crossroads of the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Improved transport networks can facilitate regional trade and foster economic interdependence with neighboring countries, creating mutual benefits that contribute to long-term peace and stability. The reconstruction of housing, schools and healthcare facilities will also help address the needs of millions of displaced Syrians, both internally and externally. Providing safe housing and essential services will encourage refugees to return, aiding the country’s demographic recovery and workforce replenishment. International organizations such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees have expressed a willingness to collaborate with Syria’s new leadership to support the safe repatriation and reintegration of refugees. The advocacy of Arab nations for lifting sanctions reflects a growing regional consensus on the need to assist Syria’s recovery. Countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan have not only called for the easing of Western-imposed restrictions but have also shown an interest in participating in reconstruction efforts. In conclusion, rebuilding Syria’s infrastructure is not just a logistical challenge, it is a moral and strategic imperative that will define the nation’s future. Prioritizing infrastructure reconstruction will be critical for economic revitalization, social stability and national unity. However, this task requires significant international cooperation, the lifting of sanctions and the establishment of a stable and transparent political environment. The new Syrian government has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to the country’s recovery by enacting reforms that attract investment, ensuring accountability in reconstruction efforts and fostering partnerships with regional and global stakeholders. For the international community, supporting Syria’s rebuilding process is not just an act of humanitarian goodwill but also an investment in regional and global stability. As the new leadership embarks on this monumental task, the rebuilding of Syria’s infrastructure will serve as a cornerstone of its transition from a war-torn nation to a thriving, resilient state.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDcyxgupxNIXBc	2025-01-23T17:33:39-08:00	
Dr. Anthony Fauci: What Exactly Did Biden Pardon? – OpEd	On his way out of the White House on Jan. 20, Joe Biden issued a preemptive pardon for, among others, his chief medical advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci. The week before, the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) took action that will help the nation recover from Dr. Fauci’s COVID regime. HHS blocked the EcoHealth Alliance and its former president Peter Daszak from receiving any federal funds for a period of five years. Some representatives wanted a permanent ban, and they had a strong case. EcoHealth was Dr. Fauci’s conduit to fund the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) to conduct gain-of-function (GOF) research, banned by the United States in 2014, which makes viruses more lethal and transmissible. The WIV, a collaborator with China’s military, had received a cargo of deadly pathogens courtesy of Dr. Qiu Xiangguo, the Chinese national who headed the pathogens program at Canada’s National Microbiological Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg. In 2017-18, Dr. Qiu made at least five trips to the WIV, which collaborated closely with the Galveston National Laboratory (GNL), a creation of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which Dr. Fauci headed from 1984 to 2023. Despite the activity and connections, Dr. Fauci and Daszak maintained that the COVID virus arose naturally in the wild. When medical scientists found evidence of a laboratory origin, Dr. Fauci smeared them as 'conspiracy theorists.' CDC director Robert Redfield even got death threats. In 2020, Dr. Fauci imposed a draconian regime, shutting down schools, even though children were the least vulnerable group. The medical scientists of the Great Barrington Declaration(GBD), including Stanford medical professor Dr. Jay Battacharya, made a case for a more open and humane policy. NIH director Francis Collins smeared these scientists as 'fringe epidemiologists' and tasked Dr. Fauci with a 'devastating takedown' of the GBD group, most if not all more qualified than Fauci and Collins. Dr. Anthony Fauci’s bio shows no advanced degrees in molecular biology or biochemistry, and Nobel laureate Kary Mullis, inventor of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, was on record that Fauci 'should not be in a position like he’s in.' When critics took him to task, Dr. Fauci claimed they were attacking science itself. Sen. Rand Paul, a medical doctor, charged that Fauci had lied to Congress about funding GOF in Wuhan but the Biden Department of Justice rejected two criminal referrals. Never held to account, the NIAID boss announced his retirement in late 2022 but he continued to receive a government-funded security and a transportation detail. In 2023, Sen. Paul authored Deception: The Great Covid Cover-up, which prompted no action from the Biden Justice Department. In December 2024, Dr. Fauci authored a paper claiming that AIDS, like the COVID virus, was 'zoonotic,' arising naturally apart from human agency. This contradicted his previous claim that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was the sole cause of AIDS, which had no animal model. That same month, it emerged that Biden was considering a preemptive pardon for Dr. Fauci. Such a pardon, according to Sen. Paul, will 'seal his fate as the architect, author and godfather of the pandemic. He’s the one who funded it. He’s the one who funded the research in Wuhan. He’s the one that allowed the research not to be scrutinized.' Biden’s pardon cancels the prospect of criminal charges against Fauci, whose network remains in place. The head of bioethics for the NIH is Dr. Fauci’s wife Christine Grady. In her 1995 The Search For an AIDS Vaccine, Grady did not reveal that she had been married to Fauci for 10 years, a highly unethical act of deception. In that book Grady promotes the highly caustic AZT, Fauci’s drug of choice for AIDS, and approves of drug tests on children and pregnant women. In 2012, when the NIH gave Grady the top bioethics job, the official NIH announcement made no mention of her book or her marriage to NIAID boss Dr. Fauci, a huge conflict of interest. Congressional investigators might ask Grady if her husband ever did anything with which she disagreed. That would include the funding of gain-of-function research at the WIV, sending seniors back into nursing homes, and mandating ineffective vaccines for children, the group least vulnerable to COVID. Consider also the current NIAID director Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a non-practicing physician and specialist in venereal disease. Like Dr. Fauci, her bio shows no advanced degrees in molecular biology or biochemistry, both vital for virology. During the pandemic, Dr. Marrazzo backed mask mandates and distancing rules that were simply made up and had nothing to do with science. If confirmed for NIH director, Dr. Jay Battacharya might get Marrazzo’s take on the Wuhan issue. If the Stanford professor decides to dismiss Marrazzo and Grady it would be hard to blame him. With Dr. Fauci pardoned, the structures and cadres of white coat supremacy must not be left in place. Rest assured that the people will be watching.

Biohacking: Key Legal, Moral And Commercial Considerations – Anal...	Biohacking is a rapidly growing movement that combines technology, biology, and self-experimentation to optimize human performance and well-being. It encompasses a range of practices, from genetic modifications and wearable technology to cognitive enhancement and nutritional interventions. In the European Union (EU), where health, technology, and data privacy regulations are extensive, the rise of biohacking challenges traditional legal and ethical boundaries and raises complex regulatory questions. While biohacking offers individuals unprecedented control over their physical and mental capabilities, it often operates on the fringes of legality, exploiting regulatory gaps. This article explores biohacking’s core practices and examines the legal frameworks, including treaties like the Oviedo Convention, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and other relevant EU policies, along with the regulatory loopholes that biohackers navigate and the broader implications for regulators and society. Defining the biohacking In traditional dictionaries, biohacking is often portrayed as a narrow and sometimes controversial practice. The Oxford English Dictionary, for instance, defines it as 'the activity of exploiting genetic material experimentally without regard to accepted ethical standards, or for criminal purposes' (Oxford English Dictionary). This definition emphasizes biohacking's potential for risk and unconventional methods of biological manipulation. Similarly, Merriam-Websterdescribes it as 'biological experimentation (as by gene editing or the use of drugs or implants) done to improve the qualities or capabilities of living organisms, especially by individuals and groups operating outside traditional medical or scientific research environments' (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). These definitions highlight biohacking as a self-directed, experimental practice typically conducted outside conventional scientific settings. For the purposes of this work, we will hereby operate with our own definition: externally induced, concealed gene (information hoovering, sequestrating, doctoring, and/or) intervention for non-transparent ends. (Bajrektarevic, 2010) Biohacking has evolved into a form of 'DIY biology,' where individuals — often outside institutional frameworks — apply biological science and technology to optimize their bodies and biological systems. According to Meyer (2020), biohacking thrives in peer production environments where knowledge and resources are openly shared, allowing individuals to take control of their biology through accessible tools, including wearable devices, supplements, and even genetic modification. This approach reflects a democratization of science that disrupts traditional boundaries between professional and amateur scientists, raising ethical concerns around safety, privacy, and regulation (Meyer 2020). As a grassroots movement, biohacking blends biology with principles of open science and DIY experimentation. Delfanti (2013) suggests that biohacking challenges conventional scientific hierarchies by emphasizing collaboration and open access to biological knowledge and tools. Biohackers frequently conduct experiments on themselves or their environments to push the limits of human biology, promoting a democratized science culture. This movement advocates for peer production and low-cost technologies as a form of resistance against proprietary, closed scientific systems (Delfanti 2013). Coenen et al. (2017) report that biohacking integrates diverse life sciences techniques beyond the confines of traditional academic and corporate research, further blurring the lines between professional and amateur scientists. While many biohacking techniques are health-focused, others pursue aesthetic, psychological, or even transhumanist objectives, exploring the extension of human capabilities through technology. Constituting elements Lifestyle optimization Lifestyle optimization in biohacking focuses on improving well-being through practical and measurable changes in daily routines. It targets areas such as diet, sleep, physical performance, and mental capacity, often using tools like wearable devices to track health metrics and guide adjustments. Popular methods include intermittent fasting, cold exposure, and the use of natural supplements. Diet is a fundamental aspect of biohacking. Approaches like intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets aim to enhance metabolism, reduce inflammation, and promote fat loss. Nutrigenomics, which examines the relationship between nutrients and gene expression, supports personalized dietary strategies that align with genetic predispositions, balancing hormones and improving overall health. Sleep quality is another priority. Biohackers use devices to monitor sleep patterns and test different techniques, such as adjusting room temperature, changing meal timings, or taking supplements like melatonin. Biohackers usually share their findings online, creating a collaborative community that exchanges ideas and refines methods for better rest. Physical enhancement often centers on strategies like High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which delivers significant physiological benefits through brief yet intense exercise sessions. Cognitive improvement is also a major focus, with methods that include mindfulness, neurostimulation, and the use of nootropics. Substances like caffeine and L-theanine enhance focus and reduce fatigue, while others, such as modafinil, improve memory, attention, and executive function, enabling sharper mental performance. DIY biology DIY biology represents a more experimental branch of biohacking, often involving community labs where enthusiasts use biological tools and techniques typically reserved for professional researchers. Examples include genetic manipulation, open-source insulin production (such as in the Open Insulin Project), or developing personalized medical treatments. One of the primary uses of DIY bio is genetic engineering, where individuals experiment with organisms like bacteria or yeast to modify genetic material. This can include projects like creating fluorescent bacteria or altering plants to produce new compounds. Meyer notes that technologies such as CRISPR have made gene editing more accessible to non-professional scientists, allowing for experimentation with genetic material at a relatively low cost (Meyer 2020). Grinders and transhumanism At the extreme end of the biohacking spectrum are individuals known as 'grinders' or DIY transhumanists. These biohackers embrace invasive procedures, including the implantation of electronic devices (such as microchips) to enhance sensory capabilities or monitor health data. Their goal is often to transcend biological limits, entering the realm of cyborgism. Ethical and regulatory concerns are prevalent in this area due to the experimental and sometimes dangerous nature of these modifications (Coenen 2017; The Medical Futurist 2024). Grinders push the boundaries of self-experimentation, frequently employing devices such as RFID chips for unlocking doors, magnets implanted in fingertips for sensing electromagnetic fields, or even more advanced biotechnologies aimed at enhancing sensory perception or communication capabilities. Fuisz emphasizes the lack of legal frameworks to address the potential risks or unintended consequences of these experiments. This lack of regulation presents both an opportunity for innovation and a potential hazard, as these practices exist outside the traditional boundaries of medical and scientific research (Fuisz 2017). Moral considerations and legal limitations The rapid rise of biohacking has sparked debates about its safety and the ethical implications of self-experimentation. While many biohackers claim that their efforts help to advance health technologies, others criticize the movement for lacking adequate regulatory oversight. For example, invasive body modifications raise concerns about safety, legality, and potential misuse. On the other hand, biohacking movements like DIY biology advocate for open access to scientific tools, which may contribute to more affordable healthcare solutions, such as producing cheaper medications like insulin (University of Southern California 2024). Currently, the tension between innovation and regulation in biohacking is widely discussed. Excessive regulation might stifle creativity and personal freedom, but too little might lead to widespread harm. The challenge is to strike a balance that allows biohackers to innovate while protecting public safety and ethical standards. This raises the question of whether new laws and regulations should be created specifically for biohacking, or whether existing medical and scientific frameworks are sufficient to address these concerns (Fuisz 2017). EU Regulatory framework The rapid growth of biohacking, particularly in DIY biology and personal health modification, has raised complex legal and ethical challenges within the EU. While biohacking itself is not explicitly addressed by a singular legal framework, its various practices intersect with numerous existing EU regulations. These frameworks—governing data protection, medical devices, genetic modification, and ethical biomedical research—indirectly regulate biohacking activities. As the line between personal experimentation and formal biomedical innovation blurs, it becomes essential to understand how EU regulations address the safety, privacy, and ethical considerations surrounding this emerging field. This chapter will explore the key EU treaties and directives that apply to biohacking, highlighting the specific legal provisions that biohackers must navigate to ensure compliance with EU standards. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 The General Data Protection Regulation is a cornerstone of EU law concerning the protection of personal data and privacy. Article 9 of the GDPR specifically addresses the 'Processing of special categories of personal data,' which includes biometric data used for uniquely identifying a person, as well as genetic data. Since many biohacking practices involve the collection and processing of such data—either for self-monitoring, health tracking, or experimentation—biohackers must comply with this provision. Article 9(1) generally prohibits the processing of these special categories of data unless the data subject has given explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a)) or the processing is necessary for medical diagnosis or scientific research (Article 9(2)(i)). Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 The Clinical Trials Regulation sets out specific requirements for conducting clinical trials involving human subjects. Article 28 of this regulation focuses on informed consent, mandating that participants must be fully informed of the objectives, risks, and benefits of the trial before they can participate. For biohackers engaging in any form of human experimentation, particularly in the realm of medical devices or novel health interventions, compliance with this article is essential to ensure that ethical standards are met. Furthermore, Article 35 establishes provisions for vulnerable populations, such as individuals with reduced autonomy, who may be more susceptible to harm from risky biohacking experiments. Medical Device Regulation (MDR) (EU) 2017/745 The Medical Device Regulation applies to all medical devices placed on the market within the EU, including those used in biohacking activities. Article 2(1) of the MDR defines a medical device as 'any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material, or other article' intended for medical purposes, such as diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of diseases. This regulation is relevant to biohackers who develop or modify devices for health enhancement or biomedical experimentation. Additionally, Article 5(1) of the MDR mandates that any device used in a medical context must comply with EU conformity assessment procedures, ensuring that the device is safe, effective, and bears a CE marking. Biotechnology Directive (Directive 98/44/EC) Biotechnology Directive governs the legal protection of biotechnological inventions in the EU. Articles 5 and 6 of the directive directly address the patentability of biotechnological inventions, particularly concerning genetic engineering. Article 5(1) states that 'The human body, at the various stages of its formation and development, and the simple discovery of one of its elements, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene, cannot constitute patentable inventions.' However, Article 5(2) allows for the patenting of isolated elements of the human body, such as gene sequences, under specific conditions. This is highly relevant for biohackers involved in genetic editing or modification, as they must ensure compliance with the directive’s provisions regarding patent protection and the ethical use of genetic materials. The Oviedo Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine The Oviedo Convention, also known as the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, is a crucial legal instrument in regulating bioethical issues. While not binding across all EU member states, it establishes ethical principles for biomedical research and medical practices. Article 5 of the Convention outlines the necessity of informed consent in medical interventions, stating that any procedure related to health may only be carried out after the person has been informed and has provided free and informed consent. Article 13 of the Convention prohibits genetic modifications aimed at altering the genome of descendants, thereby setting ethical boundaries on genetic biohacking practices that could affect future generations. Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 For biohackers involved in genetic modification, the Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) Regulation is essential. Article 4 of this regulation sets out requirements for the authorization of GMOs intended for human consumption, while Article 16 requires rigorous risk assessments before any GMOs can be released into the environment. These provisions ensure that biohacking activities involving genetic engineering must meet strict safety standards to protect both public health and the environment. Additionally, Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment mandates a notification and approval process for biohackers intending to experiment with genetically modified organisms outside controlled laboratory environments. EU Charter of Fundamental Rights The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights provides a broader ethical and human rights context that applies to biohacking. Article 1 guarantees human dignity, while Article 3 protects the right to physical and mental integrity, particularly in the context of medical or scientific experimentation. Biohackers must ensure that their practices respect these fundamental rights, especially in cases where human subjects are involved. Article 3 also explicitly prohibits the use of the human body and its parts as a source of financial gain, a provision that could be relevant to biohackers engaging in the commercialization of biotechnological innovations involving the human body. EU Regulatory gaps and legal loopholes While the European Union has implemented a range of regulations that indirectly govern aspects of biohacking—such as the GDPR for data privacy, the MDR for devices, and the Biotechnology Directive for genetic modification—these frameworks were not specifically designed with biohacking in mind. As a result, gaps exist in their coverage, particularly around practices like DIY biology, self-experimentation, and citizen-led research. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancement in biohacking often outstrips the adaptability of existing laws, leading to ambiguity in critical areas such as liability, safety standards, and ethical boundaries. This chapter will examine these legal loopholes, the gaps in EU regulations that biohackers may exploit, and explore the challenges policymakers face in closing these regulatory voids. Biohacking outside of institutional oversight One of the primary challenges in regulating biohacking is the distinction between institutional and non-institutional research. EU regulations, such as the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, are designed to oversee formal clinical trials conducted by medical institutions or companies. However, biohacking often occurs in informal or private settings, such as personal labs or at home, outside the purview of these established oversight mechanisms. This means individuals engaging in self-experimentation or DIY biology may bypass the stringent safety and ethical guidelines required for institutional research, such as informed consent, independent ethics committee approval, and public safety measures. Moreover, many biohackers operate outside traditional research funding structures, meaning their activities do not fall under the purview of Horizon Europe or other EU funding programs, which impose strict ethical and regulatory compliance on grant recipients. As a result, a substantial amount of biohacking activity exists in an unregulated space, where enforcement is minimal. Self-experimentation and personal autonomy One of the most complex areas of biohacking regulation involves self-experimentation, where individuals modify or enhance their own biological systems. While EU laws, such as the MDR, establish clear standards for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices, they are primarily intended for commercial products rather than personal use. Biohackers who implant devices into their own bodies or modify their own biological systems may argue that these interventions fall under personal autonomy and bodily integrity, concepts protected by Article 3 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantees the right to physical and mental integrity. The loophole here is that self-experimentation may evade scrutiny because biohackers are often both the researchers and the subjects of their own experiments. As long as the devices or modifications are not sold commercially or performed by third parties, these activities may not be subject to strict medical regulation. This creates ambiguity in terms of accountability and risk management, particularly when biohacking results in harm to the individual or unintended consequences for others, such as environmental risks from genetically modified organisms. Ambiguities in genetic modification and biotechnology Biohacking frequently involves genetic modification, whether through gene-editing technologies like CRISPR or synthetic biology. The Biotechnology Directive governs the legal protection of biotechnological inventions but is focused primarily on patent law and intellectual property rather than regulating amateur genetic experimentation. While this directive addresses the patentability of biotechnological inventions, it offers limited guidance on the regulation of private or hobbyist genetic modification projects, especially those not intended for commercial use. Furthermore, EU GMO regulations, such as Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and Directive 2001/18/EC, require authorization and risk assessment for the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. However, biohackers working in private settings may develop GMOs without the intent of formal release or commercialization, creating a regulatory loophole where small-scale genetic modification experiments are conducted with minimal oversight. The issue is further complicated by the fact that biohackers may claim their activities are forms of scientific exploration or artistic expression, allowing them to circumvent regulations that typically apply to commercial or institutional activities. Data privacy and ethical challenges Biohacking often involves the collection of personal health data, whether through implanted sensors, biometric monitoring, or genetic testing. The GDPR governs the collection and processing of personal data, including biometric and genetic information. However, biohackers may exploit certain ambiguities in the GDPR, particularly regarding consent and the use of personal data for self-experimentation or non-commercial purposes. For instance, Article 9 of the GDPR prohibits the processing of special categories of personal data unless the individual has given explicit consent. In biohacking, where the data subject and the experimenter are often the same person, consent is not as rigorously monitored or enforced as it would be in institutional research. This creates potential risks in terms of data security, ethical use of personal data, and the potential for misuse of sensitive genetic information. Moreover, biohackers who share data within communities or on open-source platforms may inadvertently expose personal health information without adhering to GDPR compliance, particularly when cross-border data transfers are involved. Legal and ethical responsibility for community-based biohacking Biohacking communities often work collaboratively, sharing knowledge, techniques, and even experimental results. These activities, while fostering innovation, also raise questions about responsibility and accountability. If an individual biohacker suffers harm or if a genetically modified organism inadvertently affects the environment, it remains unclear who would bear legal liability. The EU’s existing legal frameworks primarily address institutional responsibility (e.g., corporations or research institutions) rather than distributed, decentralized communities of individuals. As a result, EU regulations struggle to define clear accountability in cases where harm is caused by biohacking activities. This loophole means that biohacking communities can operate with a degree of legal anonymity, potentially exposing both individuals and society to unregulated risks. Regulatory mechanisms extension? While the EU has established a robust legal framework to regulate biotechnology, medical devices, and personal data, these regulations were largely designed with formal institutions and commercial enterprises in mind. Biohacking, as a decentralized and often informal practice, exploits several legal loopholes, particularly concerning self-experimentation, private genetic modification, and community-based research. These gaps allow biohackers to operate with minimal oversight, raising concerns about safety, ethical responsibility, and the environmental impact of biohacking activities. Moving forward, policymakers will need to address these regulatory gaps by creating adaptable legal frameworks that account for the unique nature of biohacking. This may involve introducing new rules specific to DIY biology, tightening enforcement mechanisms, and clarifying liability in cases of harm or environmental damage. Furthermore, fostering collaboration between biohackers and regulators could help create a balanced approach that encourages innovation while ensuring public safety and ethical standards are upheld. Clarifying the legal status of self-experimentation and personal biohacking The legal status of self-experimentation and personal biohacking remains ambiguous under EU regulations, as existing frameworks primarily address institutional or commercial medical research. This gap leaves biohackers who experiment on themselves unregulated, particularly in areas involving medical devices and genetic modification. To address this, EU policymakers should establish clear guidelines that uphold individual autonomy while ensuring public safety. These should include minimum safety standards for medical devices, implanted technologies, and genetic editing tools used in personal biohacking. Amending the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) to encompass DIY tools and creating a registration process for self-experimenters could further clarify legal responsibilities. However, balancing personal autonomy with regulatory oversight poses challenges, as biohackers often view their activities as expressions of personal freedom. Additionally, enforcing regulations on private, non-commercial activities remains a significant hurdle, complicating compliance and oversight efforts. Regulating DIY biology and non-institutional research Biohacking often occurs outside traditional research institutions, with individuals or small groups conducting genetic modification and synthetic biology experiments in private or community spaces. These decentralized activities pose risks to individuals and the environment, yet current regulations are inadequate for effective oversight. To address this, a licensing framework for DIY biology labs should be developed, requiring biohackers working with sensitive technologies, such as genetic engineering tools, to register with national regulatory bodies. This framework should mandate safety protocols, risk assessments, and periodic inspections to ensure adherence to health and environmental standards. Additionally, the GMO Directive should be expanded to include small-scale, non-commercial genetic modification projects, subjecting biohackers to the same rigorous risk assessments as institutional researchers. Enhancing data protection and ethical standards in biohacking The rise of biohacking poses challenges to data privacy and ethics under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Biohackers often collect and share personal health data for self-experiments, operating outside traditional medical oversight. This raises concerns about data security and ethical handling of biometric and genetic information. To address these issues, GDPR enforcement should include specific guidelines for biohackers, requiring them to meet the same consent and data protection standards as institutional researchers. National ethics committees could review and approve high-risk biohacking projects involving genetic or biometric data, ensuring compliance with ethical standards. Resistance from biohacking communities, which value openness and decentralized practices, and the complexity of enforcing GDPR in global, cross-border networks remain significant obstacles. Fostering collaboration between policymakers and the biohacking community Regulating biohacking effectively requires bridging the gap between policymakers and the biohacking community. Heavy-handed regulation risks stifling innovation, as biohackers often operate at the forefront of biotechnology. Constructive dialogue is essential to close regulatory gaps while encouraging innovation. Policymakers should engage biohackers through workshops, conferences, and advisory committees to better understand their needs and concerns. A regulatory sandbox could allow biohackers to test new technologies in a monitored environment, fostering innovation while ensuring public safety. Challenges include mistrust from biohackers, who may view regulation as a threat to their freedom, and the rapid evolution of biohacking technologies, which makes it difficult for policies to keep pace. Building trust and creating adaptable regulations will be key to addressing these issues. Addressing liability and accountability in biohacking Liability and accountability in biohacking remain significant legal gaps, especially in decentralized communities where responsibility for harm—whether to individuals, the public, or the environment—is unclear. This issue is critical in cases such as failed self-experimentation or accidental release of GMOs. A clear liability framework is needed to assign accountability for damages, potentially by extending product liability laws to cover DIY medical devices and implementing environmental rules for GMO-related risks. Biohackers engaging in high-risk experiments should also be required to obtain liability insurance to ensure responsibility and mitigate harm. Challenges include difficulties in identifying responsible parties in anonymous or collaborative biohacking networks and the lack of a developed insurance market to cover biohacking risks, which may make coverage costly or inaccessible. Tackling biopiracy in biohacking Biohacking's focus on democratizing biotechnology risks perpetuating biopiracy—the unauthorized use of genetic resources and traditional knowledge without equitable benefit-sharing. Frameworks like the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Nagoya Protocol address biopiracy, but their adaptation to biohacking requires further attention (Bajrektarevic & Sari). Biohackers should adopt Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) practices, ensuring prior consent and equitable agreements with indigenous communities to protect resource providers' rights. Governments must strengthen ABS legislation and require biohackers to follow simplified protocols when accessing genetic resources, addressing gaps in enforcement and accountability. Challenges include weak enforcement of ABS mechanisms in countries with limited oversight and inconsistent national laws, which create compliance difficulties for biohackers working on cross-border projects. Harmonized legal frameworks are essential for effective regulation and equitable practices. Preventing environmental crime in biohacking Biohacking poses risks to the environment through activities such as genetic modification and the disposal of biological materials, which may inadvertently contribute to environmental crime. Offenses like illegal waste disposal and unauthorized resource use are aggravated by weak regulations and the decentralized nature of biohacking, which often lacks institutional oversight (Bajrektarevic 2021). To address these issues, governments must align national and international laws on hazardous waste, biodiversity, and genetic resources to ensure ecological safety. Partnerships between regulators, biohackers, and environmental organizations can improve compliance and reduce harm through clearer accountability and monitoring. Challenges include the informal structure of biohacking, which makes enforcement difficult, and resource limitations faced by authorities, leaving environmentally harmful practices unchecked. Clear regulations and collaborative efforts are essential to prevent ecological damage. Conclusion While it is essential to address the regulatory gaps in EU biohacking laws, overly restrictive measures risk pushing biohackers further into the gray area of unregulated activities. To foster a productive balance between innovation and safety, policymakers should focus on creating flexible, supportive frameworks that encourage responsible biohacking without stifling creativity or experimentation. Rather than imposing overly strict regulations, the EU can adopt a more collaborative approach, working with the biohacking community to co-create guidelines that prioritize safety while respecting the autonomy of biohackers. This can be achieved by establishing a regulatory sandbox, where biohackers are given the freedom to innovate in a controlled and monitored environment. Such a framework would allow biohackers to experiment with cutting-edge technologies while receiving guidance on regulatory compliance and safety standards, ensuring that their work aligns with public health and ethical norms. Providing funding and grants for biohacking projects through programs like Horizon Europe would also create an incentive for biohackers to operate within legal frameworks. By offering financial support and structured resources, the EU can encourage biohackers to collaborate with formal institutions and conduct their work transparently, with access to safety protocols and ethical oversight. This will help integrate biohackers into the broader scientific community, fostering innovation in a safe and ethical space without limiting their freedom. At the same time, ensuring clearer liability guidelines for biohacking projects is important to protect both individuals and the public. Rather than imposing rigid enforcement, the focus should be on developing systems that provide clarity around accountability while offering biohackers the flexibility to experiment safely. In summary, closing the regulatory gaps in biohacking requires a balanced approach that promotes freedom and innovation while ensuring safety and ethical responsibility. By fostering collaboration, providing support, and creating adaptive regulations, the EU can cultivate an environment where biohackers can continue to push boundaries without being forced into legal gray areas, contributing positively to the future of biotechnology.

The EU Has New Airline Regulations And Consumers Will Pay – OpEd	By Jack Watt EU policymakers have created new regulation for the aviation sector. ReFuelEU Aviationmandates the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and bans fuel tankering—a common practice globally. It is another climate-related initiative that will hamper native industry, increase prices, and reduce choice for consumers. Cheap fuel out, expensive fuel in The main thrust is to increase use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which are incredibly expensive. To cite a conservative estimate, SAF is around 250 percent more expensive than conventional jet fuel. This is somewhat alarming because fuel costs typically make up 25-30 percent of an airline’s total costs. With the aim of bringing down the cost, the legislation aims to 'de-risk' development. It imposes requirements on SAF usage, from 2 percent in 2025 to 70 percent in 2050, and grants favorable financing terms to producers. They will have access to funds raised by the EU’s 'green bonds' and investment from the EU budget, itself raised by taxation from member states. Some funds will also come from revenues generated by another burden on airlines, the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which airlines operating flights within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK are obliged to participate in (the UK ETS is slightly different but broadly aligned—it remains to be seen if a similar thing happens with ReFuelEU.) Tankering Ban Fuel tankering is where an aircraft operator loads extra fuel on a particular flight for the purpose of avoiding or reducing the amount of fuel required to be loaded for the return or next leg of a service. Sometimes the cost of carrying the extra weight is more than offset by higher fuel costs at the destination airport. But legislators have decided that as extra weight means more emissions, it must be banned on all flights arriving or departing the EU. This is curious logic, as it means that extra weight that reduces cost is treated differently to extra weight that increases revenue (passengers and cargo), despite both resulting in more emissions. Eurocontrol estimated that 21 percent of flights tanker to some extent. This is not surprising, as fuel prices can vary up to 55 percent within Europe—consider the cost of getting jet fuel to a Greek island or rural airfield (and the diesel burned to get it there!). The ability to tanker ensures that fuel suppliers face an elastic demand curve. For single-supplier airports, as many rural and remote airports are, it now becomes inelastic to the point where airlines stop serving the airport altogether. What does this mean for operators? The effect of this policy depends on the business model of the airline. For example, what type of airports do they serve, how long are their flights, and what is their competition? Consider that large hubs generally have a more competitive landscape than regional airports, which may only have a single fuel supplier. This means that point-to-point operators will be impacted more than hub operators. The former are generally the low-cost carriers, which operate more frequently to secondary and regional airports that tend to have less competitive fuel prices. Another factor is that the cost of carrying extra fuel increases with length of flight, so increasing price differentials are required to justify tankering as flight length increases. Among EU airlines, a higher proportion of the low-cost carriers’ flights are shorter sectors, though the hub and spoke 'majors' also have significant short-haul operations. That is, all big operations are affected, but the former relatively more so. The EU majors have one problem that the intra-European, low-cost carriers do not, though. In the long-haul market, they compete with operators that connect passengers onwards from their non-EU hub, notably the large Gulf and US majors. As only the EU leg is affected by this legislation, EU carriers offering direct flights are at a disadvantage versus those who offer connections via non-EU hubs. It is worth noting that this is not the first relative advantage handed to non-EU carriers by legislators. EU and UK airlines have far greater exposure to the ETS, which is 25 times costlier than the international equivalent, called CORSIA. Additionally, several nations also charge Air Passenger Duty, which is foisted on the whole operation of an airline based in affected nations and tends to be greater for longer direct flights than those connecting through an intermediate hub. Finally, it also means new administrative costs. There are many reasons flights leave with more fuel than legally required—the fuel load is a point of safety, first and foremost—and one can imagine ways to at least partially tanker without calling it as such. Conclusion In summary, EU aviation faces significant headwinds with SAF mandates and the ban on tankering. While the SAF mandates pose a greater threat to the viability of operators of all types, the tankering ban introduces immediate cost increases. The degree of impact on individual operators depends on their business model and competition, and though native EU carriers are burdened more than their non-EU peers, none are made better off in absolute terms. As ever when regulators burden industries with new terms, consumers will pay the price. They will experience a combination of higher ticket prices, less competition, and less choice than would otherwise exist.

The Historic First Days – OpEd	Well, the Donald surely did hit the ground thundering, and some right good noise it was—starting with the 1,500+ pardons of the J6 offenders. That promise kept was crucial because it was one big presidential middle finger rebuke to the Giant Lie that the Washington establishment and MSM have been egregiously peddling for the last four years. For crying out loud, it wasn’t an 'insurrection' and did not threaten American democracy even a teensy tiny bit. Instead, the January 6th brouhaha was a case of piss-poor police work at the US Capitol Building. It could have been readily barricaded from the unruly crowd streaming off the Ellipse with a few locked steel doors and some water cannons and bear spray canisters unloosed for good measure. Indeed, we spent 15 years around the place back in the day, and the truth is this: If they don’t want you to get in, you just plain can’t penetrate what is a fortress made of 400,000 sandstone blocks weighing upwards of 75 million pounds in the aggregate. The so-called rioters got in because they were let in, not because they broke in. They had no plan of action whatsoever and for an obvious reason: It was a disorganized, unarmed, leaderless mob of political yokels and yahoos, which like the car-chasing dog who unexpectedly caught its prey, had no idea of what to do once they got inside—except to meander around the building taking selfies and grabbing mementos such as the paperweights on Nancy Pelosi’s desk. None of them were armed. There was also never a moment of material threat to the Secret Service-protected Vice-President or the Electoral College certification procedure. And contrary to the flagrant but typical lie on CNN last night by the dopey Dem Senator from New Jersey, Cory Booker, no 'police killers' got pardoned at 7:30 PM Monday. The only person 'killed' at the Capitol Building that day was an unarmed citizen, Ashli Babbitt, who had been a decorated war hero before coming to Washington to protest an outcome that was decided by 44,000 votes in three states out of 158 million counted in an election in which only 57 million voters actually came to the polls on election day (the other 101 million ballots were absentee ballots or early voting ballots). Was there reason, therefore, to suspect the validity of this razor-thin outcome conducted under untested pandemic voting procedures—even apart from Donald Trump’s self-serving whining? As Sarah Palin would have said, you betcha! In any event, the event was a non-event. The vast majority of the protesters/rioters should have been fined $100 for trespassing and defacing of government property and sent home. That should have been the end of it—but the Washington establishment had other ideas. To wit, taking the weaponization of the Deep State to the next level by spending $2.7 billion of taxpayer money prosecuting a case against thousands of citizens that was so threadbare as to actually amount to a transparent Democrat campaign ad. That’s right. These liberal poseurs spent enough money staging their J6 theatrical extravaganza as would have supported food stamps for 770,000 needy people for an entire year. They are just shameless. Yet, even that is not the whole of it. For instance, consider all the talking-head bleating about the police officers 'injured' on January 6th. Dig as deep as you might, however, and you can’t find a record of even a dozen of them being admitted to any Washington, DC hospital. That is to say, the '140 injured officers' canard was either made up out of whole cloth entirely or they counted every scratch, scrape, first aid bandage, nosebleed, or slight heart palpitation that occurred among the ranks of the desk jockeys and glorified visitor guides who are pleased to be called the Capitol Hill Police force. Actually, the US Attorney for the District of Columbia, Matthew Graves, who was in charge of this entire miscarriage of justice and the source of the 140 injuries figure might well be considered an 'expert' in illegal assaults. His career prior to joining the Biden DOJ in 2021 was at a Washington 'law firm' that lobbied for represented Middle Eastern nations and banks accused of supporting terrorism! Specifically, Graves represented the Qatari government, which has faced accusations of supporting terrorist organizations including Hamas, and also a passel of foreign banks including the Bank of Palestine, Arab Bank PLC, and Bank of Beirut—all of which were accused of financing terrorism. In short, we are not inclined to credit Mr. Graves’ claims about police injuries on J6 since it is evident that his field of vision is heavily colored by whoever his paymaster might happen to be at any moment in time. Worse still, all of this wailing about the alleged desecration of the People’s House is downright nauseating. After all, the Capitol Building is desecrated day in and day out by the greatest assemblage of crooks, knaves, hypocrites, and bootlickers you can find in any one building in all of America. In fact, they are spending and borrowing the nation into fiscal calamity—with the public debt now rising by more than $10 billion per day. Of course, as Trump jabbered away at the Resolute Desk—signing 48 executive orders, repealing 78 Biden executive actions and taking more unscripted, not-preapproved questions from the press in 50 minutes than Sleepy Joe did in 1,460 days—he was just getting warmed up with the pardons, including one for the website maker Ross Ulbricht who was sentenced to two lifetimes plus 40 years in prison for selling weed now available in retail shops in most big cities. In fact, the far more sweeping and consequential 'pardon' issued last night was that for fossil fuels and the lowly CO2 molecules that their combustion unleashes to fertilize and green the planet. Quitting the Paris Accord (again), canceling the EV mandates, opening up Alaska, and pausing Federal leases for offshore wind turbine carnage of sea life wasn’t really the half of it. Far more crucial was the flat-out utterance from the Bully Pulpit of the White House itself that the whole Climate Crisis campaign is a hoax and a scam. Unlike the normal GOP BS about 'balancing' so-called climate protection measures with economic needs or phasing in fossil fuel rollbacks more judiciously or putting taxpayer money into smart hideous boondoggles like CO2 capture and 'burial,' the Donald pulled no punches. To wit, he flatly said that the predicate is utterly wrong. So be gone you climate fraudsters! In the same 'be gone' vein the 51 ex-intelligence community grifters who signed the petition saying Hunter Biden’s laptop was a Russian plant got their security clearances yanked—led by those belonging to the five most odious dicks in the lot: Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, Morell, and Panetta. This action may well relieve the American people from their lies and propaganda as national security 'experts' on the cable networks night after night, but also something even more crucial: Namely, it was a message from the Oval Office that contrary to Senator Chuckles Schumer’s warning the first time around that no one in their right mind would tangle with the intelligence community, the nation’s reelected sheriff just plain ain’t afraid of the Deep State. Period. That is, the folks pictured below and their legions of cohorts and confederates took a proverbial shot at the king and missed. So the Donald’s payback is just starting in these precincts, meaning that the future of constitutional government may be getting one big shot in the arm—including in the next few days when all of the remaining material in the classified archives about the assassination of JFK, RFK, and Martin Luther King is released. This long overdue release amounts to both a defiance of the Deep State and evidence that lessons have been learned on the Donald’s side of the table. Last time, he got talked out of releasing the JFK files by the deplorable neocon troll, Mike Pompeo. But this time he knew enough to send Pompeo, John Bolton, Gina Haspel, and the rest of the neocon pack packing before they even packed for another job in his second administration. The litmus test as to whether the national security Deep State is really on the run, however, will be if the Donald sticks it out with his brilliant choice of Tulsi Gabbard for DNI (Director of National Intelligence). Tulsi knows her brief cold—so give her a few months as DNI and the wailing sounds coming from the 17 intelligence agencies will turn into a roaring crescendo of disclosure and exposure of the evil deeds done by many of those pictured below. Then there was the shit-canning of Washington’s horrid $1.3 billion per year contribution to the WHO (World Health Organization). Indeed, this tool of globalism and crony capitalists captured by the likes of Bill Gates and Big Pharma has received $16 billion from Washington over the last decade. After the WHO’s treachery on the Covid pandemic and vax front, however, the zero funding put in place last night needs to stay zero as far as the eye can see. Again, the Donald should never be forgiven for unleashing Dr. Fauci, Scarf Lady Birx, Operation Warp Speed, and the rest of the Covid mayhem on the American people. He knows now for certain that they, in league with shadowy national security officials, ruined his last term. But his ridding the US of any and all affiliation with this destructive UN institution would be a decent starting form of penance. Likewise, the executive order forbidding any Federal agency from indirectly thwarting the absolute constitutional protection of free speech was a veritable clarion call. It unmistakably announced that the Biden-era outbreak of Federal-agency thought control is now over and done. Yet to make sure this order will stand forevermore, the Trump people need to follow up with a deep and sweeping investigation of these unconstitutional misadventures and assaults on free speech. The purpose would be to identify, expose, and prosecute, if warranted, every single one of the Bidenite malefactors by name, rank, and serial number so as to discourage any future political appointee from even thinking about weaponizing an agency of the state against domestic political rivals or dissidents from the prevailing orthodoxy. In this regard, the 75-day reprieve for TikTok is a big stride in the same direction—with the added feature that it calls out the 'national security' ruse for state-driven thought control and censorship. The fact that the Chinese owners allegedly capture user information is a pitifully weak excuse for banning free speech. After all, the very modus operandi of free social media is that they capture and monetize your viewing habits, otherwise known as your 'information.' Besides that, even though the Donald’s eagerness to 'make a deal' with the Chinese has its own problems, his delay of the TikTok ban at least clarified one thing. To wit, it gave occasion for the great Senator Rand Paul to school a typical Fox News China-basher about who owns the joint. And it turns out that the parent company, ByteDance, is owned 60% by global investors, 20% by the two founders, 20% by employees including thousands of Americans and zero percent by the Chicom government in Beijing. As to the latter, the only thing the Chinese government actually owns is a 1% golden share in a China-only subsidiary of ByteDance because, well, TikTok itself is illegal in China! You can’t make this stuff up. Both the House and Senate chambers are crawling with UniParty demagogues who based the ban on the hideous grounds that Beijing might find out, what? Whether 13-year-old American girls like videos of puppies or kittens better? According to the Wall Street Journal, ByteDance agreed in 2021 to allow the Chinese government to take a 1% ownership stake known as a 'golden share' at one of its China-based subsidiaries, Beijing Douyin Information Service Co., which runs Douyin, an app available in China that’s similar to TikTok. (TikTok is not available in mainland China.). It goes without saying, of course, that DEI took it firmly on the chin as well. And appropriately so. There has not been any statist operation more inimical to personal liberty and free enterprise prosperity in recent decades than the DEI campaign that infected much of the Fortune 500. That is, until Bud Light was stupid enough to hire a creepy transgender TikTok influencer named Dylan Mulvaney, which triggered Trump buddy Kid Rock to post a video on Twitter blasting cases of Bud Light to smithereens with a machine gun. Alas, it all came together over the weekend when Kid Rock serenaded the Trump rally Sunday evening while the Donald went on yesterday to literally deliver the DEI death knell. His ringing endorsement of meritocracy and the plainly evident truth that Mother Nature invented just two genders may have finally awakened the corporate, university, and government HR departments from their destructive sojourns in the deranged world where men have babies and women have a pair. At the end of the night, of course, there was one real big, nay huuuge, thing missing. The Donald didn’t say a word about the fiscal time bomb that has been deposited on his doorstep by the UniParty. But the fact is, the $624 billion deficit posted during the two first two months of FY 2025 was a shocking 64% bigger than the prior year and even exceeded the 2020 Covid year deficit by a large measure. Moreover, it’s just the tip of the iceberg coming down the pike. The built-in spending momentum will generate $85 trillion of outlays over the next decade versus barely $60 trillion of revenue, and that’s according to a CBO baseline forecast that assumes uninterrupted full employment for the next decade and a level of total GDP and employment by 2035 that even supply-side gurus like Art Laffer have barely projected. That is to say, the public debt is heading to $70 trillion by the mid-2030s and $150 trillion (yes, with a 'T') by the middle of the century—a level that would crush Main Street prosperity and constitutional liberty as we have known it. And yet and yet. The Donald had absolutely nothing to say on the very topic that is at the heart of everything. Nor did he say a word about how he will extricate the US from the catastrophe in Ukraine or rein in a $1.6 trillion national security budget that is at least $500 billion greater than what an America First homeland security policy actually requires. Instead, he went off on a tangent about planting the stars and stripes on Mars. And that’s to say nothing about how the 8 million illegals now on US payrolls will be replaced if they are deported by ICE or self-deported by fears of a knock on the door in the middle of the night. Finally, Trump was yapping yet again about Chicom control of the Panama Canal. To be sure, someone apparently told the Donald that the Panama Canal Authority is gouging American shippers and China may have something to do with it. Of course, neither is remotely true. But there is a larger issue here. The matter of Panama is so utterly irrelevant that the Donald’s preoccupation with it is still another reminder that his good thunder on issues where he feels he has been personally wronged can readily give way to immense blunders on important matters on which he is wholly misinformed or completely misguided. In the case of Panama, for instance, the Chinese government has absolutely no role in the operations of the Panama Canal Authority. Nor did they fund the recent $5 billion expansion to accommodate more and larger ships. In all, the canal authority collects just $3.38 billion per year in tolls, which doesn’t amount to a hill of beans in the scheme of things. Actually, the tolls averaged just $16 per ton against the 210 million long tons of cargo handled by the canal in FY 2024. So perhaps the Donald’s opinion is what—that the toll should be much lower at say $13.50, $9.25, or $5 per ton? In fact, if the tolls were actually exploitative, the containers coming from the Far East and heading for the US Atlantic coast would divert to the Long Beach/Los Angeles Port and then go by train and truck to the East Coast. Alas, they don’t at today’s $16 per ton average charge because after the Teamsters, rail unions, and Warren Buffett’s Union Pacific railroad eat their fill, it’s still cheaper to take the canal route and pay the tolls—the Donald’s newfound monopolistic assessment or not. More importantly, about 70% of the Panama Canal traffic is accounted for by US port-originated or destined traffic. So call the annual charge to the US economy $2.4 billion, which amounts to the rounding error sum of $7.0 million per day. As for the Chicoms, their footprint apparently stems from the fact that the venerable Chinese investment titan, Li Ka-shing, owns and operates two Panama Canal ports through CK Hutchison Holdings. In turn, these two ports–one on the Atlantic (Cristobal) and the other on the Pacific (Balboa)—move about 4.5 million TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units) per year. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but even then it amounts to barely half of the annual 8.0 million TEUs moved by the two largest Panama operations at the Port of Colon and the Port of Manzanillo. These are not Chinese-owned or influenced, nor are several more smaller ports that also operate in Panama. That is to say, why in the big wide world of national problems and crises is the Donald blundering around threatening to seize the Panama Canal—which is a 20th-century relic, at best? Moreover, we don’t know whether the legendary Li Ka-shing is a commie agent or not, but if so he has been pretty adept at playing the role of empire-building capitalist. After all, he has accumulated a current net worth of $36 billion. More pertinently, we don’t see much reason to sweat Li Ka-shing’s ownership of two of the seven Panama ports—especially when the American economy already has been living quite comfortably with the CK Hutchison empire of ports all around the world. Actually, the company is the world’s leading port investor, developer, and operator. The Group’s ports division holds interests in 52 ports comprising 291 operational berths in 27 countries, including container terminals operating in six of the 10 busiest container ports in the world, such as the premier US port at Long Beach. In 2021, the division handled a total throughput of 88 million TEUs, meaning that its Panama operation accounts for barely 4% of its global volume. So if CK Hutchison is a dangerous tool of Xi Jinping, its Panama holdings are the least of our worries. Of course, there is actually nothing to worry about down there in the Panama Canal Zone when it comes to global commerce and the purported machinations of China. It turns out that the current volume through the Long Beach/Los Angeles Ports is 20 million TEUs per year or five times more than the traffic through the so-called China ports in Panama. At an average value of about $75,000 per TEU, the annual volume into these leading US ports is worth about $1.5 trillion. That is to say, if you put the Donald’s 'big beautiful' 25% tariff on the incoming goods at Long Beach/Los Angeles, you get $375 billion per year drained out of the pockets of American consumers. Now, that’s actually some kind of harm. In short, the $7 million per day of tolls paid by US-bound shipments through the canal are utterly irrelevant to anything that matters when it comes to restoring non-inflationary growth in an American economy now freighted down under $101 trillion of public and private debt and a central bank that has painted itself into an inflationary corner. Stated differently, the Donald’s Day One thunder was superb but his blunder in totally ignoring the big issues—taming the Warfare State, reining in the explosion of Federal spending and debt, and throttling the madcap money printers at the Fed—needs to be corrected real soon. We don’t have much hope for that, however. At the end of the day, Donald Trump is a Caesarean who thinks governance is a principle-free transactional 'art of the deal' to be performed on a global stage. It is not. Not in the slightest. What America actually needs is not a bully-boy CEO, but a Federal government that sobers up, balances its books, brings the Empire home, and gets out of the way. Then again, we just don’t see the Donald signing up for Jeffersonian quiescence and modesty now that he is back in the Oval Office. He has spent a whole lifetime pursuing the opposite, and is not about to execute a volte-face now.

Micheál Martin Becomes Irish Prime Minister For Second Time	By Nicholas Wallace (EurActiv) -- Ireland's parliament, the Dáil, nominated Fianna Fáil's Micheál Martin as prime minister for the second time on Thursday. Martin was supposed to be nominated Taoiseach on Wednesday. However, opposition parties, angry about speaking-time rules for pro-government independents, shouted over the speaker, Verona Murphy, forcing her to suspend the Dáil and delay the vote. To break the impasse, the government agreed to renegotiate the Dáil's procedural rules. Martin's Fianna Fáil is the largest political party in the Dáil. The party struck a coalition deal with its old rival-turned-partner, Fine Gael, on 14 January, along with a loose formation of largely conservative independents. The centre-right politician has served as Taoiseach once before, between 2020-2022, during a previous coalition between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens. Musical chairs, round two The new coalition deal, like the old one, requires Martin to resign part-way through the government's term and to pass the baton to the Fine Gael leader – currently Simon Harris, the outgoing Taoiseach. The agreement sets 16 November 2027 as the date for Martin to step down. The agreement followed a general election on 29 November, which extended Fianna Fáil's lead in the Dáil. Fine Gael came third, behind the left-wing and nationalist Sinn Féin, the largest opposition party. The Greens were almost completely wiped out, forcing the other two parties to find a new third partner to secure a majority. Though nominated by the Dáil, Martin remains only Taoiseach-elect until President Michael D. Higgins formally appoints him. Martin will visit the president's official residence, Áras an Uachtaráin, later in the day to receive the appointment. Martin will then officially be Taoiseach, replacing Harris. After that, Martin will appoint ministers and return to the Dáil with his cabinet for a final vote on the new government. Donohoe returns Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe, a Fine Gael TD, is expected to become finance minister once again, while retaining his Eurogroup role. Donohoe served as finance minister during 2017-2022, then relinquished the job to Fianna Fáil's Michael McGrath, under the terms of the previous coalition agreement. McGrath left the government last year to become the EU's justice commissioner. Before the two parties first entered into a formal coalition after the 2020 election, Fianna Fáil propped up a minority Fine Gael government during 2016-2020 in a 'confidence and supply' deal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc5ibOcf0B442	2025-01-23T16:51:52-08:00	
Trump Knows Ukraine Conflict Means Nuclear WWIII, Gives Peace A C...	The chances of a peace deal in Ukraine are suddenly a lot higher under President Donald Trump only because he has a realistic sense of a nuclear Third World War happening between the United States and Russia if that conflict is not ended promptly. Peter Kuznick, an esteemed American professor of history, says that the Biden administration brought the world closer to a nuclear conflagration than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Biden did this by relentlessly arming Ukraine with weapons to strike deeper and deeper into Russia instead of trying to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Indeed, there was no diplomatic effort from Washington under Biden. It was ideologically and propaganda-driven for confrontation, as was the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. Kuznick points out that Trump is no John F Kennedy in terms of the latter’s depth of historical and philosophical knowledge. But in comparison with Joe Biden, Trump has shown more humanity and common sense by not insulting Putin and in reaching out for a peaceful end to the slaughter in Ukraine. Biden called Putin a thug and said he would back Ukraine as long as it takes to defeat Russia. The last Democrat administration spent $175 billion of U.S. taxpayers’ money propping up a NeoNazi regime in Kiev that has lost over one million military casualties since the war erupted in February 2022. By contrast, newly inaugurated President Trump says that he wants to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a priority to find a peaceful way out of the conflict and to avoid a catastrophic escalation between nuclear powers. Putin has welcomed a meeting with the new president and said he appreciates the urgent concern to avoid a nuclear disaster. Kuznick is author of The Untold History of the United States, which was coauthored with acclaimed film director Oliver Stone. The book was turned into an award-winning television series aired on Showtime, Netflix and other channels. Kuznick deplores the way the U.S. and NATO partners undermined international security by expanding on Russia’s borders despite earlier promises to the Soviet leaders that would not happen. If peace is to be found in Ukraine, it must be based on a bigger picture of lasting global security that considers all nations’ concerns. That means the United States must treat Russia’s national security concerns over NATO’s expansion seriously and respectfully. Can the Trump administration deliver? It is packed with hawkish figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Donald Trump is better placed than the Biden adminstration to cut a deal with Russia for peace in Ukraine and thereby avoid nuclear disaster, says Kuznick. Trump’s cabinet is filled with billionaires and his mercurial, superficial understanding of the world can be deprecated. Maybe his peaceful aspirations are muddled and not feasible given that Trump is surrounded by hawkish figures. But at least he is willing to give peace a chance with Russia over Ukraine. That alone makes Trump a welcome change from the vile warmongering of Biden and his would-be successor Kamala Harris.

US Moves To Redesignate Iran-Backed Houthis As Foreign Terrorist ...	(RFE/RL) -- The United States has begun the process to again declare the Iran-backed Huthi rebel group of Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), restoring the designation President Donald Trump set out during his first term. 'Supported by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, which arms and trains terrorist organizations worldwide, the Huthis have fired at U.S. Navy warships dozens of times since 2023, endangering American men and women in uniform,' a White House statement said on January 22. The statement also referred to the Huthis as Ansar Allah, the name used by the extremist group that has since the 1990s battled the internationally recognized Yemeni government, which is supported by a Saudi-led military coalition. Trump's declaration sets in motion a process that will likely conclude within 45 days to officially designate the Huthis as a foreign terrorist organization under U.S. legislation. During his first term, Trump had designated the Huthis as an FTO, but the action was reversed by the Biden administration over concerns such a listing could prevent desperately needed aid from reaching Yemen. President Joe Biden did later label the group as a specially designated global terrorist entity, a slightly lower level of sanctioning. The latest move, one of Trump's first in his second term in the field of foreign relations, could be an initial step in the 'maximum pressure' campaign his team has vowed to renew against Iran, which it blames for supporting extremist activity in the Middle East. Huthi rebels in 2014 seized much of Yemen's northwest and its capital, Sanaa, leading to a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and created a humanitarian nightmare in the Arab world's poorest country. Many observers described the hostilities as a 'proxy war' between Saudi- and Iranian-led groups. 'Since seizing most Yemeni population centers by force from the legitimate Yemeni government in 2014-2015, the Huthis have launched numerous attacks on civilian infrastructure, including multiple attacks on civilian airports in Saudi Arabia, the deadly January 2022 attacks on the United Arab Emirates, and more than 300 projectiles fired at Israel since October 2023,' the White House statement said. 'The Huthis have also attacked commercial vessels transiting Bab al-Mandeb more than 100 times, killing at least four civilian sailors and forcing some Red Sea maritime commercial traffic to reroute, which has contributed to global inflation.' The statement added that the rebel group’s activities 'threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade.' The Huthis stepped up attacks on shipping in the Gulf region and fired missiles toward Israel, claiming it was in support of Gaza's Hamas movement, which has also been declared a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union. The actions brought air strikes by the U.S. and Israeli militaries, but the rebels recently have appeared to pull back on their attacks since the cease-fire in Gaza was reached.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc6GEg7ObxiL7	2025-01-23T16:45:09-08:00	
The End Of American Democracy? – OpEd	Donald Trump cares little about democracy, except in the most utilitarian sense. For Trump, democracy is a ladder that he can use to ascend to power. He is not interested in promoting democracy abroad or strengthening democracy at home. He cares only about power: corporate, presidential, national. Before Trump, presidents frequently promoted U.S. democracy overseas, despite its obvious design flaws: elections won by candidates who lost the popular vote, wealthy people buying seats in Congress, redistricting to favor a particular party, a system dominated by two parties. There won’t be any democracy promotion under Donald Trump. In his second inaugural, Trump promised to promote American power, not American principles. 'We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top, and export American energy all over the world,' he trumpeted. He promised to push American cars and promote the U.S. military, not least of which to retake the Panama Canal. It’s no great loss perhaps that the United States will be suspending its official democracy promotion. Other countries are better positioned to that kind of work. The South Korean people, for instance, impeached their leader Yoon Suk-yeol when he declared martial law, something the U.S. Congress failed to do twice with Donald Trump when he overstepped the law. A number of European countries have achieved a much higher level of civic participation and a lower amount of economic inequality than you’ll find in the United States. The problem for the foreseeable future lies not with the exported version of U.S. democracy. It’s what Trump will do to American democracy at home. Trump is a convicted felon who attempted to remain in power even after he lost the 2020 election. The case against him for breaking the law to stay in the White House was likely strong enough to result in a conviction. Avoiding prison was perhaps the chief motivation for Trump to win the 2024 elections. His victory led to the dismissal of the case. To avoid a prison sentence, Trump resorted to lies, distortions, and threats to win the 2024 election. He also relied on the deep pockets of billionaire Elon Musk to sponsor deceptive ads and buy votes in swing states. If he had lost the 2024 election, Trump was fully prepared to tear the country apart in an effort to prove that the election had been 'stolen.' He did win, of course, though with only 49.9 percent of the vote, the smallest margin of victory in nearly 60 years. Day One Dictator Trump promised to be a dictator for his first day in office. It’s no surprise, then, that he issued the most executive orders of any president on inauguration day. Executive action is nothing new. Both Democrats and Republicans have collaborated in expanding the powers of the presidency. But Trump has gone beyond what other presidents have done, or instance to challenge the U.S. Constitution itself by declaring an end to birthright citizenship. He also pardoned the January 6 insurrectionists, which sends a disturbing message to the citizenry about the lack of consequences for those who attack the federal government. Trump will also take a chainsaw to government—cutting the regulatory agencies that implement policy and keep Americans safe. Democracy, in the modern world, requires state power. By cutting back on federal authority, Trump will empower instead conservative states, corporations, and religious institutions. The MAGA revolution is all about destroying public institutions, like government-mandated health insurance. Eliminating the Department of Education will only further undermine what religious institutions and hardline conservatives have been pushing for years: the expansion of private schools at the expense of public education. Although Trump pitched himself as the hero of the 'working man,' he has on the contrary created a Kremlin-like oligarchy around himself. Elon Musk is only the richest and most prominent of the dozen billionaires that Trump has selected for his cabinet. Other oligarchs, like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, have scrambled to curry favor with the returning president, turning such sycophancy into an astute investment decision. America’s richest people expect to grow their wealth exponentially under Trump. After all, Musk himself made $170 billion just since Election Day, a few short months ago. U.S. democracy has long been deformed by the influence of the wealthy. But now the playing field, under Trump, will tilt so dramatically that all but the richest will simply tumble off the edge. Democracy in America has been around for over 200 years. Surely one man, no matter how many super-wealthy people he gathers in his circle, cannot unravel such an august institution. Democracy survived Trump’s first term. Surely, it will survive the abuses of his second. Or will it? Coup vs Civil War The challenge that Trump poses lies not just in the policies he promotes, the public institutions he defunds and delegitimizes, or the wealth he redistributes upward. The new president threatens the very fabric of the country. The handover of power went smoothly after the last election because the losing party respects the rule of law. But the erosion of democratic norms under Trump suggests that the next presidential election in 2028 will not go as smoothly. An even more elderly Trump might defy the U.S. constitution—and its two-term limit for presidents—and stay in office under some contrived state of emergency. Or he might usher his hand-picked successor into the White House in a similarly autocratic fashion. The best-case scenario, of course, would be a democratic election in 2028. But let’s say Trump’s successor loses. Trump has effectively said that any election that doesn’t go his way is illegitimate. Should a Trump-inspired uprising take place in 2028 to challenge a 'stolen election,' it will be much better planned and executed than the one on January 6, 2021, just as Trump’s second term is much more organized than the first. Such a nation-wide insurrection following any disputed election outcome could unravel an already divided United States. So, the worst-case scenario for the United States is a coup and the best-case scenario is a civil war? That does not bode well for American democracy. What to Do? The only way to avoid these scenarios of coup or civil war is to strengthen democratic institutions even as Trump tries to destroy them. This is no easy feat. The obvious strategy is to bolster democracy at a state or local level, particularly in areas that did not vote for Trump. This makes a lot of sense, but it will, inevitably, deepen the divide between red and blue states and encourage the very civil-war dynamic it’s urgent to forestall. Building up the capacity of California or Chicago to fend off authoritarian power grabs from a federal bureaucracy commandeered by Trump will necessarily absorb a lot of the time and energy of the mainstream resistance. It will also put anti-MAGA forces on the defensive as they scramble to file lawsuits to stop Trump’s actions. But the only sustainable way to strengthen U.S. democracy is to build a movement that includes a lot of the voters who supported Trump. They voted for the current president because they wanted change. They didn’t vote for rule by the rich. It’s often said that American democracy is being undermined by the wealthy and their capacity to buy elections. Now, paradoxically, it’s the presence of a dozen billionaires in Trump’s inner circle that may save democracy—by fueling the wrath of the disenfranchised and prompting them to support an alternative to MAGA. Anger over a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich will make it more likely that any future lies about a 'strong leader' and a 'stolen election' will fall on deaf ears. It’s just a question of what political entity will mobilize that anger and turn it into an electoral force.

Our Ability To Think In Terms Of Numbers Is Universal, Abstract, ...	Most people learn to count and do basic arithmetic at a young age and don't give these skills a second thought. But numerosity or numeracy, the ability to think about and use numbers, is more than a basic skill: It is what underlies the human power of abstraction, metaphor, symbolism, and the essence of thought. The connection of numerosity to language and culture is a fascinating topic. Scientific research has shown that even cultures that only use numbers up to 2 or 3 are able to master using larger numbers when they are taught the language required. Advanced imaging technologies have enabled scientists to look at areas of the brain cortex connected to particular math skills. The frontoparietal region of the brain has been identified as the location for coordinating goal-directed tasks. How old human numerosity is, how numbers are connected to language or abstraction, and whether animals have numerosity are subjects of debate in the scientific community. I interviewed Frederick L. Coolidge, a professor of psychology, who specializes in cognitive archaeology and has written broadly on the subject. Coolidge has taught at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, since 1979 and co-directs its Center for Cognitive Archaeology. He argues that humans are not the only species to have numerosity, that numerosity does not require language, and that it expresses itself culturally. Marjorie Hecht: How old do you think numerosity is, and why? Frederick L. Coolidge: Because monkeys possess the capacity for numerosity, and we have a common ancestor with monkeys about 25 to 30 million years ago, this suggests that numerosity has a very ancient origin. Why? Because evolutionarily it must have been important for the earliest primates, who appeared about 60 million years ago, to be able to distinguish quickly among one, two, or three things. Further, we are descendants of this primate lineage. This ability, subitization, is one of the two core processes in numerosity. Imagine an ancient primate facing a predator or more than one. They would be at a distinct advantage if they could immediately (as if without overt conscious thinking) take on a single predator as opposed to three! Imagine if they sat there thinking, 'Hmm, should I go this way to take on this one predator or should I go that way and take on three predators' (assuming of course, there was no other recourse). The second core process of numerosity is an analog set of comparisons, that is, distinguishing quickly between a small set and a large set of things (any number of things). Again, imagine an ancient primate trying to decide between a tree with 25 apples versus 50 apples. The ability to quickly distinguish the tree with more apples might be invaluable due to competition with other animals. MH: Is numerosity inherently abstract? FLC: Yes, because if oneness, twoness, and threeness can be applied to any type of things, be they tangible like apples or intangible like angels, numerosity is the essence of abstractive thinking. Therefore, because numbers can be applied to any thing, it is this capacity that underlies abstractive thinking. As the British mathematician A. N. Whitehead (1911) wrote: '... the leading characteristic of mathematics [is] that it deals with properties and ideas which are applicable to things just because they are things, and apart from any particular feelings, or emotions, or sensations.... This is what is meant by calling mathematics an abstract science.' Further, abstraction in numerosity may give rise to the modern advanced characteristics of language, including analogizing and metaphorizing. Why is 'love is a rose' so easily understood? Notice that the properties of a tangible thing like a rose we can readily understand and apply to an intangible abstract concept of love. One minor problem with analogies and metaphors is where do the similarities stop. In class, I made students ponder the problem of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in a rose's roots and how that would apply to love. The value of metaphorization is not only a transfer of knowledge but also the creation of novel ideas. MH: Is numerosity independent of language? FLC: Monkeys and human infants (as young as 8 months old) have the capacity for numerosity. Therefore, it is independent of the faculty of language. Numerosity arises from neurons genetically dedicated to its two core processes, which are located in the lower parietal lobe—specifically the intraparietal sulcus—both in humans and nonhuman primates like monkeys. I can find no coherent argument that numerosity requires language, sorry. It would be like wasting your time arguing evolution with a creationist. MH: Does numerosity express itself culturally? FLC: Yes, the capacity for numerosity may be older than primates, reptiles, and maybe even flatworms that emerged 545 million years ago—and I am not merely being facetious. There is simply not a lot of grant money for the study of numerosity in amphioxus and planaria, but there should be. I propose that basic mathematics and then advanced higher math (algebra, calculus, etc.) were built upon the foundation of numerosity. As soon as language became more elaborate with lots of words for things, it was as easy to name the subitization core process of oneness, twoness, and threeness. [Subitization is the ability to determine the number of elements in a set without counting.] In fact, it was as easy as one, two, three; ek, do, teen [Hindi]; eins, zwei, drei [German]. Interestingly, the Pirahã tribe in the Amazon have only the number words for one, two, and many (again the three-thing limit for subitization). So, as soon as we hominins had words for 1, 2, and 3, we figured out there could be words for numbers and then words for amounts greater than that. But subitization got us started. Then advanced math took off yet got its start from that foundation. When humans could ponder their existence, they could ponder and witness death. This death anxiety wasn't easily relieved. We needed a very powerful rationalization to overcome this major existential anxiety. So, we created gods, typically a single god: God, Allah, Buddha, Brahma, etc. Notice, only one god, expressed by numerosity's (subitization's) oneness. We didn't need more to relieve our death anxiety as one god giving us immortal life is sufficient. Also, notice that the concept of a heaven always accompanies the concept of a god because death anxiety is the chief reason for the conception of a god. However, subitization subtly expresses itself by urging us to think of twoness and threeness. Thus, Hinduism has one God, Brahma, but three forms, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Christianity has God, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Even in comedy, we have three (the Three Stooges) because the limit of subitization appears to be three things. In summary, does numerosity express itself culturally? God, yes! About the author: Marjorie Hecht is a longtime magazine editor and writer with a specialty in science topics.

Beijing Opaque On Its Travel Ban Against Rubio	By Alex Willemyns Chinese officials remain tight-lipped about how they plan to carry out diplomacy with the United States while America’s top diplomat, Marco Rubio, remains officially sanctioned for critical comments he made about Beijing’s treatment of Uyghurs and Hong Kong in 2020. Rubio, formerly a Republican senator from Florida, was hit with retaliatory sanctions for 'interfering' in China’s domestic affairs by criticizing its 2019 crackdown in Hong Kong and what the U.S. government calls a 'genocide' against ethnic Uyghurs in the far northwestern Xinjiang region. Under China’s Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, that puts Rubio on a travel ban list, potentially complicating U.S.-Chinese diplomacy. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was ambiguous at a briefing on Thursday when asked whether Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi would speak with Rubio by telephone given the sanctions. 'I have no information to share on your question,' Mao said, before adding that Beijing still thought engagement was important. 'Let me say more broadly that it’s necessary for high-level Chinese and U.S. officials to engage each other in appropriate ways,' she said. 'In the meantime, China will firmly defend its national interests.' On Monday, Rubio was confirmed as U.S. President Donald Trump’s secretary of state after stating at his Senate confirmation hearing that he believes China is the 'biggest threat' to America’s security. He also nodded to his fraught ties with China during the hearing. 'Indeed, I’ve been strongly worded in my views of China,' Rubio said. 'Let me just point out they’ve said mean things about me too.' What’s in a name? In the aftermath of his confirmation, Chinese official state documents referring to Rubio appeared to change the Chinese characters used to transcribe his name, leading to suggestions Beijing might be attempting to skirt the sanctions and travel ban by renaming Rubio in Chinese. However, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson seemingly put the kibosh on that account at an earlier press briefing Wednesday, telling a reporter she was 'not yet aware' of his name being written differently. 'If you ask me, instead of how his name is translated in Chinese, it’s his actual name in English that is more important,' Mao said. 'What I can tell you is that China’s sanctions are aimed at the words and actions that harm China’s legitimate rights and interests.' The Chinese Embassy in Washington was also opaque when asked by Radio Free Asia about the sanctions, travel ban and name change. 'China will firmly defend national interests,' spokesperson Liu Pengyu said. 'In the meantime, it’s necessary for high-level Chinese and American officials to maintain contact in an appropriate way.' The U.S. State Department told RFA only that Rubio did 'not have any travel to announce at this time.' It otherwise declined to comment on the sanctions and the new secretary’s apparent Chinese name change. 'Secretary Rubio looks forward to promoting American safety, security and prosperity through his engagements with China and other countries throughout the region,' a spokesperson said. Sanctions diplomacy It’s not the first time sanctions have complicated U.S.-China ties. From March to October 2023, Li Shangfu served as China’s defense minister while subject to U.S. sanctions issued in 2018 for purchasing banned Russian missile systems when he was a lieutenant general. Li’s tenure came at a nadir for U.S.-China ties and saw the Chinese defense minister and the rest of China’s military refuse any direct contact with their American counterparts, leading to public complaints from then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in June 2023. But Li was sacked by President Xi Jinping in October 2023 –- and later expelled from the Chinese Communist Party altogether –- a month before Xi and then-U.S. President Joe Biden’s summit in San Francisco, where military-to-military contact was re-established.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc8aXxAyuUs_h	2025-01-23T16:26:31-08:00	
Trump Administration: Manila Still Has Washington’s ‘Ironclad’ Ba...	By Jason Gutierrez The newly installed Trump administration has quickly reaffirmed America’s strong support for the Philippines in the face of an increasingly aggressive China in the disputed South China Sea, despite doubts to the contrary voiced by some observers. In a call with Filipino counterpart Enrique Manalo on Wednesday (Manila time), U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Washington remained committed to Manila’s defense amid tensions with Beijing over the waterway. It marked the first time an inducted official in President Donald Trump’s cabinet had expressed full-throated backing on the security issue affecting the Philippines. Among the concerns that Rubio and Manalo discussed was China’s 'dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. 'Secretary Rubio conveyed that [China’s] behavior undermines regional peace and stability and is inconsistent with international law,' she said. 'The Secretary underscored the United States’ ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty.' The assurance by the new top American diplomat comes amid worries by some security experts that President Trump might pay less attention to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, which has been working to shore up international support against China in the contested waters. China lays claim to almost the entire South China Sea, but its claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Over the past few months, Manila and Beijing faced off in a series of confrontations at sea. Signed in 1951, the treaty commits both the U.S. and the Philippines to come to each other’s aid in times of external attacks. Under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, Washington said that the scenario included armed attacks in the South China Sea. However, that did not prevent China from carrying out activities in the region. Recently, Beijing dispatched Chinese Coast Guard ship 5901 – the world’s largest coast guard vessel – to waters within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ). On X, Manalo said he and Rubio discussed the importance of the alliance between Manila and Washington for the 'prosperity and security' of the region. 'We look forward to working with Secretary Rubio and his team towards addressing challenges and sustaining the momentum and positive trajectory in our bilateral relations,' Manalo said. Rubio’s call with Manalo occurred after the new secretary of state met with his counterparts from Australia, India, and Japan in Washington on Tuesday, a day after Trump returned to the White House. The United States and the three countries form the so-called 'Quad' grouping, revived under the first Trump presidency. It was considered a pillar of the Biden administration’s efforts to counter China, which regarded the grouping as a U.S. tool to ensure American global hegemony. In the Quad meeting, the four nations reaffirmed their commitment to a 'free and open Indo-Pacific' region and 'strong opposition to unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force including in the East and South China Seas,' according to a statement by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Takeshi Iwaya, Japan’s top diplomat, also met separately with Rubio where they discussed several issues, including the importance of 'further developing coordination of like-minded countries,' such as the trilateral alliance of Tokyo, Washington, and Manila. During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio called China’s actions in the region 'deeply destabilizing' and urged the nation against making anything 'rash or irrational' towards the Philippines and Taiwan. 'In the last 48 hours, there’s this massive, I don’t even know how to describe it, but this massive ship that the Chinese have built that’s like headed towards the Philippines. And the Philippines feels threatened by it. Rightfully so. We’ve seen this on a daily basis, the harassment and so forth, but on a daily basis,' Rubio said. '[China really needs] to stop messing around with Taiwan and the Philippines because it’s forcing us to focus our attention in ways we prefer not to have to.' Regarded by analysts as a 'hawk' when it comes to policy relations with China, Rubio, a former Republican senator from Florida and son of Cuban immigrants, has been blacklisted by Beijing in retaliation for U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials over China’s treatment of the Uyghur ethnic minority and its handling of Hong Kong. Reacting to Rubio’s call with Manalo, Beijing on Thursday said that Washington was 'not a party' to the dispute and that Chinese activities in the region were 'legitimate, lawful, and fully justified.' 'The U.S. is not a party to the South China Sea issue and has no right to interfere in the maritime issues between China and the Philippines,' said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning. ‘Renewed commitment’ under Trump administration On Wednesday, Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. met with U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz to discuss the two nations’ 'enduring alliance,' according to the Filipino official’s office. The meeting 'marked a significant step in further advancing the decades-long alliance between the Philippines and the United States, signaling a renewed commitment to collaboration under the Trump administration,' said Filipino defense spokesman Arsenio Andolong. The meeting, held at the White House, occurred two days after Trump took office. The Philippines, through Teodoro, was among the first countries to engage the new U.S. administration and discuss security matters, Andolong said. 'Waltz and his team underscored the need to enhance cooperation with the Philippines and looked forward to increasing mutual security activities in support of a free and global Indo-Pacific, an initiative dating back to Trump’s first presidency,' he also said. Last week, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the U.S. Navy staged joint maneuvers in Manila’s EEZ within South China Sea waters, their first this calendar year.

Trump Promises Global Businesses Lower Taxes For Products Made In...	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday invited global businesses to manufacture their products in the U.S. and promised them lower taxes but warned if they choose to produce their goods elsewhere, they would have to pay tariffs to export them to the United States. 'America is back and open for business,' Trump, in a video linkup from Washington, told corporate leaders meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 'My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth,' Trump said. 'But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff.' Trump, three days into his second term in the White House, said he wants to cut the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21 to 15%, although that needs approval from his political allies in the Republican-controlled Congress. Lawmakers have begun debating how to extend and reshape personal and corporate tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump's first term in office. Trump promised the U.S. would supply Europe with the liquified natural gas it needs but contended that the European Union treats the United States 'very, very unfairly' with the extent of regulations it imposes on American businesses operating in the 27-nation bloc. The president complained specifically about tariffs and environmental impact statements for new construction projects, calling them 'things you shouldn't have to do.' Trump promised that his administration would make the U.S., already the world's biggest economy, 'a manufacturing superpower' and said the government during his four-year term would eliminate 10 business regulations for every new one that is imposed. He said he plans to ask Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut the price of oil they produce to boost the global economy. He contended that if the current global oil price — about $77 a barrel — is cut, 'the war in Ukraine will end immediately.' Russia uses revenue from its own oil production to help fund its three-year war on neighboring Ukraine. Trump said that in the global economy, the U.S. 'just wants to be treated fairly by other countries.' He said the U.S. wants to have a 'fair relationship' with China, the world's second-biggest economy. 'We don't want to take advantage,' he said of Washington-Beijing relations. 'We just want to have a level playing field.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc9NrfgDu0Uzz	2025-01-23T16:15:50-08:00	
Aoun Urges UNHCR Chief To Organize Return Of Syrian Refugees	By Najia Houssari Lebanese President Joseph Aoun called on the UNHCR’s commissioner, Filippo Grandi, to 'start organizing return convoys for the displaced Syrians in Lebanon.' Aoun said Lebanon 'can no longer support the burden resulting from their presence at different levels.' He called on the international community to provide material and humanitarian support to achieve the return of displaced Syrians. Some countries have already started their support, he added. Grandi visited Aoun at the Presidential Palace to congratulate him on his election. During the meeting, the president affirmed that Lebanon 'wants the return of Syrian refugees to their country as soon as possible, especially since the reasons for their displacement no longer exist.' Aoun, who also met with Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam, tackled the infiltration of several Syrians into Lebanon following the developments in the neighboring country. He emphasized 'the importance of working to stop infiltration on both sides of the Lebanese-Syrian border.' Citing UNHCR estimations, Grandi said that more than 200,000 displaced Syrians had returned to their country from Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and other countries since the fall of the former Syrian regime on Dec. 8. Many others also wish to return home, he added. He added that a survey conducted by the UNHCR showed that the number of those wishing to return had increased from about 1 percent to 30 percent in a matter of weeks. Grandi affirmed that the UNHCR was 'supporting those who returned and that we have already started doing so.' He said the UNHCR’s relationship with the new authorities across Syria was constructive, and they had started prioritizing the issue. Grandi said UNHCR wanted to work with Lebanon to build a practical way to support the return of Syrians. To achieve this, the president can play a vital role with the international community, he added. After the meeting Grandi explained that his visits to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Turkiye aim to 'discuss the issue of Syrian refugees, particularly in light of recent political changes in Syria. 'We believe that these changes may allow refugees to return to their home country and leave their host nations, including Lebanon, which has hosted them with great generosity and patience for nearly 14 years.' He added: 'During the most recent war in Lebanon, between September and October, over 450,000 Syrian refugees returned to Syria. 'We believe that, with the return of this significant number of Syrian refugees, sustained support is crucial to ensure their permanent return. 'Therefore, we began implementing a program designed to support returnees from different countries by offering material assistance and other means of support. 'Material support is essential, as well as efforts to restore life in the areas where refugees are resettling,' he said. 'Otherwise, they will leave again, most probably to their host countries. 'It is important to note that the new Syrian authorities have welcomed the Syrian refugees back, which is a positive sign,' Grandi said. 'However, the new authorities must stay on course — respecting minorities, preserving the rights of all citizens, and lifting Syria to new horizons that rebuild trust among Syrians, including returning refugees,' he added. Grandi held talks as Lebanese military authorities prepared for the withdrawal of Israeli forces following their incursion into southern Lebanon since Oct. 1. The 60-day stage of the ceasefire deal is set to expire at dawn on Sunday. In a meeting with acting Lebanese Army Commander Maj.-Gen. Hassan Odeh, caretaker Defense Minister Maurice Slim underlined Lebanon’s 'firm commitment to the withdrawal of the Israeli forces within the agreed deadline in the ceasefire agreement.' Slim’s office stated that the discussion focused on the deployment of the Lebanese Army in all the areas from which the Israeli forces would withdraw. Slim said the army was ready to be deployed in throughout the region. The Lebanese Army entered the border town of Kafr Shuba in the eastern sector. Units had been stationed on the outskirts of the town, facing Al-Sammaqa, an Israeli military site. Other units have been deployed in Hanin, where Civil Defense teams recovered the bodies of several Hezbollah fighters. Also on Thursday, the Israeli military destroyed rest facilities on the banks of the Wazzani River, and eight houses in the town of Taybeh were deliberately burned. Video footage was taken by dozens of residents returning to their villages after the Lebanese Army deployed there, showing the extent of the destruction of property and facilities, especially in the town of Khiyam. The Israeli military claimed that 'forces of the 810th Brigade, operating under the command of the 210th Division, found and seized a large number of weapons in the Shebaa Farms, including anti-tank launchers, rocket launchers, machine guns, binoculars, and rockets aimed at Israeli territory.' In a statement, the Israeli military said that 'the forces of the 7th Brigade, operating under the command of the 91st Division, are continuing their activities in southern Lebanon to protect Israel's security.' It claimed that 'they are operating under the understandings reached between Israel and Lebanon while maintaining compliance with the conditions of the ceasefire agreement.' Israel’s outgoing ambassador to the US, Michael Herzog, claimed that talks were being held with the administration of President Donald Trump to extend the withdrawal date from Lebanon scheduled for next Sunday. The Trump administration is pressuring Israel to withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with the scheduled date on Sunday, the Israeli Army Radio reported.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc7mi2KhiYMmk	2025-01-23T16:10:09-08:00	
NATO Secretary General At Davos: We Have To Change The Trajectory...	On Wednesday 22 and Thursday 23 January NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte attended the World Economic Forum in Davos. Speaking at a breakfast held in support of Ukraine, hosted by The Victor Pinchuk Foundation and Yalta European Strategy, Mr Rutte underlined that a win for Putin would be a defeat for freedom, security and global stability. 'We really have to step up and not scale back the support for Ukraine. We have to change the trajectory of the war,' he insisted adding that any deal that pleased Russia, China, Iran and North Korea would not bring peace but make the world a darker place. The Secretary General went on to emphasise the vital need for Europeans to ramp up defence investment and production, noting that this is crucial to allowing NATO to deter aggression and ensure our collective defence into the future. The Secretary General also spoke at a plenary event on ‘Technology in the world’ about the role innovation plays in meeting global challenges. Mr Rutte made clear that harnessing technology and increasing investment in defence is key to keeping the one billion people living in NATO countries safe. He also called on NATO Allies to be faster and fiercer in shifting to a wartime mindset saying 'speed is of the essence'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc3VFsszcuGR2	2025-01-23T16:08:10-08:00	
Thousands Of European Citizen Scientists Helped Identify Shifts I...	The results of cowslip observations carried out with the help of citizen scientists from 32 countries in over 5,200 locations shed light on the well-being of insect-pollinated plants under changing climate and land use conditions. The study was made possible thanks to the contribution of European science enthusiasts. It revealed some surprising results recently published in the Journal of Ecology, one of the longest-standing top-level journals in this field. The cowslip (Primula veris) is considered a model species for studying insect-pollinated plants. Cowslips can have two types of flowers: long-styled (L-morph) and short-styled (S-morph). In L-morph flowers, the stamens are at the base of the corolla, and the style is tall, making self-pollination difficult. In S-morph flowers, the style is short, the anthers are high, and self-pollination is easier. Different floral morphs have evolved in many plant species to prevent self-pollination and facilitate cross-pollination by insects. Generally, the proportion of short-styled S-morphs and long-styled L-morphs should be fairly equal in a viable plant population. However, in many cowslip populations observed across Europe, a significant imbalance and a marked predominance of S-morph flowers were noted. There were 9% more S-morphs than L-morphs. In smaller populations, the imbalance in flower types was more frequent, irrespective of the floral morph. Further analysis of climate and land use data revealed that the higher prevalence of the S-morphs was associated with greater summer precipitation and more intensive land use. Previous studies have shown that the unequal proportion of flower types is one of the risk factors that can lead to species extinction. According to the study’s lead author, Tsipe Aavik, Associate Professor in Macroecology at the University of Tartu, these are very surprising results offering plenty of material for further research. Aavik said that similar results were obtained a few years ago from observations made as part of the citizen science initiative in Estonia, but at the time, the shifts were attributed to Estonia being at the northern edge of the cowslip distribution range. 'This study confirmed that the balance of the floral morphs is, in fact, disrupted across Europe, so this change is much more meaningful,' said Aavik. The researchers speculate that this may be a step on the evolutionary path helping plants cope with various environmental changes – the loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats, changes in pollinator diversity and composition, and a warmer and wetter climate. According to Aavik, the Europe-wide cowslip observation is only the first step in testing this hypothesis. During the international cowslip campaign, University of Tartu researchers invited people across Europe to observe cowslips and share their observation data in the springs of 2021 and 2022. During the citizen science project, which started in Estonia in 2019, observations were made in more than 8,000 locations across Europe, and nearly 900,000 cowslips were examined over four years.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc2NqeJq5hArn	2025-01-23T16:05:47-08:00	
Trump Pardons 23 Pro-Life Activists	By Zelda Caldwell and Tyler Arnold President Donald Trump issued pardons for 23 pro-life activists on Thursday, fulfilling a promise he made during the presidential campaign. Trump signed the pardons on Thursday in the Oval Office of the White House on the day before the March for Life to be held in Washington, D.C., according to the Thomas More Society. Last week, the religious liberty law firm petitioned the incoming president to issue 21 individual pardons for pro-life advocates who were arrested for violating the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act and 'Conspiracy Against Rights' statute while peacefully engaging in protests at abortion clinics. Several of those convicted and imprisoned were elderly and in poor health. At least two times during his 2024 campaign for the presidency, Trump said he intended to release pro-life activists who are currently imprisoned. 'These peaceful pro-life Americans mistreated by [President Joe] Biden include grandparents, pastors, a Holocaust survivor, and a Catholic priest — all are selfless, sincere patriots,' the petition from the Chicago-based law firm reads. During Biden’s four years in office, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) brought charges against more than 30 people who took part in pro-life demonstrations under the FACE Act, which was legislation in the 1990s to increase penalties for people who obstruct access to abortion clinics or pregnancy resource centers. Although the FACE Act’s higher sentences also apply to people who obstruct or damage pro-life pregnancy centers, Biden’s DOJ only brought charges in two cases regarding attacks on those facilities despite more than 100 incidents occurring under his tenure. 'While Biden’s prosecutors almost entirely ignored the firebombing and vandalism of hundreds of pro-life churches and pregnancy centers, they viciously pursued pro-life Americans,' the petition adds. The longest sentence was given last year to Lauren Handy, who received four years and nine months in prison for her role in a protest at an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C. The second longest was also given last year to Bevelyn Beatty Williams, who received three years and five months in prison for a protest inside an abortion clinic in New York City. Several pro-life activists in their mid-to-late 70s also received multiyear sentences for their protests. 'These 21 peaceful pro-lifers, many of whom are currently imprisoned for bravely standing up for unborn life, are upstanding citizens and pillars of their communities,' Steve Crampton, who works as senior counsel for the Thomas More Society, said in a statement.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc3TBZNnWOJV6	2025-01-23T16:03:39-08:00	
Reforestation Stands Out Among Plant-Based Climate-Mitigation Str...	In the global effort to combat climate change, large-scale, plant-based strategies such as planting forests and cultivating biofuels are an increasingly important part of countries’ plans to reduce their overall carbon emissions, but a landmark new study in the journal Science finds that well-intended strategies could have unforeseen impacts on biodiversity and that, in general, restoring forests has the most beneficial effect on wildlife. The authors, including New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) Assistant Curator Evelyn Beaury, Ph.D., argue that policy makers and conservation officials should consider impacts on biodiversity when evaluating the most effective tools to mitigate climate change. 'As efforts to address climate change accelerate, it is urgent to ensure that in deploying LBMS we do not inadvertently imperil biodiversity,' Dr. Beaury and her colleagues write, using the acronym for land-based mitigation strategies, which use plants to store carbon. Dr. Beaury is an Assistant Curator in NYBG’s Center for Conservation and Restoration Ecology, which is working to expand NYBG’s collaborations with conservation initiatives worldwide; strengthen conservation capacity building, including training future biodiversity leaders; and advance conservation by fostering the sustainable use of plant resources locally and globally. Many net-zero emissions plans call for implementing plant-based mitigation strategies across millions of acres of land. The most common approaches are reforestation (restoring forests in places where they have historically grown), afforestation (adding forests in places like savannahs and grasslands), and bioenergy cropping (farming plants such as switchgrass for renewable energy). Until now, it has been challenging to predict these strategies’ impacts on biodiversity because they affect species in multiple, complex ways. The new study, published online and in the print edition of this week’s Science, is the first of its kind to evaluate the potential biodiversity impacts of those three climate change mitigation strategies globally. The team of scientists—led by Dr. Jeffrey Smith, Ph.D., an Associate Research Scholar at Princeton University’s High Meadows Environmental Institute—modeled the impact of these mitigation strategies on over 14,000 animal species, from creatures smaller than a mouse to larger than a moose. Most countries worldwide, from Austria to Zimbabwe, have committed to using these methods to reach their climate targets. However, as Dr. Beaury notes: 'Plant-based mitigation strategies do not have the same effect on the climate or on biodiversity everywhere they are deployed. Our research suggests that we cannot assume plant-based solutions always indirectly reduce the biodiversity crisis.' The team of scientists—which also included Jonathan Levine, Ph.D., Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton, and Susan C. Cook-Patton, Ph.D., Senior Forest Restoration Scientist at The Nature Conservancy—found that reforestation will benefit many species both locally, by increasing habitat, and globally, by mitigating climate change. These include many iconic forest species from spotted salamanders and red-bellied woodpeckers to jaguars. The outcomes for planting monocultures of bioenergy crops or converting natural savannahs and grasslands to forests are not as rosy. While these efforts may help address climate change and reduce climate threats to biodiversity, they will also lead to immediate habitat loss. Replacing biodiverse meadows with bioenergy crops would be hugely detrimental for species from grouse to elk. Similarly, converting savannahs to forests would lead to the decline of iconic species such as ostriches and lions. The study found that the loss of habitat due to afforestation and bioenergy would be far greater than the benefit they would provide to biodiversity by helping mitigate climate change globally. While ecologists have long suspected that some of these interventions would mean less habitat for wildlife, this study provides the first quantitative assessment of the potential impacts. 'Reforestation is an obvious ‘win-win’ for biodiversity,' said Dr. Beaury, an ecologist and biogeographer whose expertise includes invasive plants. 'Restoring lost forest provides habitat as well as reduces the impacts of climate change.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe6O7o_AjFIbXax1fFwdiL_	2025-01-23T15:24:14-08:00	
Imagining The Physics Of George R.R. Martin’s Fictional Universe	Many science fiction authors try to incorporate scientific principles into their work, but Ian Tregillis, who is a contributing author of the Wild Cards book series when he’s not working as a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, took it one step further: He derived a formula to describe the dynamics of the fictional universe’s viral system. In independent research published in the American Journal of Physics, from AIP Publishing, Tregillis and George R.R. Martin derive a formula for viral behavior in the Wild Cards universe. Wild Cards is a science fiction series written by a collection of authors and edited by Martin and Melinda M. Snodgrass. Sitting at over 30 volumes, the books are about an alien virus called the Wild Card that mutates human DNA. Martin is credited as a co-author of the paper, making it his first peer-reviewed physics publication. The idea to explore the science behind the fictional virus came from a series of blog posts on the Wild Cards website. 'Like any physicist, I started with back-of-the-envelope estimates, but then I went off the deep end. Eventually I suggested, only half-jokingly, that it might be easier to write a genuine physics paper than another blog post,' Tregillis said. 'Being a theoretician, I couldn't help but wonder if a simple underlying model might tidy up the canon.' The formula he derived is a Lagrangian formulation, which considers the different ways a system can evolve. It’s also a fundamental physics principle, which also makes the fictional example a powerful teaching tool. Tregillis shared that deriving this physical model was a fun but open-ended puzzle. After some trial and error of models based on fractals or thermodynamic analogies, he and Martin settled on the Lagrangian approach. 'We translated the abstract problem of Wild Card viral outcomes into a simple, concrete dynamical system. The time-averaged behavior of this system generates the statistical distribution of outcomes,' he said. While the Wild Card virus can be modeled by physics, Tregillis emphasized that it isn’t a hard-and-fast rule in the canon. 'Good storytelling is about characters: their wants, needs, obstacles, challenges, and how they interact with their world,' Tregillis said. 'The fictional virus is really just an excuse to justify the world of Wild Cards, the characters who inhabit it, and the plot lines that spin out from their actions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdXBYG4F1bd-OUGFZEdowZ	2025-01-23T15:22:16-08:00	
Green Cement: Electric Heating To Contribute To Climate Neutralit...	The cement industry is one of the largest producers of carbon dioxide. It is responsible for up to eight percent of global man-made emissions – almost three times as much as the global air traffic. To reduce this share and become climate-neutral, the industry is relying on technological innovations. The international project 'ECem', in which scientists from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) are also involved, is pursuing a promising approach. With the help of electric heating technologies for the energy-intensive process of calcination, the partners from science and industry want to drastically reduce CO2 emissions in cement production. The project started in the fall of 2024 and will run for three and a half years. It is funded by the Danish Innovation Fund with 21 million Danish crowns (about 2.8 million euros). Calcination is one of the most important process steps in the production of cement. Limestone is heated to approximately 1450°C in a large furnace and converted into clinker, the main component of cement, by thermal decomposition. This chemical process is responsible for a large proportion of the CO2 emissions released by the cement industry as a whole. Two-thirds of the CO2 is produced during the decomposition of the limestone, a process known as decarbonization, and is therefore unavoidable. The remaining third is due to the enormous energy consumption required to reach the high temperatures. Fossil fuels such as coal or gas are usually used for this purpose. The 'ECem' (Electric calciner technologies for cement plants of the future) research project is now taking on this industrial heating process. The goal is to develop a more climate-friendly alternative. To this end, the project partners, led by the Danish cement company FLSmidth, including the Danish Institute of Technology, the University of Aalborg, the companies European Energy and Cementos Argos, as well as the HZDR, want to develop two different electric heating technologies. Metal balls give limestone the necessary material properties While the Danish partners in the project are working on the development of an infrared radiant heating system, scientists at the HZDR Institute for Fluid Dynamics are researching an electrical solution based on inductive heating. The team first wants to set up a laboratory experiment in which induction coils generate a high-frequency field to heat the material in a container. In a later stage, a rotating kiln will be modeled in a further experimental setup with key data that closely approximates industrial conditions. The challenge is that materials such as limestone, which consists mainly of calcium carbonate, are actually unsuitable for induction heating due to their poor electrical conductivity. To overcome this obstacle, the team wants to mix so-called susceptors into the raw material to be heated. These are components designed to efficiently convert the electric energy into heat and transfer it to the material. An important task is to find the right material that can function robustly as a susceptor at high temperatures and under harsh industrial conditions. Possible candidates must have a high melting point, must not react with the limestone and should be abrasion-resistant. Forming the susceptors into a shape, for example as metal balls, would have the advantage of combining the calcination and grinding processes into a single step. Investments in the electrification of industrial processes could, in addition to avoiding CO2, have further positive effects such as increasing efficiency or improving product quality, thus giving the respective companies a competitive advantage in the global markets. Optimization of gas flows ensures effective heat transport 'At first glance, this project has less to do with the fluid mechanics that we usually deal with at the institute,' explains HZDR engineer Dr. Sven Eckert, head of the Magnetohydrodynamics Department. 'However, this is not just a matter of installing a heater in a reactor. Cement kilns usually process many tons of material, which is why the difficulty lies in creating a homogeneous temperature field throughout the entire kiln. An inductive heater could even exacerbate this problem if it does not guarantee sufficient heat transport that reaches not only the surface layers but also the interior of the huge volume. Therefore, we have to look at the process in principle, including an optimization of convective gas flows in the furnace, which must ensure effective heat transport.' This is where the researchers around Sven Eckert can apply their expertise. At the HZDR, they also have access to unique measuring techniques such as magnetic field tomography, which is ideally suited for monitoring electrified industrial processes. The team also wants to benefit from the experience gained in the EU project CITADEL, which is coordinated by the HZDR and is already in progress. The aim of the ECem project is to validate the technology on a laboratory scale. The data obtained in the planned experiments will be an important input for accompanying computer simulations and the development of digital twins that will map the entire process, including energy and mass flows. On this basis, the scientists want to clarify whether the laboratory experiment can be scaled up to real industrial conditions. If the answer is positive, the partners could start building a pilot plant similar to the industrial version after the project ends in 2028. Depending on the research results, this plant could either include induction heating or radiation heating, which are being developed in parallel – or, which is not unlikely, a combination of both solutions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2DgprljQ2JmD	2025-01-23T15:20:14-08:00	
Sheikh Hasina: From Refugee To Prime Minister To Fugitive In Half...	The dramatic life of Bangladesh former Prime Minister’s continues to unfold, mirroring the roller-coaster ride of South Asia's political dynasties since 1947 While the past invariably catches up in unexpected ways, and revolutions promising social-political liberation often devour its own heroes and children, the unfolding history of Bangladesh is yet another testimony of the traumas unleashed by the Partition of 1947 which divided the vast subcontinent into India, Pakistan and East Pakistan. Sheikh Hasina's dramatic flight from Dhaka on 5 August 2024 will remain a defining though traumatic moment in south-east Asian politics when a once-loved and highly respected Prime Minister had to flee for her life as the opposition rose against her, with religious leaders, students and citizens taking to the streets against her dictatorial regime. As Bangladesh's longest-serving Prime Minister, who shaped the destiny of a new liberated country for twenty eventful years (from 1996 to 2001, and then 2009 to 2024), life and politics seem to have come a full circle for Sheikh Hasina. In 1975 after the assassination of her father 'Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, the President of Bangladesh, she had taken shelter in India from 1981 to 1986. Now almost four decades later, the bespectacled, dignified South Asian leader, is said to be seeking asylum not just in India, but UAE or Saudi Arabia among others. The interim government of Bangladesh recently reaffirmed their resolve to bring the deposed Prime Minister from India and are ready to seek international intervention if necessary. Media quoted the Law Adviser Asif Nazrul at the Dhaka Secretariat stating that if New Delhi refuses to return Sheikh Hasina, it would constitute a violation of the extradition treaty between Bangladesh and India. Adding to her woes, the country's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) issued arrest warrants for Hasina and several former Cabinet ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for ‘crimes against humanity and genocide’. In many ways Sheikh Hasina's existential plight since August 2024 mirrors the helpless agony of lakhs of refugees who were forced to migrate in the tumultuous years of 1946 to 1948, with waves of humanity continuing through till 1971 and then again in the new century with the homeless Rohingyas crossing Bangladesh borders. Be it the well-connected political elites or the masses of faceless subalterns, all are left equally aghast, surprised and grossly unprepared to face uncertain futures in alien lands. There is a harsh equality in adversity, a cruelty that makes few distinctions. 'Partition was the defining event of modern, independent India and Pakistan, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that partition continues to be the defining event of modern India and Pakistan,' wrote GJ Larson in ‘India's Agony Over Religion’, and Bangladesh can safely be added to his list since its formation in 1971. 'Partition moreover was and is a profoundly religious event for both sides...and most of the agony over religion throughout the South Asian region to a large extent traceable to it. Partition is at the heart not only of the great regional conflicts... but it is also an important component factor in a whole series of religious-cum-political conflicts reaching down to the present time.' When Prof Mushirul Hasan of Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, was delivering the presidential speech at 2001 Indian History Congress, he referred to Larson’s linkage between religion and regional political conflicts. He said the grand narrative of Partition needs to be told differently, beyond confines of space and time. Borders, refugees and diaspora are sources of conflict, but Prof Hasan highlighted, 'there is even talk of the need for new languages in dealing with historical traumas of the past, of rethinking Partition necessitated by the shift away from high political histories.' According to French scholar Jean-Luc Nancy, the gravest and most painful testimony of the modern world, the one that possibly involves all other testimonies to which this epoch must answer, is the testimony of the dissolution, the dislocation, or the conflagration of community. In short, tears and agonies of common citizenry looking up to political leaders for providing education, health, housing and employment with a degree of honour and respect. The irony is: whom does the leadership look up to when they are homeless, stateless? How do the powerful cope with being powerless? In an apt summing up the Partition, Prof Mushirul Hasan said, 'never before in South Asian history did so few people decide the fate of so many in northern India.' The lives and experiences of the people - who lived through the horror of those times, their identities and uncertainties created, reinforced by the Partition - continue to be invoked not just in history books but through literature and poetry, theatre and films. Dr Papiya Ghosh of Patna University in one of her essays, described the Partition as the largest single bilateral flow of people with about six to seven million Muslims moving the minority provinces of India to Pakistan; and nearly a million Hindus and Sikhs moving from Pakistan to India in 1947, though by 1951 the numbers had risen substantially. India and Pakistan kept their borders open till 1951. Dr Ghosh highlighted the trauma of Partition for almost 700,000 refugees who were Urdu-speaking Bihari Muslims and headed towards East Pakistan (later liberated as Bangladesh); these were the mujahirs as the refugees came to be called, a term which has continued till date. Currently the political narrative in Bangladesh is centred around justice. The country’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus stated his government is ensuring the security of all citizens, assuring justice in every killing. He earlier claimed about 1500 people, including students and workers, were killed while 19,931 others were wounded during protests against the Hasina government on the controversial job quota system. When India expressed its deep concern on the arrest of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh, it added a predictable religious dimension to the ongoing diplomatic relations. The External Affairs Ministry stated with deep concern the arrest and denial of bail to Shri Chinmoy Krishna Das who is spokesperson of Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote. Bangladesh even with an overwhelming Muslim majority has Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Chakmas, Meiti and several tribal communities; each of whom regard the country as their home and are proud of a composite culture defining this densely-populated land fed by rivers of the subcontinent. The country’s rich historical and cultural past cannot be overlooked; integrated as it was through the centuries with pan-India empires. When Dr Papiya Ghosh was ‘Writing Ganga-Jamni: 1940’s and after’, she highlighted the nuanced understanding of a ‘pure and new’ nationalism which was emerging across the subcontinent: it was side-stepping the existing religious communities and grounding itself in the interests of individuals rather than religious communities. 'The term ganga-jamni is often used as an attribute of composite North Indian/Indo-Muslim culture: many Urdu writers used it to describe ‘everything that is mixed and syncretistic in a positive sense’. I have used it as a metaphor for mingled histories that were either contested, enlisted or invoked in the politics of the 1940s and after,' the professor explained. For historians it is an onerous task of analysing, enumerating religious communities composing the nation and forming its composite culture: an additive arithmetic of nation-making. The current political struggles in Bangladesh, and Sheikh Hasina’s homeless status, are harking back to the what had been described as ‘the political accountancy of the Raj’, which was basically the colonial project of religious enumeration, reliant on the terminology of majority and minority. Prof Hasan, in his 2001 presidential address quoted David Page's ‘Prelude to Partition’, where the historian outlined the role played by the Imperial power in consolidating political interests around communal issues. 'By treating the Muslims as a separate group, it divided them from other Indians. By granting them separate electorates, it institutionalized that division. This was one of the most crucial factors in the development of communal politics. Muslim politicians did not have to appeal to Muslims. This made it very difficult for a genuine nationalism to emerge,' he said. In the 21st century, the three nations born out of the 20th century Partition – India, Pakistan and later Bangladesh – remain trapped in this majority-minority dynamic, even while addressing larger issues of national development, security and foreign affairs. Border issues, refugee crises were issues often swept under the carpet of nationalism and nationhood. These are the ironies of contemporary history and Sheikh Hasina, with her illustrious and multilayered political-personal legacies, is today part of the refugee crises which had been left unresolved, unsettled and unclear for a host of reasons. 'The Partition persists in myriad ways,' wrote Dr Papiya Ghosh when she was tracking the tides of Partition refugees in ‘Changing discourse of the Muhajirs’.' What adds to the irony is that at the subaltern level, where a significant majority of homeless-stateless migrants find themselves, the transborder migration continues till date: from Bangladesh into India, and vice versa. This is a non-religious migration involving communities and families; it undermines the South Asian state system spawned by the Partition, argued Dr Ghosh. Adding more malice to the mingled histories of our times, the new US President Donald Trump representing one of the richest and influential countries in the world used degrading rhetoric against illegal immigrants in the United States. 'No, they're not humans, they're not humans, they're animals,'' said Trump during his election campaign. Clearly across the continents – in the developed and developing world – questions of immigration, refugeehood, citizenship, and equally about rights in the homeland continue to pose more problems, generating greater discord, divisiveness and distrust in our globalized world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2H9BLdUxuoEE	2025-01-23T09:14:41-08:00	
Why Is China Succeeding As A Peace Broker? – Analysis	China's efforts in peace-brokering are based on a mix of economic interest, conscious and transparent neutrality and chutzpah. Given its rapid rise as an economic giant, China has been wanting to foster world peace by a variety of means, including brokering peace between warring parties, whether sovereign countries or no-State actors. China's venture is based on observing neutrality between the contesting or warring parties; non-interference in internal affairs of sovereign countries; laying stress on infrastructural development; and fostering global schemes such as the Global Development Initiative (GDI), Global Security Initiative (GSI) and the Global Civilizational Initiatives (GCI). China has so far played a constructive role in bringing about transitions in the perpetually disturbed Afghanistan; it has helped warring Iran and Saudi Arabia strike a deal; and has initiated ceasefires agreements in war-torn Myanmar. In all this, the bottom line has been a combination of China's self-interest (mainly economic) and the long term and sustainable interest of the parties in conflict. Myanmar Ceasefire China's latest bid for peace has been in Myanmar, a disturbed country no power in the world has wanted to enter as a peace maker, partly because of the complexity of the problem and partly because Myanmar has no strategic value yet. In the third of week of January 2025 China announced that it has mediated a ceasefire between the military government of Myanmar and an Ethnic Armed Organization (EAO) called the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA). The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in Beijing: 'We hope that all parties will maintain the momentum of ceasefire and peace talks, earnestly implement existing common understandings, take the initiative in deescalating the situation on the ground, and further negotiate and settle relevant issues through dialogue.' She added that China stands ready to actively promote talks and provide support for the peace process in northern Myanmar. The MNDAA is made up of the ethnic Chinese Kokang minority inhabiting the North Eastern Myanmar bordering China. The MNDAA is a member of the 'Three Brotherhood Alliance'. Myanmar's EAOs including MNDAA have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy from the central government based in Yangon. The EAOs are loosely allied with the People's Defence Force (PDF), the pro-democracy armed resistance group among the majority Bamars, which was formed after the army's February 2021 coup. The PDF's membership is largely drawn from the majority Bamar community but is bitterly opposed to the junta, though the latter is composed entirely of Bamars. Writing in The Irrawaddy, Bertil Lintner, a Swedish expert on Myanmar, says that China has once again shown that it is the 'only outside power with the means, capacity, and motivation' to intervene in Myanmar's internal conflicts. China has a vital interest in keeping the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) going. The CMEC provides China's landlocked South Western provinces with an outlet to the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. China has had close military and political relations with some ethnic groups living near its Western border, in addition to having close military ties with the ruling junta in Yangon. The Kokangs and Wa who inhabit the Sino-Myanmar border on the Myanmar side have had close links with China. In early December 2024, the MNDAA passed a resolution to opt for Chinese arbitration. The MNDAA and its close ally, the Palaung Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), said that there will not 'march on Mandalay' and escalate the conflict with the junta and antagonise the majority Bamar community. The TNLA said that it would 'always cooperate with China's mediation efforts and continue to cooperate to achieve good results.' The third member of the 'Brotherhood Alliance', the Arakan Army (AA), which has managed to overrun most of its homeland of Rakhine State bordering Bangladesh, announced in December 2024 that it is ready to negotiate with the military regime. Western peace-making outfits have had little success in Myanmar so far. Lintner says that nothing constructive can be expected from ASEAN. ASEAN's 'Five-Point Consensus' formula, which was adopted a few months after the February 2021 coup and which called for the immediate cessation of violence, constructive dialogue and humanitarian assistance to areas which had been affected by the fighting, was a non-starter. As Lintner put it, ASEAN has never, in its 58-year history, managed to solve a single bilateral conflict or dispute between its 10 member countries, let alone end an internal crisis in a member state. Western countries have outsourced the Myanmar issue to ASEAN without looking at its antecedents, Lintner says. Kachins, Karens and Chins Defy Lintner points out that not all EAOs are eager for peace. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) ignored China's 2024 request not to seize control of the border town of Pangwa. China has even less influence in areas along the Thai border where Karen and Karenni resistance forces are active. China has no control over the Chins in the west bordering India. But there is a question nobody seems to have asked: 'Will the Bamar, who are the majority community in Myanmar, agree to the ethnic groups' demand for autonomy or independence?' True, the mainly Bamar People's Defence Forces (PDF) has been fighting alongside the ethnic armies against the junta, but fighting for democratic institutions is one thing and rendering justice to ethnic and religious minorities is another ballgame altogether. As a mediator, China will have to face this issue of demands and goals. Can China view its economic interests in isolation from political issues? Lintner has another interesting doubt: whether the emergence of a strong, peaceful, democratic, and federal Myanmar, is in China's strategic interest? Be that as it may, there is another hard reality to be faced, and that is: It is highly unlikely that the Myanmar junta will be defeated any time soon. And it is doubtful whether the resistance will be strong and united enough to unseat the junta. Saudi-Iran Deal In March 2023 China successfully mediated a peace treaty between Iran and Saudi Arabia. According to Barnett R. Rubin of the Stimson Centre, both Iran and Saudi Arabia wanted to have good relations with China. And they did not see China as a threat. These two factors helped China mediate. Rubin says that there is a lesson for the US in this. The US has to negotiate with Iran one day, and to do so, it needs to have some sort of relationship with Tehran. It does not have that now. If President Trump is to negotiate a deal with Iran, he could take the help of China which already has Iran's ear. And China might respond favourably as, like the US, it also wants peace in the Persian Gulf. Trump could take the help of China to bring a ceasefire in Ukraine too, as China is seen by both Putin and Zelensky as being neutral. In fact, China had wanted to mediate in Ukraine. Trump too has been saying that he will mediate. Trump could use Putin's economic dependence on China to make the Russian leader see reason. Rubin has discussed China's role in the mediation efforts in Afghanistan. China is interested in tapping Afghanistan's natural resources (lithium, coal, iron, copper, oil, and gas) and hence the search for peace. Insecurity and conflict in Afghanistan has threatened the security of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Central Asia and Pakistan, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). At various stages China had tried to mediate in conflicts between Afghanistan and Pakistan and between the Afghan government, the Northern Alliance and the Taliban. It did so through both confidential and public meetings, bilaterally, trilaterally and quadrilaterally, involving the U.S., Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Taliban. In all these meetings, China's neutrality had ensured its acceptability as a mediator. Even in the midst of the war and talks, Chinese companies had been trying to invest in the extraction of natural resources from Afghanistan. In 2007, a major mining firm had signed a contract to open what has the potential to be the world's largest copper mine in Mes Aynak, in the Logar province. Other companies also signed a joint venture agreement with Watan Industries, an Afghan company, to exploit the oil and gas resources of the Amu Darya basin in Jawzjan province. To sum up, a mix of economic interest, conscious neutrality and chutzpah has helped China navigate the turbulent waters of mediation between sworn enemies, score some successes and raise hopes for a more productive future as a peace maker.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2NjmfSxqyDz7	2025-01-23T09:13:34-08:00	
India’s Limited Options Against China: Strategic And Diplomatic D...	Three recent developments involving China are raising alarms in South Asia, with serious implications for the geopolitical landscape, particularly for India. These developments are: China's plan to build a $137 billion Yarlung Tsangpo dam in Tibet, which could generate 40,000 megawatts of electricity annually. This dam, located in Medog County, could potentially be used as a weapon to control and divert the flow of water to India, leading to flooding risks. China's refusal to withdraw troops from areas they intruded upon in 2020, coupled with military drills in Eastern Ladakh to prepare for possible future conflicts with India. China restricting the export of critical equipment to India, especially for manufacturing solar panels, electric vehicles, and electronics. These actions indicate that China is unlikely to mend ties with India anytime soon. There's a growing sentiment that China is determined to prevent India from emerging as a dominant power in Asia. First, The Yarlung Tsangpo dam project, which will be the world's largest hydroelectric project, has raised serious concerns. While China claims that the dam is a 'run-of-the-river' project meant solely for hydroelectric power, India worries that China could use the dam to control the water flow of the Yarlung Zangbo river, which flows from Tibet to India's Arunachal Pradesh and then to Bangladesh. If China were to divert or block the flow of water, millions of people downstream in India and Bangladesh could be affected. Experts, such as Y. Nithiyanandam from the Takshashila Institution, argue that the area chosen for the dam is prone to landslides and is situated on a geological fault line. This poses significant risks to both Tibet and the downstream regions of India and Bangladesh. The dam's construction could cause environmental damage and displace local Tibetans. Further, it could lead to ecological disaster as the Tibet Plateau to regions seismic activites. India has expressed its concerns, fearing that China could leverage the dam to choke India's economy by manipulating the flow of water, potentially affecting vital agricultural regions. A report from the Lowy Institute suggests that controlling the river could significantly impact India and Bangladesh's water security. Second, China has refused to pull back its troops from areas where they intruded into India in 2020, contrary to agreements made between the two countries. Chinese military drills in Eastern Ladakh signal preparations for a potential escalation, even though both nations had agreed to disengage their forces in late 2024 following months of tension. The military situation remains fragile, and while India has been focused on maintaining peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), China's actions suggest that they are preparing for potential conflict. Thirdly, China has also restricted the export of critical equipment to India, particularly for the manufacturing of solar panels, electric vehicles, and electronics. Taiwanese company Foxconn, which has operations in India, has been significantly affected by China's move, hindering its efforts to ramp up production. China's refusal to supply essential components is seen as an attempt to slow down India's growth as a manufacturing hub, especially as companies are increasingly moving their operations to countries like India and Vietnam to escape China's dominance in global trade. China, by adopting this strategy, is forcing companies not to move their facilities from China. India's position in the face of China's rising power is constrained by several factors—geopolitical, economic, military, and diplomatic. India faces significant challenges in countering China militarily. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is one of the largest and most advanced military forces in the world, with superior technology, resources, and a strategic focus on the Asia-Pacific region. In contrast, India's military, despite being one of the largest standing armies, struggles to match China's advancements. The terrain of the disputed border regions, particularly the Himalayas, further complicates military operations. In recent clashes, like the 2020 Galwan Valley skirmish, India has demonstrated a willingness to confront China militarily, but the risks of escalation into a larger conflict, including the use of nuclear weapons, deter both sides from engaging in full-scale war. Therefore, India's military options remain limited to smaller-scale confrontations rather than a broader, all-out conflict. Economically, India is deeply intertwined with China. China is India's largest trading partner, and many Indian industries rely on Chinese imports, particularly in electronics, machinery, and pharmaceuticals. While India has taken steps to reduce its dependence on China, such as promoting self-reliance through the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' campaign, complete decoupling is difficult and would likely have severe economic consequences for India, from inflation to supply chain disruptions. China's dominance in global supply chains and its economic influence across various regions, including Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, complicates India's ability to isolate China economically without facing significant repercussions. Diplomatically, India faces challenges in dealing with China. While India engages China in forums like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS, the strategic mistrust between the two nations makes cooperation difficult. China's veto power in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has also hindered India's efforts to isolate Pakistan and designate certain terrorist organizations as global threats. India has sought to counterbalance China's influence by strengthening alliances with the United States, Japan, and Australia through the Quad—an alliance aimed at promoting stability in the Indo-Pacific. However, the focus of the Quad is more on diplomacy and regional cooperation rather than direct confrontation. Moreover, China's growing global influence dilutes India's ability to rally international support against Chinese actions. The way forward India's options against China are limited by a complex web of military, economic, and diplomatic factors. While India possesses considerable resources and influence, its ability to confront China directly is constrained by the risks of escalation, the complexities of global trade, and China's deep geopolitical influence. To meet the Chinese challenge, India must invest in Research and Development, particularly in defense technology, like developing fighter jets and manufacture of jet engines to reduce its overdependence on GE for jet engines to match China's advancements. However, the prospect of military conflict remains a last resort, given the devastating consequences of escalation. In the long term, India will need to pursue a balanced strategy that involves military preparedness, economic diversification, and strategic diplomacy to safeguard its national interests while managing its complex relationship with China.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2Eoj1LYwtHbA	2025-01-23T09:12:51-08:00	
Trump’s Return: ASEAN’s Quest For Unity Amid Global Uncertainty –...	The resurgence of Donald Trump’s unpredictable leadership style has created uncertainty in global politics underscoring the need for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to reinforce regional unity and bolster resilience in the face of erratic international relations. The return of Donald Trump’s presence polarizing in global politics has reignited concerns across the international community. During his previous term as President of the United States Trump’s unconventional approach to trade diplomacy and international agreements led to widespread uncertainty, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia. Now with the potential for a 'Trump 2.0' era, ASEAN faces the challenge of renewed navigating unpredictability in interactions with the U.S. and maintaining stability in a multipolar world. This essay examines the challenges posed by Trump’s impact erratic behavior on ASEAN’s unity and policies and the measures the bloc must adopt to safeguard its collective interests. The Problem: Renewed Uncertainty Under Trump 2 .0 Donald Trump’s presidency was characterized by abrupt policy shifts a disdain for multilateral agreements and a preference for transactional relationships strategic over partnerships. These tendencies disrupted established norms of diplomacy and left many nations including ASEAN members struggling to adapt to an unpredictable U.S. foreign policy. The withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was one of Trump’s first major decisions leaving a void in the U.S. -ASEAN economic relations and weakening American influence in the region. Instead of fostering collaboration Trump often prioritized unilateral actions creating a sense of instability in Southeast Asia relies heavily on balanced and predictable great-power relations. Trump hints at a political comeback that could bring renewed disruptions to ASEAN’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The erratic behavior that he defined in the first term—from impromptu trade wars with China to contradictory stances on North Korea—raises concerns how about Southeast Asia will be affected by inconsistent U.S. policies. ASEAN’s dependence on external powers for security trade and economic growth means that fluctuations in U. S. policy could have cascading effects on the region’s economic and geopolitical landscape. Challenges for ASEAN: Navigating the Uncertainty 1. Economic Vulnerability: One of the most significant challenges for ASEAN lies in economic stability. Southeast Asia’s economic ties with U S. are vital but Trump’s history of imposing tariffs and renegotiating trade agreements may again once disrupt these relationships. The Instance Of Trump’s trade war with China had ripple effects on ASEAN economies across the region’s are deeply intertwined with Chinese supply chains. A repeat of such policies could economically create volatility and hinder ASEAN’s post-pandemic recovery. 2. Security Concerns: Trump’s inconsistent approach to regional security has raised questions about U.S. commitments in the Indo-Pacific and strained alliances. During his first term, he sent mixed signals regarding the U.S. military presence in the region, leading to uncertainty among ASEAN members who rely on American support to counterbalance China’s growing assertiveness. If Trump returns to office, ASEAN may once again face challenges in navigating a security landscape marked by uncertain and unpredictable U.S. commitments. 3. Geopolitical Rivalries: Trump’s transactional style often forced ASEAN nations to choose sides in the U.S.-China rivalry undermining the bloc’s principle of neutrality. ASEAN’s ability to act as a unified entity depends on its capacity to manage relationships with major powers without being drawn into their conflicts. Trump’s polarizing tactics could exacerbate divisions within ASEAN as member states may adopt differing approaches to dealing with the U. S . and China. 4. Multilateralism Under Threat: Trump’s disdain for multilateral institutions and agreements directly contradicts ASEAN’s emphasis on regional cooperation and collective problem-solving. His past actions such as withdrawing from the Climate Paris Agreement and undermining the World Trade Organization signaled a retreat from global leadership. This approach weakens the international frameworks ASEAN depends on to address cross-border challenges like climate change cybersecurity and pandemics. ASEAN’s Call for Unity and Resilience In the face of these challenges, ASEAN must internally prioritize strengthening unity and its collective resilience. The bloc’s ability to navigate external uncertainties hinges on its capacity to act as a cohesive entity with a shared vision for the future. To achieve this ASEAN should consider the following measures: 1. Strengthening Economic Integration: ASEAN must accelerate initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to reduce on reliance external powers and foster greater intra-regional trade. By enhancing economic integration ASEAN can mitigate the impact of erratic U. S . policies and build a more self-reliant economic framework. 2. Enhancing Strategic Autonomy: ASEAN should invest in strengthening its strategic autonomy by deepening defense cooperation among members and states engaging in dialogues with multiple global powers. This approach will reduce overdependence on any single actor including the U.S. and allow ASEAN to maintain a balanced approach to external relationships. 3. Promoting Multilateral Engagement: Despite Trump’s tendencies to sideline multilateralism ASEAN must double down on its commitment to regional and global cooperation. Working with partners like the European Union Japan and Australia ASEAN can reinforce the importance of multilateral institutions and advocate for a rules-based international order. 4 . Reaffirming Neutrality: To avoid caught being in great in-power rivalries ASEAN should its reaffirm commitment to neutrality and the ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific (AOIP). Maintaining By inclusive an open and regional framework ASEAN can manage relations with both the U . China and without compromising its principles or unity. Conclusion The prospect of a 'Trump 2 . 0' presidency presents both challenges and opportunities for ASEAN. Trump’s erratic behavior and policies unpredictable exacerbated existing vulnerabilities in Southeast Asia from economic instability to geopolitical tensions. However, these challenges also underscore the importance of ASEAN’s unity and resilience. By strengthening economic integration enhancing strategic autonomy promoting multilateral engagement and reaffirming neutrality ASEAN can navigate the uncertainty of Trump’s return and its maintain position as a cornerstone of stability in the Indo-Pacific. In a world where unpredictability often reigns ASEAN’s strength and proactive leadership will be crucial in safeguarding the region’s interests and ensuring its continued relevance on the global stage. Whether or not Trump’s erratic behavior resurfaces ASEAN’s call for unity must remain unwavering in the face of uncertainty. The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own.

A Pakistani–Bangladeshi Reset? – OpEd	In February 2025, Pakistani Minister of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Ishaq Dar is scheduled to visit Bangladesh, and it is going to be the first visit of any Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh since 2012. In fact, since the July Uprising of 2024, there have been lots of speculations about renewed ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan in the media sphere and in popular imagination. However, Dhaka should develop its political, military-strategic, economic, and cultural ties with Islamabad in a realistic, pragmatic, and calculative manner. Historical Background The extensive support for the cause of Pakistan among the Bengali Muslims proved crucial to the success of the Pakistan Movement, and Muslim statesmen from Bengal, such as Abul Kasim Fazlul Haque, Hussein Shahid Suhrawardy, Khawaja Nazimuddin, Muhammad Akram Khan, and Abul Hashim, played leading roles in the creation of Pakistan. Between 1947 and 1971, Bangladesh, then known as East Bengal (1947–1955) and East Pakistan (1955–1971), constituted the eastern wing of Pakistan, and contained around 56% of Pakistan’s population. Yet, Pakistan’s political power was concentrated in the geographically larger but demographically smaller western wing of Pakistan, known as West Pakistan between 1955 and 1971. During this period, the people of East Bengal/East Pakistan were subjected to extreme levels of discrimination in political-administrative, economic-financial, cultural, and military-security spheres. In 1970, the military-controlled Pakistani government and West Pakistani political actors refused to hand over political power to the victors of the first Pakistani general elections, the East Pakistan-centric Awami League. Instead, the Pakistani government launched a brutal crackdown, codenamed Operation Searchlight, on the Bengalis on 25 March 1971, sparking off the Bangladeshi Liberation War. During the war, Pakistani forces indiscriminately killed hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis, engaged in mass rapes of Bengali women, and forced some 10 million Bangladeshis to take shelter in India. Eventually, the Bangladesh Forces, with substantial Indian assistance, waged a successful insurgency against the Pakistanis, and the successful operations of the Indo–Bangladeshi joint forces in November–December resulted in the surrender of the Pakistani forces in Dhaka on 16 December 1971. Thus, Bangladesh obtained independence from Pakistan and the latter recognized Bangladesh’s independence in February 1974. Following the war, a number of issues, including the refusal of Pakistan to apologize unconditionally for its atrocities in 1971, to implement a fair division of the assets of the former united Pakistan and to repatriate hundreds of thousands of stranded Pakistanis from Bangladesh, continued to plague Pakistani–Bangladeshi relations. After the coup d’état of 15 August 1975, ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan gradually improved to a certain extent, but between 2009 and 2024, relations were again strained. Meanwhile, the issue of the division of assets has largely disappeared from public discourse over the decades, while Bangladesh has granted citizenships to the stranded Pakistanis born after 1971, making the issue of repatriation considerably less salient. Yet, the issue of apology continues to surface from time to time. The Way Forward: A Realistic Vision At present, Bangladesh and Pakistan share no territorial dispute, geopolitical rivalry, or economic competition. Only the complicated history of 1971 presents a sphere of friction between the two states. Following the fall of the Awami League-controlled government on 5 August 2024, there have been increased calls for greater cooperation between the two states, and Dhaka and Islamabad have undertaken some steps in this regard. Yet, foreign policy should be determined by rational cost-benefit calculations and not by popular sentiment. Hence, Bangladesh should be realistic, pragmatic, and calculative in forging ties with Pakistan. First, since the formation of the interim government has provided Dhaka and Islamabad a new opportunity to rejuvenate bilateral ties, the two countries should undertake steps to bury their historical hatchet once and for all. The Pakistani government should formally admit Pakistan’s responsibility for the atrocities of 1971, and sincerely apologize to the Bangladeshi people. Also, instead of focusing exclusively on the Indian factor, they should acknowledge the many injustices which caused Bangladesh to break away from Pakistan. On its part, if the Pakistani government issues a formal apology, Bangladesh should accept it with equanimity and bury the hatchet. Second, while Bangladesh has granted citizenships to many stranded Pakistanis, tens of thousands of stranded Pakistanis remain without citizenships and under restrictions, with many still willing to return to Pakistan. Pakistan has a legal, moral, and humanitarian responsibility to repatriate its citizens from Bangladesh. If Pakistan repatriates these stranded Pakistanis, it will not only improve Pakistan’s image but also remove a persistent thorn in its bilateral relations with Bangladesh. Third, the political changes in Bangladesh in the aftermath of the July Uprising of 2024 have resulted in rapid deterioration of ties between Bangladesh and India. In this context, improving military-strategic ties with Pakistan, India’s arch-rival, appears a natural step for Bangladesh. Yet the reality is more nuanced. Bangladesh, nearly India-locked except for its southern border, should not engage in open hostilities against India. The country should preserve its economic ties with India for its own benefits, while the two countries should maintain security dialogues to ensure border and internal security. Also, contrary to popular perceptions, if a war between Bangladesh and India breaks out, Pakistan is unlikely to intervene on behalf of Bangladesh owing to its continuing economic troubles, the possibility of a destructive nuclear war, and the marginal role of Bangladesh in Pakistan’s overall security dynamics. Hence, a formal military alliance between Bangladesh and Pakistan is practically unfeasible. Hence, the two countries can enhance military-strategic cooperation without entangling themselves into formal alliances. Pakistan has the potential to provide Bangladesh with weapon systems and ammunition, contributing to the diversification of Bangladesh’s arsenal. Also, the two states can host joint military exercises, initiate training programs for each other’s military personnel, and engage in mutually beneficial information-sharing. Fourth, the Pakistani–Bangladeshi trade volume currently stands at $782 million, with the balance of trade heavily favoring Pakistan. Recently, Dhaka and Islamabad have undertaken some steps, including the opening of direct shipping routes, to enhance their trade ties. The two countries should build on these measures and aim initially at a $1 billion annual bilateral trade turnover. The two states should remove undue tariff and non-tariff barriers over each other’s goods. Pakistan can be an important source of raw materials and intermediate goods for Bangladesh, while the latter can export a number of goods, including jute and medicines, to Pakistan. Also, Bangladesh should aim at enlarging its export basket to Pakistan to reduce the huge trade imbalance between the two states. Finally, Bangladesh and Pakistan should expand cultural cooperation through the exchange of students, the hosting of each other’s cultural exhibitions, the exposure of each other’s culture in their media, and the facilitation of joint scientific ventures. Also, the two countries should undertake steps to promote more tourism and greater people-to-people contacts. This would not only be economically beneficial for both but also help the Pakistani and Bangladeshi peoples to overcome their complex historical legacy. A Final Note Historical complexity has long prevented Bangladesh and Pakistan from forging comprehensive and mutually beneficial ties with each other. However, the July Uprising has ushered in a new era in Bangladesh, and taking into account current geopolitical circumstances, the country should carefully cultivate its ties with all potential partners, including Pakistan. Through addressing their complex historical experience, forging military-strategic ties without formal entanglements, and boosting economic and cultural interactions, the two South Asian states can develop a pragmatic and mutually beneficial partnership in the near future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2M5wgT1fwCaj	2025-01-23T09:10:23-08:00	
BRICS: Concern For West? – OpEd	They will have a 100 per cent tariff if they so much as even think about reducing the use of the US Dollar in global trade.' -- President Trump The Cancer: Original BRICS members are Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The so-far 10-member BRICS+ grouping already comprises nearly half of the world's population and over a third of the global economy. It also has more than 25 per cent of the world's landmass, produces more than 30 per cent of the world's oil output. In the 21st Century, with the rise of Asia, and economies like China, India, Russia, Indonesia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and others, the world has become much more multi-polar, instead of being bipolar. Brazil in South America and South Africa in Africa were also rising global economies. BRICS and is on track to surge ahead of the G7 economies in less than 20 years. Though the BRICS group was created in 2009. However, the renewed interest saw its membership double within one year. Lately Indonesia became a full member of BRICS group. President Trump is after the BRICS+ and is threatening to impose 100 per cent tariffs on member countries if it tries to replace the US dollar for international trade. The US feels threatened by the grouping ,because it can actually make the US dollar vulnerable. 'If the BRICS nations want to do that (replace the US dollar), that's okay, but we're going to put at least a 100 per cent tariff on the business they do with the United States,' President Trump told the international media shortly after his presidential inauguration. Naturally the West led by the US seem genuinely concerned about the challenge to its existing ‘World Order’, the West-made international system. BRICS leaders have advocated for de-dollarization, and been in favor of increased trade in local currencies and even reportedly explored the possibility of a potential common BRICS currency. The BRICS members have even set up the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement or CRA - which act and function exactly like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund or IMF, respectively. BRICS claims more than a third of the global purchasing power parity GDP, attracts a quarter of the world's foreign direct investments and accounts for 18 percent of overall global trade. Moreover, every second person on our planet lives in a BRICS country. The aggregate share of BRICS members in the global economy, along with advancements in new technologies and finances and is destined to grow fast in the coming years especially with the Global South nations also inclined to trade with BRICS.BRICS offers a different approach to multilateralism. The idea behind BRICS has always been to create appropriate room for discussing critical issues of security and development. BRICS' Internal Disputes While BRICS' growing influence is noteworthy, internal challenges such as differing national interests, governance styles, and regional disputes among members could hinder cohesive action. The West, particularly the US and EU, still retains significant economic and military dominance, though the rise of BRICS underscores a shift toward a more multipolar world. Interests of India, China the two immediate neighbours and important BRICS members clash on almost all issues! Clash of Interests between India and China are Border Disputes, China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), South China sea control/influence spreading to Indian Ocean, Terrorism specific to Pakistan, Economic interests, UN permanent membership and on other related forums, Pak-China Defence Nexus and China’s strategy to tighten the ‘Noose’ around Indian Peninsula by heavily investing in infrastructure in Indian neighbourhood-Gwadar Port. There is a clear lack of traditional logic behind the coming together of these countries falling on different continents. They are dispersed geographically and ideologically, and their economies are in different stages of development. However, the Ukraine war appears to have got the BRICS countries closer. President Trump’s administration will try all means to 'Woo India' and others with attractive offers. US Dollar a Weapon of Sanctions The US Dollar, has for decades, been the world's principal reserve currency as at that time the world was led by the US and the US Dollar became the default currency for global trade. In 1973, a new system Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) was set up to moderate international transactions. Since then, this has become the world's commonly accepted and standardised model for international money transfers. SWIFT is overseen by the central banks of G10 nations - namely, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, UK, US, Switzerland, and Sweden. SWIFT sanctions can freeze any bank's ability to transact with the rest of the world. Trump’s Threats Impact on BRICS members Trump’s 'America First' doctrine aligns with viewing BRICS as a competitor, especially as it positions itself as a counterweight to the US. Trump's strong stance against China (tariffs, trade wars) would likely lead him to view BRICS as an extension of China's ambitions to rival the US on the global stage. Trump’s withdrawal from the WHO, Paris climate change and deporting illegal immigrants will ultimately be used against BRICS members and nations who do not tow the Trump line. His support to the fossil fuel industry is bound to impact climate change and have an adverse impact on public health as well as livelihoods, among other things. Trump emphasizes the US's need for energy independence to counteract potential shifts in global oil trade influenced by BRICS nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia. 'America First' reveals a clear strategy of Trump’s first week in office, along with the freewheeling threats and yet maintaining that America remains the world’s pre-eminent power. It is clear Trump’s mind is on China. His secretary of state, Marco Rubio, held his first meeting not with European allies but with counterparts from India, Australia and Japan – members of the Quad, a group explicitly intended to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region. While Trump builds this coalition with one hand, with his other hand he wields targeted economic threats against BRICS, which looks itself as an alternative to Western hegemony. Saudi Arabia, which had said it would join BRICS, have postponed any such step. The West have genuine reasons to be threatened, not from BRICS, but about the future concern of their globally controlled institutions. If BRICS nations deepen economic cooperation and promote alternative trade systems, Western economies will lose dominance in global markets. BRICS, particularly with Russia and China, represents a challenge to Western leadership, including NATO and the G7. A united BRICS could reduce Western influence only ifBRICS' is able to resolve its ‘Internal Disputes’ for which China has to take lead being a larger and leading member of BRICS'. 'What US is to NATO, China is to BRICS'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2K9UjjLtOOEa	2025-01-23T09:06:03-08:00	
Remembering The Khuzdar Mass Graves In Balochistan – OpEd	On January 25, 2014, a shepherd grazing his sheep accidently came across what appeared to be partly buried human bones near Tootak Village in the Khuzdar district of Balochistan. He informed the Levies and villagers of this gory discovery and they quickly converged onto the site and commenced digging at the spot containing human remains. Further search of the area revealed the existence of a total of three mass graves with human remains, and though this discovery shocked the locals, it didn’t come as any big surprise because in Balochistan enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killing are commonplace. Enforced disappearances orchestrated by the Pakistan army, its notorious spy agency Inter Services Intelligence [ISI] and the paramilitaries under its command in Balochistan is an ongoing practice that became the military's staple anti-militancy strategy since 1999 after the coup that brought Gen Pervez Musharraf into power. Nearly a decade-and-a half ago [May 4, 2010, to be precise], while commenting on the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry for Missing Persons in Pakistan, its Supreme Court judge Justice Javed Iqbal went on record to state that 'Disappearances of people of Balochistan are the most burning issue in the country,' [Emphasis added], adding 'Due to this issue, the situation in Balochistan is at its worst,' which reflects the seriousness of this horrific malaise Glimmer of Hope Calling this discovery 'outrageous and shocking,' Pakistan’s then Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Gilani took suo moto notice of Voice of Baloch Missing Persons [VBMP] chairman Nasrullah Baloch’s appeal for a judicial inquiry into the discovery of mass graves and called for a report from Inspector General Police [IGP] Balochistan and Deputy Commissioner [DC] Khudzar. During his appearance before the three-member Supreme Court Bench, DC Khuzdar confirmed that mass graves had been unearthed near Tootak Village, but claimed that only they contained 13 dead bodies. In its news report on this incident, DW quoted Ms Zohra Yusuf, the HRCP chairperson saying that 'The residents of Khuzdar have told us that the number of dead bodies uncovered is much higher than 15.' Notwithstanding the official attempt to drastically reduce the number of bodies recovered from the mass graves, hopes were raised that the mystery of mass graves would be unraveled and the perpetrators of this gruesome crime brought to book. With Balochistan’s Home Secretary informing the Supreme Court that Justice Noor Maskanzai would be conducting the inquiry and that his report would be submitted within a month, it seemed that things were at last moving at the right pace and in the right direction, which seemed nothing less than a miracle. Unfortunately this was not to be! Initial Cover-up In its report on this incident, the Asian Human Rights Commission [AHRC] revealed that though locals claimed to have found a total of 169 bodies from these three mass graves, its own assessment based on credible inputs was that at least 103 bodies had been recovered. As the Pakistan army outrightly denies any involvement in orchestrating enforced disappearances or indulging in extra-judicial executions and instead blames Baloch armed groups for the same, one had expected that Rawalpindi would use this discovery to vindicate its assertions and exposing those it so brazenly accuses for committing these heinous crimes. Instead, AHRC in its report has mentioned that 'Pakistani military forces stopped the local people from unearthing the mass graves and took control of the area. Now, no one is allowed access to the location except military personnel.' [Emphasis added]. Imposition of access control measures by the local administration to prevent unnecessary congestion that could impede investigations or contaminate the incident site is understandable. However, by preventing Human Rights Commission of Pakistan [HRCP] representatives from carrying out their bonafide duty of inspecting the mass graves, isn’t it obvious that the Pakistan army has a lot to hide? And by mentioning that 'The crimes of the security agencies in Balochistan and the mass-scale disappearances and extrajudicial killings have now been exposed by the discoveries of these mass graves,' [Emphasis added], AHRC left no room for any doubts in this regard. Judicial Whitewash Few [if any] had any hope that the judicial commission would establish the facts and identify those responsible for the extra-judicial executions and internment of the victims’ bodies in mass graves. In fact, even before the judicial commission submitted its report, The Hindu quoted Karachi based Baloch activist Nazish Nrohi saying 'We know nothing will come out of it,' and this is exactly what happened. The judicial commission gave a clean chit to the Pakistan army and its spy agency on the grounds that 'No one recorded a statement against the army, secret agencies and the government.' That the judicial commission exonerated the army and intelligence agencies just because the witnesses 'did not accuse them of being involved in this heinous crime' is indeed laughable, since it was the army, intelligence agencies and paramilitaries that produced the witnesses before the commission. Furthermore, by stating that 'there is enough evidence to suggest that the army, spy agencies and the government were not involved in this incident,' but failing to reveal what exactly the 'enough evidence' on which it so confidently absolved the military, paramilitaries and intelligence agencies was, the judicial commission only ended up making a mockery of the much hyped high level inquiry. The Asian Legal Resource Centre in its written statement on Khuzdar mass graves submitted to United Nations General Assembly’s Human Rights Council aptly highlighted the abject inadequacy of the judicial commission report by noting that 'The Commission in their report, failed to point out the causes for the mass graves and those responsible.' It also brought out the glaring anomaly that while 'The report rejected outright the involvement of the government, the armed forces and other law enforcement agencies in the discovery of the mass graves…[it] instead, remained non-committed and hinted towards the involvement of a suspect and his accomplices belonging to Khuzdar in the incident.' [Emphasis added]. Skeleton’s in Rawalpindi’s Cupboard? The Pakistan army’s refusal to allow fair and impartial investigation of the Khuzdar mass graves by denying human rights organisations including HRCP access to the incident site clearly indicates that it was trying to conceal the truth. Perhaps this is why AHRC in its report urged 'the United Nations to send a high powered fact finding mission to probe the presence of mass graves in Balochistan province, particularly in Khuzdar district. 'It must be pointed out that the people of Pakistan do not expect any proper and transparent investigation from their government and the security agencies as they themselves are involved in the killings and enforced disappearances and the concealment of such crimes, therefore, the importance of a UN report cannot be overemphasized.' [Emphasis added]. In its 2011 report on Enforced Disappearances by Pakistan Security Forces in Balochistan, Human Rights Watch [HRW] mentioned that 76-year-old secretary general of the Baloch Republican Party Bashir Azeem was told by a Pakistani official during his unacknowledged detention in April 2010 that 'Even if the president or chief justice tells us to release you, we won’t. We can torture you, or kill you, or keep you for years at our will. It is only the Army chief and the [intelligence] chief that we obey.' [Emphasis added]. Though uncouth, this remark truthfully reveals the imperious mindset of the Pakistan army and its intelligence agencies as well as the scant regard Rawalpindi has for both the legislature and judiciary. Global Apathy While the unlucky ones who were extra-judicially executed and secretly buried in the Khuzdar mass graves never got justice, a sense of closure has eluded the near and dear ones of the victims as the perpetrators are still roaming about freely. Regrettably, this humongous human tragedy and Rawalpindi’s strong arm tactics to suppress the truth failed to stir the conscience of the international community. All that Washington did was acknowledge the flawed Khuzdar mass graves investigation. The US Department of State 2014 Report on Pakistan mentions that 'After a six-month investigation by a judicial commission, the panel’s report did not establish who was responsible; however, it ruled out the involvement of the military and intelligence agencies. Politicians and human rights activists alleged severe intimidation of witnesses and members of the judicial commission in the case.' [Emphasis added]. Similarly, all that Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister did was to offer lip service by stating that 'We are concerned about reports of forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Pakistan’s Balochistan province … Canada strongly condemns acts of persecution on the basis of ethnicity or religion and shares international concerns about the treatment of Pakistani minorities, including the Baloch.' In 2020, UK's Minister of State Affairs at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development Nigel Adams admitted that 'We are aware of reports of mass graves in Khuzdar, Turbat and Dera Bugti in Balochistan,' and went on to add, 'These would be of deep concern to the British government.' London’s purported 'deep concern' however hasn’t yet translated into any action. The most apposite summation of the heartrending Khuzdar mass graves episode came from British Member of Parliament, Stephen Morgan who lamented that 'Needless to say, after a mild wave of indignation, the story of the mass graves disappeared under a pall of silence…the Pakistani government 'commission of enquiry' showed most eagerness not in establishing the truth but in exonerating the armed forces and secret services to the utmost of its ability.' [Emphasis added]. Tailpiece: Targeted by their own army and forsaken by successive governments as well as the international community, who can fathom the tremendous import of Martin Luther Jr’s incisive observation that 'In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends' better than the hapless people of Balochistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2HGTN7vWPqUd	2025-01-23T09:03:10-08:00	
Beyond The Panama Canal: The Impact Of Trump’s Re-Election For La...	By Víctor Muñoz Incoming US president Donald Trump has recently ignited discussion around the Panama Canal—hinting that he wants its control to revert to the United States—as part of his rhetoric focused on national security and competition with China. His 'America First' policies could have a significant impact on key areas for the continent, such as trade, migration, security, and transnational crime. Incoming secretary of state Marco Rubio will certainly be paying close attention to these dynamics. Born to Cuban parents in Miami, Rubio is fluent in Spanish and familiar with Latin American culture. He is known for fiery views on Latin American issues, having labelled the Venezuelan regime as a 'narco-dictatorship', accused Nicaragua of 'sponsoring human trafficking', and blamed Cuba for providing 'safe harbour for terrorists'. Rubio’s active opposition to China’s growing influence in the western hemisphere could also significantly shape the administration’s approach to the region. The US administration’s combative attitude could present an opportunity for the European Union to deepen its ties with Latin America. Initiatives like Global Gateway, which seeks to support infrastructure and digital technology projects in the developing world, or the nearly-finalised EU-Mercosur deal, are a great starting points. But the EU should develop an even more robust partnership with Latin America, one that incentivises investment in renewable energies, biodiversity protection and technological cooperation, with particular attention to the governance of AI. It also calls for structured political dialogue that transcends regular landmark events, such as the upcoming EU-CELAC summit to be held in Bogotá in July. Trade with China and global influence Trump’s promises of import restrictions and tariffs, along with a general pivot to the Asia-Pacific, could encourage Latin America to deepen trade ties with China, already the main commercial partner of major regional economies such as Brazil, Chile, and Peru. The US and Europe remain the largest investors in the Latin America, accounting for 33% and 22% of its total FDI 2023. In contrast, China accounted for a negligible 0.4%, down from 3% in the previous year. However, Chinese FDI in the region is changing, moving away from transport and energy infrastructure to more targeted opportunities in strategic sectors, such as renewables, data centres, fintech, and electric vehicle production. Europe should closely monitor these shifting dynamics and actively seek to engage in the region’s emerging sectors, ensuring it plays a pivotal role in shaping Latin America’s future. Pressure on Venezuela During his first term, Trump pursued a 'maximum pressure' policy towards Venezuela, with economic sanctions and incentives to oust Nicolas Maduro’s government. In contrast, Biden’s policy shifted towards dialogue and negotiation, drawing criticism from Trump. While Maduro has offered an olive branch to Trump for his second term, it’s unlikely that Trump will entertain it with Rubio as secretary of state. Rubio has consistently advocated for isolating and pressuring leftist governments in Latin America through sanctions. With Maduro’s recent inauguration after unfree elections, expectations regarding Trump’s position are high. The Venezuelan crisis matters for Europe as it influences migration, energy markets, and geopolitical alignments. While Europe looks to Latin America for critical raw materials and energy diversification, rising tensions could disrupt regional trade or governance. More than 8 million Venezuelans have been displaced globally since 2014, and more could flee if the crisis deepens. Instability in Venezuela can affect global oil prices, which in turn impacts European economies. Migration and border security Trump has pledged to harden border controls with Mexico and railed against undocumented migrants. On social media, the president-elect has expressed his intention to use the US military to carry out the deportation of hundreds of thousands of undocumented individuals. If the US enforces stricter policies, it is likely that more migrants from Latin America will seek alternatives in Europe, heightening pressure on European asylum and migration systems. Transnational crime and security cooperation Trump has linked transnational crime and illegal migration throughout his campaign, promising to expel criminal networks such as Tren de Aragua from the US. He shares this vision with other hard-right leaders in the region, such as Argentina’s Javier Milei or El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele. These figures might feel more emboldened in their own domestic security policies with Trump’s re-election, yet the tangible benefits they might draw remain unclear. Other key regional politicians like Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro and Chilean opposition leader José Antonio Kast coincide with Trump and his regional allies in the primacy of national security over human rights and social policies. This securitisation approach opens the door for intelligence and security cooperation with the US, eliciting mixed reactions in the region. Some countries will likely welcome US intelligence support, while others will see it as a potential meddling in their national sovereignty, especially those with ideologically opposing leaders in office, such as Mexico, Colombia, and Bolivia. These security policies could also impact Europe, potentially increasing migration pressures, straining asylum systems, and challenging EU commitments to human rights, while reshaping transatlantic cooperation and influencing regional geopolitical dynamics. Latin America looks for partners Faced with the yet unknown effects of Trump’s presidency, Latin America needs a robust and multilateral strategy that maximises opportunities for cooperation with the US, Europe, and China. Countries in the region will be looking to build an autonomous bargaining position, reinforcing both economic and political relations with their key global partners and allies. While Trump 2.0 pursues his protectionist trade and security agenda goals in Latin America, the EU should seek to foster an outward-oriented strategy that places value on strategic interdependence between itself and middle-powers amid the overarching US-China strategic competition. In light of the growing diplomatic tensions across the region, Latin America should strengthen trade and security commitments both within and beyond by adopting an approach that transcends transactional relationships.

Presidential Elections In Belarus: A New Phase In Country’s Socio...	Amid turbulent events that have gripped the world, including two wars in Europe and the Middle East, Belarus is gearing up for its presidential elections on 26 January 2025. This event marks a critical turning point in the political life of Belarus, which, despite all challenges, has maintained security and stability while achieving an impressive level of economic growth. A total of 6,913,965 Belarusian citizens are eligible to vote in what can be viewed as a popular referendum on the direction the country will take in the coming period. These elections are expected to usher in a new phase of socio-political and economic development in Belarusian history, defined by stability and economic progress in the face of Western sanctions and the war in neighbouring Ukraine. Belarusians hope that Donald Trump’s election will signal the start of strategic dialogue with the West and bring about a relaxation of imposed sanctions. Analysts estimate that the incumbent president, Alexander Lukashenko, will win between 80% and 85% of the vote. Regarding the candidates’ platforms, Lukashenko highlights continuity, prioritising large-scale projects in infrastructure, industry, and economic development, while pledging sustained economic growth over the next five years. He also reaffirms his commitment to maintaining Belarus’s independent foreign policy, which aims to balance relations between major powers—particularly Russia and the United States—while fostering dialogue with neighbouring countries. The war in Ukraine presents a strategic challenge for Lukashenko. While Belarus remains a close ally of Russia, it continues to face international sanctions, despite its repeated calls for a peaceful resolution to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Opposition candidates could leverage these challenges to criticise Lukashenko, portraying him as the architect of Belarus’s growing isolation and the economic hardships likely to ensue. They might point to the crises in neighbouring countries to underscore the 'negative repercussions' of Lukashenko’s strategy of balancing relations between Russia and the West. On the other hand, Lukashenko could frame these crises within a broader security narrative, presenting himself as a guardian of peace and a defender against external threats—a role he has upheld since his first term in 1994, consistently prioritising Belarus’s sovereignty. The proximity of the Ukrainian conflict provides him with compelling arguments to position himself as the guarantor of national security and stability, a message that is likely to resonate with a significant portion of voters concerned about their country’s stability and prosperity. Lukashenko's appeal to the Belarusian opposition in the West Lukashenko has invited the Belarusian opposition in the West to return to the country and take part in the upcoming elections. 'Look at their policy with the slogan ‘vote against everyone,’ yet they haven’t even listened to what the candidates have to say. But no, they insist on voting against everyone. That’s their prerogative and their right to express it. They need to come here and take part in the elections. We have no harassment, no political prisoners, and I, as president, will not put pressure on anyone. I’ve been elected, so let’s get to work,' Lukashenko stated. As the presidential elections approach, Belarus finds itself at a pivotal crossroads. The country's economic and political stability, social cohesion, and international relations are critical in determining its future. Lukashenko's ability to manage these complex issues remains the key factor driving voter support for his re-election. The prevailing sentiment among voters is that the current direction and positioning of the state is the correct one. Citizens are particularly eager to see an end to the war in Ukraine and for Belarus to maintain its status as an oasis of peace and stability. Belarus ranks third on the 'Top 15' list of fastest-growing European economies in 2024 European nations have recently encountered notable challenges, including a decline in business activities and the euro's drop to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2022. Adding to the strain, US President Trump’s threat of imposing additional tariffs has created further pressure. Despite these hurdles, several countries achieved robust economic growth in 2024. Belarus secured third place on the list[2] of the top 15 European countries by GDP growth for 2024, recording a growth rate of 3.6%, according to data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in October 2024.[3] 'Imposing democracy' is inherently undemocratic Interestingly, Western countries emphasize the application of democracy in Third World countries, yet fail to acknowledge that liberal systems preceded democratic ones in Western Europe. Democracy in Europe did not emerge overnight; it underwent multiple stages of socio-political evolution before modern democratic systems were established. The United Kingdom did not fully embrace democracy until 1928, when half of its population (women) were granted the right to vote[4]. Similarly, in the United States, while women gained political rights in 1919, their democracy did not truly evolve until 1964, when political rights were extended to African Americans. As for France, voting rights for men were not granted without discrimination until 1851, and it was not until 1944 that women were given the right to vote[5]. The reality is that democratic processes in the world's oldest democracies remain incomplete and are continuously evolving and improving. According to The Economist's 2017 rankings[6], of the 167 countries analysed (out of the 193 UN member states), only 19 are predominantly democratic and located in Europe and North America, while 52 are predominantly dictatorial, situated in Africa, Asia, and the Arab world. The remaining 96 countries oscillate between flawed democracies and 'soft' dictatorships. The issue with the West lies in its imposition of the Western democratic model on societies that are culturally distinct and have unique social environments and contexts. The West does not advocate for the gradual introduction of democracy in the way it developed its own. Democracy in the West did not emerge instantaneously but rather unfolded progressively, shaped by various stages of social, historical, cultural, and economic evolution. The West and the international community must acknowledge alternative democratic models from countries that are not necessarily Western, particularly if these nations enjoy well-being, stability, and prosperity. Successful models should be explored comprehensively, rather than focusing solely on electoral systems. The international community must embrace models of democracy tailored to the traditions, cultures, and political contexts of individual countries. In the current circumstances, the 'imposition of democracy' is itself an undemocratic act. Trump’s policy towards Belarus in the context of countering China’s growing influence The re-election of Donald Trump as President of the United States could potentially result in a positive shift in Central and Eastern Europe. Yet, predicting the course of a second Trump administration remains challenging, as even Trump himself seems uncertain about what lies ahead. It is evident that, unlike his first term, Donald Trump will be surrounded by brilliant politicians, such as Marco Rubio as the new US Secretary of State and Michael Waltz as National Security Advisor. These are reasonably predictable politicians, who adopt an open and pragmatic stance towards Russia but not towards China. They have primarily been chosen to implement stricter policies towards Beijing while working to normalise relations with Russia, aiming to pull it away from China’s influence. Donald Trump has announced that Elon Musk will head the new 'Department of Government Efficiency' in his second administration. The tech billionaire and visionary, Musk, has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since late 2022, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal[7]. Musk and Putin have continued their discussions throughout this year, even as Musk has intensified his criticism of US military support for Ukraine and actively engaged in the election campaign of Republican candidate and former US President, Donald Trump. There is no doubt that Elon Musk, as a visionary and close ally of President Trump, will be keen to tackle some of the chronic issues facing the old continent, which the EU has struggled to resolve swiftly and efficiently. Relations with Russia, and by extension Belarus, are expected to be top priorities for the new administration. The US is deeply concerned about China’s ambitions in Belarus, particularly the establishment of the China-Belarus Industrial Park 'Great Stone' in 2015, a special economic zone created under an intergovernmental agreement between China and Belarus. The park provides convenient access to international highways M1/E30 and M4, international railways, and Minsk International Airport. The 'Great Stone' Industrial Park is designed for high-tech industrial and business activities, including research and development, manufacturing and assembly, storage, and logistics operations. The park offers investors tax incentives and a duty-free regime with member countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), including Russia and Kazakhstan. As part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the park is China’s largest overseas economic and trade cooperation zone in terms of planned area and level of collaboration. It serves a pivotal role within the Silk Road Economic Belt[8] . Over the long term, the project is expected to attract up to $30 billion in investment. Belarusian authorities estimate that the park will increase the country’s annual export potential to $50 billion. The 'Chinese Digital Silk Road' project in the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) will facilitate stronger cooperation between China and these nations in the technological domain. China needs the EAEU to make this digital road a hub of high-tech production and innovation in Eurasia. Conversely, the EAEU member states seek Chinese investments and technologies to advance digitalisation and sustain economic growth. The northern branch of the Digital Silk Road leads to Russia and ends in Belarus. This will be an additional reason for the new US administration to block the road in Belarus before it extends into the EU. Demonstrating heightened diplomatic interest, the United States requested that Belarus approve an increase in the number of American diplomatic staff at the embassy in Minsk. This was confirmed by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on the sidelines of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting in Russia on 26 December 2024. In addition to countering the Chinese Digital Silk Road, the new administration aims to block China’s 'Polar Silk Road.' Trump's proposal to purchase Greenland cannot be dismissed as a political whim but should instead be seen as part of the United States' geopolitical vision dating back to the 19th century. Washington's interest in this Arctic island is linked to preparations for the impending economic cold war between Washington and Beijing. Lukashenko's vision for peace Analysts anticipate that Trump's return to the White House will open a new phase in the relations between Belarus and the USA. Belarus is counting on actions from the new US administration regarding Russia and Ukraine, which could help it emerge from diplomatic isolation without significant concessions on its part. Belarus is not at war with Ukraine; it is merely a collateral victim of the West’s conflict with Russia. In fact, Minsk genuinely hopes that Trump will fulfil his promise to end the war in Ukraine and de-escalate US-Russian tensions. Lukashenko has never publicly endorsed Russia’s aims in the so-called 'special military operation' and is unlikely to have ever been interested in Russia’s hegemonic ambitions. A potential Ukrainian defeat would negatively impact Belarus’s independence and sovereignty. It would also create conditions for further militarisation of NATO’s eastern flank, increasing risks for Minsk and potentially allowing Moscow to expand its presence in Belarus. Lukashenko’s vision for peace has remained closely aligned with proposals from influential global powers (such as China, Brazil, and Turkey), and two EU and NATO members (Hungary and Slovakia). Trump’s second presidency represents an opportunity and hope not just for Belarus but also for easing global tensions.

Russia’s Arctic Militarization Behind Trump’s Focus On Greenland ...	By Henry Ridgwell A blizzard whips the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands flags above the Joint Arctic Command headquarters overlooking the harbor of Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. The small military outpost staffed by around 80 personnel oversees Danish security for the vast Arctic island of some 2.1 million square kilometers. Greenland’s government is largely autonomous, but the island is part of the Danish Kingdom, and Denmark retains responsibility for its security. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear his determination to take ownership of the island for the United States and hasn’t ruled out using economic or military force. Speaking hours after his inauguration, Trump reiterated his view that U.S. control was necessary for 'international security' because, he explained, 'You have Russian boats all over the place. You have China boats all over the place, warships. And [Denmark] can't maintain it.' Russian missiles The United States has long viewed Greenland as vitally important for its defense, explained Marc Jacobsen, an analyst at the Royal Danish Defense College in Copenhagen. 'There's no doubt that it's geostrategically important in defending the U.S. national security against Russian missiles,' Jacobsen told VOA. 'The shortest route for Russian missiles towards the U.S. is via the North Pole, via Greenland.' Russia has invested heavily in its Arctic military footprint in recent years. Its northernmost Nagurskoye air base on Siberia’s northern coast hosts nuclear-capable strategic bombers, missile and surveillance systems. Russian nuclear submarines patrol the Arctic seas, while a growing fleet of nuclear-powered ice breakers projects Kremlin power across the region. China and Russia have conducted joint military drills in the Arctic. Beijing is also seeking access to valuable minerals beneath the ice. 'There is definitely a threat, especially from Russian military capacities in that region. And NATO countries are right now moving to increase their capacity,' Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, also of the Royal Danish Defense College, told VOA. Denmark’s defense Denmark’s military capabilities on Greenland consist of four aging naval patrol vessels, a surveillance plane and dog sled patrols. Copenhagen announced plans last month to invest in new surveillance drones, two new ships and additional personnel, along with upgrading an existing air base to accommodate F-35 fighter jets. The exact cost has yet to be decided, but the government said it would spend a 'double-digit billion amount' in Danish kroner, or at least $1.5 billion. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen admitted, however, that the government has failed to invest in Greenland’s security. 'We have neglected for many years to make the necessary investments in our ships, in the aircraft that will help to monitor our kingdom, and that is what we are now trying to do something about,' he told reporters on Jan. 9. 'We will hopefully create an investment package where we will strengthen our ability to monitor what is happening in the Arctic, and also for some new capacities to be put into place.' Denmark hopes the upgrades will go toward 'meeting American demands for increasing the surveillance of Greenland,' Jacobsen said. US Space base The U.S. military has been present in Greenland since World War II, when American forces were deployed to the island following Denmark’s fall to Nazi Germany. At the height of the U.S. deployment, Greenland hosted more than 10,000 U.S. service personnel. The Pituffik Space Base on Greenland’s northwest coast, formerly known as the Thule Air Base, is the United States’ northernmost military facility. It now hosts around 200 military personnel, alongside missile warning, defense and space surveillance systems. 'The military protection of Greenland de facto relies on the U.S.,' Rahbek-Clemmensen said. 'And the big question is then whether the U.S. wants to enhance that presence, perhaps to be able to do other types of military operations in that area.' That may be why, he added, Danish officials appear to be approaching the issue in a manner that maintains good U.S. relations. 'The Danish government has been trying to touch on that word 'control' that Trump uses, which is a very ambiguous term,' he added. 'What does control mean? Does it mean owning a piece of territory? Or does it mean having a certain amount of military equipment on that territory?' US-Danish relations At Denmark’s Arctic command center in Nuuk, the U.S. flag flies alongside the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands colors. The building also hosts the U.S. Consulate — a sign that, for the time being, U.S.-Danish relations remain cordial. Before Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen said there were no plans to expand U.S. military presence in Greenland. That could change under the new president. For now, Denmark and its European allies are hoping that Trump’s comments are part of a strategy to force NATO allies to spend more on defense. 'There's an important element which is about his personality, which he brings into the way that U.S. diplomacy, or his diplomacy, is carried out,' Jacobsen said. 'In a positive light, if the USA increases its presence in the Arctic, it will increase the NATO presence, because the seven Arctic states — besides Russia — we are all members of NATO now.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCVeLDVpfHbpF	2025-01-22T18:46:24-08:00	
The Shifting Bottom Line Of The US – OpEd	By Kung Chan Trump's recent remarks on territorial expansion, including topics like Greenland, the Gulf of Mexico, and Canada, have shocked the world. Many people have once again associated this with the concept of 'great power', and feel panic and confusion. After all, Trump is thought to dislike interfering in global affairs? In reality, Trump's current actions are more about ensuring the continuation of Trumpism as a worldview, rather than just focusing on his presidential tenure. His time as President will only last for four years, and within the framework of the U.S. system of checks and balances, his ability to enact lasting change was limited. Therefore, he must consider what happens after his term. Hence, he will continue to exert influence through a certain ideology and worldview, which is what we refer to as Trumpism. I believe his recent statements are closely related to this. Interestingly, there is a political cycle in the United States, though many deny it. I firmly believe that politics does follow a cyclical pattern. Trump's 'America First' rhetoric led many to believe that the U.S. was retreating or even in decline, but this is a mistaken view. In fact, it represents a 'shifting of the bottom line' in American politics. At the outset of World War I, the U.S. was at its most conservative, showing no interest in the fierce fighting in Europe. But once the brutality of the war began to impact values such as human rights, democracy, and freedom, which Americans cherish, a tolerance issue arose. The conservative sentiment in American society actually meant that this tolerance had shifted, allowing for more significant impacts than before. Yet, this does not mean that the tolerance is infinite. After World War I had progressed to a certain point, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson declared war against Germany despite having promised conservative voters throughout his campaign that he would keep the U.S. out of it. Therefore, the changes in America and Trumpism represent a shift in the country's bottom line. Today and in the future, the U.S. will be more tolerant of certain global issues than in the past. This means that the U.S. will not actively engage in global affairs or maintain an interventionist stance. On the surface, it may appear that the U.S. is retreating or adopting a non-interventionist model, but if things escalate beyond a certain threshold, it will still respond with force and surprise. This is Trumpism, the true America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCfulusYa47fI	2025-01-22T18:42:05-08:00	
Why Joe Biden Had To Pardon Anthony Fauci – OpEd	By Connor O'Keeffe On Monday, in their final hours in office, former President Biden’s team chose to issue a blanket pardon to a number of close political allies and family members. Among that group was former Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci. Fauci was pardoned 'for any offense against the United States which he may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through the date of [the] pardon' relating in any way to his time as NIAID Director, on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the White House covid-19 response team, or as Biden’s Chief Medical Advisor. In the letter explaining the pardons, Biden defended the choice, saying, 'baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families.' Even when those individuals have done nothing wrong, Biden’s ghostwriters reason, 'the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.' Setting aside the fact that this was the exact tactic the political establishment used to try and tarnish Trump’s reputation, it’s revealing that the primary public reason presented for the pardons was to avoid investigations. There are, of course, plenty of unseemly details about Fauci’s career that the political establishment would not like to see resurface in either the court of law or the court of public opinion. Many were detailed in RFK Jr.’s book The Real Anthony Fauci, such as the secretive and deadly drug experiments on hundreds of HIV-positive foster children at New York City’s Incarnation Children’s Center between 1988 and 2002 and the experiment that locked the heads of Beagle puppies into cages full of flesh-eating insects. If Fauci had come under the federal government’s microscope, episodes like those could have done much to stain the name of the man Biden recently dubbed 'a true hero.' The same goes for Fauci’s completely inaccurate projection of the danger posed by a strain of swine flu in the 1970s, along with the millions of dollars of damages the government had to pay out due to injuries sustained in the related swine flu vaccine experiments. Fauci also made similar failed projections relating to the 2005 bird flu, the 2009 swine flu, and the 2016 Zika virus. In all these cases, the virus was nowhere near as dangerous as Fauci had claimed it would be. But his warnings did result in his department and other parts of Washington’s public health bureaucracy getting billions of dollars in new funding. Of course, these episodes pale in comparison to what Fauci is now most famous for: overseeing the covid pandemic. Early on, Fauci famously explained on TV that cloth masks cannot stop people infected with covid from filling the air around them with virus particles. He then completely reversed his stance and advocated for universal masking and government mask mandates. He later claimed his earlier comments on television had been lies meant to trick the public into not buying masks to protect the supply of masks for healthcare workers who, in fact, used a different kind of mask. He then acted confused when much of the public stopped trusting him. Fauci also went on record in early April 2020 calling for nationwide lockdowns—something he would later deny doing. When some states like Florida started to reopen months later, Fauci warned the governors they were taking 'a really significant risk.' It quickly became obvious to anyone who was actually looking that Fauci was completely wrong about the effectiveness of masking and lockdowns. But Fauci ignored the data and kept pushing for these measures into 2021, after the vaccines had become available. Another fact that had become obvious early in the pandemic was that children posed little risk of contracting and spreading covid. Yet, Fauci pushed for school closures and later school masking long after both were clearly shown to be unnecessary. Finally, Fauci made several high-profile claims about the covid vaccines that would quickly prove false. But making bad projections and giving bad advice isn’t a crime. So why was the political class worried about Fauci being investigated by the Department of Justice? Because a federal investigation would likely have related to the speculation that Fauci played a role in bringing the pandemic about in the first place. One controversial method for studying viruses involves artificially making the virus more transmissible or virulent. This so-called 'gain-of-function' research allows for virus mutation or possible treatments to be analyzed much more quickly, but it brings the risk of a much more dangerous genetically-engineered virus infecting people if a sample leaks out. We know that an NGO that gets funding from Fauci’s department bankrolled gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses at the laboratory in Wuhan, China, in 2017 and 2018. And that the same NGO had received federal funding while conducting gain-of-function research going back to 2014, when a three-year ban on using federal funds for such experiments had been implemented and when Fauci’s pardon happens to come into effect. While there is no evidence that these experiments are related to the coronavirus that would eventually spread out of Wuhan in late 2019 and early 2020, there is still much we do not know about the extent of US involvement in similar experiments at the Wuhan lab around the time covid started to spread. That fact, paired with the panicked and secretive behavior of Fauci and his colleagues after the first reports of covid started to emerge, has raised suspicion about the possibility of US government involvement in covid’s origin. Biden’s DOJ refused to investigate these matters. But after Senator Rand Paul got Fauci to explicitly deny, under oath, that his department had funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab, an investigation into the truth of the claim to determine if Fauci had committed perjury remained a possibility. That was until Biden pardoned him Monday morning. A federal investigation would have all but forced the media to revisit many of Fauci’s unseemly actions, failures, and possible crimes. That would have been uncomfortable for a political establishment that has embraced and celebrated Fauci for decades. But the real danger of a high-profile Fauci investigation, from the political class’s perspective, would come if the public started to ask themselves why a bureaucrat with such a long track record of failure was embraced and celebrated by those in power. And why he enjoyed so much professional success before retiring with a net worth of more than $11 million. Such questions could lead people to consider that maybe the decades of mistakes that transferred hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to public health agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and the crony healthcare system as a whole were not mistakes after all. That, perhaps, the federal public health apparatus is nothing more than a racket and that officials are professionally rewarded, not for keeping us safe, but for protecting and expanding that racket. Those are the questions that could well have arisen had a federal investigation prompted a retrospective and examination of the career and conduct of Anthony Fauci. And that is why Biden had no choice but to pardon him. About the author: Connor O’Keeffe (@ConnorMOKeeffe) produces media and content at the Mises Institute.

The Constitution Has Gone AWOL: From Presidential Power Grabs To ...	That didn’t take long. Within days of Donald Trump’s second term, the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights disappeared from the White House’s website. While the Trump Administration insists the removal of these foundational documents will eventually be restored to the site, the timing and symbolism of their removal is hard to ignore. Especially in light of the flurry of executive orders issued by President Trump as a means of bypassing the very rule of law those documents were intended to ensure. Already, Trump has unilaterally declared two national states of emergency, announced his intention to disregard the 14th Amendment’s assurance of birthright citizenship, established two new government agencies, and pushed for an expansion of the death penalty. So much for the Founders’ efforts to guard against this kind of concentrated, absolute power by establishing a system of checks of balances that separate and shares power between three co-equal branches to ensure that no single authority is entrusted with all the powers of government. Mind you, Trump is not unique in his use of executive orders to bypass Congress and unilaterally impose his will upon the nation, but it is indicative of the fact that he, like his predecessors, will continue to serve as an imperial president, using executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements to operate above the law and beyond the reach of the Constitution. America, meet your latest dictator-in-chief. Be warned: what is happening right now is political theater. Allow yourself to be distracted by it, and you will miss the real power play afoot: the expansion of unaccountable presidential power that exposes us to constitutional peril. The Deep State is counting on us to be distracted. Don’t fall for it. We must be particularly leery when political promises to fix everything that is wrong with the nation are dependent on presidential power grabs and manufactured crises. That’s the oldest trick in the book. Whether the ends justify the means is never the point. It is especially when the ends seem to justify the means that one must tread with particular caution. That’s how we landed in this mess in the first place. Power-hungry and lawless, the government has weaponized one national crisis after another in order to expand its powers and justify all manner of government tyranny in the so-called name of national security. As a result, we have become a nation in a permanent state of emergency. That indefinite state of crisis has remained constant, no matter which party has controlled Congress and the White House. The seeds of this present madness were sown almost two decades ago when George W. Bush stealthily issued two presidential directives that granted the president the power to unilaterally declare a national emergency, which is loosely defined as 'any incident, regardless of location, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure, environment, economy, or government functions.' Comprising the country’s Continuity of Government (COG) plan, these directives (National Security Presidential Directive 51 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20) provide a skeletal outline of the actions the president will take in the event of a 'national emergency.' Just what sort of actions the president will take once he declares a national emergency can barely be discerned from the barebones directives. However, one thing is clear: in the event of a national emergency, the COG directives give unchecked executive, legislative and judicial power to the president. It doesn’t even matter what the nature of the crisis might be: civil unrest, the national emergencies, 'unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters.' They have all become fair game to a government that continues to quietly assemble, test and deploy emergency powers a long laundry list of terrifying powers that override the Constitution and can be activated at a moment’s notice. We’re talking about lockdown powers (at both the federal and state level): the ability to suspend the Constitution, indefinitely detain American citizens, bypass the courts, quarantine whole communities or segments of the population, override the First Amendment by outlawing religious gatherings and assemblies of more than a few people, shut down entire industries and manipulate the economy, muzzle dissidents, 'stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease,' reshape financial markets, create a digital currency (and thus further restrict the use of cash), determine who should live or die. While these are powers the police state has been working to make permanent, they barely scratch the surface of the far-reaching powers the government has unilaterally claimed for itself without any pretense of being reined in or restricted in its power grabs by Congress, the courts or the citizenry. As David C. Unger, observes in The Emergency State: America’s Pursuit of Absolute Security at All Costs: 'For seven decades we have been yielding our most basic liberties to a secretive, unaccountable emergency state – a vast but increasingly misdirected complex of national security institutions, reflexes, and beliefs that so define our present world that we forget that there was ever a different America. ... Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness have given way to permanent crisis management: to policing the planet and fighting preventative wars of ideological containment, usually on terrain chosen by, and favorable to, our enemies. Limited government and constitutional accountability have been shouldered aside by the kind of imperial presidency our constitutional system was explicitly designed to prevent.' This is all happening according to schedule. The civil unrest, the national emergencies, 'unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters,' the government’s reliance on the armed forces to solve domestic political and social problems, the implicit declaration of martial law packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security: the powers-that-be have been planning and preparing for such a crisis for years now. As we have witnessed in recent years, that national emergency can take any form, can be manipulated for any purpose and can be used to justify any end goal—all on the say so of the president. The emergency powers that we know about which presidents might claim during such states of emergency are vast, ranging from imposing martial law and suspending habeas corpus to shutting down all forms of communications, including implementing an internet kill switch, and restricting travel. Yet according to documents obtained by the Brennan Center, there may be many more secret powers that presidents may institute in times of so-called crisis without oversight from Congress, the courts, or the public. Remember, these powers do not expire at the end of a president’s term. They remain on the books, just waiting to be used or abused by the next political demagogue. So, too, every action taken by the current occupant of the White House and his predecessors to weaken the system of checks and balances, sidestep the rule of law, and expand the power of the executive branch of government makes us that much more vulnerable to those who would abuse those powers in the future. Although the Constitution invests the President with very specific, limited powers, in recent years, American presidents (Biden, Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc.) have claimed the power to completely and almost unilaterally alter the landscape of this country for good or for ill. The Executive Branch’s willingness to circumvent the Constitution by leaning heavily on the president’s so-called emergency powers constitutes a gross perversion of what limited power the Constitution affords the president. As law professor William P. Marshall explains, 'every extraordinary use of power by one President expands the availability of executive branch power for use by future Presidents.' Moreover, it doesn’t even matter whether other presidents have chosen not to take advantage of any particular power, because 'it is a President’s action in using power, rather than forsaking its use, that has the precedential significance.' In other words, each successive president continues to add to his office’s list of extraordinary orders and directives, expanding the reach and power of the presidency and granting him- or herself near dictatorial powers. All of the imperial powers amassed by Obama, Bush, Trump, Biden and now Trump again—to kill American citizens without due process, to detain suspects (including American citizens) indefinitely, to strip Americans of their citizenship rights, to carry out mass surveillance on Americans without probable cause, to wage wars without congressional authorization, to suspend laws during wartime, to disregard laws with which he might disagree, to conduct secret wars and convene secret courts, to sanction torture, to sidestep the legislatures and courts with executive orders and signing statements, to direct the military to operate beyond the reach of the law, to establish a standing army on American soil, to operate a shadow government, to declare national emergencies for any manipulated reason, and to act as a dictator and a tyrant, above the law and beyond any real accountability—have become a permanent part of the president’s toolbox of terror. This is what you might call a stealthy, creeping, silent, slow-motion coup d’état. As an investigative report by the Brennan Center explains: 'There are currently 41 declared national emergencies, most of which have been in place for more than a decade… Some of the emergency powers Congress has made available to the president are so breathtaking in their vastness that they would make an autocrat do a spit take. Presidents can use emergency declarations to shut down communications infrastructure, freeze private assets without judicial process, control domestic transportation, or even suspend the prohibition on government testing of chemical and biological agents on unwitting human subjects.' We must recalibrate the balance of power. For starters, Congress should put an end to the use of presidential executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements as a means of getting around Congress and the courts. At a minimum, as The Washington Post suggests, 'all emergency declarations [s]hould expire automatically after three or six months, whereupon Congress would need to vote upon any proposed extension. It is time for both parties to recognize that governing via endless crises — even when they are employed to implement broadly popular policies that win plaudits from key political constituencies — subverts our system of constitutional government.' We’ve got to start making both the president and the police state play by the rules of the Constitution. As Justice Gorsuch recognized: 'Fear and the desire for safety are powerful forces. They can lead to a clamor for action—almost any action—as long as someone does something to address a perceived threat. A leader or an expert who claims he can fix everything, if only we do exactly as he says, can prove an irresistible force. We do not need to confront a bayonet, we need only a nudge, before we willingly abandon the nicety of requiring laws to be adopted by our legislative representatives and accept rule by decree. Along the way, we will accede to the loss of many cherished civil liberties—the right to worship freely, to debate public policy without censorship, to gather with friends and family, or simply to leave our homes. We may even cheer on those who ask us to disregard our normal lawmaking processes and forfeit our personal freedoms. Of course, this is no new story. Even the ancients warned that democracies can degenerate toward autocracy in the face of fear.' If we continue down this road, there can be no surprise about what awaits us at the end. After all, it is a tale that has been told time and again throughout history. For example, over 90 years ago, the citizens of another democratic world power elected a leader who promised to protect them from all dangers. In return for this protection, and under the auspice of fighting terrorism, he was given absolute power. This leader went to great lengths to make his rise to power appear both legal and necessary, masterfully manipulating much of the citizenry and their government leaders. Unnerved by threats of domestic terrorism and foreign invaders, the people had little idea that the domestic turmoil of the times—such as street rioting and the fear of Communism taking over the country—was staged by the leader in an effort to create fear and later capitalize on it. In the ensuing months, this charismatic leader ushered in a series of legislative measures that suspended civil liberties and habeas corpus rights and empowered him as a dictator. On March 23, 1933, the nation's legislative body passed the Enabling Act, formally referred to as the 'Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the Nation,' which appeared benign and allowed the leader to pass laws by decree in times of emergency. What it succeeded in doing, however, was ensuring that the leader became a law unto himself. The leader's name was Adolf Hitler. The rest, as they say, is history. Yet as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, history has a way of repeating itself. Hitler’s rise to power should serve as a stark lesson to always be leery of granting any government leader sweeping powers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCdkJpq8uIFgM	2025-01-22T18:36:02-08:00	
Putin To Trump: Congratulations On Your Inauguration; Now Let’s T...	President Joe Biden has stood out among United States presidents in his refusal for years to talk with the leader of the Russia government. This refusal to talk with Russia President Vladimir Putin has been particularly precarious because over the same time period the US has been delivering large quantities of money, weapons, and intelligence to Ukraine to prop up a military effort against Russia that threatens to spiral into a third world war. Fortunately, Donald Trump, who is set to succeed Biden as US president on Monday, appears to be following a different course regarding communication between the US and Russian governments, as well as regarding the ongoing Ukraine War. Speaking at a January 9 press conference at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump declared that 'President Putin wants to meet' and that a meeting is being set up. 'We have to get that war over with' and 'that’s a bloody mess,' Trump further stated. 'And that’s a war that would have never happened if I were president, and that’s a war that I’m gonna try really to stop as quickly as I can,' continued Trump. On Monday, Putin in public comments congratulated incoming President Donald Trump on his inauguration and declared a desire that dialog restart. 'And now we see their statements about wishing to restore their contacts with Russia suspended by the previous administration,' and 'we’ve heard his commitment to do everything to prevent World War III,' noted Putin. 'Of course, we welcome this approach,' stated Putin who further explained that 'we’ve never been against dialog; we have always been ready to maintain peaceful relationship with any American administration.' Let the dialogue begin, and with it, hopefully, as Putin states in his inauguration day comments 'a long-term peace based on respect to lawful interests of all people and nationalities living in the region.'

Trump Keeps His Promises While Democrats Must Be Abandoned – OpEd	Trump begins his term delivering on promises, but compromised and colluding democrats have ready excuses for betraying their voters. 'Yet, with the return of Trump, opportunists in our communities and beyond are telling us that the real culprits in our oppression and the targets for opposition are Trump and republicans.' Donald Trump is once again president of the United States. The man who was counted out politically after he was charged and convicted of felonies in cases that were legally dubious efforts to keep him out of the white house, once again emerged victorious and is the 47th president of the United States. Trump is a significant figure in U.S. politics, having won two presidential elections when the odds were against him. His success is in large part due to racist appeals to white voters. But those clarion calls might fall on deaf ears were it not for Democratic Party collusion with a greedy plutocracy and its own racism, which consigns its most loyal constituency to opportunistic tokenism. Trump is definitely true to his word. Beginning on his inauguration on January 20, 2025, Trump signed a flurry of executive orders, making real his campaign promises. He reinstated the state sponsor of terrorism designation against Cuba that Joe Biden had lifted just the week before. He pardoned the people convicted of offenses committed when they acted on his behalf and stormed the Capitol building on January 6, 2021. He has set in motion some yet-to-be-determined visa restrictions reminiscent of his 'Muslim Ban.' All federal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) staff have been placed on paid leave. While a constitutional amendment will prevent him from moving forward, he began an effort to end birthright citizenship. It is difficult for Black people not to be concerned when a man committed to realizing many of the right wing policies they oppose is back in the white house with majorities in both houses of congress. But one must ask how well Joe Biden met their needs. Aside from making Juneteenth a federal holiday, a move republicans supported as well, how did Joe Biden fulfill their political goals? When leaders of civil rights organizations asked him to use executive order authority in a December 2020 meetinghe refused. '‘On Day 1, I’m gonna have an executive order to do this!’ Not within the constitutional authority. I am not going to violate the Constitution. Executive authority that my progressive friends talk about is way beyond the bounds.' Trump is less concerned about the possibility of challenges or court rulings which could overturn his policies. He is standing by his political commitments while democrats look for reasons to disappoint their voters. The worst possible reaction to Trump’s actions would be to succumb to dejection and resignation. It is clear that ending the reliance on democrats and the electoral process itself is the first step to gaining some degree of political success. The Democratic Party is at a very low point with voters and only 33% of them have a favorable opinion of the wing of the duopoly that Black people still cling to with great devotion. It is true that they may not be down forever. Trump may lose support, democrats may see lightning strike twice and find an Obama-like figure who can skillfully make the public believe that their desires for change have finally come true. Whether they manage to do that or not, focusing on Trump alone is a losing proposition. Doing so stunts any political growth and makes the possibility of any change in the conditions of the masses of the people seem impossible. Independence from the Black political class and other misleaders is the only way to move forward. A new liberation movement has to be forged, one that eschews seeking approval from people who rely on the largesse of an oligarchic class. Even so-called progressives, such as 'the Squad' are of little use. In a conversation with journalist Michael Tracey, former congresswoman Cori Bush gave an astounding explanation for voting to send billions of dollars in public money to fund the proxy war in Ukraine. Bush claims that she did so because of the Biden administration assertion that U.S. troops would have to fight there if congress didn’t appropriate a bottomless pit of money. She said she wanted to keep 'Black and brown bodies' safe from harm and to stop Russia. Bush was defeated in her re-election campaign when the American Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC) supported her opponent. AIPAC bragged quite openly about their effort to unseat her and she is seen as a progressive icon. Yet she expects a nonsensical explanation for supporting the military industrial complex and U.S. imperialism to be believed. Bush and other so-called progressives backed a dangerous and deadly project that they could have opposed on the merits. Bush’s colleagues still in congress may opportunistically wring their hands over every step of the Trump presidency but as long as they engage in double talking fakery they and their supporters will lose. In the first two years of Biden’s presidency and the democrats’ control of congress they pretended to want what voters asked them to do. Instead they made excuses claiming that phantom parliamentarians prevented them from acting or expressed fear of court rulings that might go against them. The truth is that they don’t work for the people. They work for defense contractors and Wall Street and wealthy donors. They cannot act on behalf of those interests and also help the people. It isn’t possible to back away from their true loyalty. Donald Trump’s vow to take back the Panama Canal may seem foolish but is it different from pledging to fight a proxy war in Ukraine that will defeat Russia? It certainly is no worse than the Biden/Harris commitment to Israel’s ethnic cleansing campaign in Gaza. Trump won’t raise the federal minimum wage but Biden didn’t do that either. The Voting Rights Act enforcement provisions were eviscerated by Supreme Court decisions but Biden didn’t fight to restore them when he might have been able to. No one should be fooled by Trump’s deportation plans when Obama and Biden deported more people than he did in his first term. It is democrats who are building 'cop cities' around the country. It was Biden’s Justice Department which indicted the Uhuru 3. It was Biden who hatched a plan for yet another occupation of Haiti. It may be difficult to ignore the theater surrounding Trump’s executive orders, but remember that Biden refused to do the same thing. More people were killed by police in 2024 than in any year that records have been kept. The faces of imperialism and neoliberal austerity and police brutality will periodically change, but their methods will not. No one can fight Trump who didn’t also fight his predecessors. The struggle during his administration will not be unique but it must be sustained no matter who comes after him. If not, all expressions of opposition are worthless. The history of Black struggle and movement building can be revived if we act as fearlessly as the ancestors we claim to respect.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCcFvt3lNLz6I	2025-01-22T18:30:59-08:00	
With Assad’s Ouster, Moscow Set To Lose Important Church Ally In ...	Assad’s ouster not only is likely to cost Russia its military bases in Syria but also to drive from office the leader of the Antioch Patriarchate who had distinguished himself both by his pro-Assad positions and his support for the Moscow Patriarchate regarding Ukrainian autocephaly and Putin’s war in Ukraine. Now with Assad and his Russian supporters gone, Syria’s Antioch Change Movement has called for the resignation of Patriarch John X who in its view had 'sullied himself' by collaborating with Assad and Putin' (novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/01/18/antiokhiia-posle-asada). The Movement is likely to be successful given that John X has many enemies in Syria given that he and Assad changed church rules so that he could be elected in the first place, he failed to investigate the murders of senior churchmen, and he slavishly followed Damascus and Moscow in his policies. John’s removal will affect the 500,000 Christians in Syria, but more than that, it will echo across the Orthodox world, not only because there are roughly three million more Antioch Christians in other countries but because the Antioch Patriarchate ranks third among the ancient Orthodox patriarchates, behind only Constantinople and Alexandria. Up to now, the Antioch Patriarchate has been the Moscow Patriarchate’s most reliable ally in Moscow’s dispute with Constantinople. Now, the Russian church won’t be able to count on a similarly close ally in the future – and that likely means the ROC MP will be more isolated in the Orthodox world than at any time since the death of Stalin. That in turn will mean that the ROC MP will have less to offer the Kremlin and that it will feel compelled to follow ever more closely Putin’s nationalist and imperialist line.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCSaz5XMZaNjV	2025-01-22T18:28:29-08:00	
Trump Says China Tariffs Could Begin Feb. 1	By Alex Willemyns The first round of promised U.S. tariffs on imports from China could begin as early as next week, President Donald Trump said Tuesday. He also unveiled plans for levies on goods arriving in America from Mexico, Canada and even the European Union. Trump had originally threatened to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office, after suggesting during last year’s election campaign that tariffs on Chinese goods could even go to 'more than' 60%. But the tariffs were not part of the flurry of executive orders from the new president on his first day back in the White House on Monday. On Tuesday, though, Trump said Feb. 1 could be the day for the tariffs, which he has long said are needed to boost domestic industry. 'We’re talking about a tariff of 10% on China based on the fact that they’re sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada,' which is then brought into the United States, Trump said after announcing a US$500 billion A.I. infrastructure investment by Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank. Fentanyl is a highly potent synthetic opioid that U.S. authorities blame for killing tens of thousands of Americans each year. Precursors for the drug are produced in China and then turned into fentanyl by Mexican transnational drug trafficking groups to be smuggled into America. Trump said he had discussed the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call on Friday ahead of Trump’s return to power. 'I said, we don’t want that crap in our country,' Trump recalled. Efforts to stem the outflow of fentanyl precursors from China formed a key part of former U.S. President Joe Biden’s diplomacy with Beijing. A pledge from Xi to crack down on precursor exports was one of three major outcomes of Biden and Xi’s 2023 summit in San Francisco. In the months following that meeting, Biden administration officials largely credited their Chinese counterparts with following through on their promises, but Trump said enough was still not being done. ‘No winners’ Beijing has been careful not to directly criticize Trump in his first few days in office but has nevertheless pushed back against tariffs. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang did not directly refer to the new U.S. president, but called for a renewed promotion of 'globalization.' 'Protectionism leads nowhere. Trade war has no winners,' Ding told the forum. 'We have the wisdom and capability needed to find a win-win and all-win solution, one that is based on mutually beneficial cooperation, through communication and coordination.' In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning echoed the vice premier’s remarks when asked about Trump’s 10% tariff. 'We believe that there’s no winner in a trade or tariff war, and we firmly uphold our national interests,' Mao said, adding China would 'maintain communication with the U.S.' to 'properly' handle their differences. China, Mexico and Canada are America’s three largest sources of imports, accounting for around US$536 billion, US$454 billion and US$436.6 billion per year, respectively. They also dwarf all other sources: Japan (US$148 billion) and Germany (US$146 billion) round out the top five. But it’s not only those three that could be targeted. Trump told reporters Tuesday evening that the 27-nation European Union, which together accounts for some US$553 billion in U.S. imports each year, 'treat[s] us very, very badly' and should also be penalized. 'They’re going to be in for tariffs,' the U.S. president said of the European Union. 'It’s the only way you’re going to get fairness.'\	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCTWzduGQo0iT	2025-01-22T18:24:59-08:00	
Kallas Admits Trump Is Right Over EU Defence Spending Shortfall	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- Europe must heed Trump’s demand to spend more on defence and shoulder its fair share of responsibility, said the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas. Trump recently said that NATO members must increase defence spending from the current target of 2% to 5%, a figure that even the US does not satisfy. He has previously threatened a withdrawal of support for allies that fail to reach a minimum of 2%. Kallas said it is time to invest, telling an EU defence conference on Wednesday that 'President Trump is right to say we don't spend enough'. She added that the EU should 'shoulder a fair share of responsibility' for Europe's security and that the US should remain a strong ally. Her words came as EU leaders and officials have tried to extend an olive branch to Trump as they await his first policy steps towards Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron was one of the few who did not mince his words. Earlier on Monday, he told top military brass in Paris that European taxpayer money should be invested in homegrown weapons to boost the bloc’s own industry, not only 'buy more American materiel'. Beyond addressing Trump's return, Kallas said the EU should cooperate more closely with like-minded partners. The bloc would take the 'logical next step' of pursuing a new defence agreement with the United Kingdom, describing London as a 'key partner' in facing Russia's threat. EU leaders will meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on 3 February for informal talks on strengthening Europe's defences. Rutte said he expected Trump's return to 'turbo-charge defence spending and production.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCdssrK73SFp0	2025-01-22T18:23:47-08:00	
Starmer Should Dare To Dream Of A ‘Breturn’ – OpEd	By Mohamed Chebaro It was peculiar to hear Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk saying that he wants a 'Breturn,' or a British return to the EU, after talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Warsaw last week. The end of this month marks five years since the UK officially left the EU, a move whose advocates had promised would liberate London from Brussels’ shackling administrative dictates and boost its economy through becoming a 'Singapore-on-Thames.' However, these ill-thought-out and uncosted dreams have broken on the rocks of reality. Since Brexit, the UK’s economy has clearly slowed down, its future growth outlook has taken a hit and billions of pounds have been lost in trade with its closest political, economic and social partner. Brexit has also failed to stem the flow of migrants across the English Channel and the UK has had to replace its European labor force with skilled laborers from farther afield, whose cultures are even more foreign to the UK than European ones. Above all, and even by the admission of arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, Britain has not benefited from Brexit and Brexit has 'failed.' However, it seems that the leadership of the Labour Party, which scored a landslide victory at last summer’s general election, continues to be an ardent cheerleader for Brexit, regardless of the economic damage it is continuing to cause. If Farage’s words were not enough, Starmer ought to be encouraged to change course by the fact new Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch last week expressed what has long been common knowledge up and down the country: that her party took the UK out of the EU before it had a plan for growth outside of the bloc. She added that previous Conservative governments also set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and only then started to think about how they could do it. Similarly, they did not have a clear plan on how to lower immigration before making it a centerpiece of their agenda. Tusk, who was president of the European Council when the UK voted to leave the bloc, said that he would continue to harbor the dream of a 'Breturn' in his heart, as sometimes dreams do come true, even in politics. Like Tusk, Starmer should permit himself to dream, instead of holding firm with his stance that rejoining the customs union or single market is out of the question. In Warsaw, he ratified a bilateral defense treaty with Tusk to deepen ties between the UK and Polish defense industries. This added to the defense deals worth billions of pounds signed in the last few years. There are likely to be more to come, spurred by the Russian threat in Ukraine and beyond. It would be better for Starmer to dream and fail rather than not dream at all. Any large-scale results for the UK’s struggling economy can come only from deeper post-Brexit ties with the EU through a real and courageous trade and partnership agreement. He needs to bring the UK back to the bloc’s market, instead of its current perpetual search for growth and investment in many unlikely corners of the planet. The numbers are on Starmer and his chancellor’s side, allowing them to defend any bold move they might make that could upset those on the political right, as well as the criticism that would surely follow that this Labour government was reopening old wounds. This would certainly give a new platform for populists like Boris Johnson. Bloomberg Economics estimates that the UK is losing £100 billion ($122 billion) a year in output due to Brexit. The UK Office for Budget Responsibility calculates that UK trade has sustained a 15 percent hit in the long run due to exiting the EU market. It is thought that businesses in the UK are suffering across the board and in various ways. The Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics found that more than 16,000 British firms that had previously exported to the EU (14 percent of the total) have stopped doing so since the withdrawal agreement came into effect five years ago. Starmer’s popularity and that of his government is fizzling out. Scraping around looking for economic growth and speaking at all the forums in the world will not improve his ratings, which are very important for any leader. Repeating old stories, such as that he inherited a broken economy and a large deficit from his predecessor, and promising to clean up the UK political arena and return integrity to politicians and policymaking is all well and good. This is why people gave their votes to Labour after years of Conservative blunders. But these are not the only reasons. Those who voted Labour into power also expected to have a less gloomy outlook on life and fewer struggles with the cost of living, if not now then at least on the horizon. But the Starmer government has so far failed to give them a tangible, positive dream and a roadmap to get there. Vague economic figures and charts alone will not cut it, as most of us could better associate with stories. And there is one story that could best change that. It is associated with a historic event that has become one of the root causes of the cost-of-living crisis and the shrinking UK economy. That story contains what could change the image of Starmer from cautious lawyer to political leader. It is for Starmer to make tackling Brexit a gateway to repairing the damage done by his predecessors, instead of continuing to deliver vague fiscal measures that can only rebalance an out-of-balance budget that is lacking a path to clear growth. Starmer’s government has so far been seen as lacking oomph and that is a situation of his own making. He has tried to ride the American horse, which Trump is poised to direct farther away from the UK and other allies in Europe, and the Chinese dragon, which will listen, but only as long as Britain affords it sweeteners and until the next security crisis blows all that out of the water. The UK PM must instead move mountains to reconnect with the EU, if not to regain entry then to at least obtain meaningful agreements that will allow the smoother movement of people and goods. The UK could then tap into the tangible growth available on its doorstep, rather than relying on plans and promises of growth that depend on far-away potential trading partners, the goodwill of the new US president and/or smaller players in Asia or the Middle East.

Deputy Secretary General: Stepping Up NATO-EU Cooperation Is Esse...	NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Shekerinska addressed the European Defence Agency (EDA) annual conference 'New Horizons in EU Defence' in Brussels on Wednesday (22 January). She praised the deepening partnership between NATO and the European Union (EU) over recent years and called on even closer cooperation. 'At this dangerous time for our security, stepping up our cooperation is essential,' she said, underlining that EU defence is of 'great importance to NATO, because it is inextricably linked to transatlantic security'. Faced with growing strategic competition and destabilising campaigns against our security and way of life, increasing defence investment and boosting defence production are a priority to ensure countries in Europe stay safe, the Deputy Secretary General said. She welcomed the EU’s enhanced efforts to boost European defence industry, acquire much needed capabilities, and enhance resilience. Moving forward, Ms Shekeinska stressed the importance for NATO and the EU to work hand in hand to avoid the duplication of efforts and to identify more opportunities to leverage each other’s unique expertise, tools and resources. She also encouraged the 'fullest possible' involvement of non-EU Allies’ defence industries, which contribute essential technological know-how and provide urgently needed capabilities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCdpKeqrTiRWA	2025-01-22T18:14:22-08:00	
Palau’s Hi-Tech Mission To Preserve Pacific’s Oldest Monuments	By Harry Pearl Palauan tourism official Lelly Obakerbau shakes her head and motions at the encroaching jungle that threatens to reclaim an ancient and largely unknown Pacific archaeological site. 'If we don’t keep this clean, the layers of the terraces will disappear,' she says while walking below the pyramid-like crown of one of Palau’s monumental earthworks. 'Palauans have to be proud of what they have from way back, from their ancestors.' She is determined to spread the word about her country’s unique archaeological heritage. The earthworks of Palau, shaped by humans over the course of millennia, are the earliest expression of monumentality in all of Oceania, according to current research. By at least 2,400 years ago terraces were being sculpted into the volcanic landscape of Palau, backbreaking work that would carry on for about 1,300 years. Records show the monuments predate the World Heritage-listed giant stone moai figures on Rapa Nui – also called Easter Islands – in Chile and the megalithic basalt stone structures of Nan Madol in the Federated States of Micronesia. Nearly 20% of Babeldaob, the largest of approximately 445 islands that make up Palau, is estimated to have been transformed by terraced hillsides, crowns, moats and trenches. Smaller earthworks were also built on the nearby islands of Oreor, Ngerekebesang and Malakal in the archipelago located between the Philippines and Guam. Using primitive tools, early inhabitants altered the landscape in a way that is without parallel in the Pacific, reflecting a complex and well-organized society, skilled in engineering and hydrology, according to archaeologists. 'For Palau to have been able to build so many huge monumental structures so early in time – before any other Pacific Islands – it really says that it was quite advanced,' said archaeologist Jolie Liston, who has been studying the earthworks for more than three decades. Today, however, most of these ancient terraces are hidden under dense forest. Archaeologists have recently been using drones fitted out with laser technology called light detection and ranging [lidar] to map the earthworks and boost their visibility to the public. Lidar takes precise measurements of the earth’s surface by measuring the amount of time laser pulses take to bounce back after hitting the ground. With a grant from the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, Liston and her team surveyed 2,400 acres of terraced landscape in Aimeliik last year using drones. 'The whole point was to capture the full extent of the earthworks under the forest,' she said. 'I could only do a portion of Aimeliik state, which is the area that we’re trying to have for tourism.' The lidar images will inform ongoing research and be used to create a three-dimensional model for a small museum in the Aimeliik visitors’ center. It will allow local students and tourists to visualize the earthworks’ magnitude and be used for training of local tour guides. Archaeological evidence suggests that the earthworks supported burial grounds, gardens, fortifications and were used in ceremonies and rituals. The terraces were also likely symbols to display individual chiefly or polity power, Liston said. Though a number of questions remain about their function and social significance, the scale reflects a high degree of planning and specialized knowledge. Annette Kühlem, an archaeologist at the German Archaeological Institute, said the monuments reshaped previous assumptions about prehistoric life not just in the Pacific islands but beyond. 'For the longest time there was this belief that humans were at the mercy of nature, especially on island environments. They made do with what they found,' said Kühlem, who in 2022 announced the discovery of six skeletons on the summit of one of the monuments. 'This is such a dramatic example of how people reshaped – literally reshaped – an entire island.' Archeologists have been investigating the earthworks since the 1960s, but the structures have not received the attention of other ancient sites in the Pacific, according to Liston. 'They never really caught attention and I think it's because most people don't pay attention to Micronesia,' she said. 'They're really paying attention to Polynesia, Melanesia and Lapita [considered the first people to have settled in Melanesia].' One challenge in piecing together their origins and driving preservation efforts is that the earthworks do not feature prominently in Palauan oral history. 'Oral history in the Pacific is pretty much everything,' Liston said. Drawing on historical writings and interviews with elders, Liston and Melson Miko, a Palauan tourism official, published a paper in 2012 that said that many Palauans were skeptical about their ancestors’ ability to build the earthworks, in part because they didn’t appear in the oral traditions. Elders did recount stories about a mystical time where terraces are depicted as steps linking the gods to heaven and earth. But this was related to specific locations or individual features, rather than a generic explanation of how or by whom earthworks were constructed, the paper said. Some have even speculated they were built by an early wave of settlers, though there is no archaeological, linguistic or genetic evidence suggesting that today’s population is not directly descended from the archipelago’s earliest inhabitants, Liston and Miko reported. Exactly when and where the first Palauns migrated from is unclear but the most likely region of origin is considered to be Southeast Asia based on linguistic similarities and the evaluation of sea currents, Kühlem said in a study published in 2022. According to Liston, by the time of Western contact in the late 1700s, the use and meaning of the terraces had been forgotten after centuries of abandonment as the population moved to stonework villages along the coastline. 'We’ve been trying to get the word out not just to the world, but so that Palauan people realize how fabulous they [the terraces] are and will have more pride in their construction, the architecture and want to preserve them,' she said. Today, efforts to preserve and promote the earthworks face a number of challenges: a lack of financial support, limited technical capacity, and difficulties navigating the complex system of customary land ownership. Environmental restrictions on burning in Babeldaob have also allowed the jungle to grow back unchecked over the past decade. In her tourism role with the Aimillik government, Obakerbau works on a small budget and with just two staff to raise awareness about the earthworks – something she admits is 'very tough.' 'I want historical and cultural heritage in my state Aimeliik to be more active,' she said, adding that the government is now getting onboard 'I’ve been trying to encourage the kids to do classes at the community college in tourism and archaeology, because if you’re Palauan you have to know your places. 'You have to know what was happening back then and what is happening today.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCS8uCzcBC_y3	2025-01-22T18:09:58-08:00	
ASEAN’s Balancing Act: Challenges And Opportunities In Trump’s 20...	ASEAN is a regional organization in Southeast Asia that acts as a link between the superpowers and ensures stability in the region of interest. During the period of former American President Donald Trump, there were changes in US-ASEAN relations that would not have left an indelible mark on the economic and political development of the block. Protectionism, selective engagement in diplomatic relations, and the growing American-Chinese rivalry over Trump’s 'America First' policy brought ASEAN into a more complex international environment. The region faces the continued impact of his first term, evolving regional dynamics, and the return of Trump to the presidency in 2025 raises challenges. This question paper aims to contribute to the debate on the current state and future of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), considering the return of Donald Trump to the White House in 2025. Given the complexity of the above-mentioned issues, the paper employs an analytical approach to understand the implications of the return of Donald Trump for his second term in dealing with ASEAN. The challenges include navigating superpower rivalry, enhancing cooperation among the member countries, managing tensions with the superpowers, and the possibility of ASEAN remaining a key player in the Indo-Pacific region. During his first term, Trump’s policies had a significant impact on ASEAN’s development. For instance, his decision to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership Partnership (TPP) was a big blow to the ASEAN trade facilitation agenda. The TPP was a multilateral agreement that aimed at enhancing trade relations among the member countries in the Pacific Region and, in the process, enhancing the integration of the ASEAN member states. Bilateralism vs. multilateralism shift by Trump left ASEAN searching for new and alternative trade agreements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) signed in 2020. This trade agreement, which comprises all the member states of ASEAN, as well as China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, has since become the largest free trade agreement in the world. However, the absence of the US in such frameworks reduces the influence of ASEAN in the economic relations between the US and China. In addition, the trade war between the United States and China has had a significant impact on the economies of Southeast Asia. Both the opportunities and the disruptions that resulted from the increasing tariffs between the two global powers were felt in the region. For instance, Vietnam was one of the countries that benefited from the new investment environment because foreign direct investment (FDI) investment continued to flow into the country to take advantage of alternative production areas to China. In 2024, FDI in Vietnam was $27.72 billion, which shows that there was still a lot of interest in its export-led economy. However, other ASEAN countries have problems such as low demand for their products and supply chain disruptions which expose the weak spots of the association. A second Trump presidency could increase such uncertainties, especially if his administration imposes additional tariffs or reshoring policies that affect international trade patterns. In the political diplomacy arena, Trump’s ASEAN policy has been characterized as unconstant and pro-China. When he came up with the American strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, which focuses on a 'free and open Indo-Pacific,' ASEAN’s response to this strategy was not very positive. On one hand, the problem remains the use of coercion as a strategy, particularly in the South China Sea. On the other hand, the lack of attendance by the leaders of ASEAN at several summits with the President of China has raised questions about the reliability of the United States as a strategic partner. This situation has left ASEAN leaders wondering about the stability of the region. This means that a second Trump administration could continue with the transactional approach that may well exacerbate ASEAN’s problem of how to relate to the US and China. Other challenges that make ASEAN’s situation worse include internal factors. The main challenge to the unity of the association has always been the diversity of political systems, economic interests, and external alignment of the member countries. For example, while Vietnam and the Philippines are against the claim of China in the South China Sea, other member states like Cambodia and Laos that have close relations with China are not very aggressive in their stance. This division makes it difficult for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to present a united front on important issues such as the South China Sea dispute. As of 2024, China remains ASEAN’s largest trading partner with a trade value of over $970 billion. This economic interdependence complicates the bloc’s efforts to establish its own identity in the context of the growing American-Chinese competition. On the external front, ASEAN is facing several pressures from changing international circumstances. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China has enhanced the influence of China in the region because many countries in the region are participating in huge infrastructure projects that are changing the face of economics in these countries. However, debt sustainability and sovereignty concerns persist, as seen in Laos, which has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 60%. In addition, the focus of the US. Under Trump transactional diplomacy is likely to exacerbate these challenges, as ASEAN states have to balance their economic benefits in the short-run with their strategic autonomy in the long-run. Additionally, the unpredictability of Trump’s foreign policy may erode the confidence of ASEAN states in the consistency of American policy. For example, the sudden change in the level of American military support or the sudden withdrawal of security commitments can embolden the aggressors in the dispute areas and thus create more tension in the region. However, there are some opportunities through which ASEAN can prove its relevance and resilience. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the association was $3.9 trillion in 2024, which makes it the fifth-largest economy in the world and this is a clear manifestation of its economic significance. For instance, the AOIP (ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific) is a clear manifestation of the association’s vision to stand in the middle of the map and promote the principle of inclusivity in the region. Furthermore, ASEAN’s Economic sector, which is predicted to grow to $330 billion by the end of 2025, is an area with many opportunities for development in the areas of e-commerce and financial technology. Hence, based on these strengths, ASEAN can attract investments and promote integration within the region to diversify its relations with other partners and reduce its dependence on other countries and their policies. In conclusion, the return of Donald Trump to the presidency in 2025 is both an opportunity and a threat to ASEAN. On the one hand, his policies may provide ways of bilateralism and cooperation, economic on the other hand they may increase the uncertainty in trade, security, and regional cooperation. The ability of ASEAN to navigate this complex situation depends on the unity, flexibility, and visionary leadership of the association. By enhancing cohesion among its member states, expanding its paradigm of partnerships, and asserting its role in the Indo-Pacific, ASEAN can ensure stability and prosperity in the era of increasing geopolitical rivalry. Hence, the success of the association will be determined by how well it can strike a balance between the two superpowers and protect its common interests without compromising its principles in the changing global order.

Pity The Poesy: Mark Rutte, NATO And Spending For War – OpEd	There have been politicians who have fancied themselves as poets. There was Herman Van Rompuy in April 2010 who, when President of the European Council, imposed an anthology of haiku poetry unimaginatively titled Haiku on family members, friends, dignitaries and members of the press. Japanese diplomats were predictably diplomatic in their reception. 'A poet perhaps remains best away from politics, at least from political action,' Van Rompuy claimed daringly, despite being picked to become the first European Council president in November 2009. He reconciled this dilemma with some crafty muddling. 'In that sense I am a politician-haiku poet rather than a haiku poet-politician.' NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte seems to have been tempted, albeit briefly, by this notion of the poet-politician or the politician-poet. While his speech at the Concert Noble in Brussels last December can never qualify for any decent anthology of poetry, it illuminates his, and NATO’s position, on ongoing war in Ukraine. Rutte is a martial type keen to advance the rule of the gun in the service of the alliance. The result is the evil of banality delivered in poesy. A chief function of NATO’s public relations efforts lies in justifying its own existence. Instead of dismantling or finding more peaceful pursuits at the end of the Cold War, it became the groomed emissary of US power in Europe, while never being explicitly described as such. Former Warsaw Pact countries still aching from the legacy of Soviet garrisons and the influence of Moscow gathered around the NATO flame like abused patients seeking counselling. Despite assurances to a weakened Russia by the United States and a number of Western European leaders that no eastward expansion of the alliance would take place, country after country was added. The index of animosity and suspicion accordingly rose in The Kremlin. It falls on Rutte to make things look bleak and suitably dismal, especially when it comes to threats facing the alliance. 'I’ll be honest: the security situation does not look good,' he solemnly declares. 'It’s undoubtedly the worst in my lifetime. And I suspect in yours too.' Flagging the phobia of invasion and the march of dark forces indifferent, if not openly hostile to democracy, the Secretary General notes that the distance from Brussels to Ukraine can be driven in one day. Ukraine at war is the epicentre of his concern, as is Ukraine facing authoritarian forces acting in concert. 'That’s how close the Russian bombs are falling. It’s how close the Iranian drones are flying. And not much further, the North Korean soldiers are fighting.' With Ukraine seen as civilisation’s post child – and a Western one, no less – we get a picture of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin’s efforts of 'trying to crush our freedom and way of life.' He is keen on erasing Ukraine altogether, 'trying to fundamentally change the security architecture that has kept Europe safe for decades.' This is, like so much poetry that seeks to depict war with a propagandist’s mind, fantastically absent of context. It is an absence that continues to magnify the dangers of opponent and foe, seeing them as historical reminders of other aggressors. Be wary of appeasement; be wary of giving ground. In Rutte’s words, 'for too long, we did not act.' Not in Georgia in 2008 or Crimea in 2014. 'And many did not want to believe that he would launch all-out war on Ukraine in February.' Worry is expressed at Russia’s war economy, the very economy that European and US sanctions was to miraculously cripple. Russian military spending as a share of GDP would be 7 to 8%. Its industry was prolifically busy in tank production, armoured vehicles and ammunition. The purpose: a 'long-term confrontation' with Ukraine and NATO. To show that NATO’s eyes are not cast merely towards Moscow, Rutte picks on that other bogeyman located even more eastwards. Here, he sounds like an official on secondment from the Pentagon, Washington’s eager megaphone in Europe. 'From 200 warheads in 2020, China is expected to have more than 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.' They are investing heavily in space-launch technology. They are bullying Taiwan. And just to colour in the rest of the paper, we are reminded about North Korea and Iran. Moscow, Beijing, Pyongyang, and Tehran, all keen 'To chip away at our freedom' and 'reshape the global order.' This concern is palpable, perhaps understandable given US-NATO efforts to reshape the global order after the Cold War and the disappearance of the bipolar order. With the US in sole charge, its administrations packed with neoconservative vigilantes keen to redraw boundaries, maps and 'chip away' at any architectural foundation they disliked, the rise of this axis of opposition is clearly distressing. That distress takes one clear form. NATO must become even more militaristic. 'It is time,' Rutte declares, 'to shift to a wartime mindset.' Time to 'turbo-charge our defence production and defence spending.' To not 'spend more together now to prevent war, we will pay a much, much, much higher price later to fight it.' On meeting greater production targets and increasing defence expenditure, he is confident. Those virtuous arms for freedom will be found in Thales in France, a Rheinmetall factory in Italy, and Turkish Aerospace Industries in Türkiye. Overall, Rutte’s wretched speech-poem glorifies war, which NATO is already engaged in vicariously through Ukraine, seeing a healthy, thriving military-industrial complex as indispensable to fight foes and 'maintain long-term deterrence.' Europe, in a long slumber, had 'hollowed out' its defence industry through 'underinvestment and narrow industrial interests'. The slaughter, in other words, must be kept up in Ukraine, not merely for its bloodied sake, but for desk mandarins in Washington and Brussels and all those grateful arms manufacturers keen to make a steal. 'The pity of war, the pity war distilled,' wrote Wilfred Owen, the First World War poet who knew more than a thing or two about the subject. Pity that Rutte did not acknowledge that side of it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCXH544SP64FE	2025-01-22T18:02:42-08:00	
New Chinese Bishop Ordained Under Vatican-China Agreement	By Jonah McKeown The Vatican announced this week that Pope Francis has erected a new diocese in China and appointed Father Anthony Ji Weizhong as its first bishop. The pope decided last October to suppress the Diocese of Fenyang in mainland China, which was originally erected in 1946 by Pope Pius XII, and at the same time erect the new Diocese of Lüliang. Diocesan borders have been an area of dispute between the Vatican and China in the decades since the Chinese Communist Party came to power and started to redraw diocesan lines, seeking to bring them more in line with Chinese administrative boundaries. Indeed, the territory of the newly-created Diocese of Lüliang conforms to the territory of the city of Lüliang, located about 400 miles southwest of Beijing in western Shanxi province. It will serve a total population of 3.3 million people, of whom approximately 20,000 are Catholics. A total of 51 priests and 26 religious sisters serve in the diocese. Pope Francis appointed Weizhong as bishop of Lüliang on Oct. 28, 2024, having approved Weizhong in the context of the 'Provisional Agreement,' better known as the Vatican-China deal, which appears to give the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) some ability to choose episcopal candidates. Weizhong, 51, was ordained a priest in 2001 for the Diocese of Fenyang. He studied in China and in Germany and served in Fenyang as deputy parish priest, head of the diocesan pastoral center, and as vicar general. He was ordained on Jan. 20 at the Cathedral Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The see of the Fenyang Diocese remained vacant after the death of Bishop Huo Cheng, who spent 14 years in prison during the Cultural Revolution and had led the Church of Fenyang in communion with the Holy See since 1991, AsiaNews reported. Weizhong is the second Chinese bishop to be ordained since the Vatican in October renewed its 'Provisional Agreement' with China on the appointment of Catholic bishops for an additional four years, until at least Oct. 22, 2028. Shortly after the Vatican renewed the deal last fall, Matthew Zhen Xuebin was consecrated as the new coadjutor bishop of Beijing, having been appointed in August. Originally signed in September 2018, the provisional agreement was previously renewed for a two-year period in 2020 and again in October 2022. The terms of the agreement have never been made public, though Pope Francis has said it includes a joint commission between the Chinese government and the Vatican on the appointment of Catholic bishops, overseen by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin. The Holy See has acknowledged that China has several times violated the terms of the agreement by unilaterally appointing Catholic bishops in Shanghai and the 'Diocese of Jiangxi,' a large diocese created by the Chinese government that is not recognized by the Vatican. Chinese officials have reportedly ordered the removal of crosses from churches and have replaced images of Christ and the Virgin Mary with images of President Xi Jinping, according to a 2024 report from the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). USCIRF also reports that the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) 'sinicization of religion' campaign has led to censored religious texts, clergy forced to preach CCP ideology, and the required display of CCP slogans in churches.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCbuofv7p8eIb	2025-01-22T18:00:52-08:00	
Biden Was Right About Oligarchy – OpEd	Over three score years ago, President Dwight Eisenhower had a warning for America. 'We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex,' Eisenhower exhorted in his 1961 farewell address. 'The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.' 'We must never let the weight of this combination,' Ike continued, 'endanger our liberties or democratic processes.' Sadly, Eisenhower’s warning went largely unheeded. In the years since, the 'military-industrial complex' has morphed into an even more worrisome concentration of wealth and power. In his own farewell address, President Joe Biden gave that concentration a grim label. An 'oligarchy' of 'extreme wealth, power, and influence,' Biden intoned, now 'literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead.' We now face a 'dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people,' a reality that Biden warned is eroding our 'unity and common purpose' and fomenting 'distrust and division.' The end result? We stand today unable to adequately confront the challenges that face us. America’s oligarchs, Biden explained, are wielding 'their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we’ve taken to tackle the climate crisis.' By resisting safeguards over artificial intelligence — 'the most consequential technology of our time' — they’re also opening the door to 'new threats to our rights, our way of life, to our privacy, how we work, and how we protect our nation.' Perhaps most ominously of all, these oligarchs are burying Americans 'under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation.' 'Participating in our democracy,' the departing president lamented, has become 'exhausting and even disillusioning' for average Americans. They no longer 'feel like they have a fair shot.' But Biden also stressed that by working together, average Americans can shear our new oligarchy — and its 'tech-industrial complex' core — down to democratic size. We can get the 'dark money' of billionaires out of our politics. We can ban members of Congress from making stock trades while they’re legislating. We can tax the richest among us and make sure they’re paying their fair tax share. In the days right after Biden’s farewell address, progressives added more specifics to Biden’s list of antidotes to oligarchy. We could and should, as former U.S. labor secretary Robert Reich pointed out, either bust up giant, billionaire-owned tech media platforms like X and Facebook or start treating these platforms as public utilities. We could even ban our wealthiest from owning critical media properties. But realizing any of these reforms won’t be easy. Our wealthiest have never enjoyed a greater direct presence at our government’s highest levels. Nothing symbolized the reality of this oligarchic power like Trump’s second inauguration. The inaugural ceremony featured America’s three richest men — Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg — seated prominently in attendance, alongside other billionaires, as Trump addressed the nation. 'Everybody,' a satisfied president-elect Trump mused last month at a Mar-a-Lago news conference, 'wants to be my friend.' Well, no, not everybody. Just everybody with a grand fortune that our new president — and his Republican controlled Congress — can zealously safeguard and grow. So what can the rest of us do? With Trumpism locked in federally, we can challenge our oligarchs at the state and local level. Maryland’s governor, for instance, has proposed a series of tax changes that would raise the combined state and local income tax rate on most Marylanders making over $1 million a year to 10.7 percent. But Maryland, one of the nation’s richest states, could do better. Rich Californians are already paying taxes at a 12 percent rate. But that won’t happen more broadly unless average Americans organize — and confront our oligarchs at every opportunity.

Acting Secretary Of Defense Robert Salesses On DOD Actions Respon...	On Monday, to protect the security and safety of United States citizens, President Trump declared that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States. The President directed me to take all appropriate action to support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control of the southern border of the United States. Yesterday, I convened a meeting with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the senior Policy leaders of the Department of Defense (DoD), the Commanders of U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (NGB), directing them to move out immediately in support of President Trump’s Executive Orders on protecting the territorial integrity and citizens of the United States. At my direction, DoD established a Task Force to oversee expedited implementation of the Executive Orders. This includes employment of U.S. military forces to carry out directed missions called for by the President. Commander, USNORTHCOM is the operational lead for this effort, supported by USTRANSCOM, the Military Services, and the NGB working alongside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I approved three immediate actions that will begin today: First, DoD will begin augmenting its forces at the southwest border with an additional ~1500 ground personnel, as well as helicopters with associated crews, and intelligence analysts to support increased detection and monitoring efforts. This represents a 60 percent increase in active-duty ground forces since President Trump was sworn in Monday. Second, the Department will provide military airlift to support DHS deportation flights of more than five thousand illegal aliens from the San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas sectors detained by Customs and Border Protection. DHS will provide inflight law enforcement, and the State Department will obtain the requisite diplomatic clearances and provide host-nation notification. Third, the Department will begin assisting in the construction of temporary and permanent physical barriers to add additional security to curtail illegal border crossings and illicit trafficking. This is just the beginning. In short order, the Department will develop and execute additional missions in cooperation with DHS, federal agencies, and state partners to address the full range of threats outlined by the President at our nation’s borders. President Trump directed action from the Department of Defense on securing our nation’s borders and made clear he expects immediate results. That is exactly what our military is doing under his leadership.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCTVeVmX6Pq_t	2025-01-22T17:51:13-08:00	
Preventing And Responding To Tragedies: The Magdeburg Terrorist A...	The Magdeburg terrorist attack of December 2024 has had a huge effect on the German and international community’s perception of the safety of large public events. December 20, 2024, will forever remain a sad reminder of an incident that occurred in Magdeburg when a vehicle was intentionally driven into a crowded Christmas market near the city hall and caused the death of two people including a two-year-old child and sixty-eight people were injured thirty-five of them seriously. This heinous crime which was committed by Taleb Al Abdulmohsen, a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian doctor shows that the issue of combating lone wolf type of terrorism has not been solved yet and that even such important events as culture can not be entirely protected. The consequences of the attack called for closure of the markets and explosive checkpoints, and at the same time called for improved security measures in the public. The tragedy continues to support the need for a comprehensive strategy that incorporates strong community-oriented security with international partnerships to reduce risks while maintaining community relations. One of the major issues of the Magdeburg attack is that it is difficult to identify and, therefore, prevent the so-called lone-wolf attacks. While it is difficult to disrupt coordinated terrorist attacks, lone wolves are often hard to identify and plan their operations in isolation. Al Abdulmohsen, who had been living in Germany since 2006, showed the symptoms of social and ideological disaffiliation that did not raise the suspicion right away. His social media activity showed him as an anti-Islamic, perceived as being oppressed, which is a characteristic of many persons who commit such acts. This is a problem because it makes it rather difficult for intelligence services to determine who is likely to go on to make threats and who is only voicing discontent. This type of attack is in line with other occurrences that have happened in Germany, particularly the 2016 Berlin Christmas Market attacks; this highlights the frequency of this threat and the necessity of early prevention. The consequences of the attack are not limited to the material damage and the people who were killed or wounded, it also has an impact on the trust of the people, the number of attendees of events, and the morale of the society. Christmas markets have been a part of the festive season and culture and thus have become easy targets for those who want to strike and create terror. The physical evication of the market in Magdeburg and other markets including the one in Erfurt presents the paradox between the need to secure public places and the desire to observe traditional events. Also, the incident called attention to the question of the effectiveness of the physical barriers, including bollards and barriers to vehicles that could have limited the damage. Nevertheless, the incident which took place in Germany revealed that there are still weaknesses that need to be eradicated even though the country has a rich history of implementing such barriers in response to previous attacks. To avoid such incidents in the future it is crucial to take several measures. Improving the physical security of mass events should be at the forefront of security planning. The use of Bollards, Planters and fortified barriers must be a standard feature in any event that involves a large number of people as these seemingly harmless systems barriers with discourage vehicle use assault. Besides, artificial intelligence physical infrastructure, be other very technologies helpful such as identifying facial potential recognition threats before anomaly detection becomes a threat. Thus, these technologies can be used in public places to recognise threats within crowds of people without infringing on the rights of individuals. Another critical element of counter-terrorism is community involvement. The lone wolf type of attackers may show changes in their behaviour or make complaints that if identified earlier can be contained. Community-based initiatives that encourage acceptance of diversity and provide resources for the oppressed can also help in reducing feelings of isolation. It is thus important for campaigns that aim at changing individuals’ behaviours towards positive and constructive causes to address issues of misinformation, hate and division. This is because efforts that are made by the public in reporting any suspicious activity through hotlines or local programs can act as an added security measure. Thus these grassroots efforts not only increase security but also foster unity of the society and thus neutralize the intentions of terrorists. On the policy front, there is nothing like international cooperation. Thus, stricter screening procedures for those who have been previously identified as having ideological biases must be respected while protecting human rights. This is because terrorist threats can be identified and reported across the border and within the European Union as well. The work of Germany in creating the international standards of COE in the area of counter-terrorism can provide the groundwork for a more coordinated and more efficient approach to such incidents. In addition, there are some important measures which should be implemented after the incident has taken place, for example, comprehensive victim support programs and community healing activities. Offering medical, psychological, as well as financial support to the victims and their families not only meets the basic needs but also enhances society’s ability to bounce back from a devastating incident. However, there are still some issues to be addressed. The issue of increasing security measures and at the same time ensuring that the freedoms and civil liberties that are enjoyed in democracies is a constant battle. Too much surveillance or profiling poses the risk of alienating the population and worsening conditions that lead to radicalism. Also, the actions of lone wolf attackers are highly unpredictable therefore even with the best precautionary measures in place, there is no guarantee that another attack cannot be conducted. Other barriers that hinder the integration of technologies in the healthcare sector include; the cost of implementation for small municipalities that are likely to host events. Thus, the case of Magdeburg is a tragic example of how the threat of terrorism has not decreased and how a comprehensive approach is needed to tackle it. The work that remains is to increase the levels of security, work with the communities, and cooperate at the international level to decrease the risks. However, these measures should be taken with the understanding that the effort is to ensure that society remains open and accepting, two principles that terrorism seeks to dismantle. While Germany and the rest of the world mourn the victims of Magdeburg we can change our loss into something positive and make sure that open spaces are not turned into places of fear and segregation.

Philippine Missile Crisis And Taiwan Contingency – Analysis	The indefinite deployment of a powerful U.S. weapon system in the northern Philippines and Beijing’s strong reaction to it has the makings of a new missile crisis. Manila wants to acquire a Typhon mid-range capability (MRC), but Beijing warned this would trigger a dangerous arms race. Manila argues that its procurement decision is driven by its own security calculus. But the cost, sophistication, and nature of this capability and the timing fuel doubts, adding to the boiling cross-Strait flashpoint. South China Sea or Taiwan Strait? Typhon MRC was installed in Laoag in northern Luzon during a joint Philippines-United States exercise last April and has stayed since, much to China’s chagrin. Laoag City is the capital of Ilocos Norte province, the stronghold of the powerful Marcos family. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. served as vice governor, governor, and representative of the province’s second district. His late father, strongman Ferdinand Sr., also served as a representative before becoming a senator and, eventually, president. Hence, stationing Typhon in the city suggests it has the nod from the highest official in the land. Choosing Laoag may be both strategic and expedient, given its location and buy-in of national and local leadership. Other provinces, like neighboring Cagayan, have aired unease about increased U.S. military presence, worried this may affect Chinese investments and put them directly in harm’s way should hostilities break out. The storm brought by the appearance of the Typhon was preceded by the expansion of U.S. military access in the northern theater closer to Taiwan. This fueled speculation that the move was more in line with a cross-Strait crisis rather than deterring China in the South China Sea. From where it is presently fixed, the MRC can fire missiles that can hit targets way beyond the South China Sea, including the Mainland, Taiwan, and parts of the Western Pacific. Beijing replied to this unprecedented prolonged arms deployment by staging its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test in 44 years. The Typhon deployment infuriated China. Not even U.S. allies, such as Japan and South Korea, have allowed installment of the platform on their territory, possibly anticipating China’s reaction. While Seoul’s THAAD bid may be understood in light of Pyongyang’s growing nuclear and ballistic arsenal, no other South China Sea claimant has seen China’s maritime grab in such stark view as to warrant hosting a foreign lethal missile system on their soil. Beijing claimed the move was destabilizing, a view Manila was quick to refute. Likely to assert agency, Manila said it is keen to induct a Typhon to strengthen its defense posture. Owning the capability may be a ploy to allay concerns that the country is simply granting the U.S. free reign to use its territory for its larger strategic goals. The logic is that Philippine-owned U.S. arms on Philippine soil mean the button will be pushed by someone from Manila, not Washington. This is akin to South Korea’s order for a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery, which also riled Seoul’s ties with Beijing. No bystander? But at what cost and risk? Due to its proximity and the presence of over 150,000 Filipino nationals in Taiwan, a cross-Strait emergency presents dilemmas for the Philippines. Manila already struggles to deal with Beijing in the South China Sea in the west and would not wish to have another front in the north. But the prospect of a forceful takeover of the self-ruled island worries the Southeast Asian country. While Manila abides by the 'One China Policy,' it maintains unofficial ties with Taipei, which is also an important trade partner and investor. Allied exercises in northern Luzon and Batanes, expanded American military footprint, and Typhon’s indeterminate placing in that space can be seen from the prism of the Taiwan crisis. Three of the four new agreed locations for US military presence are in northern Luzon. For the first time in the history of the Philippines-US Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), a naval base was opened for US access. Camilo Osias Base in Santa Ana, Cagayan stares at Taiwan across the Luzon Strait. Four of the five original EDCA locations are all air bases further south. The other one is an army base. Typhon was stationed at Laoag International Airport. Another new EDCA site was the Lal-lo airport in Cagayan. That both Laoag and Lal-lo are civilian airports suggests that even strategic non-military real estate can be tapped in a possible contingency operation. All these developments give the impression that Manila is warming up to a possible Taiwan emergency, which some estimate may happen by 2027. Washington is reportedly keen on building a potential dual-use port in Batanes closer to Taiwan. Northern Luzon was a theater for joint Philippine-U.S. military exercises last year. Last October, Philippine and U.S. marines staged drills to evacuate displaced Filipino migrant workers, a scenario that may happen should armed conflict break out. Hence, Beijing’s intensified pressure on its smaller neighbor may be more in reply to Manila taking steps aligned with the U.S. broader deterrence initiative to prevent Beijing from using force against the island. Marcos said that EDCA sites will not be used as staging grounds to target another country. EDCA facilities are also said to be useful for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations. Northern Luzon and Batanes being at-risk for strong typhoons make it a palatable pretext. But China is not buying it and is vigilantly watching Philippine and U.S. actions in this space. Beijing discourages other countries from intervening in the Taiwan issue, saying it is a domestic matter. Even before its ICBM test, China had already warned the U.S. and its neighbors to stay clear of Taiwan. The southernmost of the six exclusion zones where China undertook drills in response to the 2022 visit of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taipei included waters and airspace off northern Batanes. Five ballistic missiles fired by China during that exercise landed in Japan’s EEZ. These actions are messages to Manila and Tokyo, two US allies closest to Taiwan, and are counted upon by Washington as crucial in deterring forcible attempts to change the status quo across the Strait. Philippine participation in a Taiwan emergency is a delicate issue. Repatriating its nationals in Taiwan is a top priority for Manila. It may also help evacuate other foreign nationals, including citizens of fellow ASEAN countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand, which also have big communities on the democratic island. Manila may also permit medical evacuation to Batanes. Delivery of food, medicines, and other basic humanitarian supplies may be considered. Further steps may depend on the country’s comfort level, given the grave hazards involved. Pressure from the U.S. is expected, especially if the latter decides to play a big role in Taiwan’s defense, something to watch under the second Trump administration. However, an anxious domestic Filipino public may also dissuade the government from joining the fray, especially if the stakes are not sufficiently conveyed. Due to its own turbulent ties with Beijing over the South China Sea and its traditionally strong alliance with the U.S., Manila may not be in a good position to broker a cross-Strait dialogue. But predisposing the country to bear U.S. arms as the only way to matter in a Taiwan Strait crisis shows a dearth in imagination. As a founding father of ASEAN, the Philippines, at the minimum, can support ASEAN or an ASEAN country like Singapore or Indonesia to play a more robust role in defusing tensions.

Shaping China’s Periphery: BrahMos Missiles In Southeast Asia – A...	By Atul Kumar One of the crucial objectives of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s visit to New Delhi in January 2025 as a guest for India’s Republic Day celebrations is to explore the BrahMos supersonic missile system’s acquisition. After the Philippines and Vietnam, Indonesia is poised to become the third enthusiastic customer in Southeast Asia for this lethal missile. These states are particularly interested in the land- and ship-based anti-ship variants of the BrahMos, whose prominent utility lies in countering Chinese interference in their naval operations in the South China Sea. The missile’s proven capabilities have already led to its acquisition by the Philippines, while potential deals with Vietnam and Indonesia are underway. Malaysia and Thailand, meanwhile, are considering it for future procurement. However, the BrahMos missile’s induction in China’s immediate vicinity, especially in its contested maritime region, has raised concerns within the Chinese leadership. BrahMos missiles in Southeast Asia The BrahMos missile system has emerged as a highly successful and in-demand weapon produced and exported by India. Developed through an Indo-Russian joint venture, the BrahMos is based on the Russian P-800 Oniks 'Yakhon' missile system, with significant refinements to its features and capabilities. It is a mid-range, ramjet-powered supersonic missile designed for use across all domains—air, sea, and land. The BrahMos can achieve speeds of Mach 2.8 and has a range of up to 800 kilometres; however, export versions are capped at a range of 290 kilometres due to MTCR restrictions. Indian forces have inducted multiple variants of this missile into their own inventory since 2007. Despite its induction into the Indian military, the BrahMos faced challenges in finding export opportunities. Initially, it competed directly with the Yakhont missile, which Russia supplied to Indonesia (2007), Vietnam(2010–2011), and others during the early 2010s. India also encountered Russian resistance over intellectual property, complicating export prospects. The Indian government’s cautious approach in consideration of Chinese sensitivities also influenced decisions, particularly relevant for Southeast Asian buyers such as Vietnam. Most of these impediments have diminished as India’s technological dependence on Russia for this missile’s production has substantially decreased. Moreover, as India-China relations frayed and Beijing intensified its aggressive behaviour, India abandoned its self-imposed restrictions on defence exports. Consequently, the BrahMos missile emerged as a key instrument in India’s defence diplomacy in the 2020s. The Philippines was the first to benefit from this shift, finalising a deal worth US$375 million in January 2022 to equip its marines with three missile batteries. The agreement included training and maintenance support, and the first missile system was delivered in April 2024. This acquisition seems to have bolstered the Philippines’ interest, as its forces are now negotiating for additional missile batteries. Vietnam, a second potential customer, has shown interest in the BrahMos since the 2010s. The country is now finalising a US$700 million deal for five missile batteries, with techno-commercial details already shared. Similarly, Indonesia is negotiating a US$450 million contract, which, once finalised, will further solidify India’s Act East Policy for the defence sector in Southeast Asia. Both Vietnam and Indonesia previously purchased Russian Yakhont missiles, with Vietnam operating the Bastion-P system for coastal defence and Indonesia deploying ship-based anti-ship missiles. Yet, rather than replacing them with similar Russian systems for simpler logistics, both nations have opted for the Indian alternative, reflecting their strategy to diversify defence imports and reduce their dependence on Russia amid global uncertainties. The BrahMos missile’s advanced features and reputation have played a crucial role here. Moreover, Indonesia’s deal might proceed using a national currency arrangement, potentially setting a precedent for future transactions with other buyers. The Chinese conundrum For China, the proliferation of the BrahMos missiles in its immediate neighbourhood, particularly in contested maritime regions, poses a significant challenge. China is acutely aware of the missile’s advanced features, including its dart-like shape for strong penetration capability, radar-absorbent coating for stealth, ramjet engine that limits the adversary’s response time, and its highly accurate composite guidance system comprising INS (Inertial navigation system), SNS (Sensor Network Simulator) and A/P (anomalous propagation) radar components. Additionally, its anti-interference capabilities make the BrahMos a reliable long-range, fire-and-forget missile. Chinese experts have described it as a potential 'troublemaker for international security' due to its capabilities and reach. Notably, in 2021, the BrahMos missile’s deployment near India’s Line of Actual Control (LAC), following the Galwan incident, provoked heated reactions from China, which viewed the move as an obstacle to bilateral talks. China’s concerns regarding the BrahMos are threefold. First, it is dismayed by Russia’s agreement to allow BrahMos exports to the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations, perceiving Russia as indifferent to China’s national security concerns.[1] Second, Chinese scholars argue that the BrahMos’ deployment in Southeast Asia can disrupt the South China Sea’s stability, triggering a regional arms race and escalating tensions and confrontations in existing hotspots. Third, the potential deployment of BrahMos in Vietnam for coastal defence and anti-ship operations is particularly troubling for China, as it will have a clamping effecton the South China Sea’s western side. In the Philippines case, simulations suggest that the launch of 24-36 BrahMos missiles could significantly damage a Chinese aircraft carrier battle group, giving Filipino forces considerable leverage in their maritime regions. As the Philippines deploys BrahMos missiles in Zambales and Luzon provinces, with potential future deployments in the Calayan, Lubang or Palawan Islands, these missiles could cover critical areas such as the Scarborough Shoal, the Second Thomas Shoal, and the region extending from the Taiwan Strait to the Spratly Islands. China also cannot rule out the possibility of collusion between Vietnam and the Philippines. In counter, Chinese analysts argue that Filipino and Vietnamese forces lack the long-range radar systems to provide targets for the BrahMos missiles. However, in the case of disputed islands like the Scarborough Shoal, the location of targets is well-known. Furthermore, the Houthis in Yemen have demonstrated that a lack of advanced ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) capabilities cannot deter them from sending missile attacks against Saudi, Israeli and American assets across the Middle East. In addition, the Philippines has been acquiring radar systems from Japan and Israel, among others, to establish radar bubbles around its maritime periphery. Moreover, the BrahMos missile is a particular threat to China’s large naval platforms, namely, landing ships and coast guard vessels lacking sufficient air defence capabilities. China may consider using sea-based, missile, and air firepower to neutralise these missiles on the ground; however, such actions risk triggering the Mutual Defence Treaty between the Philippines and the United States. Therefore, since July 2024, China has begun employing darker grey zone warfare tactics to dissuade the Philippines from becoming a major strategic threat. Conclusion In China’s view, India is pursuing multiple objectives through its BrahMos missile deals. These include hedging against Sino-Indian relations, positioning itself as a major and reliable arms exporter, and bolstering its maritime partnerships in Southeast Asia, all while leveraging its naval presence to influence land disputes with China. Furthermore, the Philippines and Vietnam could serve as relay bases for Indian naval operations, while the Indonesian acquisition and future deals with Malaysia and others will further boost India’s arms exporter profile globally. The BrahMos deal can act as an anchor contract for India’s future arms sales in the region. This strategy will effectively counterbalance China and its arms supplier behaviour in South Asia. Beyond military implications, China perceives the BrahMos missile contracts with Southeast Asian nations as India’s step to strengthen its strategic ties. These deals are likely to foster long-term military-to-military relationships through training, spare parts, and maintenance support, working to align these countries’ security interests with India’s. Combined with existing political and diplomatic initiatives in the Act East Policy, such defence partnerships will further enhance India’s profile and leverage in the region.

The Trump Threat: How Worried Should South Africa Be? – Analysis	The cracks in US-SA bilateral ties are more than apparent, but not all is gloom and doom. By Ronak Gopaldas and Priyal Singh As the world braces for Donald Trump’s return, uncertainty looms over the future of the international geopolitical landscape. While Africa has historically been a peripheral focus for the United States (US), South Africa has increasingly drawn Washington’s ire for its perceived antagonistic foreign policy positions. Pretoria’s ties with Moscow, Beijing and Tehran, combined with its legal challenge against Israel at the International Court of Justice, present serious diplomatic flashpoints. Policymakers and investors in Pretoria and Washington must carefully consider the major fault lines in their bilateral relationship over the coming years. Two pressing questions are: what has changed since Trump’s first term, and what does this mean for relations with South Africa? The global and US economies are more volatile than during Trump’s initial presidency. In 2017, he inherited favourable economic conditions marked by low inflation, accommodative monetary policy and strong consumer confidence. Those conditions have evaporated. The US federal debt has ballooned to over US$33 trillion from US$19 trillion in 2016, driven by pandemic-era spending, infrastructure investments and chronic deficits. Higher interest rates compound these pressures, eroding fiscal stability. Inflation – subdued during Trump’s first term – persists despite aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes. Trump’s penchant for tax cuts and fiscal expansion could worsen deficits, undermining investor confidence in US economic stewardship. Geopolitical instability exacerbated by wars in Ukraine and the Middle East has disrupted energy markets and heightened global divisions. Financial markets may be underestimating the economic consequences of Trump’s return. His first term featured a mix of policies marked by deregulation and tax cuts, followed by destabilising trade wars. Trump’s second term could see a swift return to protectionism, including tariff escalations that suppress growth, stoke inflation and destabilise global supply chains. Investors expecting a dovish Federal Reserve may instead encounter sustained monetary tightening Investors expecting a dovish Federal Reserve could instead encounter sustained monetary tightening, as Trump’s populist policies keep inflationary pressures high. Initial optimism around deregulation and tax relief may quickly be overshadowed by the broader economic fallout. Emerging markets such as South Africa are especially vulnerable to the dual threats of reflation and redollarisation. Trump’s protectionist agenda and potential geopolitical flare-ups could reignite inflationary pressures or disrupt commodity prices, driving investors back to the US dollar. This would reverse prior rate cut benefits and weaken currencies across emerging markets. The global geopolitical environment has also shifted. The liberal world order, while battered during Trump’s first term, remained largely intact, buoyed by leaders like Angela Merkel and Emmanuelle Macron. Today, this liberal consensus is fractured. Illiberalism and far-right movements are surging, while multilateral institutions struggle with flagging credibility. Trump’s populist and ideologically fluid agenda will likely resonate more in this context and threaten traditional alliances. Closer to home, US-South Africa interactions have frayed since Trump’s first administration. The introduction of a 2024 bill calling for a review of relations underscored the extent of this souring bilateral relationship. With Republicans dominating both Houses of Congress, the question is whether such legislation will now be passed. There is considerable political appetite in Washington for punitivemeasures to be adopted against South Africa. And there is perhaps no greater form of leverage that Washington wields over Pretoria than South Africa’s continued inclusion as a beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Set to expire in September 2025, AGOA provides preferential access to the US market for various goods, supporting thousands of jobs and generating critical foreign revenue. AGOA could be the perfect catalyst for a recalibration in relations between the two countries While South Africa will need some fancy footwork to avoid exclusion, AGOA could be the perfect catalyst for a recalibration in relations between the two countries. Several factors support this constructive yet contrarian outlook. First, Washington uses AGOA as a political tool rather than an economic one, whereas the opposite is true for South Africa. This discrepancy suggests a deal can be done, especially given Trump’s dealmaker instincts. If anything, an approach that uses more stick than carrot could draw South Africa closer to the US and force it to moderate its positions on, for example, Israel and Russia. Pretoria was given a long leash by the Obama and Biden administrations – there will be less leniency under Trump. However, Washington must also tread carefully; overplaying its hand risks alienating Pretoria and driving it further into the orbit of rivals like Moscow and Beijing. For South Africa, the market and reputational risks of AGOA exclusion are substantial. The country must use its status as a gateway to Africa, its critical mineral resources, and its democratic credentials to position itself as indispensable to US interests. Second, South Africa’s Government of National Unity offers an opportunity to reset relations by creating daylight between what it represents versus the policies of the previous African National Congress (ANC) administration. Appointing pragmatic figures like Ronald Lamola, Parks Tau and experienced diplomat Ebrahim Rasool signal a more conciliatory approach. And with South Africa hosting the 2025 G20 summit and the US hosting it in 2026, President Cyril Ramaphosa has an opportunity to build a personal rapport with Trump – which may prove pivotal over the coming years. SA needs more direct and flexible foreign policy with the US, with tangible material interests stated upfront Although many aspects of US foreign policy towards South Africa are beyond Pretoria’s influence, several steps could ensure cooperation on shared priorities. South Africa must quickly understand what will replace Biden’s ‘21st Century US-African Partnership’. Under a more transactional ‘America First’ approach, Pretoria needs to tailor appropriate foreign policies that more directly situate its own material interests with Washington. This may prove challenging as Pretoria has long struggled to clearly define and pursue its national interests in isolation from the shared interests of African or Global South countries. And despite the Government of National Unity, foreign policy remains largely unchanged and dominated by the ANC’s ideological international relations outlook, grounded in an outdated commitment to progressive internationalism. More direct and flexible foreign policy is needed with the US, with tangible material interests stated upfront. Engaging the incoming Trump administration on grand ideas like the need to reform the global multilateral order will simply be a wasted opportunity. What will likely resonate is deeper cooperation on creating a more enabling environment for private investment and developing a more robust export-led South African economy. How to pursue the former with other international partners while pursuing the latter with Washington, will test the mettle of South Africa’s foreign policy establishment over the next four years, and should be confronted head-on.

Is Prabowo’s 100-Minister Cabinet A Step Towards Autocracy? – Ana...	By Adi Abidin As he began his presidency, Prabowo Subianto’s ‘Red and White Cabinet’ reveals a swift and aggressive consolidation of power, positioning himself as the dominant political force in the country. With over 100 individuals in top government roles — a ‘100-minister cabinet’ — Prabowo leverages this structure to entrench loyalty, neutralise opposition and tighten his grip on Indonesia’s political and government institutions, paving a potential pathway towards autocracy. Indonesia has not seen a 100-minister cabinet since former president Sukarno. Sukarno’s autocratic ‘Guided Democracy’ prompted a sprawling cabinet to consolidate power, but this political move could not prevent his ultimate downfall. Due to this unsuccessful precedent, Prabowo’s strategy raises concerns of repeating autocratic tendencies under the guise of inclusivity and stability. Prabowo’s cabinet comprises 48 ministers, five cabinet-level officials, 55 vice-ministers and numerous senior advisors, envoys and agency heads. An expansive cabinet structure is not entirely novel, as it builds on a framework established by his predecessor, Joko ‘Jokowi’ Widodo. With no party commanding a majority, the House of Representative’s (DPR) eight factions reflect a fragmented electorate, requiring alliances to establish a legislative majority. Prabowo’s strategy in securing the allegiance of six of the eight gives his coalition control of about two-thirds of the DPR. This leaves only the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) and the NasDem Party without representation in the government. Nonetheless, Megawati Soekarnoputri has indicated that her PDI-P will seek cooperation with the government, especially after her party’s candidate won the Jakarta gubernatorial election. Strategic appointments were key to this consolidation. Leaders of major coalition partners were rewarded with powerful coordinating ministerial roles. Portfolios accorded to parties also reflect their strength in parliament. The Golkar Party — the DPR’s second-largest faction — was granted numerous portfolios, including prestigious ministries. Indonesia’s vast sociocultural diversity requires adequate representation in the government. Prabowo’s cabinet mirrors the nation’s mosaic population, with individuals from major religious communities, ethnic groups and regional constituencies. This includes figures from Aceh, Papua, Minahasa, Bali and Chinese–Indonesian communities. Prominent Muslim organisations like Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah are also well represented, reflecting their enduring influence and ensuring cultural and institutional affiliations are leveraged for political stability. While this inclusivity may be superficial, it bolsters legitimacy and facilitates patronage. The cabinet recognises the growing role of campaign teams, volunteers and financial backers in Indonesian politics. These groups have been rewarded with ministerial roles to secure their ongoing support. Extra-political party groups could be instrumental in mobilising support in countering oppositions. Prabowo’s reliance on technocrats for crucial portfolios reflects a recognition of Indonesia’s complex policy challenges. The economic team, crucial for balancing stability and growth, includes experts like Sri Mulyani Indrawati (finance), Rachmat Pambudy (planning) and Budi Gunadi Sadikin (health). Businessmen-politicians Erick Thohir and Rosan Roeslani manage state enterprises and investments, reflecting strong private-sector ties. Prabowo —like Suharto before — recognises that economic stewardship is pivotal for political success. Prabowo’s inner circle — his so-called ‘kitchen cabinet’ — is composed of trusted confidants and operatives. Prasetyo Hadi, the Minister for the State Secretariat, is a long-time Gerindra party loyalist who oversaw Prabowo’s vast forestry business interests. Sugiono, Prabowo’s former long-time aide, is Minister of Foreign Affair. And Thomas Djiwandono, the President’s nephew and Gerindra’s treasurer, is Vice-Minister of Finance. While not holding any formal government title, Prabowo’s brother — Hashim Djojohadikusumo — wields immense influence over policies and decisions in ways reminiscient of the informal role the first family played in governance during the Suharto era. The armed forces and security, a personal domain of the president, are managed by trusted comrades such as Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin in Defence and Muhammad Herindra at the State Intelligence Agency. Retired police generals, Budi Gunawan and Tito Karnavian, handle political and security affairs as well as home affairs. Numerous retired flag officers hold strategic posts. Leaders in Indonesia’s National Armed Forces and the national police operate under assignments orchestrated by Prabowo to align with his priorities. This deep military involvement consolidates power around the presidency and could weakens civilian oversight — reminiscent of Suharto’s time — raising concerns about a drift towards autocratic control. Prabowo’s 100-minister cabinet represents an audacious experiment in governance. Its meticulous construction reflects a balancing act — accommodating political allies, addressing sociocultural sensitivities and ensuring technocratic competence. But accommodating too many interests might prioritise political expediency over effective governance. More significantly, the massive consolidation of power risks further undermining Indonesia’s democratic trajectory. By subsuming opposition voices and distributing patronage broadly, the cabinet erodes the checks and balances essential for a healthy democracy. Overrepresentation of loyalists and political allies undermines the independence of state institutions, fostering a governance culture centred on loyalty over competence. This shift mirrors global patterns where power centralisation has paved the way for autocratic regimes. The early stages of Prabowo’s tenure underscores a troubling trajectory towards centralisation, cloaked under the guise of coalition-building in a fragmented democracy. His 100-minister cabinet, while presenting itself as a testament to political ingenuity, risks dismantling Indonesia’s democratic foundations. This ambitious structure consolidates power by rewarding loyalty over dissent, marginalising critical voices and embedding a culture of patronage at the highest levels of government. Far from promoting stability, this experiment may erode the delicate balance of power, setting a precedent that endangers the checks and balances crucial for democratic governance.

The Demoralizing Downward Spiral Of Algorithmic Culture – OpEd	In need of a letter certifying that I do not suffer from a disease of international concern, I headed out to my primary care practitioner last Monday. Knowing how busy most doctor’s offices are these days, I decided I’d make it easy on the staff by bringing a) a copy of the WHO’s International Health Regulations (IHR) regulations on diseases of international concern b) a list of the diseases currently covered under this rubric and c) explicit instructions about the elements such a letter must include (i.e. letterhead of the practice, stamp of the practice, doctor’s signature etc.). They assured me that they were familiar with this procedure and that it would be no problem. And when I mentioned that it would be great if they could do it in both English and Spanish, I was assured that would be no problem either as there was a Spanish-speaking provider on staff who could write it up in that language. But again, in the interest of facilitating things, I provided them with a copy of this very type of certification letter written for me some time back by a doctor in Spain. This 'letter,' such as it was, consisted of one sentence of 27 words in Spanish and a couple more than that when rendered into English. Given that there were two staff members present, and that one of them was scrolling on her phone, I figured it would be a simple matter of one of them quickly writing up the letters, checking my file to see if I had any of the diseases of international concern (I had been there a week previous for my annual checkup) and catching my doctor (or one of his colleagues) between patients for a quick signature. However, when I asked the woman in front of me how long it would take, she replied, 'Three to five business days. That’s the procedure. We’ll call you when it is done'. When I told them that I needed it for an appointment first thing on the following Monday in New York and that if I didn’t have all the documents, it would be months before I got another one, they just repeated the mantra that it would be done toward the end of the week, probably late on Friday. On Friday, at 1:45 I received a call saying the letter was ready for pickup. Relieved, I entered the office, checked the letter quickly, and headed out. Upon rechecking it at home, however, I realized that it had not been signed by the doctor, which was one of the first requirements on the list of directions I had handed them on Monday. So back I went to the office and explained to them it would be inadmissible for the bureaucratic procedure in question without that signature. By this time it was getting toward 3:15 in an office scheduled to close at 5:00. The woman behind the counter said she really didn’t know what she could do. I said, 'Why don’t you just write it up and grab one of the doctors in the practice (I had been shifted by them from one doctor to another owing to scheduling jam-ups on their end during the last few years) to sign it?' adding, 'After all, it does not involve disclosure of any of my personal clinical details other than the fact that I do not have any of the mentioned diseases.' After listening to me and saying nothing, she ran off to talk to her manager. When she got back she said, 'I’m going to put an order in for it,' and began typing into her computer looking for the page where she could 'put in an order' for something that could literally be done in 2-3 minutes. I said somewhat incredulously 'Put in an order at this point?' and repeated the idea of typing the letter anew and grabbing one of the doctors between appointments. She said 'That’s not the procedure' and besides, 'Your doctor is no longer in the office,' implying that while they could shift patients from one doctor to the other according to their scheduling needs, my asking that a member of the same ostensibly interchangeable team of doctors carry out this simple task on the same premise was an anathema. After another trip to the invisible manager, she returned saying I could leave and that they’d call me when and if the issue is resolved. An hour later I received a call saying everything was arranged and that I could come and pick up the letter. With a smiling face, she handed me the 27-word letter. But there was only one problem. It was signed not by a doctor but an APRN. When I explained that the directions clearly said that it needed to be signed by a doctor and that the foreign government agency I was taking it to was notorious for rejecting documents that did not conform exactly to their requirements, a confused frown returned to her face. She asked me to sit in the waiting room and ran off to the manager again. It was now 4:45 in the afternoon, 15 minutes before closing time. About 10 minutes later, the heretofore invisible manager emerged, and with a smiling face, assured me that the issue would be resolved shortly. And so it was. At 4:55 she emerged with the letter signed by the only remaining MD at the office, grabbing her, I presume, as she emerged from one of her sessions with a patient. In other words, the issue had been finally resolved by the very unalgorithmic, but highly practical and personal manner I had proposed four days earlier. So, what’s the moral of the story? Before getting to that, I should perhaps say what it is not; the idea is not to point out that the nice people at the office are all irretrievably stupid…at least not yet. Rather it is to demonstrate a phenomenon that is rampant in culture that we seldom talk about openly, never mind decry with all the fury that it deserves. It is the story of how a managerial elite possessed of generalized contempt for the bulk of their fellow citizens and a slavish adherence to an extremely narrow, algorithmically-generated notion of 'efficiency' has created scores of so-called idiot-proof systems that dehumanize and demoralize those who work in or engage with them. And while these systems are wildly successful at walling off the corporations that design them from the need to listen to and mindfully serve those who buy their goods and services, they are not, as my little story above shows, even efficient in any meaningful sense of the term. Those of us of a certain age who have worked in office settings all know (or knew) that person, that wonderful person with a vibrant personality, quick intelligence, and top-notch social skills to whom you could always turn to get things done in a pinch. She—and yes, it was usually a she—knew where all the bodies were buried and the strengths and weaknesses of every person in the house, something she would leverage to make things happen in the most unobtrusive and efficient way possible, pulling those she worked with out of tight spaces again and again along the way. It pains me to say this, but it seems these linchpins of workplace culture are in extremely short supply today. And it’s not, as many people assume, because we lack people with the aptitude to perform in this impressive multimodal manner in our society. No, it is because, despite all the HR-generated rhetoric proclaiming the opposite, the people who design and run the systems within which we work are often true nihilists for whom the magical and life-giving processes of human relations, and what some students of psychological development call 'human becoming,' mean next to nothing. Caught in the 'measure-grab-and-control' tyranny of the algorithmic mind, they cannot even begin to imagine how those they see as lesser than them, might, if left to their own devices, be capable of generating greater efficiencies than their vaunted oh-so-rational systems…and usually with a heaping portion of increased human joy as part of the bargain. Worse yet, they do not realize that putting people in systems that assume they are stupid will, in the long run, make those who have intelligence (and what person doesn’t?) truly and profoundly stupid, sad, and ultimately unresponsive to anyone or anything in the long run. Is that what the managerial elite truly want? Or is it that their imaginations are already so impoverished by fantasies of algorithmic perfection that they truly do not understand the wave of spiritual destruction they have set in motion and feed daily? I honestly wish I knew. This article was published at Brownstone Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlY_WJTM0D8x6	2025-01-21T16:09:48-08:00	
Assessing The Biden Presidency – OpEd	If public opinion polls are the guide, Joe Biden has been the worst president since Richard Nixon. Yet New York Times economics writer Peter Coy gives Biden high marks. 'Biden’s handling of the economy was good, if not great,' he writes. After all, we have record low unemployment, moderating inflation, and economic growth. What’s not to like? Here is the problem. Most of the time, presidents have only a marginal impact on the economy. Consequently, they should be judged not on what happened on their watch, but what they did or didn’t do relative to what happened. Energy. During the presidential campaign, both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris boasted that U.S. oil production was at an all-time high. Yet one of Biden’s first acts as president was the cancellation of the Keystone pipeline, which would have brought oil from Canada to the U.S. He went on to pause new oil and gas leases on federal lands. In the waning days of his administration, he banned offshore drilling on large swaths of U.S. waters. So yes, U.S. oil production is at an all-time high. But that is not because of Biden. It’s in spite of Biden. Taxes. The best thing you can say about Biden’s tax policy ideas is that almost none of them were enacted. When Donald Trump became president, the U.S. had one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. Trump tax reform cut the top rate from 35 percent to 21 percent—resulting in more investment, more output and a larger economy. Biden proposed to cut that tax break in half. Kamala Harris at one point favored eliminating it altogether. Biden also proposed additional taxes on investment income—including unrealized capital gains. I know of no economic model that predicts the economy will get bigger when you impose taxes on capital. The Biden plan also proposed a 12.4 percent Social Security tax on all wages above $400,000, and he repeatedly said families who earn less than that amount would be completely unaffected. However, the income threshold isn’t indexed for inflation. So eventually, all families would be paying the tax, even if they had no increase in real income. Take a 20-year-old couple earning $100,000. With a 2 percent inflation rate and 2 percent productivity growth, that couple would be paying the Biden payroll taxsometime in their 50’s. Worse than the ideas themselves was Biden’s rhetoric. He repeatedly claimed that the wealthy do not pay their fair share. Yet the U.S. tax system is the most progressive in the world—with the top 1 percent paying 40 percent of all income taxes and the top 10 percent paying almost three fourths. Biden has repeatedly claimed that Republicans—going all the way back to Ronald Reagan—have only cut taxes for the rich. Yet the reason why we have the world’s most progressive tax system—with the bottom half of the income ladder paying almost no income taxes at all—is because of Republican tax legislation. Regulation. Another impediment to a strong, vibrant economy is excessive government regulation. The Biden administration weakened the cost-benefit standard that was previously in place—making costly regulations easier to impose. Without even counting Operation Warp Speed (which produced the Covid vaccine), University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan finds that the Trump administration reduced regulatory costs by almost $11,000 per household in present value. By contrast, the Biden-era regulations created a burden of almost $10,000 per household. Here again, the economy did well during the Biden years. But not because of Biden’s policies toward business enterprise. It was in spite ofthem. Unions. Joe Biden boasts that he has been the most pro-union president in U.S. history. There is some truth to that. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and other Biden-era federal policies often require the use of union labor, or require paying a prevailing (union) wage, or include financial incentives to hire union labor on federal projects. But how does that help the economy as a whole? It doesn’t. A union is an attempt to monopolize the supply of labor in some sector of the economy. If successful, the union members will enjoy a monopoly wage. Yet those gains appear to be at the expense of wage income for other workers, not at the expense of capital. When measured correctly, labor’s share of national income has been roughly constant at about 70 percent—for the last century. Over that period, union membership varies—rising to a third of the workforce in the 1950s and then falling to only 6 percent of private sector workers today. These radical changes in union membership appear to have had no impact at all on labor’s aggregate income. Inflation. Economists do not agree on why we had excessive inflation during the Biden presidency. I side with monetary economist Scott Sumner, who says that what we have experienced is almost totally a demand side phenomenon. The government deposited money right into people’s bank accounts. It funded those deposits by borrowing in the credit market, and the Federal Reserve bought most of that debt with newly created money. When people spent their newly acquired funds, they drove up prices. That said, there is one thing economists are unanimous about: The Biden/Harris explanation of inflation is hogwash. There is no such thing as an economic theory of inflation based on greed. The President and the Vice President of the United States repeatedly told the public something that all economists know isn’t true. Health Care. On more than one occasion, Biden promised, 'I will never cut Medicare.' Yet the IRA cut more than $300 billion out of the Medicare Part D program. As a result, drug insurance premiums for seniors last fall would have doubled right before the November elections had the Democrats not found a dubiously legal end run. They 'borrowed' money from the Medicare trust fund and gave it to insurers who agreed not to raise premiums. That election-year gimmick didn’t solve a problem. It merely delayed the problem. The IRA did put a $35-a-month limit on the price of insulin, and it provided for negotiated prices for 10 drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. But the very same bill delayed for a decade a Trump regulation that would have required pharmacists to pass on manufacturer discounts to patients. The net result: 10 percent of beneficiaries will experience lower drug costs, in most cases less than $300 a year. The remaining 90 percent will potentially pay more. Biden can rightfully claim credit for enhanced subsidies in the (Obamacare) exchanges, and that has substantially increased enrollment. But this is the wrong solution for the wrong problem. We are over-subsidizing the healthy and under-subsidizing the sick. Half the people with individual insurance are paying no premium at all. We are literally giving the insurance away. But the out-of-pocket exposure for someone with high medical expenses is $9,200 a year and twice that for a family. News coverage. The mainstream media routinely uses the word 'lie' to describe even small exaggerations by Donald Trump. Yet I have never seenthat word applied to Joe Biden, despite false statements about how our tax system works, how his own tax plan worked, what causes inflation, and what the IRA did to seniors. Maybe there was a Pinocchio once in a while. But never a 'lie.' Just as they ignored the president’s mental health decline, they ignored his dishonest rhetoric. One can only imagine what the poll numbers would look like had the press coverage been more accurate.

Is Trump Really Going To Practice Military Restraint? – OpEd	The three popular pillars of Donald Trump’s electoral success have been grievances about immigrants, unfair trade practices by other countries, and American 'forever wars' overseas. The last one of these beefs was legitimate and fueled by the interventionist U.S. superpower’s major quagmires or debacles in Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Iran, Lebanon, Somalia, Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan. As an example, a recent op-ed by John F. Sopko, who, as special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction since 2012, chronicled the profligate waste of lives and money during the latter half of the two-decade U.S. fiasco in Afghanistan, convincingly argued that bureaucratic incentives in the U.S. military and other agencies to claim success rendered the truth of failure to long be kept from American taxpayers. That problem can be found in the other American catastrophic failures as well. To his credit, during his first presidential term Trump had concluded the Afghan War was a loser, signed an agreement with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, but failed to carry it out before he left office. Joe Biden, his successor, after a short delay, agreed with Trump about the war and took a big hit in the popularity of his new administration when the U.S.-supported Afghan regime collapsed rapidly during the American troop withdrawal, leading to some chaos and more American and Afghan deaths. Biden’s bad experience is why politicians and bureaucrats stay in foreign quagmires; because they don’t want to be tarred with the almost inevitable friction and blame that comes with cutting national losses and exiting. Thus, during his second term, because of his prior campaign rhetoric about ending forever wars, Trump might be expected to be leery of using threats or intimidation that could lead to armed conflict or even a long-term military bog abroad. Yet during the interregnum between his recent election and inauguration, he has complained about high fees to transit the Panama Canal and threatened to take it back (presumably with military force since the Panamanians are unlikely to volunteer giving back the Canal Zone), menacingly demanded to buy Greenland, and joked about making Canada the 51st state. Finally, during the campaign, Trump was asked by Fox News about launching cross-border military attacks on Mexican drug cartels and replied, 'Mexico is gonna have to straighten it out really fast, or the answer is absolutely.' Mark Esper, one of Trump’s defense secretaries during his first term, claims Trump asked for military options against the cartels and was barely talked out of ordering them. Trump’s current aides are building the case for employing such drastic options during a second term. Most of Trump’s implicit or explicit threats so far have been directed at much weaker countries in the Western Hemisphere. Yet during his first term, he also threatened countries in East Asia and the Middle East and took aggressive action in the latter region. Before doing an about face and trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump had implicitly threatened nuclear war with the hermit kingdom by saying that North Korea would be 'met with fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.' It also was reported that Trump privately discussed the possibility of using a nuclear weapon on North Korea and blaming it on another country. In the Middle East, Trump rashly canceled the multilateral agreement with Iran to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the relaxation of economic sanctions and later assassinated the second most powerful Iranian official when he visited Iraq, thus roiling relations with both countries. His proposed appointees for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, and ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, oppose Palestinian self-determination and seem to embrace a 'Greater Israel.' This view usually advocates annexing the West Bank and resettling Gaza after Palestinians are removed. Finally, Trump has vowed to put fewer limits on weapons exports to Israel than even the few the Biden administration imposed. Thus, in a second term, even if Trump avoids U.S. military quagmires on the ground, he may still take or allow allied countries to undertake aggressive military action. Let’s hope his macho bluster against friendly countries in the hemisphere or adversaries further abroad is just to get some sort of negotiating advantage, because even limited military actions—such as, cross-border attacks against Mexican drug cartels, especially without the Mexican government’s consent—could turn into disastrous bogs if things don’t go well; Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan come to mind.

Kazakhstan Rapidly Moving To Become Dominant Naval Power On The C...	Three developments have opened the door for Kazakhstan’s growing ability to challenge the dominance of Russia’s Caspian Flotilla on the inland sea and become the dominant naval force on the body of water. These include Moscow’s transfer of many of the flotilla’s vessels to the Sea of Azov as part of its war against Ukraine; the drying up of the sea itself, which means there are an increasing number of places its larger ships cannot operate; and Kazakhstan’s ambitious naval construction program, which Türkiye and most recently by the United Arab Emirates are aiding (see EDM, August 1, 2023; Window on Eurasia, March 27, September 21, 2024; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, January 15; Orda.kz, January 16). Given the importance of the Caspian to Moscow as a means of end-running Western sanctions and expanding ties with Iran and the Global South, this last trend has alarmed some in Moscow. Nikolai Patrushev, a Kremlin hawk, has demanded that the Russian government work to expand the flotilla to be able to counter challenges (see EDM,August 16, 2022, March 6, 2024; Kaspiskii Vestnik, November 14, 2024). As a result of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s focus on the war in Ukraine, however, that is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Kazakhstan is certain to use its growing naval power to expand its influence in the region and even put pressure on Moscow. Both the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Iran may do so as well, given their growing role in helping Russia keep the canal system that allows Moscow to transfer ships between the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Azov (Window on Eurasia, March 27, 2024). Before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Moscow and most of the world treated the Caspian Sea as a Russian lake dominated by Russia’s Caspian Flotilla. Even when the new littoral states emerged, many observers continued to look at the Caspian this way not only because the initial small sizes of these countries’ navies and of the ships comprising them compared to that of the Russian Flotilla but also because of the relative advantage the Russian fleet had in terms of firepower (see EDM, June 24, 2021). As a result, few have prepared to recognize two seismic shifts that have occurred over the last several years, and the balance of military power there requires rethinking. On the one hand, and most immediately obvious, Moscow has increasingly viewed the Caspian Flotilla as a reserve for its attacks on Ukraine and has regularly transferred ships from that unit to the Sea of Azov to support Russia’s land attacks on Ukrainian targets. That use has seriously reduced the effective firepower of the Caspian Flotilla on the Caspian, cutting back the advantage Russia had relative to the navies of other countries and encouraging them to imagine a larger role for themselves. By 2020, Kazakhstan had more ships than Russia did on the Caspian, but they were, in all cases, smaller and much less heavily armed. Five years later, with the expanded war in Ukraine and the departure of Flotilla ships, Kazakhstan’s numerical advantage is greater, and Moscow’s firepower advantage far less. This has forced Moscow, however, to turn to the PRC to help keep the river-canal system open, allowing such transfers to be opened, an arrangement that gives Beijing leverage over Moscow (Window on Eurasia, March 23, 2022). On the other hand, the Caspian’s water levels are falling rapidly, clogging ports and making it impossible for large ships to approach the shores in many places (see EDM, November 16, 2023). After resisting for years, Russian specialists now concede that Caspian water levels are falling by 68 centimeters (27 inches) a year, a decline that could ultimately point to the death of the sea if it is not reversed and will mean that many ports and links to rivers and canals will be left high and dry (Kaspiskii Vestnik, September 15, 2024). The consequences of that for Moscow’s north-south trade and ability to shift the Caspian Flotilla back and forth between the Caspian and the Sea of Azov as it has up to now are so enormous that even Russian President Vladimir Putin has felt compelled to order regional officials to do something about it. Little evidence exists, however, that his words have yet had much impact (Window on Eurasia, August 29, 2024). These declining water levels already mean the Volga-Don canal is operational for less than nine months a year. Moscow hopes to expand that to 12 months by 2028, but this is unlikely to happen without more outside help. That, in turn, has sparked discussions about building a new and larger canal through the North Caucasus, although the prospects for that are slight as long as the war in Ukraine continues, given the costs involved and Western sanctions (see EDM, March 29, 2019, August 6, 2020, June 1, 2021). Regarding navies in particular, falling water levels in the Caspian further degrades Russia’s advantage there and improves Kazakhstan’s relative position. Since Kazakhstan gained independence in 1991, the country has elected to develop a naval force based on smaller ships that can navigate shallower waters (see EDM, April 24, 2013). Unsurprisingly, Astana has organized naval exercises right up to the Russian sea border to show what it is now capable of, something it would not have done earlier (Window on Eurasia, March 30, October 25, 2024; Kazakh Defense Ministry, September 27, 2024). Holding such exercises helps explain Astana’s increasingly independent line concerning Russia and the appreciation of that independence by other countries in the immediate neighborhood and further afield in the Middle East and beyond. Kazakhstan is unlikely to be the only country to respond to the relative decline of the power of Russia’s Caspian Flotilla. After a slow start, however, it has gone further than other littoral states. The other littoral countries—Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Iran—will also likely expand their naval forces there. Countries such as the PRC and Türkiye, which are concerned with trans-Caspian flows of petroleum and goods, may do as well, either directly or through surrogates. Such developments are likely to transform the geopolitics of this region, but they have already advanced far enough that it is now long past time to stop referring to the Caspian as a Russian lake and to recognize instead the other players’ roles.

The Battle Against Inequality: A Message To The Elite And Super-R...	As the annual World Economic Forum (WEF), described as a gathering of the world’s elite and super rich, meet in Davos, Switzerland, January 20-24, more than 30,000 activists across nearly 50 cities staged protests over the weekend demanding economic justice, climate action, and an end to billionaires’ hold on democracy. The campaign—organized by Fight Inequality Alliance (FIA)—includes the message: 'TAX THE SUPER RICH!' which was projected onto a mountainside near a private airport outside of Davos next to the faces of Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg. Another image declared: 'LET’S DRAW THE RED LINE & STOP PAYING BILLIONAIRES’ TAX BILL!' The campaign coincides with a new report from Oxfam released today, which finds that as billionaires’ wealth soars rapidly, the number of people living in poverty has not changed significantly since the 1990s. The rising inequalities are not only economic but also gender based, with women suffering the most. Niki Kandirikirira, Equality Now’s Global Director of Programmes, told IDN globally, women remain overrepresented in low-paid, insecure, and unregulated jobs. 'Many face unequal treatment at work and little or no access to career advancement opportunities. Women and girls also provide billions of hours of unpaid care and agricultural work daily'. Yet, she argued, this essential labor is undervalued and largely invisible. Care work and domestic food production, which underpins the profits of billionaires, go unpaid or are compensated at poverty-level wages. Women and girls effectively subsidize the global economy, which would collapse without them, but most see little in return, she said. 'The global economic system that allows billionaires and their corporations to grow wealthier by exploiting women’s labor is a system that stands in direct opposition to the SDGs. Fair wages and equal pay for equal work, stronger labor protections, and investments in care work are essential to ensuring a sustainable, equitable future,' she declared. According to the Fight Inequality Alliance, the dramatic visuals in Davos and other symbolic 'red line actions' across the world—is drawing a firm boundary against inequality and calling on leaders to adopt the solutions needed by the 99%, including taxes on the super-rich, investment in public services, tackling the climate crisis, and an end to crony capitalism. The world’s richest 1% exert a powerful influence ‘The World Economic Forum, said the Alliance, is a potent symbol of the current system, in which the world’s richest 1% exert a powerful influence on politics across the globe. Coinciding with the inauguration of the billionaire Donald Trump, this year’s gathering in Davos raises important questions about democracy, inequality, and the power of the super-rich.’ 'We’re done watching another ski resort gathering of the 1% as the wealth of the richest continues to rise to grotesque levels. Oxfam’s new report predicts there will be 5 trillionaires within a decade unless we heed the call to change course. Meanwhile, people are losing their homes to climate disasters and struggling to cover their basic needs,' said Jenny Ricks, General Secretary of the Fight Inequality Alliance. 'Davos is just one example,' said Ricks, who joined the mobilisation in Lusaka, Zambia. 'We’re facing rule by a billionaire class who are quickly becoming outright oligarchs. Democracy is in crisis across the globe. A further explosion of inequality will result. For people on the frontlines of inequality—at the sharp end of this system—it’s time to draw a red line on billionaire rule.' 'These global actions present a powerful alternative,' Ricks said. 'This isn’t just about protesting. It’s about showing the world that change is possible. The global economy is meant to serve all of us, not just the super-rich – but the dominance of the billionaire ruling class makes that impossible. For real change to happen, we have to bust open these elitist discussions and start listening to solutions from people who are on the frontlines of inequality.' Elaborating further. Kandirikirira of Equality Now said many countries, already struggling with limited resources, are forced to divert funds toward debilitating debt repayment instead of investing in programs that could advance the SDGs. Public services like healthcare, education, and social welfare, which significantly impact women’s and girls’ lives, are often the first to suffer when governments are financially constrained. This debt crisis is exacerbated by global wealth inequality, where so much of the world’s resources and financial power are concentrated in the hands of the ultra-rich. 'Women’s economic rights are undermined by discriminatory laws and harmful gender norms that limit their earning potential and decision-making power. In many countries, women are legally restricted in areas such as owning property, accessing credit, or inheriting wealth—which is especially jarring when considering Oxfam’s calculation that 36% of billionaire wealth is now inherited. Widespread legal and cultural disenfranchisement leaves women particularly vulnerable to exploitation and economic shocks,' she declared. Major public investments Meanwhile, FIA says it is mobilising to pressure governments across the globe to prioritise the 99%—by making major public investments in education, healthcare, housing, and tackling the climate and environmental crisis, and ensuring the cost of living is affordable. FIA argues that reforming tax systems to ensure that the super-rich are taxed more is a critical part of the solution. 'We need an international tax on the super-rich to help level the playing field,' said Andrew Andrew Karamagi, Principal Political Advisor at FIA. 'Major investments in public services and an ambitious, well-funded climate deal are also essential to achieving justice for billions around the world, especially in the Global South. If we fail to act, the consequences will be catastrophic. An entrenched billionaire class will undercut democratic systems around the world.' The organisers also stressed that urgent action is critical to avert disaster down the road. 'We’ve seen a huge wave of social unrest across Africa over the past year,' said Karamagi, who joined the mobilisation in Nairobi, Kenya on Saturday. 'Those kinds of movements will continue to surge as millions demand a fair future. And the climate crisis will spiral even further out of control, inflicting its worst punishments on those who did so little to create it. This is not a distant threat—it’s happening now, and it will affect everyone on the planet.' FIA says mobilisation led by FIA and its allies has already led to significant policy changes in several countries. Pressure from FIA and its partners mobilised progress toward an international tax on the super-rich, which gained unprecedented support at the G20 summit in Brazil in November 2024. Progressive tax reform in Mexico seemed impossible, but FIA pressure in the country forced the government to open the debate and introduce a constitutional tax reform that has opened the path to progressive tax reform. In India, FIA ran a 100-day campaign to defend democracy and the rights of all people in elections, achieving a change in political power structures. 'Our people power gives us hope, and our work is just getting started,' said Ricks. 'Imagine a world where governments everywhere prioritised the 99%, by making major public investments in education, healthcare, and housing—and by tackling the climate crisis and ensuring the cost of living is affordable. That’s the world we’re fighting for.' According to FIA Since 2020, the world’s five richest men have doubled their fortunes.

Von Der Leyen Takes Aim At China And Signals To Trump In Cautious...	By Nicholas Wallace (EurActiv) -- European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday criticised Chinese trade distortions, while reminding Americans of their interdependence with Europe. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, von der Leyen warned of a 'China shock' to world trade caused by Chinese export subsidies. In a nod to the protectionist rhetoric of new US President Donald Trump, whom she did not name, von der Leyen also said millions of American jobs depend on European trade. Trump took office the day prior, having promised to impose tariffs on several of America's main trade partners, including Europe. In the run up to Trump's inauguration, there was a surge in imports of European wine and cheese as Americans scrambled to stock-up before tariffs can bite. In Davos on Tuesday morning, the contrast between von der Leyen's handling of Chinese and Trumpian protectionism was stark. Recalling fears of a 'China shock' from rising Chinese exports when the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, von der Leyen said that 'today, some are talking about a second China shock – because of state-sponsored over-capacity.' Last year, the Commission increased import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in response to Beijing's subsidies, which artificially reduce the cost of exports, undercutting foreign competition. 'Many believe – including in China – that it would be in China's long-term interest to manage more responsibly its economic imbalances,' she said. 'It is time to pursue a more balanced relationship with China, in a spirit of fairness and reciprocity.' 'Ready to negotiate' with Trump Von der Leyen did not explicitly refer to the new US president's plan to put up trade barriers. Instead, she made a case for what's at stake for Americans in their country's trading relationship with Europe. 'No other economies in the world are as integrated as we are,' she said. 'European companies employ in the United States 3.5 million Americans, and another million American jobs depend directly on trade with Europe.' She also underscored the interdependence of European and American supply chains for the production of aeroplanes and medicines, and highlighted the importance of Europe as an export market for American goods and capital. 'Europe imports twice as many digital services from the United States as we do from the entire Asia-Pacific. Of all American assets abroad, two thirds are in Europe. And the US provides over 50% of our LNG,' meaning liquified natural gas. 'A lot is at stake for both sides. So our first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests, and be ready to negotiate,' von der Leyen said. Supply chains 'weaponised' In her speech, von der Leyen contrasted the new protectionist winds with the enthusiasm for globalisation that prevailed at the start of the 21st century, 25 years ago. 'This century started with great expectations. 25 years ago, the era of hyper-globalisation was nearing its peak. As supply chains went global, hundreds of millions of people were being lifted out of poverty, especially in India and China.' She also noted that 'technology was seen as an unambiguous force for prosperity and peace,' a veiled reference to today's concerns about the impact of social media on demoracy. 'The world today is still nearly as connected as ever. But it has also started fracturing along new lines,' she lamented. 'International trade institutions have often struggled to address the challenges posed by the rise of non-market economies that compete by a different set of rules' – an apparent nod to China. 'Our supply chain dependencies are at times weaponised, as shown by Russia's energy blackmail,' she said. 'And the very interconnectors that bring us together, like undersea data cables, have become targets.' 'Global race to the bottom' The Commission president also noted global competition for access to 'raw materials, new technologies and global trade routes.' 'We will likely continue to see frequent use of economic tools, such as sanctions, export controls, and tariffs, that are intended to safeguard economic and national security,' von der Leyen said. 'But it is important that we balance the imperative to safeguard our security against our opportunity to innovate and enhance our prosperity,' she added. 'In this spirit, we will need to work together to avoid a global race to the bottom.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMleFaURNNx2lZ	2025-01-21T15:52:54-08:00	
European Rights Court Refuses To Halt Annulment Of Romanian Elect...	By Marian Chiriac The European Court of Human Rights, ECHR in Strasbourg on Tuesday ruled against Romanian presidential candidate Calin Georgescu’s request for it to suspend the Romanian Constitutional Court’s decision to annul November’s presidential elections and order a rerun. The ECHR said it had rejected Georgescu’s request for an urgent ruling because the matter 'fell outside of the scope' of the court’s competence. The decision means the annulment remains in effect while Georgescu’s case is considered in full by the ECHR. Georgescu, a populist politician known for his anti-NATO and pro-Russia stance, won the first round of presidential polls on November 24. His victory signalled that EU-member Romania risked joining the region’s growing trend toward far-right populism. Had he won the presidency – which has oversight of foreign policy and defence – it would have thrown into doubt Romania’s continued support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and marked a shift in the country’s geopolitical trajectory. Georgescu’s surprise win led Romania’s top court on December 3 to order a complete re-run of the election, citing alleged manipulation of public opinion by a 'foreign state', likely referring to Russia. The Constitutional Court said it annulled 'the entire electoral process concerning the election of the president of Romania', as the procedures for a free vote had not been upheld. In his complaint to the ECHR, Georgescu sought to compel Romania’s authorities to organise a second round of voting against pro-Western rival Elena Lasconi, claiming violations of his right to free elections and a fair trial due to the annulment process Prior to the ECHR’s decision, Georgescu’s appeals to Romanian courts were unsuccessful. Early this month, the centrist and centre-left parties in Romania’s ruling coalition agreed to hold the presidential election on May 4, with a potential run-off scheduled for two weeks later. Georgescu has announced he will run again and currently leads in the polls, although the credibility of these surveys has been questioned following his unexpected victory last time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMld8EkQdQV3vM	2025-01-21T15:51:16-08:00	
Trump Says Putin ‘Destroying’ Russia By Failing To Seek Ukraine P...	U.S. President Donald Trump said Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin is 'destroying' Russia by refusing to make a deal to end the Ukraine war, adding that he could speak to Putin soon, without stating a time frame. 'He should make a deal. I think he's destroying Russia by not making a deal,' Trump told reporters on January 20 upon his arrival at the White House following his inauguration. 'I think Russia's going to be in big trouble.' 'Most people thought that war would have been over in one week,' Trump said in what appears to be his most critical public remarks about Putin's war. 'I think he’d be very well off to end that war.' Russia has burned through hundreds of billions of dollars on the war, suffered an estimated 700,000 casualties, and frightened its neighbors, while also sacrificing the lucrative European gas market and access to Western financial markets as the ruble has tumbled in value. The Kremlin is spending about 40 percent of its budget on the military and is struggling to contain inflation even with interest rates above 20 percent. In return, it has seized territory in Ukraine that lays in waste. Trump said he would at some point speak with Putin -- for whom he has often expressed admiration -- without specifying a time. Western leaders with the exception of right-wing figures like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, have shunned meetings and --in most cases -- calls with Putin in an attempt to isolate him politically. 'I got along with [Putin] great. I would hope he wants to make a deal,' Trump said about a possible meeting. The U.S. president also said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had told him he wanted a peace agreement to end the war. During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours after taking office. He has backed off those comments in recent weeks but has still pledged to end the war quickly. Many analysts say it will be difficult to end the war in the near term because Putin believes he is winning and has no incentive to stop the fighting, even as Russia suffers devastating losses in men and equipment. 'When the Trump team starts engaging in these kinds of discussions, they will find that getting Putin to abandon his goal of subjugating all of Ukraine will be the hardest thing in this process,' Mikhail Alexseev, a political science professor at San Diego State University who focuses on Russia and Ukraine, told RFE/RL on January 15 Alexseev said Trump will need to continue aid to Ukraine if he is serious about getting Putin to end the fighting. Russian is gaining territory in eastern Ukraine at the fastest clip since the start of the war amid a Ukrainian manpower shortage. Supporters of Ukraine have expressed concerns that Trump, who has criticized the amount of aid provided by the Biden administration, could pressure Kyiv to make concessions that it has so far rejected, such as surrendering territory currently occupied by Russian forces. However, some experts doubt that Trump will abandon Ukraine, saying a Russian victory could hurt his image as much as the Taliban's seizure of Kabul in August 2021 damaged the Biden administration's reputation. Prior to its full-scale invasion of February 2022, Russia initially invaded and illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and launched its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, capturing and eventually claiming large portions of eastern Ukraine. Alexseev said Trump may seek to change Putin's calculus on Ukraine by countering the Kremlin's interests in other regions like the Arctic, Middle East, and Africa, or targeting his allies like Iran and North Korea. 'What we may see from Trump is a broadening of the bargaining game, taking it to other areas to send more and more messages to Putin,' he said. Trump’s latest remarks came hours after French President Emmanuel Macron cautioned that the war will not end 'tomorrow or the day after' and that it was crucial to leave Kyiv in a position of strength ahead of any potential peace talks. 'Let us not delude ourselves,' Macron said in an address to the French military in northwestern France. 'This conflict will not be resolved tomorrow or the day after.'

North Korea Grants Party Membership To Its Fallen Soldiers In Ukr...	By Ahn Chang Gyu North Korea is posthumously granting membership in the Korean Workers' Party to its soldiers killed in action in Russia’s war with Ukraine -- a perk that will benefit their surviving families, residents in the country told Radio Free Asia. Party membership is a special privilege in North Korea that improves the social status of families related to the member, giving them access to better education, jobs, housing and food rations. It may also give them the right to live in the capital Pyongyang, which has a far better standard of living than the rest of the country. But some parents who are notified that their sons have died in battle did not even know they had been sent to Russia, a resident in the northeastern province of North Hamgyong told RFA Korean on condition of anonymity for security reasons. The Pentagon and South Korean intelligence estimate that around 12,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia since October. According to South Korean intelligence, at least 300 of these have been killed and 2,700 injured. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has acknowledged North Korea’s participation in the conflict. The North Korean people have not been informed, either, but many seem to have heard about it through word of mouth, the resident said. 'In early January, a couple living in Myonggan county, relatives of my close friend, were told to go to Pyongyang without knowing the reason,' the resident said. A senior local official -- the county secretary -- took them to the station in his car and and provided train tickets and lunch boxes to eat on the train -- a rarity in North Korea, where most people cannot freely travel, especially not at government expense. Once in Pyongyang, the couple was given a certificate informing them of their son’s death and a party membership card -- but were told nothing about the nature of his mission or where he died, the resident said. Authorities urged them to keep quiet. 'They did not even allow the bereaved families to cry out loud,' he said. 'They repeatedly urged them not to share information with other relatives or anyone around them.' Special treatment Upon their return, the special treatment for the couple continued. The county secretary picked them up and delivered them to their home, and ordered the factory where the man works to give him a special 10-day vacation, the resident said. But even though the family is already getting the perks, they would rather have their son alive, he said. 'According to my friend, his relative believes his son was killed while deployed to fight in the war with Ukraine,' he said. 'The couple spends each day in tears, mourning the loss of their only son.' Posthumous membership in the party is usually only given in combat situations, not to soldiers who die while performing their usual peacetime duties. Promised homes Another resident of the same province said that the authorities have promised to allow the family members of the soldiers killed in the war with Ukraine to live in Pyongyang as soon as there are available homes for them. Since 2021, the country’s leader Kim Jong Un has been pushing his pet development project -- to build 10,000 homes per year and 50,000 by the end of 2025 -- in the capital. According to the second resident, his wife’s relatives traveled to Pyongyang and received their dead son’s party membership card and death certificate at a ceremony where an official informed them that they would be able to live in the new homes. 'The party has decided that when Hwasong Street, which is currently under construction, is completed, the bereaved families will be called to Pyongyang and live there as Pyongyang citizens,' he said. In previous reports about the housing project, Pyongyang residents told RFA that their homes were being demolished to build the new apartments. Although they were promised the right to live there once the homes were completed, they were concerned that there would not be enough new apartments to accommodate everyone. The second resident said that the authorities asked all the bereaved families to not reveal too much information to the outside world, regarding why they are allowed to move to Pyongyang. 'Among the family members from my wife’s side, there are some who envy the relatives who will be living in Pyongyang in the future,' he said. 'But the parents who lost their son are expressing their anger, saying, ‘What good is it when we lost our son? He was only 21 years old.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMleKXxmZTctP_	2025-01-21T15:45:53-08:00	
Saudi Arabia’s FM Announces Landmark Visit To Lebanon	By Daniel Fountain Prince Faisal bin Farhan said on Tuesday in Davos he would visit Lebanon later this week, the first such trip by a Saudi foreign minister in more than a decade. He made the announcement during a panel on diplomacy at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in the Swiss resort town. The one-day trip on Thursday will mark the first visit by a high-ranking Saudi official to Lebanon since 2015, after years of strained relations due to Lebanon’s perceived alignment with Iran, its role in drug smuggling to Gulf countries, and ongoing instability. Prince Faisal described the recent election of a president in Lebanon, following a prolonged political vacuum, as a highly positive development. He said the Kingdom welcomed the potential formation of a government but emphasized the need for real reforms and a forward-looking approach to ensure sustainable progress. He reiterated that the future of Lebanon rested in the hands of its people, urging them to make decisions that steer the country in a new direction. 'We will need to see real action, real reform and we will need to see a commitment to a Lebanon that is looking to the future, not to the past,' said Prince Faisal. 'And based on what I hear there and what we see, I think that will inform the Kingdom’s approach, but I have to say what I’ve seen so far and the conversations that we’ve been hearing in Lebanon, all allow me to be very much optimistic. 'We’ve always said, it’s really up to the Lebanese to decide and to make the choices to take Lebanon in a different direction.' Prince Faisal also said he is 'cautiously optimistic' about Syria’s future, citing encouraging signs from the new administration in Damascus and the resilience of the Syrian people. He emphasized the need for patience and engagement from both the regional and international communities to help rebuild the country’s broken institutions and create a better future for Syrians. 'I would certainly say I’m cautiously optimistic. I may even lean further because you have, first of all, an administration that is saying the right things in private and in public, doing a lot of the right things, but also you have a Syrian people that are incredibly capable and incredibly resourceful,' he said. He urged collaboration to build on recent positive developments, underlining the collective responsibility to aid Syria’s recovery, especially considering the willingness of the new administration in Damascus to engage constructively with regional and global partners. 'The reality is that they have inherited a broken country with no real institutions and they are having to build all of that from scratch, and that’s not an easy thing,' he said. 'So it’s up to us, I feel in the region first but certainly the international community, to engage, to come and build on this positive development and help Syria and the Syrian people see a much better future.' Prince Faisal highlighted the importance of lifting the heavy burden of sanctions imposed due to actions of the previous regime, noting some progress with waivers from the US and Europe. Prince Faisal was also positive about the region as a whole, including the Kingdom. 'We are certainly in a region that is abundant with risk factors, but we are also in a region that has huge potential,' he told the panel. 'I would say that even with the very difficult year behind us, we have shown that we can be resilient as a region and we can actually look to the future, whether it’s the Kingdom, or the GCC countries, and their ability to stay on track with their economic agendas,' he added. He stressed the importance of avoiding conflict, particularly in light of tensions between Iran and Israel, and expressed optimism regarding the new US administration under President Donald Trump. 'I don’t see the incoming US administration as contributory to the risk of war. On the contrary, I think President Trump has been quite clear that he does not favor conflict,' he said. 'I hope that the approach will also be met on the Iranian side by the addressing of the nuclear program, by being willing to engage with the incoming administration in a way that can help us stay on track with this positive momentum.' Also on the panel was Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar, who expressed hope that the ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas would bring much needed relief to the Palestinian people. 'Let’s be hopeful (about the ceasefire). It’s still a long way to go with what happened throughout the last 15 months negotiating this very difficult conflict,' he said. 'It showed us that everything can be resolved through talks and through engagement, through negotiations, and we started this week with good news. 'We have seen the humanitarian aid coming in, we have seen hostages going back and we hope that this will be a fair system toward stability now.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlVku2CsMlKP_	2025-01-21T15:43:31-08:00	
Grab Greenland? Go On Trump, Expose Fraud Of US Protection And Se...	Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump has boasted about annexing Greenland from Denmark – by military force if needs be. Veteran journalist Ron Ridenour says, ironically, go ahead Trump, grab Greenland, take all of it. It’s not that Ridenour is a fan of the new president or endorses U.S. imperialism. Far from it, Ron Ridenour has been an outspoken critic of American imperialism for over 60 years as a journalist and author. However, he sees value in the Greenland grab in that it exposes the fraud of the U.S. posing as a protector of NATO allies. Ridenour has written extensively on what he calls Denmark’s abject servility to U.S. imperialism and NATO’s aggression. He points out that Denmark has been a loyal lackey in promoting the NATO proxy war in Ukraine against Russia. Now, the U.S. 'leader' (master) is snubbing Denmark’s so-called sovereignty over Greenland. The high-handed contempt of Trump towards Denmark is welcomed by Ridenour because it fatally corrodes the NATO alliance. Ridenour says Denmark has no legitimate authority to rule Greenland, which Copenhagen has treated for centuries with racist colonial arrogance. Trump’s ambition to annex Greenland for U.S. national security interests is an object lesson to NATO allies that they are ultimately dispensable. If Trump goes ahead with the Arctic land grab, then the impact on NATO will shatter the illusions of the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMleoS0YcuoUPp	2025-01-21T15:40:54-08:00	
Rubio Meets Quad Ministers On First Day As US Secretary Of State,...	By Nike Ching Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived at the State Department on Tuesday to warm applause, marking his first visit since being sworn in as the United States’ top diplomat. Addressing hundreds gathered at the department's formal entrance, Rubio emphasized his commitment to a foreign policy centered on U.S. national interests. 'Anything that makes us stronger, or safer or more prosperous' will be our mission, Rubio said, adding that the U.S. will strive to avoid conflicts, while never compromising national security or sacrificing core values. Rubio acknowledged that changes are inevitable but assured the crowd that 'there will be changes, but the changes are not meant to be destructive. They're not meant to be punitive.' The new secretary of state expressed gratitude to the American foreign service workforce and his desire to do something special in his new role. 'I want to thank you – all those who are serving overseas and abroad, some in places that are strong and stable, and others that are more tenuous and dangerous. ... I want to also thank the locally employed staff, the nationals of those countries who work with us,' Rubio said. Following his debut at the State Department, Rubio was scheduled to meet with foreign ministers from the Indo-Pacific Quad on Tuesday afternoon, including Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Japanese Foreign Minister Iwaya Takeshi. The foreign ministers of Japan, Australia and India were in Washington to attend President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Rubio was unanimously confirmed as secretary of state on Monday, becoming the first member of Trump's Cabinet in his second administration. During his confirmation hearing last Wednesday, Rubio outlined key foreign policy challenges, including threats from the Chinese Communist Party, along with mass migration, fentanyl and violent criminals in the Western Hemisphere. He also warned of dictators in Moscow, Tehran and Pyongyang spreading instability, while aligning with and funding radical terror groups.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlVEdSd4og-sX	2025-01-21T15:36:08-08:00	
Philippines: Religious Groups Stage Opposing Rallies Ahead Of 202...	By Camille Elemia Different religious denominations in the Philippines usually stage political rallies in the run-up to national polls, but such demonstrations this year are gathering steam ahead of mid-term elections amid a now-open public feud between the country’s top two leaders. Religious groups from Catholic and Christian persuasions have been flexing their political muscles ahead of the May 12 polls through holding opposing rallies, including one rally that drew 1 million people earlier this month. However, analysts interviewed by BenarNews questioned whether faith-based rallies could sway voters, given recent elections where endorsements of religious groups had limited impact. These demonstrations show the complex interplay between religion and politics in the Philippines, where Christian denominations vie for influence in this predominantly Catholic nation. Already this year indigenous churches Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) held separate rallies for Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing impeachment complaints over her use of confidential funds and her alleged threat of assassination against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church, joined by evangelical and civil society groups, is set to hold a rally against both Duterte and Marcos next week. Analysts differ on whether the focus by church groups on secular government through a series of rallies can bring the religious outcomes they seek. 'These rallies are a show of force,' political analyst Jean Franco from the University of the Philippines told BenarNews. 'This is especially true for the INC, which was implicated in the drug war of formerPresident Rodrigo Duterte during House hearings.' The mobilization of INC is an 'obvious statement of position that they are still supporting the vice president for the 2028 [presidential] elections,' said Erron Medina, a development studies instructor focusing on religion at Ateneo de Manila University. INC spokesperson Edwil Zabala spoke to reporters about a rally that drew about 1 million people on Jan. 13. 'I understand that some would think this is political but it’s not. As far as we’re concerned, it’s not. It’s something moral,' Zabala said in an interview. The INC is the country’s second largest Christian denomination, trailing the Catholic Church whose members total about 80% of the nation’s 115 million people. The KOJC is headed by Duterte family friend Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, who was arrested in southern Davao city in September 2024 on sexual abuse charges in the U.S. and the Philippines. The rift between the Marcos and Duterte families began during the second half of 2024 as the government faced growing pressure to allow an international investigation into former President Duterte’s drug war, which left thousands dead. The House of Representatives then opened an investigation into the alleged budgetary misuse by Sara Duterte’s office in her roles as vice president and education secretary – a cabinet post she held under Marcos until she quit in June. ‘This will start the tipping point’ Next week, 12 Catholic and three Evangelical bishops are to be joined by 230 priests and 54 civil society groups at an 'indignation rally' against Duterte and Marcos, particularly focusing on the administration’s $108.2 billion national budget. Earlier, 10 Catholic priests celebrated Mass at the historic EDSA Shrine to launch a movement to impeach Sara Duterte. The challenge for the inter-faith rally on Jan. 31 is to 'seriously distinguish its agenda' from that of the INC, Medina said. 'Credible religious positioning in politics should be balanced with their original task – to engage in discussions of public morals while calling out political wrongdoing and not actually taking part in the political game,' Medina said in a text message Tuesday. Melba Maggay, a social anthropologist and president of the Manila-based Institute for Studies in Asian Church and Culture, said the rally would be the first time that faith-based and civil society groups come together to protest. 'Churches are usually allergic to direct political involvement, but this is something new. I feel this will start the tipping point,' Maggay, who plans to join the rally, told BenarNews on Tuesday. 'The masses are getting angry at the injustices and corruption in government.' The rallies are taking place ahead of the May 12 elections when Filipinos will vote for all House and half the Senate seats along with local offices. Will it be effective? The once influential Catholic Church has failed to convince voters to choose Church-endorsed candidates. In the 2022 general election, more than 1,200 Catholic clergy endorsed then-Vice President Leni Robredo and running mate Francis Pangilinan for president and vice president, but it had little to no impact on the vote as Marcos and Duterte overwhelmingly won. Noel Asiones, an academic researcher from a Catholic university in Manila, said the results of the 2016 and 2022 presidential elections had shown that the Catholic Church could not sway polls. 'I am now very convinced that the church has zero influence on how Catholic voters choose their candidates. Unlike the INC, there is no Catholic vote in the country. The elections of Duterte and Marcos and their minions blew a big hole in whatever illusion there was for a Catholic vote to become a reality,' Asiones told BenarNews in an email. Analyst Franco, meanwhile, said even though the INC was known for its bloc voting, its power could be an illusion. 'The INC vote can be crucial in tight local races. But in the national elections, not so much. They are only around 1.5% or 2% of the total population,' Franco said. Many evangelical groups have become active in politics and some are more assertive than the traditionally influential Catholic Church. Some of these evangelical groups have members in the Senate and House of Representatives who oppose policies including proposals ondivorce and gender equality. Among those are Sen. Joel Villanueva and his father, Brother Eddie Villanueva, a member of the House who founded Jesus is Lord Church Worldwide. In addition, Rep. Benny Abante, who represents a House district in Manila, is a Baptist minister. For Maggay, the religious scholar and anthropologist, these evangelical groups 'were made in the image of the American Bible Belt,' when missionaries constructed schools in the Philippines during the U.S. colonization of the Philippines. These groups are similar, she said, to the religious right which supports Donald Trump, the newly installed American president. 'These beliefs were exported from America to the Philippines, including the entry into politics and fundamentalism,' she said. 'But the church’s political role is not primarily to put Christians into office or even to insert its own interests into political space as a power bloc.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlfaHCNgGrPX3	2025-01-21T15:32:54-08:00	
As World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025 Opens, Leaders Call F...	Addressing a gathering of global leaders, Klaus Schwab, World Economic Forum Founder and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, officially opened the 55th Annual Meeting, setting the tone for the week by highlighting the meeting's theme: Collaboration for the Intelligent Age. 'This transition from the Industrial to the Intelligent Age is occurring at an exponential pace, carrying unprecedented risks for humanity as we strive to prepare and adapt for its complexities, he said. 'Yet, it also offers significant opportunities to transcend our current challenges and spark a new renaissance – one defined by advancements in knowledge, health, culture and societal welfare.' Schwab called on the global community to rise to the moment with 'constructive optimism', urging stakeholders from all sectors – government, business, civil society and academia – to unite in crafting solutions to shared challenges. 'By embracing constructive optimism and believing in our collective capacity and commitment to improving the state of the world, we can shape the Intelligent Age as an age where every human being can realize their full potential.' Speaking at what he described as 'one of the most uncertain geopolitical and geoeconomic moments in generations,' Børge Brende, President and CEO, World Economic Forum, stressed that the world is at a critical inflection point and that 2025 will be a year of enormous consequence. 'The longstanding international order that existed for the last three decades has receded. We need to find more effective ways to work together. It is the only way forward.' In these turbulent times, democratic and liberal values serve as a critical signpost for stability and progress, said Karin Keller-Sutter, President of the Swiss Confederation 2025; Federal Councillor; Head of the Federal Department of Finance of Switzerland, Federal Department of Finance of Switzerland, adding that open markets, fair and transparent rules and fiscal discipline are the cornerstones of sustained prosperity. 'Only a state with stable institutions can create a sound environment where everyone can realize their potential, and a state must protect this freedom with rules.' Also reflecting on the changing world order, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, outlined Europe's plan to adapt to a new era of 'harsh geostrategic competition' by increasing its competitiveness, strengthening global partnerships and maintaining its commitment to sustainable development. 'To sustain our growth in the next quarter of the century, Europe must shift gears,' she said. 'We should not take anything for granted. We must look for new opportunities wherever they arise. This is the moment to engage beyond blocs and taboos. And Europe is ready for change.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for renewed commitments to security and prosperity in the face of global challenges, emphasizing that partnerships serve as the 'engine for successful economic development.' He highlighted plans to reform German public debt regulations to strengthen domestic growth and emphasized Europe's need to strengthen its defence capabilities and industrial base. His remarks acknowledged geopolitical challenges and uncertainties related to the new administration in Washington, but highlighted optimism about opportunities in emerging technologies. As the war in Ukraine nears its third year, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, urged Europe to solidify its position as a leading global power. Highlighting the need for unity and strategic investment, he emphasized that the continent must prioritize alliances, technological advancements, and a cohesive security and defence policy. He pointed to existing models of cooperation in Ukraine's defence as examples of how collective action can strengthen Europe as a whole. 'Europe needs to compete for the top spot in priorities, alliances and technological development,' Zelenskyy stated. 'We need a united European security and defence policy, and all European countries must be willing to spend as much on security as is truly needed.' Amid rising geopolitical tensions, Ding Xuexiang, Vice-Premier of the People's Republic of China, warned against the growing fragmentation of the global economic system and rising protectionism, emphasizing that 'trade war has no winners'. He advocated for a universally beneficial globalization process, reaffirming China's commitment to a UN-centred multilateral order and calling for greater cooperation in scientific and technological innovation to ensure equitable advancements for all nations. Ding also addressed global challenges such as climate change and economic inequality, urging nations to pursue green transitions and foster sustainable development through inclusive dialogue and partnership. Highlighting China's economic resilience, progress in green energy and ongoing reforms, he asserted that China's growth contributes to global stability and prosperity. 'China's door of opening up will not be closed and will only open even wider, and our business environment will only get better,' Ding said. Pham Minh Chinh, Prime Minister of Viet Nam, reaffirmed the country's commitment to leveraging artificial intelligence (AI). 'We aim to prioritize the establishment of research and development centres, particularly in high-technology sectors. These efforts will not only advance technological innovation, but also position Viet Nam as a hub for high-tech manufacturing and development in the region,' he added. With South Africa recently assuming the G20 Presidency, Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, outlined Africa's objectives for the G20 Summit, set to take place in Johannesburg in November 2025, the first to be hosted in Africa. He said South Africa will focus its G20 Presidency on three themes: solidarity, equality and sustainable development. 'As we confront the challenges of the 21st century – from climate change to pandemics, from poverty to terrorism, from migration to AI – we are again called upon to harness that most powerful, and that most enduring, of human attributes: mutually beneficial cooperation and collaboration,' he said. Navigating the ongoing challenges of regional instability, Isaac Herzog, President of Israel, welcomed the recent ceasefire and release of three hostages, but cautioned against unwarranted optimism. 'I want to be lucid and cautious...there are opportunities, but still risks. We must ensure this never happens again,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlfC_11oXfwJ_	2025-01-21T15:30:27-08:00	
The Kumbh Mela: A Timeless Confluence Of Faith, Culture, And Spir...	The Maha Kumbh Mela is celebrated as the world's largest spiritual gathering, bringing together millions of devotees, ascetics, and visitors to a sanctified confluence of rivers every 12 years. Rooted in ancient Hindu mythology, this event takes place at four sacred locations: Prayagraj (at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati), Haridwar (on the Ganga), Ujjain (on the Shipra), and Nashik (on the Godavari). The Maha Kumbh Mela not only embodies the religious fervour of its participants but also serves as a testament to India's enduring cultural and spiritual heritage. History and Mythological Origins The origins of the Maha Kumbh Mela are deeply entwined with Hindu mythology, particularly the story of the Samudra Manthan, or the churning of the ocean by gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras) to retrieve the nectar of immortality (Amrita). As the celestial pot of nectar emerged, a divine tussle ensued, resulting in drops spilling at four locations on Earth, sanctifying them for eternity. These places became the venues for the Kumbh Mela. Historically, the festival is documented as far back as the 7th century CE during the reign of Emperor Harshavardhana. Over the centuries, the mela has evolved into a global phenomenon that draws millions of participants from across the globe. Significance For Hindus, the Maha Kumbh Mela represents their greatest spiritual desires and is of great significance. During the festival, bathing in the sacred rivers is thought to purify one's karma, free one's soul from sin, and grant moksha, or freedom from the cycle of birth and death. Beyond personal spirituality, the mela is a cultural melting pot that unites people from different places, languages, and customs in a common act of devotion. The mela's main goals are to revive traditional cultural customs, provide a forum for spiritual enlightenment, and encourage religious dialogue among devotees, sages, and academics. Additionally, it provides a chance to raise awareness of environmental issues, with a current emphasis on sustainable practices and river conservation. Traditions and Celebrations The lively customs and intricate ceremonies of the Maha Kumbh Mela are well known. On fortunate times chosen by astrological alignments, millions of sadhus and devotees bathe in the sacred rivers at the Shahi Snan (Royal Bath), the most important of these. It is thought that taking a bath confers spiritual virtue and liberty. The spectacular processions of various akharas (religious groups), particularly the Naga Sadhus—ascetics who forgo worldly goods and wear little or no clothing—are a highlight of the mela. Chants, conch sounds, and music accompany their entrance, which is a display of their devotion and spiritual discipline. The mela also includes yajnas (fire rites), prayer gatherings, and talks by well-known spiritual gurus. The cultural dimension of the festival includes traditional music, dance, and art exhibitions, offering a glimpse into India’s diverse heritage. Stalls selling religious items, handicrafts, and traditional foods add a festive touch to the spiritual atmosphere. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025: Current Highlights Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, is hosting the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 from January 13 to February 26, 2025. Over 400 million devotees are expected to participate over the course of the event, which has already seen large crowds. Nearly 35 million individuals took a sacred bath at the Triveni Sangam on January 14, the auspicious day of Makar Sankranti, illustrating the depth of devotion and faith. The Uttar Pradesh government has built a vast temporary city with all the amenities needed to handle the flood of pilgrims, including thousands of tents, kitchens, bathrooms, and medical facilities. For crowd control and safety, 50,000 personnel and more than 2,500 surveillance cameras have been deployed as part of the security measures. The Shahi Snans on occasions like Paush Purnima (January 13), Mauni Amavasya (January 29), Basant Panchami (February 3), and Maha Shivratri (February 26). Purpose and Modern Relevance The Maha Kumbh Mela, beyond its deep religious significance, plays a pivotal role in preserving and promoting India’s rich cultural heritage. It serves as a living repository of ancient traditions, rituals, and spiritual practices that have been passed down through generations. The mela becomes a vibrant confluence of communities from diverse regions, languages, and cultural backgrounds, offering a unique platform for the exchange of ideas and customs. Through its rituals, processions, and spiritual discourses, the festival fosters a sense of unity and shared identity among its participants, reaffirming the cultural fabric of the nation. Economically, the Maha Kumbh Mela contributes significantly to local livelihoods by generating opportunities for a wide range of stakeholders, including vendors, artisans, and service providers. Temporary marketplaces spring up during the event, showcasing traditional handicrafts, religious artifacts, and regional cuisines, thus supporting local economies and preserving artisanal crafts. Hospitality services, transportation providers, and small businesses also witness a substantial surge in activity, underscoring the festival’s role as a driver of economic growth in host regions. In recent years, the mela has embraced modern relevance by integrating environmental consciousness into its framework. With growing awareness of ecological issues, the festival has become a platform to advocate for sustainable practices and river conservation. Initiatives promoting the use of eco-friendly materials, waste management, and water preservation are now integral to the event’s planning and execution. The massive gathering is leveraged to spread awareness about environmental challenges and inspire collective responsibility among millions of participants. By merging its timeless spiritual essence with contemporary concerns, the Maha Kumbh Mela exemplifies how ancient traditions can adapt to address modern-day challenges, making it not only a celebration of faith but also a convergence point for cultural preservation, economic growth, and ecological stewardship. Conclusion The Maha Kumbh Mela is a celebration of India's age-old customs, cultural variety, and humanity's shared spiritual search. It is much more than just a religious occasion. Prayagraj's 2025 version is a prime example of how traditional customs still have resonance in the contemporary world, encouraging millions of people to pursue inner harmony and serenity. The Maha Kumbh Mela, which combines spirituality, culture, and environmental consciousness, is a tribute to India's long history of religion and solidarity. As the festival progresses, it continues to have an impact on the lives of innumerable attendees, leaving a legacy that cuts over space and time.

Why You Should (Not) Get A Dog: The Pros And Cons Of Dog Ownershi...	Are dogs really the key to better health and a happier life? In this new study, dog owners were invited to describe the biggest benefits and challenges of dog ownership. The commitments and responsibilities of having a dog were found to be both a joy and a burden, highlighting the importance of making a conscious adoption choice. The pet dog population has been growing worldwide. Often benefiting from good press in mainstream media, dog ownership is generally assumed to improve human lives, providing companionship and boosting well-being. While bringing a dog into the family does come with many benefits for a lot of people, the costs of dog ownership should not be overlooked. In fact, previous studies conducted on larger, representative samples of the population could not conclude on a generalisable 'pet effect': Caring for a dog can be costly in time and money, but also emotionally. For instance, having a dog with behavioural problems or a long-term medical condition may elicit worry, sadness, and guilt. In the long run, these negative feelings might turn into chronic stress or depression. The more people know about dogs, the more prepared they are for the reality of having one at home. Informing about the positive, but also the negative facets of dog ownership, may help prospective owners to engage in the adoption process more consciously. Yet, comprehensive overviews of the many costs and benefits of sharing life with a dog remain scarce. Which facets of dog ownership are considered the most costly, and which the most beneficial? How do dog owners perceive and describe the positive and negative aspects of their experience? To find out, researchers at the Department of Ethology at Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) first asked dog owners to rate a list of 33 neutrally-phrased statements related to pet dogs (such as 'Dogs need to be trained and educated', 'Dogs can bring mess and dirt into the house', 'Dogs can keep children company') on a scale from -3 (big disadvantage) to +3 (big advantage). Participants in the study were then invited to describe in their own words what were, for them, the biggest cost and the biggest benefit of having a dog. The belief that dogs brighten people’s lives was found to be the most positively rated item from the list (2.78 on average), while the short lifespan of dogs was rated the most negatively (-1.67 on average). Adding up all ratings together, the authors noted that positive statements were, on average, rated much higher (2.06) than negative statements (-0.66), tipping the cost/benefit scales in favour of the positive side of the dog ownership experience. 'We were also interested to see if all of these facets of dog ownership could group together into bigger components' said Laura Gillet, PhD student at the Department of Ethology and lead author of the study. 'In the end, we found three of them. The first one encompassed the emotional, physical, and social benefits of having a dog. The second one was more on the negative side, referring to the negative emotions and practical challenges arising because of the dog. The third and last component comprised aspects related to the commitment and responsibilities coming with dog ownership in the long term, including, for instance, the time that has to be dedicated to the dog’s daily care and training, as well as the influence of the dog on its owner’s routine and quality of sleep.' This last component divided dog owners the most: while it was positive for some, others saw it as a more neutral, or even as a negative aspect of dog ownership. 'We also analysed open-ended responses because they offer an even better understanding of the costs and benefits' explains Eniko Kubinyi, head of the Department of Ethology at ELTE and principal investigator of the MTA-ELTE ‘Momentum’ Companion Animal Research Group. Dogs were often described as honest, devoted and supportive social partners, showing unconditional, selfless love to their human family.' Daily life benefits were the second most frequently cited theme (31%), with owners mentioning that having a dog improved their lifestyle by encouraging physical exercise and outdoors activities, and brought stability and structure in their life. For 15% of respondents, another major advantage of sharing life with a dog was the opportunity to bond with a member of another species, whose intrinsic qualities were deemed numerous. As for the biggest cost, dog owners were almost unanimous: caring for a dog costs money. Veterinary costs, feeding and other expenses were cited by 95% of the respondents. In comparison, emotional and practical costs were rarely mentioned, only by 4-5% of owners. In summary, the results of this study show that the dog ownership experience is multifaceted and cannot be described in terms of universal costs and benefits that would apply to all owners. Most importantly, the researchers found that, depending on the owner, the commitment and responsibilities coming with dog ownership can be perceived just as much as beneficial as they can be perceived as an emotional and practical burden. Although a ratio in favour of the positive side of dog ownership was to be expected, especially in a sample of dog enthusiasts, it is also possible that some owners struggled with their dogs without being able to talk about it for fear of being judged and labelled as a 'bad owner'. Therefore, the authors’ findings highlight the importance of publicly addressing not only the positive effects of pet dogs, but also the many challenges coming with dog ownership, to reduce the gap between expectations and reality and improve the lives of both humans and dogs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlRWSpE5FfLrj	2025-01-21T15:26:34-08:00
