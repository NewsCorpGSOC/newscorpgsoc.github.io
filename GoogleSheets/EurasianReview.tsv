Behind The Iran-Israel Conflict – OpEd	However many charges of aggression, mass murder and worse the Iranian regime chooses to level against Israel, there is no disguising the fact that it is Iran that seeks to destroy Israel, not the other way around. On April 13, 2024 Iran – which essentially means the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – committed a major strategic blunder. Israel’s audacious attack on the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus on April 1, 2024 had taken out seven Iranian military advisers, including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in the élite Quds Force of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). Such an operation would normally have provoked Iranian ire and an armed response on northern Israel from Hezbollah. Not on this occasion. Instead the incident was used as the trigger for a fundamental shift in Iranian policy which has led to negative consequences for Iran. They are still to be fully worked through and may, in the final analysis, prove existential. For 45 years – namely, since its foundation in 1979 – the Iranian regime had pursued its self-imposed mission of encompassing the destruction of Israel and its people through funding, arming and supporting organizations, groups and militias prepared to attack the Jewish state. At some point in the period leading up to April 13 Khamenei decided that the time had arrived to change tack. It must have been intense analysis and calculation by his advisers that led him to break the principle that had guided Iran’s foreign strategy for so long, and finally launch Iran’s very first direct onslaught on Israel. How must the figuring have gone? 'Israel has never been weaker. It is bogged down in its war in Gaza. It hasn’t succeeded in eliminating Hamas or recovering its remaining hostages. It is being condemned on all sides for vast numbers of civilian deaths. Hezbollah is attacking it daily on its northern border. Houthi missiles are getting through its defenses. It is the subject of an investigation by the International Court of Justice on a charge of genocide. Imagine the effect of a direct Iranian attack. Think of bombs falling on Israeli cities. Think of Israelis in their hundreds slaughtered and injured. Israel will be humbled. The Abraham Accords will disintegrate, and any hope of their extension will be snuffed out.' Khamenei’s military advisers must have convinced him that a massive fleet of kamikaze UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) would overwhelm Israel’s defenses, and at least some 50% of the missiles would get through. The aerial assault involved hundreds of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. In the event Khamenei’s anticipated military and propaganda triumph turned into a humiliation. What Iran’s military strategists perhaps failed to take into account was the united support of Israel’s allies, and Iran's own unpopularity in the Arab world (Iranians may be Muslim, but they are not Arabs). They surely did not count on Jordan and Saudi Arabia helping to block Iran's UAVs from reaching Israel, nor that the UK and France would join the US in backing Israel's Iron Dome in shooting down the Iranian missiles. Their subsequent failure was to underestimate both the chutzpah and effectiveness of Israel’s security and armed forces. Following the aerial assault of April 13, the Iranians were taken by surprise time and again. Within a week Israel had responded with airstrikes on Iranian military sites in Syria and Iran itself, while against a background of continuing tit-for-tat skirmishes, Israel pursued its hunt for the Hamas leaders responsible for the barbaric attack of October 7, and the Hezbollah leaders who supported them. The targeted elimination of Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’s military wing, on July 13 was followed by the even more telling retribution visited on Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas’s political wing. In an especial humiliation for the regime, he was killed in the heart Iran’s capital, Tehran, by an explosion in his guesthouse, on July 31. Then came September 17-18, when hand-held communication devices, such as pagers and walkie-talkies, manufactured specifically for Hezbollah and distributed widely to its operatives, were detonated remotely. At least 42 fatalities and over 3,000 injuries, the vast majority of them Hezbollah operatives, was the result. Though Israel made no claim, the world assumed it was responsible. Albert Einstein is reputed to have said: 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.' Whatever Khamenei's thinking – perhaps he believed his first aerial assault on Israel had been under-powered – he opted for a second, bigger and more focused attempt. He decided to use some 200 advanced Fattah-1 and Kheibar Shekan missiles, and to target military and intelligence locations. In the event this second Iranian attack, launched on October 1, was only marginally more damaging than the first. Once again most missiles were intercepted by Israeli and US defense systems, including support from US naval vessels stationed nearby. How and when Israel would retaliate became the subject of intense media speculation. The theorizing was temporarily suspended when Iran’s prize collaborator, the head of Hamas, Yahyah Sinwar, was shot dead by the IDF on October 16. While welcoming the news as 'a good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world,' US President Joe Biden made it clear that he did not want Israel to target Iran’s nuclear and oil installations for fear of triggering all-out war. When it came, Israel’s response, delivered on October 25, respected his wish and consisted of heavy air strikes on Iranian military targets in Syria and on Hezbollah’s military infrastructure. So Israel and Iran are undoubtedly in conflict, if not formally at war. Anyone who cares to look into the matter can see why no truce can be meaningful. The objective of the Iranian regime, from its foundation in 1979, has been to acquire as much power and influence as possible in order to achieve the key objectives laid down by the regime’s original Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He affirmed repeatedly that the very purpose of his revolution was to destroy Western-style democracy and its way of life, and to impose Shia Islam on the whole world. He identified the United States and Israel as his prime targets, but included what was then the USSR. 'We wish to cause the corrupt roots of Zionism, Capitalism and Communism to wither throughout the world,' said Khomeini. 'We wish, as does God almighty, to destroy the systems which are based on these three foundations, and to promote the Islamic order of the Prophet.' By this he meant his strict Shia interpretation of Islam, for elsewhere he had declared that the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, situated in the heart of Sunni Saudi Arabia, were in the hands of 'a band of heretics'. These objectives have driven the regime ever since, and continue to be its raison d’être. 'We shall export our revolution to the whole world,' declared Khomeini. 'Until the cry 'There is no god but Allah' resounds over the whole world, there will be struggle.' In short, Iran’s leaders want to destroy the world as we know it. They want to achieve political dominance in the Middle East, overthrow Western-style democracy of which America is the prime exponent, wipe out the state of Israel, and impose Shia Islam across the globe. Whether the West wishes to acknowledge it or not, in combatting Iran, Israel is fighting for the free world as a whole.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdMLHTWZQzrvG	2024-11-15T09:19:56-08:00	
Sri Lanka’s Leftist Party Exponentially Improves Its Electoral Pe...	In the Sri Lankan Presidential election held on September 21, the candidate of the leftist National Peoples Power (NPP), Anura Kumara Dissanayake, just scraped through. But in the parliamentary elections held on November 14, his party, the NPP, romped home with a stunning two thirds majority. Sri Lanka's only major leftist party, the National Peoples' Power (NPP), is continuing its dream run in the island nation's electoral politics. It registered a stunning improvement in its electoral standing in the parliamentary elections held on November 14. The NPP secured 159 seats in the parliament of 224 members, which gives it a two-third majority. And it got 61.68% of the valid votes, while in the September 21 Presidential election, its successful candidate, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, got only 42.3% of the votes. An electoral pole vault was on display. After the Presidential election, it was said that if only the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa and the Independent candidate former President Ranil Wickremesinghe had patched up their differences and supported a single candidate, Dissanayake would have been defeated. Premadasa and Wickremesinghe were top leaders of the same party, the United National party (UNP) for decades before they broke up, virtually destroying the Grand Old Party. That argument may have held water in September, but not in November. The voting pattern in the November parliamentary elections showed that even a combination of Premadasa's SJB and Wickremesinghe's National Democratic Front (NDF) would have been no match to Dissanyake's NPP. NPP's Growing Appeal The NPP's appeal had grown exponentially in the past two months. It now covers disparate groups living in different parts of the island and belonging to different ethnic groups. President Dissanayake and his NPP are being seen by more and more people from diverse areas and in diverse communities as the most suitable leader to exercise power in Sri Lanka. Conventional (past) Sri Lankan Presidents and MPs had shown total unconcern for the plight of the common man, people say. They had amassed ill-gotten wealth using State power in total disregard of national economic and security interests. Previously, the NPP was thought to be a left wing representative of the majority Sinhalese, who are about 75% of the population. It seemed as if the NPP had no concern for the minority Tamils and Muslims. This was because the hard core of the NPP was the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which unabashedly and uncompromisingly stood for the Sinhalese' rights viv-a-vis the minorities. But after Anura Kumara Dissanayake became JVP's leader, the party came out of its ideological and communal confines and began to broaden its appeal from the Sinhalese urban working class to the middle and upper classes in all communities and both in the rural and urban areas. Dissanayake reached out to the Corporate sector and assured the entrepreneurs and managers that the NPP will not hinder their growth. This change of image enabled the NPP to make a quantum jump from three seats in the dissolved parliament to 159 seats in the new parliament. Catching up with Minorities A noteworthy aspect of the NPP this time round is that it had put up Tamil and Muslim candidates in the North and East of the island where these minority communities predominate. The NPP candidates here had beaten local Tamil and Muslim bigwigs, like M.A.Sumanthiran in Jaffna. The Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), the oldest and the largest Tamil party since 1949, got only one seat in Jaffna, the Tamil heartland. But the NPP bagged three there. In Trincomalee, the NPP got 2 seats, while the ITAK got only one. In Batticaloa, another Tamil bastion, the NPP got one seat while the ITAK got three. Party Composition in Parliament In the new parliament of 224 seats, the NPP will have 141 elected members and 18 nominated members (also called National List members). The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), will be second with 40 seats, out of which 35 will be elected members and five to be appointed via the National List. The Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) comes third after securing eight seats, from which seven are elected and one is a National List seat. The New Democratic Front (NDF) led by former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, will have five seats, out of which three are elected members and two are National List appointments. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) led by the Rajapaksa family received only 350,429 votes but has managed to secure three seats out of which two (02) are elected. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), Sarvajana Balaya, and United National Party (UNP) have secured a few seats. Pros and Cons of Massive Mandate Sri Lankan voters are now discussing the pros and cons of giving the NPP a two thirds majority. Would it make parliament irrelevant, they ask. Parliamentary redundancy is a real possibility because in other countries, a two thirds majority had led to dictatorship. In the party system, MPs have to obey the party 'whip'. The leaders of the NPP, who are actually hard core members of the original JVP, could road roll party MPs to toe the party line which could be rigid. And under the Executive Presidential system that Sri Lanka has, the President is very powerful. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa used his Executive power fully to take unpopular decisions which ultimately led to a mass revolt (called the Aragalaya) that forced him to flee the country. President Dissanayake and the NPP had promised to do away with the Executive Presidency by enacting a totally new constitution. But there is very little chance of this happening. All past Presidents, from Chandrika Bandaranaike onwards, had promised to abolish the Executive Presidency, only to abandon the idea ultimately. Every President and ruling party had wanted to exercise the powers given to the Executive President by the constitution. Challenges Since 2019, Sri Lankans have been suffering from loss of income and jobs, and rising prices since the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic crisis which followed. Sri Lanka had defaulted on loans running into billions of dollars. The NPP has been promising to reduce economic distress. But it is not clear as to how it proposes to remedy the situation. It needs to root out corruption and inefficiency which is endemic. Politicisation of the bureaucracy and economic decision making has distorted the economy and the functioning of the system. This has to be rooted out by the NPP regime. The other equally worrying problem is the management of foreign powers, who, while extending a helping hand with funds and projects, also extract their pound of flesh in terms of economic and political concessions in pursuit of their national, strategic and geopolitical interests. Dissanayake would need expert help to meet his domestic and foreign policy challenges. He is likely to find the task of reconciling his left wing and nationalistic foreign policy predilections with ground realities and realpolitik. This is the reason why former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been repeatedly saying that voters much choose experienced people and that the Dissanayake government must draft experienced people to guide it when it navigates through treacherous waters both at home and overseas. Wickremesinghe has offered his services, being the most experienced in governance among the present crop of politicians. He has been President once and a Prime Minister more than once. Will Power Corrupt? While the NPP is lauded for its stunning performance, the people of Sri Lanka also are worried that absolute power might go to Dissanayake's head. They quote Lord Acton who said: 'Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' In the past, powerful leaders, whether in Sri Lanka or elsewhere, have not always acquitted themselves well.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdGqHR2pT8OjE	2024-11-15T09:19:04-08:00	
Gen Z Workers: Values Matter, And So Does Financial Security	Despite appearances and tongue-wagging from older observers, it turns out that Gen Z is much more eager to work hard for both social good and long-term financial security than some might think, according to new research from the Ateneo de Manila University. Steeled by economic uncertainty leading up to—and most especially in the wake of—the COVID-19 pandemic, the youngest Filipinos now entering the workforce greatly value both a stable income and personal achievement. These idealistic yet pragmatic members of Gen Z (born between 1995 and 2012) tend to look for meaningful and fulfilling work environments but also willingly forego creature comforts in favor of long-term financial stability. In their seminal study of Filipino Gen Z employees, the Ateneo researchers uncovered clear distinctions in workplace motivation versus previous generations, particularly Millennials (or Gen Y, born between 1980 and 1994); Gen X (depending on the research agency, born in either 1961 or 1965, up to 1979); and Baby Boomers (born after World War II, in 1946 to 1960/1964). These differences reflect how the unique socioeconomic context of each generation influences their motivations and overall outlook. Family matters Filipino cultural expectations concerning familial responsibility play a unique role in Pinoy Gen Z employees' work decisions. Many in this cohort are motivated by the need to support their families financially—an intrinsic motivator in Filipino culture. For Gen Z Pinoys, contributing to family well-being is a main reason for why they seek competitive salaries and benefits that can support both themselves and their loved ones. 'Family is a significant motivator for their work, as they strive to provide a good life for their loved ones. Some participants (of the study) who are the eldest child also reported feeling a greater sense of responsibility to provide for their family,' the researchers noted. Personal achievement and career growth Moreover, Gen Z puts a premium on personal achievement in the form of career growth and skill development. This focus is reflected in their desire for rapid advancement and fulfillment in their roles. Meanwhile, Gen X, who typically value job security and stability over rapid career growth, are less likely to switch jobs for career advancement alone. Baby Boomers also have a strong sense of organizational loyalty—they often stay with one employer for extended periods—but are less driven by the desire for rapid career advancement. Also, while Gen Z and Millennials are both technologically savvy and open to flexible work arrangements, Gen Z has a preference for hybrid or flexible remote work as they value autonomy and balance. In contrast, Millennials, who largely came of age during the rapid expansion of digital workplaces, are more accustomed to structured team-based settings and in-person collaboration. 'Compared to Millennials, who put more value on interesting work and collegial work environments, Gen Zs tend to focus on securing their future through savings and investments,' the researchers said. On a personal level, Gen Z’s emphasis on meaningful work also differs from other generations. Many Gen Z employees are motivated by work that aligns with their passions and allows them to make a positive impact on others and on society at large. This is partly driven by their experience of growing up in a digitally-connected world, where social issues and values-driven missions are increasingly visible and influential. Millennials, who came of age just as the digital world was emerging, also share some of this values-driven focus and likewise seek out work environments that foster a sense of community and purpose. However, Baby Boomers and Gen X tend to prioritize job security and are generally less motivated by the need for their work to align with personal or social values. What employers should know All of these generational differences suggest that companies aiming to retain Gen Z employees should focus on fostering career growth; aligning organizational values with broader social impact; and providing robust financial benefits that cater both to immediate needs and long-term security. Otherwise, companies that rely solely on traditional job security and loyalty strategies might find themselves less effective in engaging and retaining this youngest cohort of employees. Overall, Gen Z’s workplace motivations combine financial pragmatism, personal achievement, and values-driven work in a way that distinctly sets them apart from older generations. 'Financial security is one of Gen Z’s motivating factors, as they view work as an avenue for them to earn and save money for their future. Even though Millennials put a premium on compensation, the Gen Z respondents are more specific as to how they want to use their salary,' the Ateneo researchers explained. 'They also want their work to have an impact on others and society. They want to see how their work contributes to the organization’s mission in general,' they added. Mikee C. Talamayan, Dr. Mendiola Teng-Calleja, and Dr. Jaimee Felice Caringal-Go of the Ateneo de Manila University Department of Psychology and the Ateneo Center for Organization Research and Development published their paper, 'Motivating Filipino Generation Z employees at work: enablers and outcomes,' in the journal Evidence-based HRM in October 2024.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdM7LdlTCiexP	2024-11-15T09:16:37-08:00	
The Evolution Of International Political Sociology (IPS): An Expl...	International Political Sociology (IPS) stands as an interdisciplinary field at the crossroads of international relations (IR), sociology, and political theory. Rooted in the critique of traditional IR paradigms, IPS seeks to bridge gaps between domestic, transnational, and global dynamics, focusing on how social processes shape and are shaped by politics at multiple levels. This article traces the evolution of IPS through nine pivotal theories that have significantly influenced its development. 1. Realism and Its Sociological Limitations Realism, particularly dominant during the mid-20th century, is often seen as a precursor to IPS because of the challenges it inadvertently posed for sociological inquiry. Rooted in the belief that international politics operates in an anarchic system where states pursue power and security, realism largely ignored social forces and non-state actors. While classical realists such as Hans Morgenthau acknowledged human nature's role, structural realists like Kenneth Waltz focused solely on systemic constraints. The sociological critique emerged from this omission, questioning how domestic social structures, cultural contexts, and transnational relationships inform state behavior. IPS grew partly as a reaction to realism's narrow focus, seeking to incorporate broader societal forces into its analysis. 2. Liberalism and the Role of Transnational Actors Liberalism countered realism by emphasizing the role of cooperation, international institutions, and non-state actors in fostering global peace. The liberal theory introduced the concept of transnational networks, including corporations, NGOs, and epistemic communities, which influenced global governance and policy-making. IPS drew from liberalism by highlighting how social interactions among these actors create norms, identities, and practices that transcend borders. The sociological turn in liberal thought underscored the role of individuals and collective actors in shaping political outcomes, a cornerstone of IPS. 3. Constructivism: The Social Fabric of International Politics Constructivism, championed by scholars like Alexander Wendt, marked a significant shift by emphasizing the socially constructed nature of international politics. Unlike realism and liberalism, which viewed the international system as a given, constructivism argued that state interests, identities, and norms are products of social interactions. IPS expanded on constructivist insights, delving deeper into how power and discourse shape these interactions. The field investigates not only the construction of state identities but also how global hierarchies and local practices intersect, producing complex political and social outcomes. 4. Postcolonial Theory: Unearthing Power Dynamics Postcolonial theory challenges Eurocentric narratives in international relations by foregrounding the histories and experiences of colonized peoples. Thinkers like Edward Said and Gayatri Spivak revealed how colonial legacies persist in contemporary global politics through power imbalances and cultural domination. IPS integrates postcolonial insights to explore how global inequalities are reproduced and resisted. By examining issues such as migration, border politics, and racialized hierarchies, IPS emphasizes the role of marginalized voices in reshaping international politics. 5. Feminist Theory: Gendering Global Politics Feminist theory introduced a critical lens to understand how gender shapes international relations. Scholars like Cynthia Enloe highlighted the often-overlooked contributions of women in global politics, from their roles in war economies to their activism in peace movements. IPS builds on feminist critiques by analyzing how gender intersects with race, class, and nationality in global contexts. The focus on micro-level practices, such as the everyday lives of migrants or the gendered impacts of security policies, reflects the field's commitment to nuanced, intersectional analysis. 6. Foucauldian Perspectives: Power, Discourse, and Governance Michel Foucault's theories of power and discourse profoundly influenced IPS. Foucault shifted the focus from state-centric power to the diffuse, everyday practices through which power operates. His concept of 'governmentality' — the art of governing beyond the state — provided a framework for understanding global governance as a network of practices involving states, institutions, and individuals. In IPS, Foucauldian approaches examine how security, development, and migration policies are shaped by specific discourses and practices. For instance, the securitization of borders reflects not just state interests but broader societal anxieties and normative frameworks. 7. Theories of Globalization: Interconnected Realities The rise of globalization theories in the late 20th century offered new ways to conceptualize the interconnectedness of the world. Scholars like Anthony Giddens and Manuel Castells examined how technological advancements, economic integration, and cultural exchanges reshape social and political life. IPS incorporates globalization theories to study how local and global processes interact. For example, it explores how global financial markets influence domestic policies or how diasporic communities maintain transnational ties while navigating local identities. 8. Critical Security Studies: Rethinking Security Critical security studies (CSS) emerged as a direct challenge to traditional security paradigms that prioritized state-centric, military-focused approaches. Drawing from constructivist and poststructuralist insights, CSS redefines security as a social construct, encompassing issues like human security, environmental threats, and cybersecurity. IPS aligns closely with CSS, emphasizing the role of societal actors in defining and contesting security policies. By examining how security discourses shape identities and practices, IPS reveals the underlying power dynamics in seemingly neutral policies. 9. The Anthropological Turn: Everyday Practices in Global Politics The anthropological turn in IPS focuses on the micro-level practices that constitute global politics. Drawing from ethnography and cultural anthropology, this approach examines how ordinary people experience and influence international phenomena, such as migration, trade, or conflict. This perspective challenges top-down analyses by highlighting the agency of marginalized groups and the significance of local knowledge. For instance, studying refugee communities' coping mechanisms reveals how global migration policies are negotiated and resisted on the ground. Conclusion International Political Sociology represents a dynamic field that bridges the theoretical and practical, the global and local, and the structural and individual. Its evolution reflects a growing recognition of the complexity of international relations and the inadequacy of traditional paradigms in capturing this complexity. By integrating insights from realism, liberalism, constructivism, postcolonial and feminist theories, Foucauldian perspectives, globalization studies, critical security studies, and anthropology, IPS offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the social dimensions of global politics. As the field continues to grow, it remains committed to interrogating power, amplifying marginalized voices, and fostering interdisciplinary dialogue. The theories discussed here underscore IPS's central premise: that the political is inherently social, and the global cannot be understood without the local.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdGR-gT2ZIAJz	2024-11-15T09:15:31-08:00	
How Anthropological Theories Shaped International Relations: An E...	Anthropology, as the study of human cultures, societies, and behaviors, has significantly influenced the field of International Relations (IR). It has offered unique perspectives on understanding global politics, power dynamics, and the role of human agency in shaping international systems. This article delves into some of the prominent anthropological theories and their profound contributions to IR, illustrating the interdisciplinary synergy that has enriched the study of global affairs. 1. Structural Functionalism Developed by scholars like Émile Durkheim and Bronisław Malinowski, structural functionalism examines how societal structures serve specific functions to maintain social order. In IR, this theory underscores how institutions, norms, and rituals stabilize international systems. For example, international organizations such as the United Nations or World Trade Organization can be analyzed through this lens. Just as kinship systems maintain cohesion in traditional societies, these global institutions mediate conflict, distribute resources, and establish norms for cooperation. Structural functionalism also explains the persistence of cultural practices and their impact on diplomacy. Rituals and ceremonies in statecraft, such as summits or treaty signings, serve functional purposes by reinforcing trust and shared values among nations. By highlighting the importance of systemic interdependence, this theory provides IR scholars with a framework to understand how global structures operate cohesively despite underlying conflicts. 2. Cultural Relativism Franz Boas's principle of cultural relativism emphasizes understanding societies on their own terms, free from ethnocentric judgments. In IR, this theory challenges Western-centric perspectives, advocating for a nuanced understanding of non-Western states and cultures. For example, during negotiations or conflict resolution, cultural relativism encourages policymakers to consider diverse worldviews. The Westphalian model of sovereignty may not resonate with societies that prioritize communal over individual rights. Similarly, concepts like democracy and human rights must be contextualized within local traditions and histories. Incorporating cultural relativism into IR fosters more equitable global governance by avoiding the imposition of universal norms that might disregard cultural specificities. It also informs ethical foreign policies, ensuring respect for the diversity of global political systems and cultural practices. 3. Symbolic Anthropology Pioneered by Clifford Geertz, symbolic anthropology explores how symbols and rituals shape meaning within cultures. This theory has influenced IR by shedding light on the symbolic dimensions of diplomacy, statecraft, and international norms. For example, national flags, anthems, and state ceremonies serve as powerful symbols that reinforce identity and unity. In IR, these symbols play crucial roles during negotiations and conflicts. The waving of a white flag as a symbol of truce or the use of olive branches in diplomacy underscores the importance of shared meanings in mediating international relations. By analyzing these symbolic practices, IR scholars gain insights into how states construct and communicate their identities on the global stage. Symbolic anthropology thus enriches the understanding of how culture shapes international interactions. 4. Structuralism Claude Lévi-Strauss's structuralism focuses on the deep, underlying structures of human thought that shape cultural practices. In IR, this theory highlights how binary oppositions like 'us vs. them' or 'friend vs. foe' structure international politics. Structuralism provides a lens to understand how narratives of identity and difference underpin global conflicts and alliances. For instance, the Cold War was not just a geopolitical rivalry but also a clash of ideological binaries: capitalism vs. communism. Similarly, global anti-terrorism policies often rely on constructing oppositions between 'civilized' and 'uncivilized' actors. By unpacking these binaries, IR scholars can critique the assumptions underlying policies and identify paths toward more inclusive global frameworks. 5. Post-Structuralism Post-structuralism, influenced by Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, deconstructs the assumptions and power dynamics embedded in social and political systems. In IR, this theory challenges dominant narratives and explores the construction of power and knowledge. For example, post-structuralism interrogates how terms like 'terrorism' or 'rogue state' are constructed and deployed to justify military interventions. It also critiques the universalizing tendencies of global governance, revealing how they often privilege Western ideologies. By emphasizing the fluidity of meaning and the role of discourse, post-structuralism empowers IR scholars to rethink rigid frameworks and embrace alternative perspectives on global issues. 6. Political Ecology Political ecology examines the relationships between environmental issues, political systems, and social structures. In IR, this theory has become increasingly relevant in addressing global challenges like climate change, resource conflicts, and environmental justice. For instance, political ecology highlights how resource scarcity can exacerbate tensions between states or within regions, as seen in water disputes along the Nile River. It also critiques global environmental policies that marginalize indigenous communities or perpetuate colonial legacies. By linking ecological concerns with power dynamics, political ecology broadens IR's scope, emphasizing the need for sustainable and inclusive global governance. 7. The Gift Theory Marcel Mauss's theory of the gift explores the obligations of giving, receiving, and reciprocating in social relationships. This concept has been adapted in IR to analyze foreign aid, economic diplomacy, and alliance-building. Foreign aid, for instance, is not purely altruistic but often involves expectations of political or economic returns. The theory of the gift reveals how these exchanges reinforce hierarchical relationships between donor and recipient states, shaping global power dynamics. By unpacking the symbolic and material dimensions of exchange, this theory provides valuable insights into the complexities of international economic relations. 8. Interpretive Anthropology Interpretive anthropology, associated with Clifford Geertz, emphasizes understanding cultures through the meanings people assign to their actions. In IR, this theory informs the study of international norms, values, and practices. For example, the concept of sovereignty varies widely across cultures. Interpretive anthropology allows IR scholars to analyze how different societies interpret and implement this principle. It also aids in understanding the cultural dimensions of global conflicts, such as the role of religion or tradition in shaping political movements. This theory enriches IR by highlighting the importance of meaning-making in global politics, fostering deeper cross-cultural understanding. 9. World Systems Theory Immanuel Wallerstein's world systems theory examines the global economy as a hierarchical system comprising core, semi-periphery, and periphery nations. While rooted in sociology, this theory draws heavily on anthropological insights into labor, production, and cultural exchange. In IR, world systems theory critiques the inequalities inherent in global capitalism. It highlights how peripheral nations are often exploited for their resources and labor, perpetuating economic dependence on core nations. This perspective informs debates on globalization, development, and postcolonialism. By emphasizing structural inequalities, world systems theory offers a critical lens for analyzing global economic and political relations. 10. Agency and Structure Debate The agency-structure debate in anthropology explores the interplay between individual actions and systemic forces. This debate has influenced IR by highlighting the role of human agency in shaping international systems. For instance, while global structures like capitalism or diplomacy constrain states, individual leaders and social movements often challenge or reshape these systems. The Arab Spring exemplifies how collective agency can disrupt entrenched political orders. By integrating agency into IR analysis, this theory emphasizes the potential for change and innovation in global politics, challenging deterministic frameworks. 11. Ethnographic Methodology in IR Ethnography, the hallmark of anthropology, has enriched IR by providing tools for in-depth, qualitative analysis of international phenomena. Through participant observation and fieldwork, ethnography uncovers the lived experiences of individuals affected by global policies. For example, ethnographic studies of refugee camps reveal how international aid policies are implemented on the ground, often highlighting discrepancies between policy intentions and outcomes. Similarly, ethnographic research on diplomatic practices sheds light on the informal dynamics that shape international negotiations. By centering human experiences, ethnography bridges the gap between abstract theories and real-world practices, making IR more grounded and inclusive. Conclusion The intersection of anthropology and international relations has fostered a richer understanding of global politics by emphasizing culture, meaning, and human agency. The theories discussed here — from structural functionalism to ethnography — illustrate how anthropological insights challenge dominant paradigms, uncover hidden power dynamics, and offer alternative frameworks for addressing global challenges. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the integration of anthropology into IR will remain vital for fostering cross-cultural understanding, promoting equity, and navigating the complexities of global governance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdMaaIZUMRPZz	2024-11-15T09:13:33-08:00	
Pentagon Will Work Quickly To Meet President Biden’s ‘Surge’ Comm...	By C. Todd Lopez In September, President Joe Biden announced he plans to 'surge' security assistance to Ukraine. That surge includes plans to ensure all remaining congressionally authorized funding to support Ukraine, including $5.5 billion in presidential drawdown authority, should be transferred to Ukraine before the administration closes out activities in January. Executing that presidential drawdown authority, which means moving some $5.5 billion in gear from U.S. military inventory to Ukraine before Jan. 20, is a tall order. But Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the Defense Department has demonstrated a remarkable ability to quickly get things done over the past three years. 'It is a short time … just under 70 days,' Singh said during a briefing today. 'This department can do incredible work in that amount of time. The president made clear that … he wants to spend down the authority that Congress has allocated and authorized before he leaves office. We're going to work very hard to make sure that happens.' Since Russia illegally invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has provided about $60.4 billion in security assistance. On Nov. 1, for instance, the department initiated the 69th presidential drawdown authority package to Ukraine, worth some $425 million. 'I expect that for the next coming months of this administration, you're going to continue to see those packages draw down from ... what's available in our stockpiles,' Singh said. 'Again, we're committed to ensuring that Ukraine has what it needs to be successful on the battlefield.' Singh also said that the department has been, since the first transfer of military hardware to Ukraine though PDA, cognizant of what's being sent and of what the department needs for itself to ensure that readiness is maintained. That's something that's not going to change, she said. 'We're constantly refilling our shelves and our stockpiles,' she said. 'The secretary is not going to allow the department to dip below readiness levels that he doesn't feel comfortable with. So, as we continue to refill our own shelves, you're going to see equipment, capabilities continue to flow out.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdFowK7vNfNby	2024-11-15T09:11:23-08:00	
Bangladesh’s Impending Descent Into Islamist Republic – OpEd	Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus's interim administration apparently plans to turn Bangladesh into an Islamist Republic. The country's Attorney General Md Asaduzzaman has said that the word 'secular' should be removed from the nation's Constitution since '90% of the population is Muslim'. Asaduzzaman came up with this argument during a court hearing on the legality of the 15th Amendment, which was passed during the ousted Awami League's tenure in power and which guarantees Bangladeshis freedom to practise their religions. That amendment partly did not undo the status of Islam as state religion enforced in 1988 during the military rule of General H M Ershad, who was later ousted by a popular agitation, but it gave religious minorities freedom to practise their religion. 'Earlier, there was constant trust and faith in Allah. I want it the way it was before. It is said in Article 2A that the state shall ensure equal rights and equality in the practice of all religions. Article 9 talks about 'Bengali nationalism'. It is contradictory,' Asaduzzaman argued during the court hearing. Since he is the chief law officer of the interim government, his pitch in court would not be possible without green light from chief advisor Muhammed Yunus, whose liberal image abroad is clearly in contradiction to ground realities in Bangladesh since the ouster of the Awami League government. Pogroms Against Hindus, Buddhists Someone in Bangladesh claiming to be an 'Islamic Joddha' (Islamic Fighter) forwarded a Facebook post by Islamic Chatra Shibir (student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami) that claimed killing seven Hindus in the recent violence rocking the country's port city of Chittagong last week. The post claims, 'teaching Hindus in Chittagong the lesson they deserved because they had become too bold.' It also called on all to support our 'Muslim army' which, it says, has got 200 Hindus arrested to be 'taught the right lesson.' The attacks on a Hindu locality in Chittagong followed protests by Hindus in the city over a Facebook post by a local Muslim youth seeking a ban on ISKCON. During the protests, police and army mercilessly attacked Hindus, alleged local community leaders. Buddhist tribespeople in the Chittagong Hill Tracts faced similar attacks during a military crackdown following some clashes between them and Muslim settlers last month. A few tribespeople were killed during what community leaders described as 'unprovoked firings.' Indian, US reactions India has strongly urged Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Laureate Mohammed Yunus to take steps to stop violence against Hindus and other minorities. 'We have observed that there have been attacks on the Hindu community in Chittagong. Their properties have been looted, their business establishments have been looted. These happened following incendiary posts on social media targeting Hindu religious organisations,' MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said. Interestingly just before he won the US Presidential Election, Donald Trump lashed out at growing violence against minorities in Bangladesh. 'I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Trump's choice to head National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has also lashed out at 'atrocities against Hindus and other religious minorities in Bangladesh.' In a video of hers widely circulating in the social media, Gabbard described these atrocities as 'a continuation of the atrocities perpetrated by the Pakistani rulers.' Gabbard is a practicing Hindu known for her close relations with India's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Yunus administration has so far dismissed Indian concerns over growing attacks on minorities as 'highly exaggerated,' but with Trump all set to take charge, it can no longer be in self denial over the total lawlessness and anarchy prevailing in Bangladesh. Yunus promised rule of law when he took charge of the interim administration, for which there is no provision in the Bangladesh constitution, but which was apparently justified by the 'Doctrine of Necessity' that has often been used to justify military takeovers in Pakistan. Bangladesh's Growing Mobocracy Since the installation of the interim government and the dissolution of the parliament which the erstwhile Awami League has described as 'illegal', a culture of mobocracy seems to have taken root. All high level functionaries who could not be ousted legally, have been forced to resign by mobs led by student leaders who brought down the government of Sheikh Hasina. All Vice Chacellors, Pro-VCs, even Treasurers in 50 universities of the country have been forced to resign by violent mobs led by the student leaders who have owned up to close links to radical groups like the Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Islami Chatra Shibir. According to media reports, 175 School Headmasters have been forced to resign. Many of them were Hindus and quite a few of them were women. The mobs subjected them to visible humiliation. All Supreme Court judges and many High Court judges including the Chief Justice and Attorney General were forcibly removed by similar mob action, as well as ⁠33 permanent secretaries and 11 ambassdors have bern arbitrarily removed, much before end of their tenure. ⁠Nearly 300 secretaries and Additional secretaries and many more Joint Secretaries, a few hundred police commissioners downward, and Joint secretaries have been appointed without any due process. There has been a wholesale reshuffle in banks and other top financial institutions, mostly on an arbitrary basis. Most of those ousted were seen as close to the Awami League and many of those now installed are known to be close to Islamist radical groups. NHRC resignations Last week, all members of Bangladesh's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) resigned shortly after releasing a report on rising mob violence. The NHRC, chaired by Kamal Uddin Ahmed, along with members Md Salim Reza, Aminul Islam, Kongjari Chowdhury, Biswajit Chanda, and Tania Haque, submitted resignation letters to the president. The NHRC resignations came just days after the release of a report detailing a sharp rise in mob violence and crimes such as beatings, rapes, and political harassment in October. The report also exposed violent attacks on political figures, contributing to growing concerns about human rights and safety in Bangladesh. The NHRC spokesperson, Yusha Rahman, confirmed the resignations but could not specify the underlying cause. The political and communal unrest intensified following Hasina's exit, worsening the nation's human rights scenario. The NHRC's report, which underscored these escalating crimes and unrest, appears to have amplified the gravity of the situation, possibly prompting the commission members to step down. The increasing violence and political instability continue to shape the national landscape, posing significant challenges for the interim government. Ridiculous Cases Yunus' promised Rule of Law has been characterised by pursuit of vendetta as state policy. Nearly 200 cases, mostly with charges of murder, have been filed involving over 200,000 Awami Leaders and activists. Some of them, like the murder case against top cricket icon Shakib Al Hasan and lawyer Z.I Khan Panna, are downright frivolous. Shakib, an Awami League lawmaker, was away playing cricket in Canada at the time of the crackdown on student protestors when the murder he is accused of happened. Panna supported the student protests but fell foul with them for criticising their subsequent conduct after establishment of the Interim government. The height of irony is thst the complainant in the murder case accusing Panna does not know the lawyer and has gone on record to say so. The whole idea is to harass, intimidate and humiliate anyone opposing the mobocracy. Media censorship is enforced by a culture of terror and threat and many journalists and editors have been framed in cases with murder charges. Already, even leading western publications like 'Time' are suggesting a change of national mood with many saying 'Hasina's times were much better.' Owner of two small shops, Hasina Jahan pandered to this feeling with her own story. 'During Hasina's rule, we paid a monthly subscription of few hundred rupees a month to her partymen. Now both my shops have been looted and I am ruined. I am surviving by giving tuition to school students and my sister is making a few bucks by escorting toddlers from well-off families to school,' Hasina told the Federal. 'We don't judge rulers by their politics but by our own experience. See the uncontrollable price rise now,' she stressed to point to Yunus' biggest failure -- control the price of essential commodities like foodstuff. The student leaders and the Islamist radical groups they hail from have periodically taken to the streets to demand resignation of President Shahabuddin Chuppu. Some of them have even called for removal of army chief General Waqar-u-Zaman. Recently one of the newly appointed advisor Mahfuz Alam pulled down the portrait of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from Banga Bhavan, seat of the Bangladesh presidency. Alam, described as the 'mastermind' of the agitation that led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster, has been a hardliner from the radical Islamist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir. He was first inducted as Yunus' personal assistant and then upgraded to a full fledged advisor. But now the student leaders appear to be upset with some of the newly appointed advisors like film Director Mostafa Sarwar Farooqi whose wife Tisha acted in the Mujibur Rahman biopic. Finally the contradictions within the Interim government is beginning to surface. Army to get more powers Amidst the raging chaos, it is reliably learnt that the 'magistracy powers' given to the Army for two months will be extended. Even the borderguards and coastguards will now be given these powers. This enables the military and paramilitary units to arrest anybody on mere suspicion of their involvement with efforts to disturb law and order. Analysts see this as an attempt by Yunus and his coterie to stay in power by avoiding early elections, which has been demanded by the country's leading political parties, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the ousted Awami League. The BNP, which was initially pleased with the Awami League's ouster, has now threatened to hit streets unless elections are announced. The Awami League has already resumed agitations for 'restoration of democracy.' The interim government clearly cannot manage to handle the street agitation of the top parties without the brazen use of the military and paramilitary forces, which are crucial to back up the Islamist radicals under cover of student mobs for the battle of the streets in Bangladesh.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdIfjrwjYW0C_	2024-11-15T09:09:06-08:00	
Jammu And Kashmir: Countering Pakistan’s Disinformation Campaign ...	Pakistan’s Social Media Kashmir Blitz It’s no secret that Pakistan relies heavily on indiscriminate use of social media to not only peddle its pathetic Kashmir narrative but also beguile local youth into picking up guns for waging Rawalpindi’s proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir [J&K]. What’s rather surprising is that New Delhi seldom draws attention of the international community to this concerted disinformation campaign being masterminded by Pakistan army’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence [ISI]. One of India’s leading English daily recently carried an illuminating article on this subject, in which it's mentioned that when compared with the same period last year, the more than 2,000 ‘posts of concern’ flagged during October-November, translates into more than a 22 percentage increase. Quoting 'a senior officer in the central security establishment,' the report mentions that there was a concerted effort by Pakistan to use social media to 'influence and exploit' impressionable minds and radicalise them for anti-national activities. This is indeed very disturbing news. New Delhi’s Response The newspaper report ibid merits deliberation for two reasons. Firstly, inclusion of factual data collated by security and intelligence agencies not only adds authenticity to the piece but also reveals the enormity of Pakistan’s sinister psychological warfare programme. Secondly, whereas the specific information provided has definitely been shared by those in the know with the author, the sources haven’t been named, which indicates that the powers-that-be are for reasons unknown, reluctant to make an official disclosure on this serious issue. Though allowing Islamabad to get away with its falsehood on Kashmir appears inexplicable, New Delhi certainly must be having good reasons for its reticence on this issue. For one, trying to rebut patently absurd claims and untenable contentions doesn’t make good diplomatic sense and only gives the balderdash an additional lease of life. Two, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry has a proclivity of shooting itself in the foot and as such giving it a long rope by keeping silent is in itself a good strategy. Remember Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi admitting on TV that abrogation of Article 370 was India’s 'internal matter'? Or Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari publicly accepting that 'We face a particularly uphill task to try and get Kashmir onto the centre of the agenda at the United Nations'? And by telling his countrymen that 'You should not live-in [a] fool’s paradise' as 'Nobody will be standing there [at UNSC] with garlands in hands,' didn’t Qureshi univocally acknowledge that Islamabad’s massive anti-Article 370 abrogation diplomatic offensive had no substance whatsoever? Necessity of Counter Action Islamabad's bombast on the Kashmir issue may be ignored, but its efforts to beguile Kashmiri youth into joining terrorist ranks definitely needs to be countered through a comprehensive campaign aimed at increasing awareness that exposes Pakistan’s menacing game-plan in J&K. Today’s generation in Kashmir is largely unaware of how for more than three-and-a-half decades their people have been used as cannon-fodder by Pakistan just to further its self-serving interests. Islamabad’s perfidy needs to be called out in order to save local youth of impressionable age from getting lured into terrorism, and this can best be done by citing facts revealed by those responsible for promoting this senseless violence. Reality Check Unlike Islamabad which has no other choice but to rely on disinformation for luring Kashmiri youth into terrorism, all that New Delhi has to do is to educate them of Pakistani perfidy by drawing their attention to true instances that unambiguously expose its double dealings. A few examples: Objective of 'Armed Struggle' Kashmiri youth need to realise that the actual objective of the so-called 'armed struggle' in J&K is not achieving 'azadi' [freedom] but solely for the purpose of bleeding India ‘through a thousand cuts’. They should be aware that Pakistan’s ex President and former army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf has himself admitted this during a TV interview by stating that '... Kashmiris who came to Pakistan received hero reception here. We used to train them and support them. We considered them as Mujahideen who will fight with the Indian Army...' [Emphasis added]. HM chief Syed Salahuddin who also heads the United Jihad Council, an umbrella organisation created by ISI to coordinate the activities of terrorist groups fighting and calls upon young Kashmiris to pick up the gun has endorsed Gen Musharraf’s revelation that the so-called 'armed struggle' has nothing to do with azadi as 'we are fighting Pakistan’s war in Kashmir.' With both the former Pakistan army chief who oversaw terrorist activities in J&K as well ISI's minion Salahuddin who's responsible for conducting terrorist actions in this region admitting that the aim of its so-called 'armed struggle' in Kashmir is solely to wage a proxy war against India, Kashmiri youth need to more careful and not end up being fooled into being used as pawns by Rawalpindi. Assassinations The youth should be reminded that ISI is responsible for assassinating those Kashmiri leaders who opposed Pakistan’s interference in Kashmir. This is evident from former All Parties Hurriyat Conference [APHC] chairman Prof Abdul Ghani Bhat’s 2011 revelation that J&K Peoples Conference chairman Abdul Ghani Lone, All J&K Awami Action Committee chairman Mirwaiz Maulvi Mohammad Farooq and J&K Liberation Front [JKLF] ideologue Prof Abdul Ahad Wani 'were not killed by the army or the police-they were targeted by our own people.' Even Pakistan based JKLF founder Amanullah Khan has gone on record admitting that the ISI created HM terrorist group espousing Kashmir’s merger with Pakistan had killed more JKLF officials than Indian security forces. In an interview given to Arif Jamal, author of a seminal book on terrorism in J&K [Shadow War: The Untold Story of Jihad in Kashmir] Rawalpindi based HM commander Ajmal Khan claimed that his outfit had eliminated 'about 7,000 political rivals [mainly JKLF cadres]'. However, Masood Sarfraz, a former close confidante of Salahuddin maintains that 'the actual number [of Kashmiris killed by HM] is many times higher.' Pro Pakistan Camp’s Doublespeak The defining feature of the ISI sponsored political as well as military campaign in Kashmir is that while both APHC leaders and terrorist commanders demand others to make sacrifices, they themselves conveniently keep their own kith and kin out of harm’s way. For example, though senior APHC leader SAS Geelani maintained that'We [APHC] never denied or ignored the role of gun[s] in our struggle,' he ironically never made any of his sons join any terrorist group. Instead, in 2016, Geelani’s grandson suddenly landed a cushy government job as research officer in Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre in a gazetted grade equivalent position that had been lying vacant since 2005. There is strong evidence to suggest that the then Mehbooba Mufti government offered Geelani’s grandson this job as a quid pro quo for the APHC patriarch’s indulgence in stopping the violence that erupted after HM commander Buran Wani’s killing in an encounter. Such underhand deals are not uncommon and even HM chiefSalahuddin reportedly got a seat in a medical college for his son in a similar sweetheart deal brokered by J&K's Intelligence Bureau [IB] chief and approved by the then Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah! Salahuddin proudly accepts motivating Kashmiri youth into picking up the gun by assuring each aspirant that by doing 'he would get into the real life after this death and he would get peace. Khuda usse raazi hoga' [Allah would be pleased with him]. However, isn't it strange that the HM chief has cleverly ensured that his own sons don’t get a chance to get into 'real life' after death and earn divine blessings? Rather than picking up the gun, two of his sons had instead taken up jobs and served the same government that Salahuddin so vehemently accuses of strengthening what he perceives is New Delhi’s ‘forcible occupation’ of J&K! Additional Issues There’s no dearth of live examples that explicitly prove that despite all its emotional rhetoric, Pakistan has no love lost for the people of Kashmir. How does the recent targeted killing spate of migrant workers and grenade attack on innocent civilians in a local flea market by ISI sponsored terrorists further the so-called ‘Kashmir cause’ defies comprehension. This unsettling case in point leaves no scope for any doubts that other than creating mayhem and a heightened sense of insecurity amongst locals and tourists, such violence achieves nothing else. If such aimless violence continues, it will certainly dissuade tourists from coming to Kashmir and this in turn will adversely impact thousands of locals dependent on the tourism industry. The moot point is that if Pakistan really cares for the wellbeing of Kashmiris as it so vociferously claims, then would it precipitate conditions that deprive locals of their livelihood and order grenade attacks on Kashmiris? So, it's abundantly clear that for Islamabad, creating an illusion to buttress its ludicrous claim that normalcy eludes J&K is more important than the safety and wellbeing of Kashmiris. Adolf Hitler’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels had rightly opined that 'If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it,' and that’s why New Delhi cannot afford to be complacent. Pakistan is waging a multi-dimensional proxy war against India and as such every move that it makes needs to be appropriately addressed and befittingly replied to.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdFSImCsqq4-8	2024-11-15T09:08:03-08:00	
President-Elect Donald Trump And Quandary Over The Russia-Ukraine...	Amid the uncertainties surrounding the incoming Donald Trump administration's likely position and role in the Russia-Ukraine war, Moscow has escalated its war efforts and launched missiles on Kyiv on November 13 - its first missile attack on the Ukrainian capital since August. In response, Ukraine has received temporary solace in the US Secretary of State Blinken's pledges that the 'Biden government will do what it can for Ukraine before leaving office.' With Trump's second term as president in US at the beginning of coming year, uncertainties spiral as to which direction more than three years of Ukrainian resistance and fight against the Russian territorial incursion would take. While President-elect Trump has made it clear he is going to end the war in just one day, it has generated anxiety and debate as to how he is going to accomplish this. He has asserted that the US has no appetite to remain entangled in the wars in distant places where the country does not perceive any direct interest being served. Trump does not want to uphold the international liberal order underlining American exceptionalism either. His transactional worldview suggests that there are no deep ideological divisions in the world as many would like to pit the liberal values upheld by the US against the convergence of authoritarian values championed by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. During his campaign trail, he not only stressed his previous tenure being successful in its diplomatic manoeuvres by managing the great power relations without getting the US entangled in wars but emphasized the way it could successfully fight against the ISIS as well. Ukraine and Russia would Prefer Negotiations to War Ukraine being a small power compared with Russia has been holding off Russian invasion by putting up stiff resistance with its will power and military as well as financial assistance from Europe and the US. It has also enhanced its indigenous capability of producing more weapons. However, external assistance has plateaued even as it needs far more arms and ammunitions to fortify its frontline. While the Western powers have instilled in Ukraine the hope that it can get back its lost territories and restore its 1991 borders, their assistance was not up to the level and proportion that could overpower Russia. The NATO moved cautiously so as not to cross the Russian redlines and allow Ukraine to use long range missiles that could target any part of Russian territory let alone grant membership to it. Meanwhile, Ukraine entered into bilateral security agreements with certain European countries but that is not enough to assure Ukraine of protecting its territories against Russian creeping invasion. In the absence of negotiations tilting in favour of it, Ukraine was not replenished with sufficient military assistance and not allowed to muster enough military muscle to turn the tide of war decisively in its favour. While Russia received fighters from North Korea to maintain its predominance, Ukraine could not receive men in boot from its supporters despite the dire need of them. It has not been able to fortify its defences against the Russian forces within its territory losing ground to the latter. To recover these territories from Russian control, Ukraine would need massive western assistance. Ukrainians would never like to see losing these territories to Russia. Any negotiation that Ukraine enters into from a position of weakness would allow Russia to redraw its map by formally including these territories to its existing boundaries. On the other side, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky whose popularity is gradually dwindling can escape a change of regime by defending these territories from Russian occupation. In the hope of greater and steady assistance from these powers and to demonstrate Russia that the game was going to be a tough one, Ukraine, for the first time, made an incursion into the Russian territory and occupied parts of Kursk region. Now, perceiving the Ukrainian hopes destined to get faded soon, Russia has upped the ante by escalating the war. Both Ukraine and Russia although have been worn out in the protracted war, they will want a negotiated settlement but will never want to be perceived to be in the losing side by their people following the loss of so many lives from their armed forces including mercenaries and conscripted soldiers and civilians. Russian President Vladimir Putin's stated objectives of demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine while remain opaque in their definitions, Russia can demonstrate victory to its people by formally annexing the Ukrainian territories it has occupied over these three years of war. On the negotiating table, it would want guarantees that Ukraine would not be a part of NATO and the military pact would stop eastward expansion by withdrawing all kinds of military activities around and assistance from Ukraine. President-elect Trump would use different tactics to bring Russia to the negotiating table to end the protracted war given his transactional world views. Apparently, he shares good equations with President Putin but Moscow has viewed his electoral victory tepidly. Trump reportedly said unless Russia comes to a negotiating position, Ukraine would be armed to teeth to force it to compromise. War Gravitates Towards Negotiations But Without Blueprint The US under the Biden administration and the European countries have so far refrained from devising and offering any viable plans to end the war through negotiations. These powers as well as Russia and its informal allies continue to buttress their positions in the war without any plans for 'the day after'. Although some neutral powers have taken initiatives to make peace through negotiations, these have not been effective due to their plans being removed from ground realities. Ukraine and the European powers are unlikely to be moved by plans which cede Ukrainian territories to Russia. The European powers without American support cannot push Ukraine to a position of strength. The recent Presidential elections in US suggest that people have lesser appetite for supporting the causes and squandering of American resources for distant countries whereas economic concerns such as inflation and immigration have greater resilience with the masses. In this light and keeping in with speeches of the President-elect Trump during campaign trail, it is obvious that Ukraine is most likely to be bereft of substantial amount of American funds and military assistance which could turn its fate in its favour. There is a growing realisation within the political circle as well that the US has been hard-pressed to sustain military supplies to allies in various theatres of wars and conflicts such as simultaneous supplies of military aircrafts and missiles to Israel and Taiwan have led Pentagon to cancel supplies of the same to Ukraine. Once the Republicans come to dominate both the houses of the Congress, Ukraine in need of desperate military and financial assistance would face further hiccups in the chances of getting them. However, if Ukraine is pushed to negotiation from the current battlefield realities, Russia is sure to gain almost all the advantages that a victory in the war would have allowed. War-fatigued Russia has been sticking to wait out the Western commitment to Ukraine, if that happens then Moscow has everything to relish. There are neoconservatives from the GOP who still believe that American primacy in world affairs must prevail and Russia must pay a heavy price for its invasion of Ukraine. In February 2024, twenty two Senators/national security hawks from the Republican Party supported military assistance to Ukraine joining with the Democrats and defying the GOP's stance. President-elect Trump himself might not want Russia to win all these advantages let alone the believers of American exceptionalism and its primacy. Nobody knows what is on the anvil a ceasefire, armistice or a frozen conflict. However, it is really a matter of concern how both the parties to the war can be brought to a negotiation table without any of them being perceived defeated by their own people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdPx3o3vNCgAV	2024-11-15T09:06:13-08:00	
Christian Bashers Rip Hegseth And Huckabee – OpEd	They’ve started already. One week after the election and the Christian bashers are foaming at the mouth over president-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Pete Hegseth to be Secretary of Defense and Mike Huckabee to be U.S. Ambassador to Israel. Hegseth is a strong Christian who literally wears his religion on his body (he has more than a dozen tattoos emblazoned on his right arm and chest). To be sure, that is bizarre, but that is not what his critics are upset about. They don’t like what the tattoos represent—Christianity. If he had metal spikes hanging from his nose, or had tattoos honoring Lucifer on his neck, that would be fine. But once Jesus is brought into the mix, that’s a call to arms. Indeed, the Christian bashers are explicitly calling him out for wanting a call to arms—they are saying he wants to bring back the Crusades. The Jerusalem Cross on Hegseth’s chest is driving them mad. The left-wing folks at the Daily Beast informed their fans that it is 'a 13th century Crusades symbol, over his right bicep.' They are twice wrong. They are off by 200 hundred years (it dates back to the 11th century, 1099 to be exact) and it is located on his chest, not his right arm. After the overthrow of the Crusader state in 1291, the Jerusalem Cross remained a symbol of Jerusalem for Christians, and today it is the emblem of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, hardly an extremist organization. Another reminder of the Crusades is the Latin phrase, 'Deus Vult,' which means 'God wills it': it is on Hegseth’s right bicep. It is true that it was a rallying cry during the First Crusade. So what? A human rights left-wing activist group from the U.K., Action on Armed Violence, is also exercised about all the Crusader symbols. It says 'Deus Vult' was invoked to 'justify acts of religious violence.' The Bulwark, a publication by the angry never-Trumper Bill Kristol, says these Crusader images are 'disturbing.' What is really disturbing is their ignorance. The Crusades were a defensive reaction to Muslim aggression. Princeton’s Bernard Lewis, one of the world’s most noted historians, says, 'The Crusade was a delayed response to the jihad, the holy war for Islam, and its purpose was to recover by war what had been lost by war—to free the holy places of Christendom and open them once again, without impediment, to Christian pilgrimage.' Also, the Crusaders were volunteers, not papal conscripts. Just as important, according to St. Louis University professor Thomas F. Madden, who has written extensively on this subject, 'All the Crusades met the criteria for just wars.' Action on Armed Violence and the Bulwark slam Hegseth for his ties to Christian nationalism. As I recently pointed out, this is one of the greatest anti-Christian smear jobs of our day. Digging deep, any researcher worth his salt knows how vacuous these charges are. Examples of 'Christian nationalism' include saying in public, 'Blessed is the nation whose God is Lord.' That happens to be Psalm 33:12. Those who say that Trump 'loves the United States of America. He loves God,' are cited as examples of this bogeyman. Singing 'God Bless America' is another indicator of Christian fanaticism. Mike Huckabee is an Evangelical Christian who is a rock-solid supporter of Israel. But according to John Hudson at the Washington Post that is a problem. He is worried that people like Huckabee, who believe that in the covenant that God made to Abraham about Israel, 'have turned that belief into a right-wing brand of Zionism.' Similarly, the militants at J Street have lashed out at Huckabee for his 'extremist views.' Louis Moreno, a former U.S. Ambassador who knows Huckabee, calls him an 'utter nut case.' Why? Because the former Arkansas governor believes in the biblical account of the end of times. If he believed the fiction that the sexes are interchangeable, that would be considered reasonable. Vanity Fair wins the prize for the most irresponsible accusation against Huckabee. After it posts a short critical account of Trump’s nominee, it offers what it calls a Fun Fact. 'Huckabee is a Christian Zionist; Christian Zionists believe ‘Muslims, Jews, and non-Christians are ultimately damned.’' Where did that incendiary comment come from? Apparently from the website of Political Research Associates, a left-wing outlet. It has a post, '101 Christian Zionists,' with lots of statements and links to its sources. On p. 2 it lists five beliefs that it attributes to Christian Zionists, including the one mentioned by Vanity Fair. But unlike most of the other beliefs it cites, this one is not linked to any source, nor is it in quotes. In other words, it was made up by Political Research Associates and Vanity Fair cited it as if it were authoritative. Radicals hate Pete Hegseth because he is a committed Christian and a patriotic American. They hate Mike Huckabee because he is a committed Christian who defends Israel. It’s really not all that complicated.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdLRIeszN745R	2024-11-15T09:05:23-08:00	
Self-Perception And Body Image Of Women: An Overview – OpEd	Self-perception and body image are complex and powerful aspects of identity, especially for women, who face unique societal pressures and expectations. The key insights into self-perception and body image among women include: a. Media Influence: Media, including social media, has a significant impact on body image. Photoshopped images, filters, and idealized beauty standards create unattainable ideals. Many women feel pressured to conform to these ideals, which can lead to dissatisfaction with their own bodies. The 'thin ideal' has long been prevalent in Western media, though there’s been a shift toward celebrating a more diverse range of body types. However, some media still focus on specific body types or features, which can make it hard for women to fully accept their natural shapes. b. Social and Cultural Pressures: Society often links a woman's worth to her appearance, creating pressure to look a certain way. Cultural ideals vary but can include expectations about weight, skin colour, hair, and facial features. Family, friends, and even romantic partners can influence body image through comments and feedback, whether positive or negative. For example, offhand remarks about weight can shape how women see themselves and contribute to self-esteem issues. c. Age and Body Image: Body image concerns can start early, with many girls becoming aware of societal beauty standards by adolescence. Teenage years are a critical period, where comparisons to peers and celebrities are common, often resulting in self-criticism. As women age, body image concerns may shift. Older women may experience changes in self-perception due to life events like pregnancy, menopause, or aging, which can affect the body in various ways. d. Psychological Impact: Negative body image can lead to low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. Many women internalize societal standards, feeling inadequate if they don’t match these ideals, which affects mental health. Eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are extreme manifestations of body image issues and are often rooted in a negative self-perception. Women are disproportionately affected by these conditions, highlighting the mental health risks associated with body image struggles. Self-perception and body image are deeply personal and shaped by external forces. A supportive social environment and access to positive, diverse representations can help foster healthier body image perceptions for women. Causes of change Changes in self-perception and body image can be driven by various factors, ranging from personal experiences to societal trends. These shifts can have both positive and negative effects on how individuals view themselves. The major causes of changes in self-perception and body image include: a. Life Stages and Physical Changes: Adolescence: Puberty brings significant physical changes that affect how young people see themselves. These changes can bring insecurity, especially if adolescents feel they do not align with societal ideals. Pregnancy and Postpartum: Pregnancy changes the body drastically, and new mothers may experience shifts in self-perception. Postpartum, women often face new physical realities that can affect body image. Aging: As people grow older, physical changes like wrinkles, changes in body shape, and hair loss can alter self-perception. Aging is often stigmatized, which can contribute to negative body image. b. Weight Changes and Health Conditions: Weight Gain or Loss: Major weight fluctuations, whether from lifestyle changes, medical conditions, or intentional weight loss, can lead to shifts in body image. People often reassess their self-perception based on their body’s current state. Health Issues and Disabilities: Chronic illness, injury, or disability can alter body functionality and appearance, impacting how people feel about themselves. For some, this shift might bring self-acceptance, while for others, it can lead to self-consciousness. c. Cultural and Societal Trends: Beauty and Fashion Trends: As society's beauty ideals change over time, so does body image. For example, the 'thin ideal' of the 1990s and 2000s has gradually shifted toward celebrating more diverse body shapes. Gender Roles and Expectations: Cultural and societal expectations of gender roles also influence body image. For women, these roles may include pressure to appear youthful, fit, and attractive, while men might face pressure to look muscular and strong. d. Mental Health and Self-Esteem: Low Self-Esteem: People with low self-esteem are more likely to be self-critical about their appearance. This can intensify changes in body image over time, leading to dissatisfaction even when there’s no actual change in appearance. Mental Health Conditions: Conditions like depression, anxiety, or body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) can distort self-perception, leading individuals to see themselves in a negative or unrealistic light. e. Relationships and Romantic Partners: Romantic Relationships: Partners’ opinions can heavily impact self-perception. Positive reinforcement can boost body confidence, while criticism or comments about appearance can lead to self-doubt and insecurity. Breakups and New Relationships: After a breakup, people might reassess their appearance or focus on personal improvement. Similarly, entering a new relationship can sometimes bring renewed focus on appearance. Overall, self-perception and body image are highly dynamic and can shift with life’s stages, societal influences, and internal growth. Encouraging a healthy, balanced view of oneself, while challenging negative influences, can foster a positive self-image. Management of concepts Managing self-perception and body image involves building a positive relationship with oneself, embracing a balanced perspective, and developing coping strategies to handle external pressures. There are some strategies that can help improve and manage self-perception and body image: a. Limit Negative Media Exposure: Curate Your Social Media Feed: Follow accounts that promote body positivity, diversity, and self-acceptance. Unfollow those that lead to negative self-comparisons or unrealistic standards. b. Focus on Health, Not Appearance: Set Functional Goals: Aim to improve strength, energy, flexibility, or mental well-being rather than focusing exclusively on appearance-based goals. Listen to Your Body: Practice mindful eating, regular physical activity, and rest. Appreciate your body for its capabilities and try to connect health efforts to how you feel rather than how you look. c. Engage in Therapy or Counselling: Seek Professional Help: Working with a therapist, especially one trained in body image or self-esteem issues, can help you explore the roots of negative self-perception and develop healthy coping mechanisms. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): CBT is particularly effective for managing body image issues, as it helps you recognize and alter negative thought patterns and behaviors related to self-image. d. Limit Comparisons: Avoid Social Comparisons: Comparing yourself to others, whether in person or online, is a common source of body dissatisfaction. Remind yourself that everyone has unique strengths and features, and focus on your own journey. Use Journaling: Journaling can help you explore and understand your personal journey with body image without judgment or comparison. Reflect on your own achievements and progress rather than external standards. Improving self-perception and body image is a journey that takes time and patience. Building a supportive environment, practicing self-care, and reframing negative thoughts can help us develop a healthier, more balanced self-image.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWetdY-aqEPRdFohquz_oOlm	2024-11-15T09:04:30-08:00	
A Leader’s Quest: Restoring Dignity And Autonomy In A Divided Lan...	Omar Abdullah’s return to office as Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir in October 2024 is a powerful moment for the region, marking a shift towards a potential restoration of autonomy and statehood lost after the 2019 abrogation of Article 370. Following a decisive election victory by the National Conference, Abdullah stepped into leadership at a time when Jammu and Kashmir faces unique political and social challenges. The abrogation of Article 370 had stripped the region of its special status and divided it into two Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Abdullah’s leadership has reignited hopes for restoring the region’s statehood, creating a strong foundation for a future rooted in self-governance and regional identity. Omar Abdullah’s first move as Chief Minister was the formation of a ten-member Council of Ministers, chosen carefully to ensure an equal representation of voices from both Jammu and Kashmir regions. This inclusive approach is seen as a way to foster harmony and regional unity, recognizing the distinct needs and aspirations of the area’s diverse population. The National Conference’s commitment to equitable representation underscores Abdullah’s intent to navigate Jammu and Kashmir’s future through collaborative governance. By bringing balanced voices to the council, Abdullah has signaled his awareness of the socio-political complexities and his dedication to a collective approach in tackling the region’s challenges. One of Abdullah’s earliest and most decisive actions came on October 17, 2024, when his cabinet unanimously passed a resolution calling on the central government to restore Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood. This move, which quickly gained approval from Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, was a significant step in formalizing the statehood cause. Although Abdullah faced some criticism for not first putting the resolution to a vote in the Assembly, his direct action reflects the urgency he attaches to this issue. The resolution for restoring Article 370, which the J&K Assembly passed on November 6, 2024, further highlighted Abdullah’s dedication to autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 and Article 35A, prior to their revocation, had granted Jammu and Kashmir a unique status within India, including the right to have its own constitution and considerable autonomy over local governance. Article 370 allowed the state legislature exclusive powers to make laws on various matters, such as property ownership and residency rights, while Article 35A provided the legislative authority to define 'permanent residents' and ensure exclusive rights to them. The 2019 revocation of these articles brought Jammu and Kashmir fully under the Indian Constitution, opening the region to settlement from other states and changing the landscape of property ownership, employment, and welfare benefits. The November resolution, led by Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Singh Choudhary, called for a dialogue with the Indian government to reinstate these protections. While BJP members in the Assembly protested and argued the resolution was not on the day’s agenda, Speaker Abdur Rahim Rather moved forward with a vote, ultimately leading to its passage. This decision, while divisive, was seen as a bold reaffirmation of the region’s desire for autonomy, and Abdullah’s role in pushing this agenda underscores his commitment to restoring constitutional safeguards for Jammu and Kashmir. Despite these promising steps, Abdullah’s administration is limited by the constraints placed on the Union Territory Assembly, following amendments that vested the Lieutenant Governor with considerable power over administrative and legal matters. Nonetheless, the Assembly remains an essential platform for the people of Jammu and Kashmir to voice their concerns, including their advocacy for statehood, human rights, and political representation. Under Abdullah’s leadership, the Assembly has amplified calls for addressing these issues, reinforcing that the people of Jammu and Kashmir are actively engaged in shaping their future despite the Union Territory’s limited legislative power. Abdullah’s administration has made it clear that it will continue to prioritize advocacy for autonomy, underscoring the Assembly’s role as a voice for the people’s aspirations, even amid political limitations. The future of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood restoration efforts, however, remains uncertain. Abdullah’s actions have brought the issue to the forefront of Indian politics, and the assurances from Home Minister Amit Shah and the formal endorsement from Lieutenant Governor Sinha suggest positive momentum. Yet, many are wary of potential delays from the central government, which must balance its commitment to Jammu and Kashmir with broader national priorities. The ongoing efforts by Abdullah’s administration to secure statehood and constitutional guarantees will likely be met with both support and resistance, reflecting the complexities of Jammu and Kashmir’s relationship with the Indian Union. Whether these initiatives lead to lasting change or encounter further delays, Abdullah’s leadership continues to represent the resilience and resolve of the people of Jammu and Kashmir as they pursue a future rooted in self-governance and restored identity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSQWEk4z4yIff6SFsl4cye	2024-11-15T09:02:37-08:00	
Tourism In Pakistan: Discovering The Hidden Paradise Of Kashmir –...	Pakistan, with its diverse landscapes and rich cultural heritage, is gradually emerging as a top travel destination. While the bustling cities of Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi often take center stage, there's one region in the northern part of the country that remains an undiscovered gem- Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Known for its breathtaking natural beauty, AJK is becoming increasingly popular among tourists looking for an escape from the ordinary. With its lush valleys, pristine lakes, snow-capped peaks, and serene meadows, AJK is often called the 'Switzerland of the East' or 'Heaven on Earth.' For much of its modern history, Azad Jammu and Kashmir was a place visitors couldn’t easily reach. Political tensions and regional conflicts kept this stunning area off the map for international tourists. However, following a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2004, the region slowly began to open up. What was once a place of uncertainty has now blossomed into one of the most promising tourist destinations in Pakistan. Over the years, the number of visitors has steadily increased, and the region's tourism infrastructure has begun to improve. In 2015, more than a million tourists visited the area, and that number has continued to grow each year. AJK offers a rich mix of natural beauty and tranquility that is difficult to find elsewhere. The towering peaks of the Himalayas, the winding rivers, and the thick forests all create an atmosphere that feels almost otherworldly. One of the most famous spots is Neelum Valley, a stunning stretch of land nestled between the mountains. With its flowing rivers, verdant meadows, and charming villages like Keran and Sharda, it’s the perfect place to disconnect and experience the beauty of nature. The valley is a haven for hikers, photographers, and anyone seeking a peaceful retreat away from the noise and stress of everyday life. Another must-see is Ratti Gali Lake, located high in the mountains at over 12,000 feet. This alpine lake is surrounded by snow-covered peaks, creating a breathtakingly beautiful scene that draws photographers, nature lovers, and adventurers. The azure waters of the lake reflect the towering mountains, making it a perfect spot for those seeking both adventure and serenity. But it’s not just the scenery that makes AJK so special. The region is also steeped in history and culture, making it a place of both natural and historical exploration. From the ancient Sharda Peeth temple, an important pilgrimage site, to the ruins of forts and historical buildings scattered across the region, AJK is a treasure trove of culture and history. The blend of Kashmiri, Punjabi, and Central Asian influences gives the region a unique cultural identity that sets it apart from other parts of the world. The hospitality of the people is another highlight. Known for their warmth and friendliness, the people of AJK go out of their way to make visitors feel welcome. Local cuisine is an essential part of the cultural experience, with traditional Kashmiri dishes like Wazwan and flavorful teas like Kahwa offering a taste of the region’s rich culinary heritage. Food lovers will find themselves enjoying the variety of spices and flavors unique to this mountainous region. While tourism in AJK is still in its early stages compared to other global destinations, the potential is immense. Over the past few years, the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has made significant investments in tourism-related infrastructure, such as better roads, improved hotel accommodations, and enhanced facilities for visitors. These efforts are already paying off, with tourism revenue steadily increasing and more visitors arriving each year. In fact, in 2017 alone, AJK attracted 1.75 million tourists, up from 1.14 million in 2015, and the region’s tourism earnings amounted to PKR 67.378 million in the 2016-17 fiscal year. The financial impact of tourism is not limited to just AJK—it’s a key part of the larger picture for Pakistan’s economy. In 2017, Pakistan’s tourism sector contributed an impressive 7.4% to the country’s GDP, which amounted to around PKR 2,349 billion. Tourism in Pakistan has been a significant source of jobs, with the sector generating over 1.4 million jobs, or 2.5% of the country’s total employment. The tourism industry is expected to continue growing, with a predicted 7% increase in the sector in 2018, further solidifying its role as a key economic driver. Tourism also plays a crucial role in foreign exchange, as visitor exports accounted for 3.6% of Pakistan’s total exports in 2016. Moreover, Travel & Tourism investment amounted to PKR 410.4 billion in 2017, contributing 9.1% of total national investment. The government of Pakistan has been actively working to promote tourism in regions like AJK, recognizing its potential to boost the local economy, create jobs, and enhance the country's international image. The growing number of tourists, the increase in infrastructure investment, and the rise in tourism earnings all signal a bright future for AJK’s tourism industry. The region's growing popularity is also benefiting the local economy. More tourists mean more jobs, whether in hospitality, transportation, or small businesses that cater to visitors. In fact, tourism in AJK is expected to become one of the main drivers of economic growth in the region. It’s not just about the natural beauty or the historical sites- it’s about the opportunity to create jobs, stimulate local economies, and give the world a glimpse of a place that was once hidden away. Looking ahead, the future of tourism in Azad Jammu and Kashmir is incredibly bright. As more visitors from around the world discover the region, it’s likely that AJK will become a key destination for travelers seeking a unique experience. The government is continuing to improve security, infrastructure, and visa policies to make the region more accessible, and as these efforts progress, the tourism industry will likely see rapid growth. Pakistan as a whole is beginning to understand the true value of its tourism potential. With regions like AJK offering stunning landscapes, rich history, and warm hospitality, the country is well-positioned to become a major player in the global tourism market. It’s clear that places like Azad Jammu and Kashmir are not just valuable for their natural beauty- they are also vital to the country’s economic future. AJK’s rapid rise as a travel destination is a testament to its potential. As more people visit, the region’s beauty and hospitality will continue to shine, offering a peaceful and unforgettable escape. For anyone looking to explore the untouched beauty of northern Pakistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir is waiting to be discovered- a place that feels like a dream come true, and one that is poised to leave a lasting impression on all who visit.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSQWEk4z4yIVpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-15T09:01:40-08:00	
South Africa: Precision Policing A Vital Element Of Reducing Fire...	By David Bruce Mass killings have wreaked havoc in numerous South African communities in recent months. Along with the devastating murder of 18 people in Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape province on 28 September, other attacks have taken a heavy toll on human life. These occurred in places as disparate as Qumbu, Bityi and Tsolo in the Eastern Cape, Bishop Lavis and Atlantis in the Western Cape, Orange Farm in Gauteng province and Orkney in North West province. We don’t know the exact reasons for each of these incidents. But there can be no doubt that the widespread availability of firearms to those involved in crime makes mass killings more possible and more likely. These killings are one of many reasons the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), in a new policy brief, is calling for the South African Police Service (SAPS) to develop an integrated strategy to reduce firearm crime. This should ensure clear and measurable reductions in all categories of crime associated with the use of guns. Mass killings have become an embedded feature of violence in South Africa. The number of people killed in Lusikisiki is slightly higher than the death toll at the Mdlalose Tavern shooting in Soweto in July 2022, when 16 people were killed. In April 2023, 10 family members died in a single shooting incident in Imbali in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal province. The widespread availability of guns undoubtedly makes mass killings more possible and more likely Mass killings have reached unprecedented levels in South Africa since the early 1990s. SAPS data for July-September 2023 showed 125 people killed in incidents with four or more deaths. Recently released data compiled by Gun Free South Africa showed a similar number had been murdered in shootings of four or more people in the past three months. Firearms are crime enablers and violence multipliers. They make a massive contribution to crime-related deaths, injury and fear in South Africa. Police data indicates that guns were used in 12 000 to 16 000 murders in South Africa over the 2023/24 year. There were also between 17 000 and 20 000 cases of attempted murder, where people sustained non-fatal firearm injuries. The severity and complexity of many of these injuries place an enormous burden on the healthcare system. Inga Mkoko, who was 25 at the time of the Mdlalose tavern shooting, spent three weeks in intensive care and six months in hospital. He had both legs amputated and lost four fingers. Notwithstanding the large number of firearm-related deaths and injuries, guns are mostly used to threaten victims without the weapons being fired. Fear of firearms makes them the favoured instrument for coercion in robberies, extortion and some incidents of rape. They also play a major role in taxi violence and violent organised crimes such as extortion and conflict between gangs involved in the illegal drugs or mining trade. SAPS must focus on reducing firearm crime, but cannot do so using its established approach The fact that criminals have the capacity to use equivalent levels of force to the police directly undermines the state’s ability to exercise authority. Virtually all killings of SAPS members are with firearms. The SAPS must focus on reducing firearm crime. But it cannot do so using its established approach that relies mainly on the recovery of illegal firearms. A key element is making optimal use of available data. As a starting point, police should use crime statistics to identify the areas where most firearm crime occurs. The recently released ISS policy brief illustrates how this can be done. The SAPS should be able, quite easily, to map firearm crime. Effective mapping is vital to ensuring that police resources are deployed in a precise way, targeted at the groups involved and places where it’s occurring. A key solution is making optimal use of available data to quickly and accurately map firearm crime Beyond mapping, the SAPS should invest in strengthening information management systems to synthesise information on firearm crime. This includes crime reports, ballistic data, interviews with suspects, victims and witnesses, and details from sources in the community. This process, along with crime investigation, should then be used to identify, arrest and prosecute perpetrators of firearm crime. This approach can also dramatically improve our understanding of where guns used in crime are coming from. Tracing the source of these weapons would allow for proactive interventions to close loopholes that enable criminal access to firearms. Recovery of illegal firearms is not enough. South Africa needs a practical firearm reduction strategy that provides for collaboration between appropriate state, private sector and civil society role players. There is knowledge and experience of firearm crime reduction in South Africa and internationally that SAPS can draw on. Effective implementation of an integrated firearm crime reduction strategy should be an exercise in learning how a more effective SAPS can work. Without it, gun crime is likely to continue devastating many families and communities. Read the ISS policy brief ‘Targeting firearm crime will make South Africa safer’ by David Bruce, here.

RCEP Provides A Path To Regional Trade Cooperation – Analysis	By Iman Pambagyo and Donna Gultom As global trade began to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 10 ASEAN member states and their five FTA partners sealed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement on 15 November 2020 during a summit of participating country leaders. Requiring eight years of negotiation to complete, the RCEP initiative was first introduced when Indonesia was chair of ASEAN in 2011 with a view to consolidating the existing ASEAN Plus One FTAs to deepen and expand regional value chains. The basic concept of RCEP was endorsed by leaders of 16 countries in November 2012 in Phnom Penh, and the first round of negotiations took place in March 2013 in Brunei Darussalam where negotiators had more questions than answers on how to translate the RCEP concept into an effective trade agreement. Initially, RCEP was negotiated among 16 countries — ten ASEAN countries and Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. At the RCEP Summit in late 2019, India decided to leave the negotiations due to difficulties at home. India’s exit raised doubts among some non-ASEAN negotiating parties that the targeted total market size of RCEP would shrink from 3.7 billion to 2.3 billion people. ASEAN’s leadership in getting negotiations across the finish line proved critical. The key message conveyed to the non-ASEAN participating countries was that RCEP was not merely about market access. RCEP would also serve as a platform for countries in proximity to ASEAN to enhance regional cooperation and to deepen and expand the regional value chains that already existed under ASEAN Plus One FTAs — contributing to the economic advancement of individual partners as well as the region. After going through the ratification process with individual participating countries, RCEP eventually entered into force on 1 January 2022. Representing around 30 per cent of the world’s GDP, 28 per cent of global trade and 32 per cent of global foreign direct investment flows, the RCEP Agreement was championed to significantly benefit all its parties through the intensification of trade in goods and services, investment, trade facilitation and cooperation among members. RCEP has been in place for over two years, but available data suggests that utilisation of the preferential treatment under the Agreement — especially on trade in goods — is still far below what had been expected, with China, Japan and Korea currently the main beneficiaries. But this should not come as a surprise. RCEP was concluded against the backdrop of a trade war between the United States and China, which has had adverse impacts on other countries, including most RCEP members. RCEP also entered into force when global trade had to deal with the spread of COVID-19, continued geopolitical rivalries among major powers, war in Ukraine and climate change issues affecting logistics in the Panama Canal. The war between Israel and Hamas and the security threats to shipping lines through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal have added to concerns that world trade is disintegrating. Eight years of RCEP negotiations have shown that focusing on shared economic interests can lead to mutual benefits instead of an escalation of disagreements toward open conflicts. ASEAN played an important role in keeping all parties engaged constructively when its negotiation encountered non-economic hurdles between Japan and South Korea and between India and China. Statements by leaders at various RCEP summits suggest that the spirit of cooperation incentivised them to create a region of strong collaboration towards shared prosperity, regardless of differences in political, economic and social systems. While RCEP does not the disciplines of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, Peter A Petri and Michael Plummer — writing for the Brookings Institution in 2020 — note that ‘the effects of RCEP are impressive’ and that ‘it incentivises supply chains across the region but also caters to political sensitivities’. RCEP was made possible because negotiations were advanced in an ‘ASEAN way’ — consensual, flexible and sometimes very slow. This negotiation style needs to be applied as a trade diplomacy strategy by its members when trying to build cooperation and collaboration between RCEP and other economic groupings such as the EU, Southern Common Market and the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement. The ‘ASEAN way’ able to seal the deal when there is consensus and flexibility but progresses slowly and carefully when dealing with contentious issues, which otherwise bring negotiations to an impasse. All the RCEP countries now have experience negotiating unusually complex issues. This experience can be applied when they embark on global trade diplomacy with non-RCEP countries and regions.

A Deep Dive Into The India-Russia Economic Relationship – Analysi...	By Rajoli Siddharth Jayaprakash In the past decade, the core drivers of India-Russia relations have begun shifting. The traditionally dominant military-technical partnership has declined, with India buying less Russian weapons, technology and military platforms. The economic pillar stagnated as military dealings slowed, with bilateral trade hoveringaround the US$ 10-11 billion mark. However, since 24 February, 2022, there has been a dramatic uptick in economic ties, with India emerging as Russia's second-largest trade partner. In 2022, bilateral trade surgedto US$ 49 billion, and by the end of 2023, US$ 65 billion. This uptick in trade is primarily attributed to the increasing discounts on oil purchases offered to Indian refiners, as India did not join the sanctions regime against Russia. Along with increasing oil trade, the non-oil trade has also marginally increased in the trade basket. Along with these new trends in bilateral trade, there is a significant overestimation of the India-Russia economic cooperation, which has led to condemnation from the Group of Seven countries (G7), comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States). Trends in the Ttrade basket While it’s no surprise that hydrocarbon imports dominate the trade basket, in 2023, US$ 54 billion of the US$ 65 billion exports comprised oil imports from Russia. Similar trends were reflected in the previous year; out of the US$49 billion total trade,US $38 billion constituted oil imports. The overall trade has grown with the increasing oil and mineral imports from Russia. For instance, in 2021, bilateral trade was US$ 12 billion, where oil and mineral fuels constituted only US$ 5.2 billion of the total trade, leaving US$ 6.8 billion in non-oil trade. In 2022 and 2023, non-oil trade increased to US$ 11 billion, a significant growth, indicative of bilateral trade increasing. Since 2022, Russia’s fertiliser exports have grown substantially. The average Indian import of Russian Fertiliser was around US$ 600 million; however, in 2022-23, fertiliser imports increased to US$ 3 billion. It later declined in the following year, primarily because Russia ended previous discounts on the sale of di-ammonium phosphate. Further, the import of precious stones, metals, and jewellery has increased since 2021. Similarly, Russia’s export of edible vegetables and animal and vegetable fats has increased. Big-ticket Indian imports from Russia Product label FY 2021-2022 (in US$ billion)FY 2022-2023FY 2023-2024Mineral fuels, oil and refined products 5.2 38 54Fertilisers 0.77 3 2precious stones, metals, and jewellery 1.25 1.35 1.18Animal or Vegetable fats and oil 0.5 1 1.3Project goods 0.5 0.56 0.78Source: Ministry of Commerce and Industry: Tradestat Interestingly, the goods that traditionally dominated India’s exports to Russia have come down. Pharmaceutical exports are steadily declining. By 2024, pharmaceutical exports from India had declined to US$ 386 million (see Fig 1.2). Further, trade across items such as tea, coffee, and spices has fluctuated, as well as with clothing accessories. However, the export of some commodities has increased since the invasion, such as iron and steel, electrical machinery and consumer electronics, organic and inorganic chemicals, compounds of precious metals, rare-earth metals, soap and by-products, ceramic products, automobiles and spare parts, and medical and surgical equipment. However, one of the biggest Indian exports that surged in 2023-2024, since the invasion, was the export of machinery and mechanical appliances, which increased from US$ 320 million to US$ 650 million. Further, in 2024, from April to August, machinery imports rose to US$ 700 million. The increase in export volumes of these goods is one of the reasons why India’s total export surged from US$ 3.1 billion to US$ 4.2 billion in 2024. Based on early projections for 2024-2025, it is likely that trade across consumer goods, electronics, machinery, and spare parts will increase. The improvement in trade and increasing avenues for economic cooperation have emerged due to the vacuum left by Western firms in the Russian economy which allowed Russia to spend the rupees accumulated in its accounts since February 2022.

India’s trade with Russia, even though diversified, is not on a large scale in comparison to other Group of 20 (G20) countries (sans Russia). Neither are there any vast business interests for Indian elites in Russia, apart from oil and pharma, which is why trade data does not reflect any new avenues of trade except in consumer goods and electronics. In November 2022, Moscow sent a list of goods to New Delhi for delivery, including parts for cars, trains, and aircraft. The list consisted of more than 500 entries. It is clear that New Delhi has not supplied Russia with any of the big-ticket items, such as aircraft engines or equipment with high dual-use capabilities (beyond spare parts), as bilateral trade data reflects that trade for the parts requested by Moscow has been minimal. Furthermore, New Delhi’s defence imports to Russia are a by-product of the bilateral military-technical partnership and to setup joint ventures. Further, trade data does not reflect any sale of restricted critical technology to Russia, as claimed by a few sources. The sources cite drones worth US$ 5 million and goods worth US$ 600,000 that were re-exported via Kyrgyzstan. Recently, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions against 19 Indian firms for their alleged involvement in the supply of dual-use goods to Moscow, including a few pharmaceutical companies based in Mumbai re-exporting Dell Technologies’ most advanced server, Dell PowerEdge XE9680, worth US$ 434 million to Russia. Despite these claims, no evidence clearly substantiates them. For instance, with regards to the first claim of India exporting drones via Kyrgyzstan, the numbers do not add up. Since 2022, trade with Bishkek for electronic products has not crossed US$1 million. Similarly, in the case of arms and ammunition and parts, the trade does not exceed US$ 480,000. Furthermore, in a globalised world where trade takes precedence, trading firms in countries near Russia re-route such trade. For instance, several US and European firms exported US$ 1.2 billion worth of microchips, which were later re-routed from Türkiye and Kazakhstan. Therefore, despite allegations, trade data does not justify the charges. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in response to the criticism, stated that the firms involved did not violate any Indian law, as New Delhi did not recognise non-UN-approved sanctions. Since early 2024, Western sanctions against Russia have intensified, compelling India to take a stance. For instance, early this year, TotalEnergies invoked a force majeure on Russia’s Arctic LNG-2 project, which led to production being suspended. In the past, Indian firms were interested in purchasing stakes in Novatek’s (a major Russian gas company) Arctic LNG-2 project as part of New Delhi’s outreach to the Russian Arctic. However, the subsequent rounds of European Union (EU) sanctions targeting Russian Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) have prompted New Delhi to announce that it would not purchase LNG from the Arctic LNG 2 project. Interestingly, despite waves of sanctions against Russian energy, the EU continues to import LNG from Russia. Imports have increased by 20 percent this year. The EU has a selective approach to imposing and complying with sanctions. On the one hand, it criticises New Delhi with allegations of India reinforcing the Kremlin coffers, fueling Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. On the other hand, the EU continues to purchase Russian energy. Issue of payments Lastly, even though India was able to address payment issues by extending the Special Rupee-Vostro account facility to Russian businesses, certain challenges remain. Regulatory bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India, have limited foreign portfolio investments by Sberbank AG, Russia’s largest bank, to hydrocarbons only. Furthermore, because of Russia's classification as a 'high-risk' country by the Financial Action Task Force, the commerce ministry’s Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) continues to place Russia in the same category, despite the MEA and the Indian Embassy in Moscow’s request for a reevaluation. Conclusion India’s trade with Russia must be viewed from the point of view of one driven by supply and demand factors and not through the intervention of a political apparatus. With bilateral trade likely to continue and intensify with Russia, the intensity of secondary sanctions might impact New Delhi’s economic engagement with Moscow. India is presented with a set of challenges: it must sustain its engagement with Moscow while continuing to further its cooperation with the West, all while ensuring that its short-and medium-term energy security needs are addressed. Navigating these challenges will be essential for India as it seeks to balance its strategic interests in a complex global landscape.

Bending Reality: How Surrealism Reveals The Subjectivity Of Time ...	Time, as a concept, has perplexed humanity for centuries. Our understanding of it oscillates between the linear and cyclical, the tangible and the surreal, the mathematical and the metaphysical. But more than anything, time is subjective—an experience rather than a measurable constant. When examined through the lens of surrealism, time emerges as not merely a sequence of events but a fabric that our perceptions, desires, and fears weave. The Nature of Time To understand why time is subjective, it is essential to distinguish between 'clock time,' or chronological time, and 'psychological time.' Clock time is the scientific, standardized measurement—seconds, minutes, hours—that our society depends on to synchronize actions. Psychological time, however, is an entirely personal experience. It can stretch and compress, influenced by our emotions, memories, and the intensity of the moment. Surrealism and the Dream State of Time Surrealism, as a movement, broke free from the constraints of logic, reality, and linearity. It allowed artists and thinkers to explore dreams, subconscious desires, and emotions in their raw, unfiltered forms. Central to surrealism is the fluidity of time, which often appears distorted, repetitive, or looping within surrealist works. This is famously depicted in Salvador Dalí's 'The Persistence of Memory,' where clocks melt in a barren, dream-like landscape. Here, time is not rigid; it is malleable, warped by the environment and the viewer's interpretation. Dalí's melting clocks illustrate an essential surrealist idea: time as an extension of the mind, subject to interpretation and transformation. Just as the subconscious mind operates outside of conventional temporality, surrealist art challenges viewers to experience time without strict boundaries. Freud, the Unconscious, and the Nonlinear Sigmund Freud, whose work heavily influenced surrealist artists, emphasized that the unconscious mind operates outside of linear time. In dreams, he argued, events from different periods of our lives coexist, sometimes merging, altering, or repeating. Surrealism tapped into this psychological framework, breaking down chronological barriers and presenting a world where past, present, and future coalesce. In surrealist paintings, there's often a sense that scenes do not unfold in a specific order but rather coexist in a single, fragmented reality. This idea is supported by the dream-like quality of time in surrealist works. Max Ernst's collages, for instance, bring together disparate, often anachronistic elements—a modern object might appear beside a medieval scene, blending temporal periods into one. Through these juxtapositions, Ernst mirrors the way memories and dreams function, where time is not consistent but scattered, dense, and elusive. Time in the Works of René Magritte Belgian surrealist René Magritte often manipulated time by contrasting ordinary objects in unusual contexts, giving viewers a sense of disorientation. Magritte's 'Time Transfixed' exemplifies this approach, showing a locomotive emerging from a fireplace. Here, two elements representing movement and stillness intersect. This unexpected pairing creates a surreal temporal illusion, blurring distinctions between 'now' and 'then,' motion and pause. Magritte's art demonstrates the surrealist view that time need not be sequential or rational. In our internal experience, memories and events bleed into each other, and logic becomes secondary to sensation. Surrealism, therefore, encourages us to question our perception of time as an orderly flow. Time and Memory: The Persistence of the Past One reason why time feels subjective is its connection to memory. Philosopher Henri Bergson argued that our experience of time is shaped by our memories, which accumulate and form an ever-expanding repository. This non-linear model of time resembles a spiral more than a line; the past continually resurfaces, influencing our experience of the present. Surrealist art often explores this fluid relationship between memory and time. Yves Tanguy, for instance, created vast landscapes filled with bizarre, indeterminate forms. These forms evoke a sense of déjà vu, as if the viewer has glimpsed them in a dream. The familiar becomes strange, and the past blurs with the present, highlighting the surrealists' view of time as a dimension molded by memory and nostalgia. The Subjective Flow of Time: Psychological Studies Psychologists have studied how emotions alter time perception. For example, moments of fear or exhilaration seem to stretch time, while monotonous tasks compress it. Surrealism plays on this perception by bringing viewers into scenes that are neither fully real nor dreamt, allowing time to lose its rigidity. In surrealist paintings, clocks are often distorted, disjointed, or absent altogether. This echoes our psychological experience of time: in intense moments, it becomes flexible, a quality that surrealism makes tangible. The surrealist movement embraced these subjective variations, presenting them as a more 'authentic' experience of time. Instead of a relentless tick-tock, surrealist time is alive, capable of slowing, freezing, or looping—a malleable entity. Time as Cyclical and Eternal Surrealist philosophy often aligns with the idea of cyclical or eternal time, as opposed to linear time. The works of Giorgio de Chirico illustrate a kind of eternal return, an endless repetition of similar scenes with subtle variations. His paintings, often set in timeless, deserted cityscapes, evoke a sense of déjà vu, an endless present. De Chirico's work suggests that time is not something we progress through but a state we are perpetually within. This echoes the Nietzschean concept of 'eternal recurrence,' which posits that all events endlessly repeat. Through surrealist art, the viewer is invited to contemplate the nature of existence and to experience a 'timeless' state where moments are not markers of progression but of repetition. The Legacy of Surrealism on Modern Perceptions of Time The surrealist approach to time has profoundly influenced modern philosophy, literature, and film. Works such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' and films like Inception and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind embody surrealism's treatment of time. These stories unfold in fractured, dream-like ways, mixing past, present, and future into complex patterns that defy linear logic. Surrealism's radical reimagining of time has thus permeated popular culture, resonating with our innate understanding that time is not simply measurable intervals but a deeply subjective and often illogical experience.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CjcODhEWHFgj	2024-11-14T16:42:19-08:00	
Kremlin, With Help From North Korea, Stages Major Push To Recaptu...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. North Korea and Russia Launch a Large-Scale Offensive in Kursk Augmented by 10,000 North Korean servicemen, the Russian military has amassed 50,000 troops for a large-scale counteroffensive to reclaim the Russian region of Kursk from Ukrainian forces. Open-source intelligence suggests that the campaign has already begun—at an overwhelming operational tempo. According to Ukrainian officials, the North Korean contingent, divided into an assault detachment and a group of supporting forces, is engaged in combat operations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov have stated that Pyongyang’s troops have already suffered casualties. Ukrainian intelligence has also determined that at least three high-ranking North Korean generals have combat deployed to oversee Pyongyang’s movements in the field. The most senior figure in the group is General Kim Yong Bok. Kim is the vice chief of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) General Staff, the commander of Pyongyang’s special forces, a military advisor to Kim Jong Un, and a member of the Korean Workers’ Party (KWP) Central Committee. Russia’s Kursk offensive features a noteworthy composition of forces. Naval infantry formations, particularly the 810th and 155th Brigades, are leading the offensive action to break Ukrainian lines. Social media reports have highlighted the involvement of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) in the effort. Russia’s defense industry has equipped the Kremlin’s marines with newly produced BTR-82 armored personnel carriers (APCs) to provide the units with protection, operational flexibility, speed, and mobility. Despite these advancements, Ukraine’s heavy detachments, such as the 47th Mechanized Brigade and the 95th Air Assault Brigade, have so far demonstrated remarkable resilience, holding their ground and inflicting damage on the Russian formations. Ukraine’s accumulated gains in Kursk have significant strategic implications and provide Kyiv with considerable diplomatic leverage. If United States President-elect Donald Trump seeks to impose a ceasefire and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Kyiv will be able to use the Russian territory it holds as a bargaining chip. The Kremlin is working to expel Ukrainian forces from Kursk to deprive Kyiv of this leverage before the new US administration takes office. 2. Russian and Ukrainian Forces Exchange Massive Drone Barrages During the night of November 9, the Russian military launched a loitering munition salvo against multiple Ukrainian cities, including Zhytomyr, Odesa, Kyiv, Sumy, Poltava, and Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin launched 145 Iranian Shahed drone warfare systems from multiple sites including occupied Crimea. Ukraine’s air defenses intercepted only 62 of these drones. The strike, like many of the Kremlin’s prior attacks, risked significant collateral damage: some Russian drones wandered off their flight paths into Belarus and Moldova. In a previous strike, Russian loitering munitions hit the Estonian ambassador to Kyiv’s apartment building. The surge in Shahed attacks suggests that Russia and Iran’s joint drone manufacturing plant has further increased its production capacity. Kyiv answered the Kremlin’s salvo on November 10 with its largest drone strike since the beginning of the war. Russian air defense crews engaged 70 Ukrainian drones, 34 of which were targeting Moscow. Ukraine’s strike halted operations at the Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo, and Zhukovsky airports in Moscow, severely disrupting Russian air traffic. The war between Russia and Ukraine has served as both a proving ground and an innovation incubator for armed drones, yielding new technologies, weapons systems, and concepts of operations (CONOPS) in the realm of unmanned systems. 3. Battlefield Assessment The Russian military has sought to capitalize on its offensive momentum by making a concerted push on the southern Donetsk front. Despite record-high personnel losses, Moscow’s forces have gained territory after seizing Vuhledar in October of this year. After the reported fall of Selydove, Russia’s next objective is the important logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Russian forces have also heightened their offensive activity in Kurakhove. A critical dam was recently destroyed, likely by Russian forces, which will exacerbate flooding in the area. The Ukrainian 46th Brigade is manning the defensive line in the face of growing Russian pressure. The Ukrainian General Staff has also detected heightened Russian military preparations in southern Ukraine, suggesting a large-scale Russian push that could threaten Zaporizhzhia. This effort, combined with ongoing Russian pressure in the east and counteroffensive operations in Kursk, could stretch Ukraine’s military even further. Kyiv is in danger of suffering drastic setbacks on the battlefield unless it can initiate changes with the help of its allies.

Blinken Atrocious In A Dangerous World – OpEd	It is hard to credit one of the least impressive Secretary of States the United States has ever produced with any merit other than being a plasterwork that, from time to time, moved with caution on the world stage for fear of cracking. On the stage, Antony Blinken’s brittle performances have been nothing short of unimpressive, notably in pursuing such projects comically titled 'Peace in the Middle East.' Each time he has ventured to various regions of the world, the combatants seem keener than ever to continue taking up arms or indulging in slaughter. A sense of Blinken’s detachment from the world can be gathered from his Foreign Affairs piece published on October 1, intended as something of a report on the diplomatic achievements of the Biden administration. It starts off with the sermonising treacle that is all a bit much – the naughty states on the world stage, albeit small in number (Russia, Iran, North Korea and China), 'determined to alter the foundational principles of the international system.' The Biden administration had, in response, 'pursued a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad.' This served to counter those challengers wishing to 'undermine the free, open, secure, and prosperous world that the United States and most countries seek.' Then comes the remark that should prompt readers to pinch themselves. 'The Biden administration’s strategy has put the United States in a much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago.' An odd assessment for various reasons. There is the continued war in Ukraine and Washington’s refusal to encourage any meaningful talks between Kiev and Moscow, preferring, instead, the continued supply of weapons to an attritive conflict of slaughter and such acts of industrial terrorism as the attack on the Nord Stream pipeline. There has been the relentless watering down of the 'One China' understanding over the status of Taiwan, along with continued provocations against Beijing through the offensive pact of AUKUS with Australia and the UK. That particularly odious pact has served to turn Australia into a US military garrison without the consent of its citizens, an outcome sold to the dunces in Canberra as utterly necessary to arrest the rise of China. Along the way, an arms buildup in the Indo- and Asia-Pacific has been encouraged. With such a view of the world, it’s little wonder how blind Blinken, and other members of the Biden administration, have been to Israel’s own rogue efforts at breaking and altering the international system, committing, along the way, a goodly number of atrocities that have seen it taken to the International Court of Justice by South Africa for committing alleged acts of genocide. Through his various sojourns, the point was always clear. Israel was to be mildly rebuked, if at all, while Hamas was to be given the full chastising treatment as killers without a cause. When the barbarians revolt against their imperial governors, they are to be both feared and reviled. In June this year, for instance, Blinken stated on one of his countless missions for a non-existent peace that Hamas was 'the only obstacle' to a ceasefire, a markedly jaundiced explanation given the broader programs and objects being pursued by the Israeli Defence Forces. Hamas has been accused of being absolutist in its goals, but one can hardly exempt Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the charge. Not for Blinken: 'I think it is clear to everyone around the world, that it’s on them [Hamas] and that they will have made a choice to continue a war that they started.' On the issue of aid to Gaza’s strangled, dying population, Blinken has been, along with his equally ineffectual colleague in the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, cringingly ineffective. Their October 13 letter sent to their Israeli counterparts made mention of several demands, including the entry of some 350 aid trucks into Gaza on a daily basis, and refraining from adopting laws, now in place, banning the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). Each demand has been swatted back with a school child’s snotty petulance, and aid continues being blocked to various parts of Gaza. On October 24, Americans for Justice in Palestine Action (AJP Action) 'urgently' called on the Secretary of State 'to stop wasting his time with failed diplomatic visits and to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.' Those at AJP Action must surely have realised by now that Blinken would be utterly rudderless without those failed visits. Indeed, Osama Abu Irshaid, Executive Director of the organisation, went so far as to say that 'Blinken’s diplomatic theatre is enabling Netanyahu’s war crimes.' To arm and fund Israel 'while requesting a ceasefire' was a policy both 'hypocritical and ineffective.' Such is the nature of that sort of theatre. In the meantime, the tectonic plates of international relations are moving in other directions, a point that has been aided, not hindered, by the policy of this administration. Through BRICS and other satellite fora, the United States is finding itself gradually outpaced and isolated, even as it continues to hide behind the slogan of an international rules-based order it did so much to create. This is not to say that the US imperium has quite reached its terminus. If anything, the Biden administration, through the good offices of Blinken, continues to insist on its vitality. But US hegemony long left unchallenged is, most certainly, at an end.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CkVSH0qoyici	2024-11-14T16:38:16-08:00	
Biden’s Legacy: Handing A Resurgent American Empire To Trump – Op...	One of the lasting legacies of U.S. President Joe Biden will be that he reinvigorated the American empire despite the risk of an increasingly authoritarian Donald Trump returning to lead it. Over the past four years, President Biden has continually ignored criticisms of U.S. empire and the dangers it poses to the world to direct the empire’s expansion. He has overseen the enlargement of NATO, the exploitation of Ukraine to weaken Russia, a military buildup in the Indo-Pacific to encircle China, and the backing of Israel’s military assaults across the Middle East. To this day, the Biden administration boasts about its imperial maneuvers, even with the knowledge that a far more dangerous Trump administration will soon be in a position to exploit U.S. imperial power for its own purposes. 'I think we’ve done remarkable things,' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin marveled on November 7, two days after the election. 'We were able to manage challenges and resources—and I think that put us in a pretty good place.' Rebooting the Empire When President Biden first entered office in January 2021, one of his top priorities was to restore the global American empire from the chaos of the first Trump administration. Seizing upon the imperial trope of the United States as an organizer of the international system, Biden spoke about the need for the United States to restore order to a chaotic world. 'We are the organizing principle for the rest of the world,' Biden said in 2022. Despite some initial failures, including the collapse of the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan, the Biden administration achieved many of its imperial goals, such as the revitalization of U.S. alliances, a major strategic advantage of the United States over its rivals. Trump has repeatedly asserted that the United States is a nation in decline, seizing upon President Biden’s cognitive decline and some of his imperial failures to insist that the United States is no longer respected. Soon, however, he will find himself in a position to lead a resurgent empire. After all, the Biden administration spent the past four years rebooting the American empire, bolstering U.S. imperial power while making some its most brazen moves in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and the Middle East. The Transatlantic System The Biden administration has significantly reinforced U.S. power in Europe. Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has posed a major challenge to the U.S.-led transatlantic system, the Biden administration has turned the situation to its advantage. Since the start of the Russian invasion, the Biden administration has worked to enlarge and empower NATO, bringing more countries into the alliance while increasing its spending on military operations. There are now more than 100,000 U.S. soldiersstationed across Europe, the largest number since the mid-2000s. The Biden administration has also taken advantage of the war to weaken Russia. By arming the Ukrainian resistance and imposing powerful sanctions on the Russian economy, the United States has led a concerted effort to entangle Russia in a quagmire. The administration’s basic approach has been to provide Ukraine with enough military assistance to hold its positions against Russia but not enough to push Russia out of the country. According to Austin, the primary reason why Ukrainian soldiers have been able to keep fighting is 'because we have provided them the security assistance to be able to do it.' Despite the approximately one million casualties on both sides, administration officials have insisted upon maintaining their approach, prioritizing their goal of making the war into a strategic failure for Russia over the ideal of safeguarding the security and sovereignty of Ukraine. 'What we’ve witnessed and I think what the world has witnessed is a declining superpower in Russia making one of its last-ditch unlawful efforts to go in and seize territory,' State Department official Richard Verma said in September. 'This is really a declining power in so many ways and frankly not a very effective military power.' The Transpacific System While the Biden administration has strengthened the U.S. position in Europe, it has also reinforced the U.S. position in the Indo-Pacific. Even as China has pushed back against the U.S.-led transpacific system, especially in the South China Sea, the United States has strengthened many of its advantages over China. One of the Biden administration’s major moves has been to build out the U.S. hub-and-spoke model, the U.S.-led imperial structure that keeps the United States positioned as the dominant hub of the Pacific. Not only has the administration fortified the spokes, or the U.S. allies and partners that encircle China, but it has facilitated multilateral cooperation among the spokes, mainly by working through the Quad and other regional groupings. In a related move, the Biden administration has intensified U.S. military operations across the region. An estimated 375,000 U.S. soldiers and civilian personnel now operate across the Indo-Pacific, forming the highest concentration of U.S. military service members in a region that extends beyond the United States. 'In the Indo-Pacific, I think we are seeing a resurgent United States,' Defense Department official Ely Ratner commented last year. Complementing its military moves, the Biden administration has bolstered U.S. economic power. As it has worked to decouple China from multiple sectors of the U.S. economy, it has spearheaded the formation of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which reinforces the U.S. position as the center of economic power in the Pacific. 'Contrary to the predictions that the PRC would overtake the United States in GDP either in this decade or the next, since President Biden took office, the United States has more than doubled our lead,' National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan boasted in October. The Middle East Of all the signs of a resurgent American empire, however, perhaps none is more telling than U.S. action in the Middle East. Over the past year, the Biden administration has made it clear that the United States is more capable than ever to spread havoc and destruction across the region. Since Hamas’s October 7 terrorist attack against Israel, the Biden administration has openly backed Israel’s military assaults across the Middle East, all with little consequence for the United States. The Arab states in the region may have once countered Israel by going to war or organizing oil embargoes against the United States, but they have done little to deter the United States from backing Israel’s military operations. In fact, the Arab states are now more likely to come to Israel’s defense, just as they did when they helped Israel counter Iran’s missile attacks in April and October. The Biden administration may sometimes criticize Israel for how it has conducted its military operations, especially given the fact that Israel has laid waste to Gaza, but through it all, administration officials have been quietly satisfied with how they have enabled Israel to conduct military operations without facing any major retaliation. The Biden administration’s imperial management of the region demonstrates that the United States is now so powerful that it can unleash its strategic asset on the Middle East without having to engage in a wider war. 'I think we’ve done a magnificent job there,' Austin mused earlier this month, taking pride in U.S. imperial achievements while displaying little concern for the people of Gaza or the Israeli hostages who are still being held by Hamas. The Future under Trump As the Biden administration has recharged the American empire, it has never stopped to question its actions. Not even internal dissent within the State Department and other federal agencies over the administration’s complicity in the destruction of Gaza has led to any kind of reckoning over the manner in which it has employed imperial violence around the world. Perhaps most telling has been the Biden administration’s response to charges that Trump is a fascist. Top administration officials have agreed with the assessments, some made by leading scholars of fascism and others issued by former high-level officials in the first Trump administration. But leaders in the Biden administration have never questioned their belief that they must do everything they can to strengthen the U.S. empire. Rather than considering what it would mean for a fascist to take control of the most powerful empire in the world, the Biden administration has spent more time considering how to ensure the empire’s survival. In recent months, one of its top priorities has been to 'Trump-proof' the empire, meaning that administration officials are searching for ways to ensure that U.S. imperial structures survive the chaos of a second Trump presidency. Now that Trump’s re-election is here, however, the Biden administration is facing a far more disturbing reality. President Biden’s legacy will be the handover of a resurgent American empire to 'the most dangerous person' in America, all with dire implications not just for the people who are targets of Trump’s wrath but for the many people around the world who are victims of U.S. imperial practices.

Myanmar’s Rare Earth Revolution: A Geopolitical Gamechanger – OpE...	As President-elect Donald Trump assembles his new administration, a complex geopolitical chess game is unfolding in Myanmar. The intersection of rare earth minerals, a protracted civil war, and shifting global alliances has created a perfect storm that demands immediate attention from Washington. This situation not only presents a critical foreign policy challenge but also offers a unique opportunity to reshape the balance of power in Southeast Asia. Recent developments have dramatically altered the landscape of Myanmar's rare earth industry and its global impact. Myanmar has emerged as the world's largest supplier of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), surpassing even China in exports. Last year, Myanmar exported approximately 50,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides (REOs) from ion-adsorption clays to China, far exceeding China's domestic IAC mining quota of 19,000 tons. This positions Myanmar as the leading global exporter of heavy REOs, with its exports accounting for as much as 50% of the global heavy rare earths supply. The situation has been further complicated by recent events in Myanmar's ongoing civil war. The opposition forces in Myanmar have made remarkable gains throughout the country, particularly in areas controlled by ethnic armed organizations. Operation 1027, launched in October 2023 by the Three Brotherhood Alliance, marked a turning point in the conflict. This coordinated offensive saw resistance forces capture over 500 military outposts and several key towns, dealing a severe blow to the military junta's control and morale. In a significant development, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) seized control of the country's rare earth mining region in mid-October 2024. The KIA took over a leading mining center that includes production sites in Pang War, Chipwi, Phimaw, and Hsawlaw. This takeover has effectively halted mining operations, disrupting the global supply chain and prompting China to impose a trade embargo on Myanmar. The National Unity Government, an anti-junta body that oversees many of the newer civilian groups, claims that junta opponents now control 60% of the country. While this control remains largely peripheral, the resistance's success has been unprecedented. The junta faces a range of serious problems, including declining morale, defections, a failure to recruit enough people to keep the army's size stable, and terrible conditions for soldiers. China's role in this conflict is crucial and complex. While China controls nearly 90% of global rare earth processing capacity, it has effectively outsourced much of its extraction to Myanmar. Beijing has consistently promoted sham elections and forced ceasefires that ultimately benefit the military junta. However, China's approach is primarily driven by its strategic interests, including access to Myanmar's natural resources and its crucial geographic position for China's Belt and Road Initiative with ocean access from landlocked western China. Given these developments, it is imperative for the United States to seize this moment and increase its support for Myanmar's resistance rather than making unsustainable deals with the military junta like China is doing. The reasons are compelling, ranging from advancing democracy to securing strategic geopolitical gains and addressing humanitarian imperatives. President-elect Trump's recent cabinet nominations signal a hardening stance on China and a renewed focus on securing America's supply chains. Senator Marco Rubio, the incoming Secretary of State, has long been a vocal critic of China's dominance in the rare earth market. He was also a staunch advocate for democracy in Burma. Senator Marco Rubio has deep concerns about China's control of the world's rare earth supply and wrote several articles and introduced legislations about rare earths and China. Links to these are provided in the references following the article. Representative Michael Waltz, set to become National Security Adviser, brings his military background as a Green Beret veteran and hawkish views on China to the table. Waltz's appointment suggests a continued focus on countering Chinese influence. Representative Mike Waltz has been a vocal and active opponent of China across multiple fronts. As a member of the House China Task Force, he has proposed legislation to reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese minerals and protect American universities from espionage. Waltz has consistently criticized China's control over critical supply chains, its military expansion, and investments in U.S. industries. He has condemned China's human rights abuses, called for a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics, and described the U.S.-China relationship as a 'cold war.' Waltz's actions and statements reflect a strong stance against China's growing influence, advocating for policies that prioritize countering the China threat in U.S. foreign policy. Representative Elise Stefanik, nominated as UN Ambassador, rounds out a foreign policy team that seems poised to challenge the status quo. She is the No. 4 House Republican and a staunch Trump ally. She is in the Congressional Chinese Task Force, the armed forces committee and the intelligence committee. Representative Elise Stefanik has taken numerous legislative actions against China, focusing on national security, economic concerns, and human rights. She has introduced bills like the 'Confronting CCP Human Rights Abusers Act' to sanction entities involved in human rights abuses, the 'End College Chinese Communist Partnerships Act' to limit Chinese influence in American universities, and the 'Countering CCP Drones Act' to prohibit Chinese drone operations on U.S. communications infrastructure. Stefanik has also co-sponsored legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese military-affiliated companies and worked to remove Confucius Institutes from U.S. universities. Additionally, she has been involved in efforts to protect American patient data from Chinese biotechnology companies and has advocated for transparency in agreements with China, particularly regarding the WHO. In the Senate, John Thune from South Dakota has been elected as the new Senate Republican leader, succeeding Mitch McConnell. This position is crucial as it will involve working closely with the incoming Trump administration on legislative matters, including foreign policy initiatives. Senator John Thune has taken several actions against China. He co-introduced a bipartisan resolution with Senator Angus King to challenge China's self-designation as a developing country at the World Trade Organization (WTO). This resolution aims to reform WTO rules to prevent economically advanced countries like China from exploiting developing country status for unfair trade advantages. Thune has also advocated for strengthening U.S. national security and economic competitiveness to counter China's influence. He emphasizes the importance of passing timely defense authorization bills, investing in military capabilities, and developing a robust trade policy to compete with China's growing economic and strategic influence. Additionally, Thune supports initiatives to reduce U.S. reliance on China for critical minerals and energy resources. This new administration has an opportunity to set a new course – one that secures America's technological future while also championing sustainable practices and human rights. The window of opportunity for impactful U.S. involvement in Myanmar is now. By supporting Myanmar's Spring Revolution, the United States can reaffirm its commitment to democracy, gain strategic advantages in a crucial region, and potentially reshape the geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia. As we enter what Rubio calls 'an era of pragmatic foreign policy,' this pragmatism must extend to addressing the complex situation in Myanmar, balancing strategic interests with ethical considerations and long-term regional stability. The time for decisive action is now – the U.S. must not miss this historic opportunity to make a significant impact in Myanmar and beyond, while also securing its own interests in the critical rare earth mineral supply chain. Supporting the resistance, rather than making deals with a weakening military junta, is not just the right thing to do – it's the smart thing to do for America's long-term strategic interests.

Robert Reich: Matt Gaetz As AG Would Be Laughable If It Weren’t S...	President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as America’s next attorney general. This would be laughable were it not so utterly dangerous. Gaetz as attorney general would all but guarantee that Trump weaponizes the Justice Department against his enemies — past, present, and future. Ever since Trump was first indicted, Gaetz has been defending him — alleging that the prosecutions of Trump were politically motivated, that Joe Biden was behind them, charging the Biden administration with vindictiveness toward Trump, and asserting that Trump would have every right to engage in similar vengeance toward Trump’s political enemies. In making these bogus claims, Gaetz has often used identical language to Trump’s wildly partisan and incendiary claims. I worked in the Justice Department in the years following Richard Nixon’s attempt to use the department to prosecute and intimidate Nixon’s enemies. To restore faith and trust in the department, President Gerald Ford appointed Edward Levi as attorney general. Before his appointment, Levi had been dean of the University of Chicago Law School and president of the University of Chicago. One of Levi’s most important accomplishments was to insulate the Department of Justice from political interference by establishing a set of rules that prevented the White House from privately contacting an attorney general or any other Justice Department officials. How far we’ve fallen. Gaetz, a 42-year-old congressman from Florida, has zero qualifications for being the highest law enforcement official in the land. He has never been a government attorney, never been a judge, never taught law or burnished his legal standing in any way. Quite the contrary. Gaetz is now under investigation by the House Ethics Committee in connection with a sex-trafficking scandal. (The Justice Department investigated Gaetz for his alleged involvement with a girl who was 17 at the time to determine if he paid for sex in violation of federal sex-trafficking laws, but it closed the investigation last year after career prosecutors were reportedly unsure about the credibility of two central witnesses.) If confirmed, Gaetz would lead the Justice Department’s more than 100,000 employees at a time when Trump’s allies are demanding a purge of career DOJ staffers who may have opposed some of Trump’s efforts during his first term or worked on cases involving Trump or his supporters. Gaetz has defended Trump at every turn, arguing that Trump has never violated any federal laws. Gaetz voted with about 150 of his Republican colleagues to overturn Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election. He also participated in what federal prosecutors have characterized as a rehearsal for 'Stop the Steal' efforts — protesting the results of a hotly contested Senate race in Florida with members of the Proud Boys and other Trump loyalists. After Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Gaetz was defiant. 'We’re ashamed of nothing,' he said publicly. In other words, nominating Gaetz to be attorney general is only slightly less absurd than nominating Vladimir Putin to be secretary of defense. The key question is whether Gaetz can be confirmed by a Republican Senate. Two key Republican moderates have already indicated they would likely vote against him. Senator Susan Collins said she was 'shocked' by the nomination; Senator Lisa Murkowski said he was not a serious contender for the job. But Senator Lindsey Graham — currently the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a reliable weather vane for the unscrupulous — said he was surprised Trump picked Gaetz, whom he called 'clever,' and predicted Gaetz would face 'tough questions' at his confirmation hearing. But Graham also said he was inclined to support presidential appointments. Gaetz’s nomination is really a test by Trump of how far he can go intimidating, bullying, and generating fear among Senate Republicans. No Senate Democrat will vote for Gaetz, so Trump and his allies are viewing the Gaetz nomination as a test of loyalty to Trump. This will be the clearest signal yet of whether Republican senators are ready to do Trump’s bidding on all sorts of sensitive issues, including cutting back Social Security and giving Putin what he wants in Ukraine. If Trump can get 51 votes for Gaetz, he can get a Senate majority for just about anything Trump wants to do.

What Should President Trump Do Once He’s In Office? – OpEd	By Peter Jacobsen A few months ago I wrote a piece for FEE on Argentina’s new president, Javier Milei. Milei took on the presidency of Argentina with a particularly pressing challenge: government overspending was driving out-of-control money creation and its by-product—inflation. Milei’s goal was explicit. He promised to cut government largesse. In my article, I argued that his success in doing so would be entirely dependent on his ability to cut down the bureaucracy. To quote the article: Bureaus have no incentive to stop unsustainable spending habits like we have seen in Argentina. If anything, their existence requires them to prevent reforms that take from their agendas and budgets. There is still work to be done. As noted at the beginning of the piece, this is really just the first step in eliminating the bureaucratic bloat. But it is a necessary first step. In the United States, we find ourselves in a less urgent situation. Inflation has caused serious distress and harm for some, but our inflation rate is nowhere near the likes of Argentina. However, it is clear that the US is trending in the wrong direction with respect to government spending. The growth of the United States debt accelerated after Covid and is reaching dizzying levels. If the United States is unable to rein in spending, a future characterized by hyperinflation the likes of Argentina seems likely. What should the newly elected President Trump do to prevent this? To answer this question, we’re going to borrow wisdom from a group of thinkers dubbed the Late Scholastics. This was a group of Catholic thinkers from the 16th and 17th centuries who advised royalty and businessmen in their economic dealings. Much of what I write here will be drawn from Faith and Liberty: The Economic Thought of the Late Scholastics by Alejandro A. Chafuen. Although the Scholastics were situated in the setting of monarchy, their proposals for reining in government over-spending were targeted at the executive, and, in that sense, their advice is entirely applicable to the US president. The Late Scholastics coalesced around three proposals. Let’s look at each one. Proposal 1: Canning the Court First, Late Scholastic scholars advised monarchs to shrink the size of their 'courts.' The court was a group of the executive’s advisors, similar to our president’s cabinet today. For this advice on shrinking the court, we can turn to Late Scholastic thinker Pedro Fernández Navarrete. Chafuen highlights that Navarrete did not merely recommend stopping the growth of the court; he believed in actively shrinking it. In Navarrete’s words: …[it is not sufficient] to prevent future enlargement of the royal court. We need to clean it up and purge it of its present excess of hangers-on. People may say that this is an extreme suggestion since the court supports so many people, but the disease has become so grave and so evident that we have no excuse not to employ the remedy. These 'hangers-on' in the court generated demand for the king to increase spending, but added very little. As a result, spending grew, and taxes and currency debasement along with it. Our modern bureaucrats are no different. Chafuen points out how Navarrete compares this to bloodletting. You may lose some good blood (good bureaucrats), but it is necessary to do so in order to lose the bad blood (bad bureaucrats). Similar to Milei, if Trump is serious about dealing with our debt, cutting the bureaucratic fat should be the first goal on the table. It seemed unlikely that we would have gotten this sort of policy from the left. Joe Biden drew controversy recently by claiming that Donald Trump should be locked up… politically (whatever that means). In his comments which immediately preceded this claim, Biden was lamenting Trump’s Supreme Court immunity decision and, right before that, he expressed worry about Trump cutting bureaucracy. President Biden said of Trump, 'He is talking about doing away with the entire Department of Education… This is the guy who also wants to replace every civil servant—every single one.' It seems that removing executive bureaucracies and bureaucrats would be within the rights of the executive, but, if Biden is any indication, we wouldn’t have seen a President Harris exercising that authority. Trump, as of now, seems poised to do this. He has already said he is working on closing up the Department of Education in Washington DC (though it’s unclear if he is talking about ending the department entirely or just reorganizing and relocating it). If Trump follows through on this promise, made by many-a-republican before him, it will be a sign he is taking this advice seriously. Proposal 2: Sacrificing Subsidies The second proposal is a little more straightforward but still important. Late Scholastic thinker Juan de Mariana argued that the king should cut back on subsidizing private interests. Chafuen chronicles Mariana’s list of worries which included spending on 'public prizes… pensions, benefits, and offices.' The subsidization of pensions and retirement in general is not a foreign worry for the US. A significant amount of tax revenue goes to keeping Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid systems afloat. Over one-fifth of government spending goes to Social Security. The program has grown so expensive that within the next two decades it will run out of money, forcing either a benefit decrease or a tax increase. This is to say nothing of the corporate bailouts and Covid stimulus subsidies we’ve come to accept over the last few years. Meanwhile, many are agitating for more bailouts in the form of loan forgiveness of various kinds. Finally, private subsidies are given in large amounts to the industry we’ll discuss in our last proposal: the military-industrial complex. Proposal 3: Pursuing Peace The final proposal we’ll cover, also from Mariana, is that the king should stop pursuing 'unnecessary wars and nonessential enterprises.' It’s long been recognized that 'war is the health of the state.' War funnels private tax dollars to special interest groups, who in return support hawkish politicians. Wars also create a large class of bureaucrats who, as we discussed, generate more demand for foreign intervention. The United States has nearly 800 military bases across the world. The two decades of military intervention that followed the 9/11 attacks have cost the US an estimated $9 trillion. That’s more than a quarter of our national debt. The common theme throughout history is that great military powers tend to over-extend their empires. This over-extension both generates multiple fronts of conflict and creates resource stresses at home which are by and large borne by the citizens. President John Quincy Adams (son of founding father John Adams) summed up America’s commitment to freedom and to the citizenry well in a speech to the US House in 1821: Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions, and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. If Trump is serious about tackling our spending problem, he needs to get serious about the modern tendency of spending our resources searching for, fighting, and even creating monsters abroad. No country can afford to be the policeman for all other countries, nor is such a job compatible with America’s foundational liberal values. It’s my hope that Trump will finally break the cycle of ignoring our looming debt issues. The proposals of the Late Scholastics would be a great place to start.

How Targeting UN Could Harm Israel’s Own Interests – OpEd	The recent Israeli measures against the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)—including two controversial bills to ban UNRWA from operating on Israeli territory and areas under Israel’s control—are certainly a distressing development. In the early years of Israel’s statehood, after its 1948 establishment, Israel’s UN membership was held up for two years due to unresolved questions around the status of displaced Palestinians. The United Nations was still quite young when it passed Resolution 194, which recognized the rights of Palestinian refugees to return home and receive compensation for their losses—a commitment that has influenced rounds of talks over the decades. Since then, this resolution has been a pivotal point in discussions between Palestinians and Israelis. Palestinians have continued to demand that Israel acknowledge its role in this forced displacement and provide compensation, seeing it not only as a matter of historical fact but as an overdue moral obligation. Today, Israel’s treatment of UNRWA reflects the chronic tension between its own state objectives and a humanitarian question the UN has never abandoned. Israel’s recent actions raise pricking questions about its commitment to that international consensus and the lingering need for accountability in this conflict. The United States, in order to address the dire conditions faced by Palestinian refugees along Israel’s borders, played a major role in establishing UNRWA in 1950. This agency, originally backed by substantial American funding, became a critical lifeline for Palestinian refugees across the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, continuously serving a population that is now almost six million. Since its inception, UNRWA has remained a purely humanitarian outfit in every sense, focused solely on delivering essential services such as education, food, medical care, and fuel to a community facing immense hardship. However, this lifeline faced a serious setback during the Trump administration, which squeezed U.S. contributions. Biden, due to mounting pressure from pro-Israel factions in Congress, partly upheld this a stance . The funding gap has emboldened Israel’s right-wing extremist leaders to diminish the significance of the Palestinian refugee crisis in global discourse. Obviously, without UNRWA, Palestinians risk losing their most vital support system, which provides stability in an otherwise precarious situation. Although UNRWA operates strictly within its UN mandate, its mere presence has become a focal point in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Over the years, Israel’s supporters have worked to erode the agency’s reputation, urging major contributors to withhold funding or, in some cases, presenting dubious claims about UNRWA’s operations. The accusation that UNRWA staff were somehow complicit in Hamas’ attacks on October 7 was promptly investigated by a special UN committee. The findings were unequivocal: no evidence linked UNRWA staff to any wrongdoing. The inquiry exposed and rebutted Israel’s baseless allegations. The UN inquiry divulged that Israel hadn’t provided names or credible information to substantiate these allegations. In fact, UNRWA had been requesting such details from Israel since 2011, with no response. This episode has exposed the continued challenges faced by UNRWA in executing its mandate amidst politicized pressure from Israel. In a stunning turn of events on October 28, Israel’s Knesset overwhelmingly voted to ban the UNRWA from operating within Israel, with 92 out of 120 members supporting the move. In a second measure, 87 Knesset members also approved a ban on Israeli state authorities interacting with UNRWA, effectively hobbling its capacity to operate in the Occupied Territories. This week, foreign ministers from Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the UK warned of the 'devastating consequences' this ban could unleash across the West Bank and Gaza. Shortly before this, in another blatant display of brutal aggression, Israeli authorities seized the land in East Jerusalem housing UNRWA’s headquarters, reportedly to construct 1,440 new settlement units. This move contravenes international law. The timing and audacity of these actions have left the international community grappling with a troubling reality. Israel’s plans to dismantle the very mechanisms designed to support and assist vulnerable Palestinians will not only aggravate the humanitarian crisis but also deepen the operational problems for the agency. In choosing to silence the very agency tasked with aiding displaced Palestinians, Israel is seriously damaging its own legitimacy on the global stage. In so doing, Israel is actually strengthening the case of those who question that very legitimacy. Ironically, in attempting to erase the presence of Palestinian refugees from its landscape, Israel’s actions could very well enhance the visibility of that issue.

Middle East Reacts To Trump’s Dalliance With Zionism – OpEd	The election victory of Donald Trump in the November 5 election is being perceived in the West Asian region with growing anxiety as presaging the US aligning one hundred percent with the Zionist project for Greater Israel. Although Trump has kept out vociferous neocons from his government positions, the same cannot be said for pro-Zionist figures. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims he has spoken three times with Trump already since the election and they 'see eye-to-eye regarding the Iranian threat and all of its components.' The 'components' implies that Netanyahu hopes to get a blank cheque from Trump to accelerate the ethnic cleansing in Gaza, for annexation of West Bank, violent reprisals against Palestinians and, most important, to carry the war right into Iranian territory. Three events in as many days this week show the first signs of a backlash building up. On Monday, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei gave Tehran’s first official reaction to Trump’s election victory. Baqaei took a nuanced line saying, 'What matters to us in this region is the United States’ actual behaviour and policies regarding Iran and the broader West Asia.' Notably, Baqaei expressed 'cautious optimism that the new [Trump] administration might adopt a more peace-oriented approach, reduce regional hostilities, and uphold its commitments.' (Tehran Times) Baqaei also refuted the recent allegation by Washington that Iran was involved in plots to assassinate Trump. He called the Biden Administration’s allegation as 'nothing more than an attempt to sabotage relations' between Tehran and Washington by 'laying traps to complicate the path for the next administration.' Baqaei also held out an assurance to the incoming US administration that Tehran firmly adheres to a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes. He announced that Rafael Grossi, head of International Atomic Energy (IAEA) was due to arrive in Tehran on Wednesday night. Taken together, Baqaei’s remarks suggest that Iran hopes there’s still daylight possible between Trump and Netanyahu. The clincher here would have been the remark that Trump slipped into his victory speechwith great deliberation on November 6 that 'I’m not going to start a war. I’m going to stop wars.' Trump was on record during his election campaign that 'I don’t want to do damage to Iran but they cannot have nuclear weapons.' Tehran’s consultations with Grossi responds to Trump’s concern. This is smart thinking. Iran’s non-provocative stance would mean there is no alibi for attacking Iran. That said, however, the 'known unknown' still remains — namely, Iran’s retaliation to the Israeli attack on October 26. On November 2, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a video released by Iranian state media, promised 'a crushing response' to Israeli attack. Conceivably, the period till January 20 when Trump is sworn in, is going to be critical. Meanwhile, this week witnessed that Iran and Saudi Arabia have given verve to their detente, which is now manifesting as Riyadh’s solidarity and open support for Iran in its growing confrontation with Israel. Amidst the growing tensions in the region, the chief of staff of Saudi Arabia’s armed forces, Fayyad al-Ruwaili, visited Tehran on November 10 and met with his Iranian counterpart General Mohammad Bagheri. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke on the phonewith Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the phone in the context of a summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) – Arab League in Riyadh on November 11-12. Iran has extended an invitation to MbS to visit Tehran! Two hugely significant highlights of the Riyadh summit have been, first, the Saudi prince’s inaugural address where he warned Israel against hitting Iran. This marked a historic turn by Riyadh toward Tehran-Israeli conflict, and away from US-supported normalisation with Jerusalem. MbS told the summit that the international community should oblige Israel 'to respect the sovereignty of the sisterly Islamic Republic of Iran and not to violate its lands.' Again, Saudi Arabia accused Israel for the first time of committing 'genocide' in Gaza. MbS told the leaders who gathered in Riyadh, that the kingdom renewed 'its condemnation and categorical rejection of the genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people…' Trump has been put on notice that he’s meeting a radically different geopolitical landscape in West Asia compared to his first term as president. The Trump transition team is keeping its cards close, offering NatSec Daily a boilerplate statement that Trump will take 'necessary action' to 'lead our country' and 'restore peace through strength.' But warning bells are ringing. The key pillars of Trump’s 'maximum pressure' strategy against Tehran — isolating Iran and ramping up economic pressure while maintaining a credible threat of military force as deterrent — have become wobbly. On the other hand, the massive Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel on October 1 and the colossal failure of the Israeli air strike on Iran twenty-six days later convey a loud message all across West Asia that Israel is no longer the dominant military power it used to be — and there is a new sheriff in town. Trump will have to navigate the fallout of both sides of this issue with diminished US diplomatic and geopolitical capital at his disposal. Meanwhile, Tehran is also deepening its cooperation with Russia, which adds a giant new Ukraine-sized complexity to Trump’s Iran policy. While in Eurasia, the US has allies, Trump is navigating in West Asia pretty much alone. The US’ stark isolation comes home dramatically by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s announcement on Wednesday that Turkey, a NATO member country, has severed all ties with Israel. Erdogan disclosed this to journalists aboard his plane after visiting Saudi Arabia. A regional trend to ostracise Israel is visible now and it is destined to expand and deepen. The summit in Riyadh witnessed the African Union joining hands with the Arab League and OIC to sign a tripartite agreement on Tuesday to establish a mechanism to support the Palestinian cause, which will be coordinated through the three organisations’ secretariats as a game changer to strengthen their influence in international forums. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan noted that the three organisations will now onward speak with one voice internationally. Even as the summit concluded in Riyadh, Crown Prince Salman had a call on Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin readout stated that the two leaders 'reaffirmed their commitment to continue the consistent expansion' of Russian-Saudi ties and specifically 'stressed the importance of continuing close coordination within OPEC Plus and stated the effectiveness and timeliness of the steps being taken in this format to ensure balance on the global energy market.' On the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Kremlin readout noted with satisfaction that 'the principled approaches of Russia and Saudi Arabia with regard to the Middle East settlement are essentially identical.' MbS’ initiative to re-invigorate his conversation with Putin can only be seen against the backdrop of the profound misgivings in Riyadh regarding the Trump-Netanyahu bromance and the spectre of a possible regional war haunting the region stemming out of Israel drawing encouragement from the seamless US support expected through the coming 4-year period for the Zionist cause.

West Repeating Error Of 1980s And Overrating Moscow’s Strength An...	In the 1980s, Western governments and experts overrated both the strength and likely longevity of the Soviet Union, with many assuming it would survive and perhaps even prosper over at least several decades. Now, Peter Zashev says, their successors are making a similar mistake about Putin’s Russia. In fact, the Russian scholar now at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga says, 'Putin’s Russia is weak, even very weak,' despite the bluffing Moscow has once again used with such success to convince the West otherwise (moscowtimes.ru/2024/11/12/sploshnoi-blef-i-bravada-rossiya-putina-slaba-ochen-slaba-a147419). Now just as at the end of Soviet times, Zashev says, many in the West are failing to see this and making miscalculations as a result. In reality, he continues, 'the Putin regime has many weak points, and they are not some Achilles’ heel but rather other parts of the body politic, much larger' and therefore much for likely to kick in sooner than most expect. To make his point, Zashev lists four such weak points: the absence of an ideology, Putin’s inability to gain support unless he pays for it, Putin’s constant need to display his strength which in the nature of things ultimately leads to overreaching and defeat, and an economy that looks superficially strong but in fact is riven with problems. First of all, he argues, Putin’s Russia 'simply doesn’t have an ideology. Instead, it offers a strange, unnatural and rather perverse mixture of Orthodoxy, Stalinism, anti-Americanism, militarism, Sovietism' and much else besides. What is on offer is intended to cover but in fact calls attention to the fact that 'no one loves Putin unless they are paid to do so.' To conceal that reality, Zashev continues, Putin must constantly show himself to be powerful enough to win everything he gets involved with; but at present, he can’t even defend Kursk Oblast let alone take Kyiv, he can’t defend Russia’s airports or oil dumps and everyone can see that. He will try to create situations in which he can win, but he won’t be able to. The reason is the fourth weak point of the Putin system, the economy. It is just treading water now but is falling ever further behind the rest of the world in terms of innovation and modernization. And that creates a situation in which the entire system can become unbalanced and then collapse. Zashev concludes: 'The system appears to be working so far, but the example of the USSR should remind us how easily such a system can become unbalanced and what its suddent and rapid destruction this will lead to: – and more than that, that 'the end will come much faster than we can imagine.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CmXalCZp1-m4	2024-11-14T16:04:45-08:00	
How Does Marco Rubio, Trump’s Pick For Secretary Of State, See Th...	By Todd Prince and Tony Wesolowsky (RFE/RL) -- President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Senator Marco Rubio to be his top diplomat as the incoming administration prepares to navigate an increasingly perilous world, with wars raging in Europe and the Middle East and competition heating up with China in the Asia-Pacific. In choosing Rubio -- a senator known for taking a tough line on many foreign policy issues -- the president-elect is seeking someone who largely shares his views on the most pressing international topics, says Behnam Ben Taleblu, an analyst at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'Rubio is someone who has ideological and political alignment with Trump on several key national-security issues like great-power competition, countering China, countering the Islamic [Republic of] Iran, and reinstating the maximum-pressure campaign,' Taleblu told RFE/RL. In a wide-ranging interview last week with media before being tapped as secretary of state, Rubio said the decades-long period of unchallenged U.S. global dominance following the collapse of the Soviet Union had ended, replaced by a new Cold War-like era. He warned that the United States can't stretch itself too thin with global commitments, saying Washington must be 'pragmatic' in its pursuits abroad. 'We're the most powerful [country], but we too have limited resources…so we have to invest both our time and our money on things that serve our core national interest,' Rubio said in a November 7 interview with EWTN, a U.S.-based cable network. Rubio, a Cuban-American, played an influential role in shaping Trump's policy on Venezuela during the latter's first term as president from 2017 to 2021. The New York Times described Rubio at the time as Trump's 'virtual secretary of state for Latin America.' The three-time Florida senator, who challenged Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, comes to the job with ample foreign policy experience, having served on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. If ultimately confirmed by the Senate, Rubio, 53, would be the first Latino to serve as secretary of state. And while Latin America will certainly be an important focus for Rubio, it will take a back seat to more pressing U.S. foreign policy concerns, namely China's global rise, Iran's threat to the Middle East, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Priority No. 1: China When it comes to demands on U.S. military, political, and financial resources, Rubio wants the focus to be on China. 'I think the future of the 21st century is going to largely be defined by what happens in the Indo-Pacific. And I think China would love for us to be bogged down in Europe in a conflict and not focused on what's happening in the Indo-Pacific,' Rubio said on November 7. Rubio, who served as a co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, has consistently advocated taking a hard line on China. He led efforts to arm Taiwan, the self-governing democracy claimed by Beijing. He called for direct shipments of U.S. munitions and advanced military technologies in hopes of deterring China from attacking the island. Rubio has also been vocal about Beijing's human rights record, pushed for a U.S. industrial policy to better compete with China, and backed tariffs on Chinese goods. He sought to ban imports of Chinese goods made with forced labor by Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in western China and prevent China from circumventing Trump-era tariffs by relocating production to Mexico. NATO And Ukraine Rubio has repeatedly supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in its defensive war against Russia and described Ukrainians as 'incredibly brave and strong.' In February 2022, immediately following Russia's full-scale invasion, he co-sponsored the NYET Act in the Senate, which aimed to 'bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities' and impose sanctions on Russia. However, Rubio has also said Russia's war against Ukraine has reached a 'stalemate' and 'needs to be brought to a conclusion.' He was among a minority of senators who, earlier this year, opposed a foreign-assistance bill that included $60 billion in aid for Ukraine. The bill eventually passed in April, bringing total U.S. aid to Ukraine since February 2022 to almost $175 billion -- about as much given by all of Europe combined. Rubio has highlighted that imbalance, emphasizing that Washington should push Europe to take a larger role in handling its own security issues in order to allow the United States to prioritize challenging China in the Indo-Pacific. In last week's interview with EWTN, Rubio said it was 'unrealistic' to expect the United States to approve tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine every 10 months. He said European members of NATO need to step up their contributions to the alliance. 'Every day in our own country, [we are] grappling with [the question of] how do we provide assistance to Americans, even as we have these defense requirements that we're spending a lot of money on, and these [European NATO] countries are not making that choice,' he said. While Rubio sees Russia as a threat to U.S. security and backs Ukraine's sovereignty and independence, he said Kyiv will have to negotiate an end to the war. Rubio said Russia has just too many resources at its disposal, including weapons and men, to allow it to continue the fighting despite suffering extraordinary losses. Iran: 'No Appeasement' In the Middle East, Rubio has long taken a tough stand on Iran, describing its theocratic government as a 'terrorist regime' for financing groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, both designated terrorist organizations by the United States. As a senator, he was a fierce critic of U.S. President Barack Obama's 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), which restricted Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. Critics of the deal argued it empowered Iran, offering too much relief from sanctions without guarantees it wouldn't someday produce a nuclear bomb. In 2018, Trump, who was then president, pulled the United States out of the deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran. More recently, Rubio co-authored three bills punishing Iran that were signed into law this year. The bills authorize placing sanctions on Iranian oil exports and top Iranian leaders for human rights abuses, as well as foreign entities and governments supporting Hamas. An Iranian client, Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, triggering a regional war that threatens to engulf more states. Rubio in September criticized the Biden administration for dragging its feet on enforcing the Iranian oil sanctions, which are aimed at crippling the government's finances. It has also failed to move forward on the human rights sanctions. Depending on what the incoming administration is faced with in Iran when it takes office, analyst Taleblu says -- noting the volatile situation in the Middle East -- he would expect a Rubio-led State Department to make good on enforcement of the sanction bills. A vocal supporter of Israel, Rubio has backed the country's right to defend itself from Iranian threats. Following Tehran's missile strikes on Israel on October 1, Rubio publicly backed an asymmetrical response. Afghanistan Rubio has also taken a hard line on the Taliban, arguing the militant Islamist group should be described as a 'terrorist organization' by Washington. In March, the Florida senator introduced a bill in the Senate calling for an end to an end to U.S. aid to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, arguing that some of that money could end up with 'terrorist groups.' In remarks to the Senate, Rubio said, 'A Taliban-controlled Afghanistan poses a direct threat to U.S. national-security interests and to our allies in the Middle East and Central Asia.'

What To Expect From The Trump National Security Team – OpEd	By Dave Patterson When former President Donald Trump won an impressive re-election, national security wonks went wild with speculation on how Trump 47 would treat the Pentagon. The liberals portrayed the worst possible national security future, casting Trump as a tyrant who would use the active-duty military to impose his will on US citizens. Most of the gloom-and-doomers are 'never-Trumpers' and have views of little relevance. Trump Rapidly Forms National Security Staff As the Trump Defense Department transition team starts to form its slate of Pentagon and other national security staff, what amounts to a fifth column is forming inside the five-sided building. Media reports show that Trump did not calculate how divisive what he called 'the enemy within' really was. There seems to be a cadre of unnamed defense officials holding clandestine gatherings to devise ways to thwart their commander-in-chief. These people need to remember that 75 million voters repudiated their flawed point of view. News of this despicable behavior was made public in a CNN report: 'Pentagon officials are holding informal discussions about how the Department of Defense would respond if Donald Trump issues orders to deploy active-duty troops domestically and fire large swaths of apolitical staffers, defense officials told CNN … Trump’s election has also raised questions inside the Pentagon about what would happen if the president issued an unlawful order, particularly if his political appointees inside the department don’t push back.' These reports could be chalked up to chatter among those in the suggestion-making class, always a noisy minority in any administration. These comments are troubling because these voices gain prominence through the mindless echo chamber of the conventional media. To set the record straight about what presidents can do and have done, take the phrase 'how the Department of Defense would respond if Donald Trump issues orders to deploy active-duty troops domestically.' This notion is a forecast for the darkest and most malevolent intentions, unprecedented in American history. However, putting that phrase in historical context, Military.com explained past commanders-in-chief have used soldiers domestically six times. Which leads one to ask those worried about President Trump: 'Do you mean like President Abraham Lincoln using federal troops to quell the New York City draft riots? Perhaps you are talking about President Herbert Hoover when he used the US Army, led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, to remove veterans who set up an encampment on Capitol Hill, or in 1967 when President Lyndon Johnson called in the 82nd and 101st Airborne units to put down ‘Detroit’s 12th Street Riot,’ or maybe you mean the use of 13,600 armed soldiers that restored order when riots erupted nationwide following the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Maybe you are referring to the Los Angeles riots when several hundred Marines restored order in 1992.' Should anyone forget, President Dwight Eisenhower deployed active-duty soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division in 1957 to escort nine black students to a newly integrated Central High School in Little Rock, AR. In each of these instances, federal military forces were used domestically because it was necessary to preserve the lives and property of US citizens. That reasoning was precisely how President-elect Trump phrased his intentions about when federal troops would be needed. However, on a more practical level, Trump administration appointees will be swimming upstream, particularly in the Pentagon, to achieve the Trump agenda. For Secretary of State, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) steps up to take the position. Current Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL) will be Trump’s National Security Advisor. Fox News personality and veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars Pete Hegseth will be Secretary of Defense. A Non-traditional Choice Hegseth, Rubio, and Waltz will constitute the principal national security team; the most non-traditional choice is Hegseth to lead the Pentagon. However, he will have a mandate to turn the Defense Department from a den of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) activists into a fighting force capable of again deterring aggressors and, if deterrence fails, to defeat any adversary soundly. Many recent assessments of the US Armed Forces have questioned whether that is possible now. Trump sees Hegseth as a no-nonsense, thoughtful leader who will bring back structure, order, and discipline to the Pentagon. Quoting Trump, The New York Times wrote, 'Pete is tough, smart, and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — our military will be great again, and America will never back down.' As the new administration nominees are announced, each has been selected to achieve the Trump agenda. Turning the massive ship of state from the path 60% of voters said is going in the wrong direction will be an immense undertaking and may be painful. However, America will be better for the effort.

The Choices That Australia Makes – OpEd	If you go to the bluff at Kings Park in Perth, Australia, you can overlook the Swan River and enjoy a remarkable view. Across the bay, there is a phalanx of steel and glass buildings that rise to the skies. Each of these buildings carries a sign that glistens in the sharp sun: BHP, Rio Tinto, Chevron, Deloitte, and others. Kings Park no longer survives merely with the patronage of the British King, who continues to claim sovereignty over Australia. Part of it is now named Rio Tinto Kings Park, needing the corporate profits from this enormous mining company to sustain its charms. Down one of the avenues of the park there are trees set apart by a few meters, and at the base of these trees are small markers for dead soldiers from past wars; these are not graves but remembrances that are crowned by Australian flags. The park brings together the three crucial pieces of Western Australia, this province of which Perth is the capital which is the size of Western Europe: the British monarchy, the mining companies and its affiliates, and the role of the military. Of Kings A few days before I arrived in Canberra, an aboriginal senator, Lidia Thorpe, interrupted the celebration of King Charles III to say, 'You are not my king. This is not your land.' It was a powerful demonstration against the treatment of Australia ever since the arrival of English ships to the country’s east in January 1788. In fact, the British crown does claim title to the entirety of the Australian landmass. King Charles III is head of the 56-country Commonwealth and the total land area of the Commonwealth takes up 21 percent of the world’s total land. It is quite remarkable to realize that King Charles III is nominally in charge of merely 22 percent less than Queen Victoria (1819-1901). The day after Senator Thorpe’s statement, a group of aboriginal leaders met with King Charles III to discuss the theme of 'sovereignty.' In Sydney, Elder Allan Murray of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council welcomed the King to Gadigal land and said, 'We’ve got stories to tell, and I think you witnessed that story yesterday in Canberra. But the story is unwavering, and we’ve got a long way to achieve what we want to achieve and that’s our own sovereignty.' When Captain James Cook (1770) and Captain Arthur Phillip (1788) arrived on this Gadigal land, they were met by people who had lived in the area for tens of thousands of years. In 1789, a smallpox epidemic brought by the British killed 53 percent of the Gadigal, and eventually—through violence—they reduced the population to three in 1791. It is accurate, then, for Elder Murray to have said to the press after King Charles III left that 'The Union Jack was put on our land without our consent. We’ve been ignored.' What remained were barrangal dyara(skin and bones, as the Gadigal would have said). Given the value of the land in Sydney, the Gadigal clan would today be one of the richest groups in the world. But apart from a few descendants who do not have title to the land, the ghosts of the ancestors walk these streets. Of Minerals Australia is one of the widest countries in the world, with a large desert in its middle section. Underneath its soil, which has been walked on by a range of Aboriginal communities for tens of thousands of years, is wealth that is estimated to be $19.9 trillion. This estimate includes the country’s holdings of coal, copper, iron ore, gold, uranium, and rare earth elements. In 2022, Australia’s mining companies—which are also some of the largest in the world—extracted at least 27 minerals from the subsoil, including lithium (Australia is the world’s largest producer of lithium, annually providing 52 percent of the global market’s lithium). On May 24, 2020, Rio Tinto’s engineers and workers blew up a cave in the Pilbara area of Western Australia to expand their Brockman 4 iron ore mine. The cave in the Juukan Gorge had been used by the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people for 46,000 years and had been kept by them as a community treasure. In 2013, Rio Tinto approached the Western Australian government to seek an exemption to destroy the cave and to extend the mine. They received this exemption based on a law called the Aboriginal Heritage Act of 1972, which had been drafted to favor mining companies. Rio Tinto, with substantial operations in Western Australia and around the world, has a market capitalization of $105.7 billion, making it—after BHP (market cap of $135.5)—the second largest minerals company in the world (both Rio Tinto and BHP are headquartered in Melbourne). Hastily, BHP began to reconsider its permission to destroy 40 cultural sites for its South Flank iron mine extension in the Pilbara region (and after its investigation and conversation with the Banjima community) decided to save 10 sites. Craig and Monique Oobagooma live in the northernmost homestead in Australia near the Robinson River. They are part of the Wanjina Wunggurr, whose lands are now used for the extraction of uranium and other metals and minerals. The uranium mines in the north are owned and operated by Paladin Energy, another Perth-based mining company that also owns mines in Malawi and Namibia. There is also a large military base in nearby Yampi. Craig told me that when he walks his land, he can dig beneath the soil and find pink diamonds. But, he says, he puts them back. 'They are sacred stones,' he says. Some parts of the land can be used for the betterment of his family, but not all of it. Not the sacred stones. And not the ancestral sites, of which there are only a few that remain. Of Militaries In 2023, the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom signed an agreement to preserve 'critical minerals' for their own development and security. Such an agreement is part of the New Cold War against China, to ensure that it does not directly own the 'critical minerals.' Between 2022 and 2023, Chinese investment in mining decreased from AU$1809 million to AU$34 million. Meanwhile, Australian investment in building military infrastructure for the United States has increased dramatically, with the Australian government expanding the Tindal air base in Darwin (Northern Territory) to hold U.S. B-1 and B-52 nuclear bombers, expanding the submarine docking stations along the coastline of Western Australia, and expanding the Exmouth submarine and deep space communications facility. All of this is part of Australia’s historically high defense budget of $37 billion. In Sydney, near the Central Train station, I met Euranga, who lived in a tunnel which he had painted with the history of the Aboriginal peoples of Eora (Sydney). He had been part of the Stolen Generation, one in three Aboriginal children stolen from their families and raised in boarding schools. The school hurt his spirit, he told me. 'This is our land, but it is also not our land,' he said. Beneath the land is wealth, but it is being drained away by private mining companies and for the purposes of military force. The old train station nearby looks forlorn. There is no high-speed rail in vast Australia. Such a better way to spend its precious resources, as Euranga indicated in his paintings: embrace the worlds of the Aboriginal communities who have been so harshly displaced and build infrastructure for people rather than for wars.

Abolish The Department Of Homeland Security – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken The Trump transition team on Wednesday announced that he is nominating South Dakota governor Kristi Noem as the next head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In the coming weeks, we’ll hear a lot about Noem’s personal politics and origins. We’ll also hear about how the DHS is, as the AP puts it, 'one of the biggest government agencies that will be integral to his vow to secure the border and carry out a massive deportation operation.' Unfortunately, all this misses the most important point about the DHS which is that the DHS was invented in 2002 to justify more government spending, to reward political allies, and to influence local governments with federal grants. For voters who supported Trump because they thought a Trump presidency might actually reduce government waste, they should now be asking why Trump is appointing any new DHS head at all. The only thing Trump should do with the DHS is abolish it. For younger readers, or people with terrible memories, this might sound radical or extreme. But, I can assure you, dear reader, that the United States somehow managed to get along for more than 225 years before this Department was created twenty-two years ago by Congress and the Bush Administration. Much of what the Department does today was not new in 2002, of course. The federal government already had a border patrol, and it already collected tariffs on imports. The Coast Guard was alive and well. The Secret Service already existed, as did various agencies related to nuclear energy and the inspection of agricultural projects. But, the DHS has always been more than just a reorganization of existing agencies. The DHS has overseen new slush funds for domestic police departments. It is the DHS that has largely facilitated the militarization of local police forces. As Wired put it in 2020, 'the Homeland Security Grant Program has funneled billions of dollars to law enforcement agencies to acquire military-grade equipment.' Nonetheless, the creation of the DHS has done nothing to make the border more secure, or to facilitate the enforcement of tariffs. The DHS has never been necessary to patrol US coastal waters. Rather, federal bureaucrats and elected officials pursued the creation of this new enormous government department for political reasons. The DHS was created to be a cabinet-level agency, and the thing about cabinet-level status is that the move makes it easier for the bureaucrats in charge of the agencies to politically agitate for more government spending in their favor, and to push bigger government in general. It’s no coincidence that as the US government has grown ever larger and more intrusive, so has the number of cabinet-level agencies. So, now we have the EPA, the SBA, and the departments of HUD, Energy, and Education all provided with more direct access to the president and the media. Everything they do is deemed 'essential.' Everything they do, we’re told, is a matter of national importance. DHS is no different. When the 9/11 attacks occurred, they exposed the sheer incompetence, laziness, and inefficiency of government security and defense organizations. Year after year, hundreds of billions of dollars were poured into these organizations — in addition to the countless billions spent on the Pentagon. But when they were shown to be asleep at the switch, what happened? Rather than have their budgets cut, and senior officials fired in droves — as should have happened — George W. Bush and his cronies decided that what the federal government really needed was a new department into which billions more in taxpayer money could be poured. The was politically important in the sense that making DHS a department made it easier to call for every more funding for its constituent agencies. It has certainly worked. Prior to the creation of the DHS, 'homeland security' functions were rarely funded at levels exceeding 20 billion dollars per year. Since 2002, though, federal spending on these functions—now consolidated into the DHS—has soared. Since 2001, the total budget for these activities has nearly tripled, rising from $28 billion in 2001 to $112 billion in 2024. (That’s in inflation-adjusted 2023 dollars.) Since the Cold War ended, by the way, spending on so-called homeland security has increased by more than six-fold. Since 2001, has it really become almost three times more expensive—in inflation adjusted terms, mind you—to patrol the border, to collect tariffs, and to check luggage for guns at the airport? It is difficult to see how. What we do know is that the DHS has become an important pass-through for government largesse. Some of this goes to local governments, and these dollars give the federal government more power by providing yet another carrot the feds can hold out to local politicians. Billions more goes into the FEMA black hole which spends prodigiously on federal agents who use DHS dollars as a means of punishing their political opponents. While the Department was created in response to the 9/11 attacks, the Department does nothing to address anything like a 9/11-style attack. All the agencies that were supposed to provide intelligence on such attacks — the FBI for instance, which failed miserably on 9/11 — already exist in other departments and continue to enjoy huge budgets. Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration — an agency that has never caught a single terrorist—has managed to smuggle at least $100 million worth of cocaine. Once upon a time, 'homeland security' was supposed to be the job of the Department of Defense. but, it seems the Pentagon has been too busy in Ukraine or Iraq to trouble itself with the defense of the borders and airspace of the United States. In spite of having been freed of its responsibility for 'the homeland,' however, the Pentagon’s budget just keeps getting bigger. In 2024, it was at a thirteen-year high and remains—in inflation adjusted terms—above the levels of Reagan’s Cold War spending spree. Pentagon spending is up by 57 percent, inflation-adjusted, since 2001. There is no doubt, however, that heading the Department in Washington will be great for the career of Kristy Noem. She’ll get invited to cabinet meetings, go on national TV, and generally enjoy the pampered life of a high-ranking bureaucrat. Meanwhile, American taxpayers will pay more and more, in depreciating dollars, for yet another federal department.

The Absurdity Of War And Its Ethical Echoes In AI – OpEd	By Rafael Hernandez de Santiago In a city where artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize everything from grocery shopping to pet care, one question looms larger than the latest tech trend: What happens when we forget the lessons of humanity in the quest for efficiency? As our screens flash with notifications, a local philosopher and self-proclaimed ethical warrior, Mr. Raf, urges us to reflect on the often-ignored costs of conflict — both in the battlefield and in our evolving digital landscape. 'War, like a poorly programmed AI, often leads to catastrophic outcomes,' Raf quipped during a recent lecture. 'Blood is not even useful for making mud. It’s just messy!' In the annals of history, war has always demanded a staggering price, and not just in dollars and cents. The most chilling aspect is the loss of human life. Each casualty in conflict is not merely a statistic; it represents a unique individual — someone with hopes, dreams, and loved ones. 'When we wage war, we’re not just destroying buildings; we’re dismantling lives,' Raf stated, recalling the painful remnants of countless conflicts. According to the World Health Organization, wars claim tens of thousands of lives annually, and the toll is not limited to soldiers. Civilians — those who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time — find themselves swept into the storm. 'Imagine being at a family picnic and having it interrupted by artillery fire. That’s no way to spend a Saturday!' Raf remarked dryly, emphasizing the absurdity of violence amid humanity’s gatherings. But the scars of war run deeper than physical loss. The psychological impacts are profound and often overlooked. Soldiers return home carrying the invisible burdens of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. 'It’s like bringing a demonic AI home from work; you can’t just turn it off!' Raf lamented. He highlighted that the horrors of war haunt veterans and civilians alike, leaving a legacy of trauma that can echo through generations. The emotional toll on children, especially those growing up in war zones, is particularly alarming. 'You think kids have it rough with homework? Try growing up while bombs are falling!' Raf added, shaking his head in disbelief. The trauma these children endure can shape their futures, perpetuating cycles of violence and despair. Then there is the economic fallout, which can feel as invisible as the psychological scars but is no less devastating. The funds poured into military campaigns could be better spent on education, healthcare, and infrastructure. 'Let’s not forget the opportunity cost here,' Raf urged. 'Imagine the roads we could build or the schools we could fund instead of financing yet another conflict.' The irony is palpable: We invest billions in creating more sophisticated weapons while ignoring the very real problems we could solve with those resources. 'It’s like spending all your money on a fancy coffee machine but not using it to make coffee. What’s the point?' he quipped. Even our planet bears the scars of warfare. From bombings that raze forests to chemical weapons that poison water supplies, the environmental destruction wrought by conflict is catastrophic. 'War is like a poorly designed AI: It doesn’t just affect the immediate environment; it disrupts the whole ecosystem,' Raf argued. 'The trees don’t just fall; they take entire habitats with them. If we’re going to wage war, we’re also declaring war on the Earth itself.' The consequences of this destruction are felt long after the fighting stops. Communities left with barren land and polluted water face dire challenges. 'It’s a vicious cycle: War devastates, and the aftermath leaves people hungry and desperate,' he said. Raf’s mantra — 'Blood is not even useful for making mud' — serves as a stark reminder of the senselessness of war. 'It’s a truth that echoes through history: Conflicts often end in stalemates or resolutions that could have been achieved through dialogue,' he pointed out. The philosopher Aristotle once said: 'It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.' Yet, in war, we often accept the thought of violence without questioning its futility. 'Wouldn’t it be great if we could use all the energy we spend on fighting to solve our differences peacefully?' Raf proposed. 'Imagine an AI that mediates disputes instead of escalating them. Now that’s the kind of machine we need!' As Techville embraces the future of AI, Mr. Raf advocates for an ethical approach — one that learns from the past. 'If we can’t teach AI to value human life, we might as well hand over the keys to a malfunctioning robot,' he cautioned. 'We need to instill the values of diplomacy and cooperation in our technology.' In this context, the role of the international community becomes crucial. 'We must prioritize dialogue over military intervention,' Raf emphasized. By addressing root causes like poverty and inequality, we can create a world where conflicts are less likely to arise. 'Investing in education and social justice is like teaching AI to be kind — it’s not easy, but it’s necessary.' In a world increasingly defined by AI and technological advancement, it is our ethical responsibility to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of history. 'Peace isn’t just a noble idea; it’s essential for our survival,' Raf declared. As he concluded his talk, the crowd erupted in applause. 'Let’s strive for a future where our conflicts are resolved through dialogue, and where human life is cherished above all else,' he urged. 'After all, if we can’t learn from our past, how can we expect our machines to do better?' In Techville, where the buzz of technology mingles with the echoes of history, Mr. Raf stands as a beacon of hope. He reminds us that as we navigate the ethical landscape of AI, the lessons of humanity must guide our way. With a wink, he added: 'And maybe one day, we’ll look back and wonder why we ever thought war was a good idea in the first place!' • Rafael Hernandez de Santiago, viscount of Espes, is a Spanish national residing in Saudi Arabia and working at the Gulf Research Center.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CkFdwgyqTMbo	2024-11-14T15:50:40-08:00	
Czech FM: If Europe Wants US Protection Against Russia, It Must S...	By Aneta Zachová (EurActiv) -- The United States remains Europe’s greatest ally regardless of who is in the White House, said Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský, adding that to face Russia, the EU should back newly elected US President Donald Trump's China policy. 'We share common interests and values that endure,' Lipavský (independent) said at the opening of the Aspen Institute conference in Prague on Thursday (14 November). The head of Czech diplomacy also stressed that Europe should see a change in the US administration as an opportunity to take more responsibility for its own security. 'It is clear that the United States can no longer police the world alone. If we want to ensure prosperity and security in the transatlantic area, both sides must contribute,' he added. 'We must continue proving that we do not shy away from challenges and that we have courage and determination,' the Czech minister said, commenting that Trump respects those willing to stand up and fight. According to Lipavský, the US will increasingly focus on China and protecting the Taiwan Strait. 'Europe needs to focus on what is happening at its borders. If we expect a strong US commitment to our protection against Russian imperialism, we must be prepared to support them, which means also facing the challenge posed by China,' he explained. Lipavský noted that global instability is on the rise, with recent years bringing further shifts on the geopolitical stage. China’s influence and its ambitions to reshape the international order are growing, he added. 'The Kremlin seeks to disrupt transatlantic ties by aligning with Iran and North Korea. North Korean soldiers are already in Europe, and the axis of evil has thereby been fully revived,' said Lipavský.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9Cn95PP9A0Duc	2024-11-14T15:48:00-08:00	
Malaysia Protests New Philippine Maritime Laws For South China Se...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Malaysia said it is protesting two new Philippine maritime laws that it contends encroach on its boundaries in the South China Sea, amid heightened regional tension over Beijing’s increasing assertiveness about its expansive claims. In October, Malaysia lodged a similar complaint against Vietnam following a BenarNews article about Hanoi’s expansion on a South China Sea reef both countries claim, Reuters news agency reported last week. One security analyst said that despite regional tension, there is little risk of confrontation between Malaysia and the Philippines, or Vietnam, while a regional observer said that Manila and Hanoi were the transgressors in both cases. Malaysian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamad Alamin told his country’s parliament on Thursday that the new Philippine lawsencroach on Malaysia’s oil-rich state of Sabah, which borders the South China Sea. 'We’ve finalized and reviewed key issues in our protest note, which we’ll send today [Thursday] to affirm our commitment to protecting Sabah’s sovereignty and rights,' Alamin said, referring to the state on Borneo island that is claimed by both Malaysia and the Philippines. Manila on Nov. 8 enacted the Philippine Maritime Zones Act and Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act, which Alamin said extend into Malaysia’s boundaries mapped out in 1979, which Kuala Lumpur regards as internationally recognized. Manila had said the laws were intended to strengthen Manila’s maritime claims and restrict foreign ships and aircraft to designated lanes, to align with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Philippine officials did not immediately respond to Alamin’s comments to Malaysian lawmakers. Located off the southwestern region of the Philippines, Sabah has long been a thorny issue between the neighboring countries. In September 2020, the two countries took their dispute over who owns Sabah to the United Nations. The dispute remains unresolved. Separately, in June 2023, a Paris court upheld Malaysia’s challenge to a U.S. $15 billion arbitration award to purported heirs of an erstwhile sultanate called Sulu, part of which is in Sabah. An arbitration court in Paris had in February 2022 ordered Malaysia to pay that amount to settle a colonial-era land deal. The former Sultanate of Sulu was based in a small archipelago in the far southern Philippines. An analyst at the non-profit Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies said Malaysia has had to deal with the Philippines’ expansion efforts in the South China Sea. 'From the point of view of Malaysia, the Philippines is the troublemaker-in-chief,' Benjamin Blandin, a network coordinator at the council, told BenarNews. He said the Philippines destroyed Malaysian sovereignty markers in the Spratlys, a South China Sea island chain, in the 1970s and 1980s and later occupied Commodore Reef within the Malaysian exclusive economic zone. A country’s EEZs extends up to 200 nautical miles from its coastline. 'So based on this bilateral ‘history,’ Malaysia can only interpret negatively any further move of the Philippines, at least as long as the Sabah case is not solved,' Blandin said. Blandin said Vietnam had also destroyed markers at two maritime features in Malaysia’s EEZ before occupying them. Another analyst, Shahriman Lockman at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia, blamed Vietnam’s actions. 'Recent reports of Malaysia’s protest note to Vietnam, if accurate, reflect a growing impatience with Vietnam’s recalcitrance in the South China Sea and reluctance to engage in constructive discussions – behavior that deserves as much attention as China’s,' Lockman, a senior analyst at the institute, told BenarNews. 'Even so, I don’t anticipate any major escalation as long as Vietnam tries to restrain its fishermen who have a tendency to intrude into foreign EEZs, not only in Southeast Asia but across the Asia Pacific.' Lockman added that protests regarding territorial claims were normal. 'This is just a routine aspect of diplomatic relations – a typical day at the office for our diplomats,' he said. 'As countries build the legal foundations for their territorial and jurisdictional claims, it’s inevitable that overlaps are going to be reiterated.' 'Unless Manila actively pursues its legal claims, I don’t see a high risk of confrontation with Malaysia,' he said. Overlapping claims Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, China, Brunei and Indonesia, as well as Taiwan, hold overlapping claims in the South China Sea and its islands and reefs. Beijing claims nearly all of the sea as its own based on historic rights, which were invalidated by a 2016 arbitration ruling by the international court in The Hague, Since the Philippines enacted its two new laws, Beijing and Manilahave launched protests against each other over contested South China Sea claims. Following Beijing’s protest, Marcos on Thursday said his government would maintain its stance on its South China Sea territories, the state-run Philippine News Agency reported. '[T]hey will continue to protect what they defined as their sovereign territory,' he told journalists. 'Of course, we do not agree with their definition of sovereign territory.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceSn9UyJP9CrENeJA6YRdr	2024-11-14T15:45:30-08:00	
The Shifting Nature Of Journalism: Its Being Turned Upside Down –...	Over the last few years, journalism has undergone a massive change. The media organizations many journalists work(ed) for are also in the process of being turned upside-down. What can be described as the mass media in some form employed around 95 percent of journalists, where their prime function was to disseminate news, information, and objective analysis to the public at large. The mass media was portrayed as the 'Fourth Estate', a body that would act as a check and balance to government in a democratic system. Journalism is not always what it appears to be The uncovering of the Watergate break-in and the pursuant cover-up by the White House, which eventually brought down US president Richard Nixon, has been described as the epitome of investigative journalism. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein received much of their information from an insider whistleblower, known as ‘Deep Throat'. However, the revelation that ‘Deep Throat’ was Mark Felt, an assistant director of the FBI at that time, arises another possibility. The possibility that information provided by Felt to Woodward and Bernstein was intended by the ‘Deep State’ to end Nixon’s presidency. Felt was (perhaps unsuspectingly) an agent of the ‘Deep State’ on a mission to end a presidency. The lesson is there is truth, and there are motivations behind truths, where the public may never find out the reality of the situation. This example above, shows the power of journalism in finding the truth, or the flip side, where journalism is susceptible to being used by unidentified forces for the purposes of fulfilling hidden agendas. Journalism has been manipulated over the centuries, where the most well-intentioned journalists have either been misled, or themselves been dishonest. Journalism is often a pivot point between exercising the aspirations of the ‘Fourth Estate’, or acting for the Deep State. Much reporting has been influenced, either intentionally or unintentionally by state narratives. Weapons of mass destruction, Y2K, and Black Lives Matter (BLM) were partly media creations. Images of Obama, Biden, Trump, Assange, Putin, Zelenski, and others were carefully crafted by the legacy media, shifting public opinion either for or against them. This paradox of sorts has over the last 30 years created a loss of confidence and trust by the public in the legacy media. The public has grown wise. In the recent US presidential election, major legacy network audiences plummeted. Audiences moved across to the independent media, as faith has been lost in legacy journalism. Many journalists through pushing partisan narratives helped to destroy their employers. This will lead to fire-sales in the not too distant future. Comcast is already trying to sell MSNBC. Today’s journalistic landscape is vastly different to what it once was. Traditionally, graduates of journalism, economics, arts and other humanities would start their careers in journalism through what was once a very stable industry. Alternatively, cadet journalists would move into one of the satellite areas, such as local newspapers, regional radio, television stations, or specialist magazines. Over time, some would rise up to senior reporter and eventually editor in print media. Some would enter investigative journalism in crime, business or government. In television and radio, some would become a host or anchor of their own programs. Becoming the anchor of the news desk, or anchor of a long running high rating program was the pinnacle of the profession. Successful journalists would be given their own columns in print media, where they would focus on Op Eds, that in the past were very influential in shaping public opinion. In the past journalists tended to settle within legacy media corporations which represented their political beliefs, being left, centre, or right. Up until around 2010, being a journalist within the legacy media was considered a good career choice. One had a career path. Journalists would tend to move from one corporation within the legacy media to another, or an international media organization, which grew out of the CNN success in the 1980s. Very few would ever go out of the industry as an independent. The systemic control over narratives of the legacy media created a prism that has forced out some of the best journalists. The impending mass layoffs of journalistic staff at legacy media companies due to declining audience sizes will act as a great impetuous of independent journalism in the near future, which took a foothold during the Covid pandemic, and came of age during the recent US presidential election. The rest of the world is following this trend and set to play a major role in future elections. The new journalistic landscape This rise of the internet and ability of people to utilize platforms like YouTube from 2010 onwards as it became more sophisticated, provided a potential platform for citizen journalism. The so-called Arab Spring around the 2010s showed the potential of social media for groups to get information out to the public. Prior to this period, WHO rather than WHAT was the prime determinant of who was heard on the media and published. This prevented any balance of views getting public airing. Initially social media changed that. In addition, many academic journalists opened their own websites and published articles in websites such as this one, offering new perspectives to potential readers. These conditions precipitated the beginnings and rise of the early independent media. Podcasting is the new frontier in journalism. Podcasting was looked down up as glorified blogging, which was more opinionated than factual in most cases. A number of podcasts excelled during the recent US presidential election campaign and challenged the legacy media’s viewing audience numbers. Many prominent podcasters are now becoming household names within the independent media. The adversarial David Frost mode of interviewing is being replaced with a successful 'sit down coffee talk' style that has become a trademark of Joe Rogan. Many prominent journalists and broadcasters from the legacy media such as Tucker Carsen, Megyn Kelly, Russell Brand, and many others have moved across successfully to independent journalism. Some of the successes have their own staff of researchers, journalists and production crews. The very top echelon are financially much better off than when they were employed in the legacy media. Rumble, Spotify, and X (formally Twitter) are becoming premier platforms for podcasters. This area is growing exponentially. They have taken much of the audience the legacy media once had. Many print journalists have now moved across to Substack. The Substack platform allows articles with audio versions, podcasts, and video broadcasts. Substack is accompanied by Notes, which is a 'Twitter like' feed based community that is rapidly becoming a ‘go to’ place. Seymour Hersh, Michael Shellenberger, Matt Taibbi, and Bari Weiss, among thousands of other journalists have moved across to this reader supported platform. These sites have paywalls and collect subscriptions from readers. Some of the successful Substack sites are reported to earn USD 500,000 gross revenue per annum. Substack is still growing very fast. However, many new sites fail to deliver what they promise and become dormant, leaving subscribers in the lurch. Many other business model news portals have mushroomed across the world, relying on advertising from their websites. However, many fall by the wayside, unless they are financed externally by a benefactor. Many of these sites are also being blocked by government authorities, which is becoming a major hazard in the independent news industry. Independent media has shown itself much more capable of going after and exposing the 'Deep State' than the legacy media. Legacy media has been shown to have ‘relationships’ with agents of the Deep State, and influenced from the large revenue streams that Big Pharma provided. Those in this new media aren’t burdened by the editorial lines and narratives the legacy media has been caught up in. It appears to be only the conservative side of the independent media that is taking a critical look at president elect Trump’s new appointments. Pushback against independent media The tool of choice by the establishment to pushback against the independent media are the so-called factcheckers. Factcheckers are usually funded by left leaning political organizations, big pharma, governments through clandestine means, and even the intelligence agencies. The factcheckers with their adversarial approaches usually attempt to destroy narratives, rather than directly tackle facts. The flood arguments with superlative information. Quite often, the factcheckers themselves are often incorrect and misleading, and very difficult to communicate with and obtain a reply, if challenged. During the pandemic factcheckers often attacked recognized world experts. These organizations were based upon journalists, where medically qualified staff didn’t even exist within their organizations. The legitimacy of some of these factcheckers are mostly self-proclaimed. This highlights a group of journalists within the industry who could be best described as presstitutes. Presstitutes are ‘hired guns’ employed to put out particular narratives and stories into the public domain. The spread 'fake News’, or mis-information deliberately. This is very wide spread throughout the legacy media today. Pressititution has been allowed to flourish today because the legacy media is one of the few places those who want a career as a journalist can be employed. They have no choice but to be lucratively paid pressititutes. This is destroying the attractiveness of journalism today, which is losing favour as a tertiary education pursuit. Jobs in public relations, media promotion and advertising usually turn out to be much more lucrative, and provide better upward career mobility. A word about AI One of the biggest threats to the journalism industry is Artificial intelligence (AI). Content in online news portal is sometimes created through AI, making it unnecessary to employ content writers. Articles can be quickly produced through the technology, edited, and posted. However, AI is based upon ‘grounded knowledge’ already on the internet. Acetic and decorative descriptions created upon feelings of the moment are difficult to recreate in situational news or topic situations. As yet, AI will not be able to replace the spark and innovation of journalists as they work on ideas and hunches for creating content that will benefit the platform they are working for. All within the independent media have not forgotten what happened to Julian Assange, who exposed war atrocities committed by the US military, and the long suffering he endured. In 2023, 45 journalists were killed in the line of duty. Legal sanctions and lawfare are also being used to silence many within the independent media. Independent media is the last bastion of hopefully honest journalism that is capable of exposing the excesses of government and 'Deep States' in countries around the world. Independent media is now the legitimate 'Fourth Estate'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRY-1QJZwmBIV	2024-11-14T09:50:04-08:00	
Worldwide Trends In Diabetes Prevalence And Treatment From 1990 T...	There is the only disease that increases the risk of crippling complications such as amputation, vision loss, and kidney failure- Diabetes- It is also associated with cardiovascular disease, dementia, some cancers, and infections such as tuberculosis and severe COVID-19. Of the 828 million adults with diabetes in 2022, over a quarter (212 million) lived in India with another 148 million in China, followed by the USA (42 million), Pakistan (36 million), Indonesia (25 million) and Brazil (22 million).' The Global study published in The Lancet reveals ahead of World Diabetes Day . An Additional concern is that 445 million adults aged 30 years and older with diabetes (59%) did not receive treatment in 2022, three and a half times the number in 1990 The study conclusions: (verbatim) The global rate of diabetes (type 1 and 2 combined) in adults doubled from approximately 7% to about 14% between 1990 to 2022, with the largest increase in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Over the same period, rates of treatment for diabetes stagnated at low levels in many of the same LMICs where rates of the disease have drastically increased, resulting in almost 450 million adults aged 30 and over with diabetes globally (59%) who did not receive treatment in 2022. Meanwhile, people living in North America, Australasia, central and western Europe, and parts of Latin America and East Asia and the Pacific saw a significant improvement in treatment rates for diabetes from 1990 to 2022, contributing to widening global inequities in diabetes treatment. Authors say the study highlights the urgent need for financing of medicines and comprehensive diabetes programmes that enable early detection and effective treatment of diabetes in LMICs. Senior author Professor Majid Ezzati, of Imperial College London, highlighted the widening global inequalities in diabetes, with treatment rates stagnating in many low- and middle-income countries where numbers of adults with diabetes are drastically increasing. 'This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications – including amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss - or in some cases, premature death.' He warned A unique study This global study with global data conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) analyzes the trends in both diabetes rates and treatment which includes all countries; The researchers used the data from over 140 million people aged 18 years or older from more than 1,000 studies in populations of different countries. The authors used statistical tools to bring all the data across different years, ages and countries together, and estimate diabetes rates and treatment in a way that enables comparisons across countries. Researchers defined Diabetes as having a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 7.0 mmol/L or higher, having a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 6.5% or higher (two commonly used diagnostic criteria options for diabetes according to modern guidelines) or taking medication for diabetes. They defined 'Treatment' as taking medication for diabetes. Global rates of diabetes doubled over the last three decades 'From 1990 to 2022, global diabetes rates doubled in both men (6.8% in 1990 to 14.3% in 2022) and women (6.9% to 13.9%). With the additional impact of population growth and ageing, this equates to an estimated 828 million adults with diabetes in 2022, an increase of approximately 630 million people from 1990, when roughly 198 million adults were estimated to have the disease.' A press release from The Lancet noted 'The changes in diabetes rate from 1990 to 2022 varied drastically across different countries with mostly LMICs experiencing the largest increases (eg. the diabetes rate amongst women in Pakistan rose from 9.0% in 1990 to 30.9% in 2022, the largest increase across all countries). Whilst some higher-income countries, such as Japan, Canada and some countries in western Europe (eg. France, Spain and Denmark), saw no change or even a small decrease in diabetes rate over the last three decades.' The release added. Obesity and poor diets are important drivers of the rise in type 2 diabetes rates, and its variation across countries, Diabetes rate was either already high or increased more in some of the regions where obesity was or became prevalent between 1990 to 2022, compared to many high-income countries, especially those in the Pacific and western Europe , where, in general, obesity and diabetes rates did not rise or rose by a relatively small amount. According to Dr Ranjit Mohan Anjana, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, India, the disabling and potentially fatal consequences of diabetes, preventing diabetes through healthy diet and exercise is essential for better health throughout the world. 'Our findings highlight the need to see more ambitious policies, especially in lower-income regions of the world, that restrict unhealthy foods, make healthy foods affordable and improve opportunities to exercise through measures such as subsidies for healthy foods and free healthy school meals as well as promoting safe places for walking and exercising including free entrance to public parks and fitness centres,' she clarified. Widening global inequalities in diabetes treatment: The grim reality What is worrying is the grim reality that three out of five (59%) of adults aged 30 years and older with diabetes, a total of 445 million, were not receiving medication for diabetes in 2022, three and half times the number in 1990 (129 million). Since 1990, some countries, including many in central and western Europe, Latin America and East Asia and the Pacific, as well as Canada and South Korea have seen vast improvements in treatment rates for diabetes resulting in more than 55% of people with diabetes in these countries receiving treatment in 2022. The most notable information is from Belgium where the highest treatment rates were estimated at 86% for women and 77% for men. For many LMICs diabetes treatment coverage has stayed low and changed little over the previous three decades, with over 90% of people with diabetes not receiving treatment in some countries in both 1990 and 2022. Sadly, because of these trends, the yawning gap between the countries with the highest and lowest treatment coverage for diabetes has widened since 1990 to 2022; from 56 to 78 percentage points in women and from 43 to 71 percentage points in men. 'Our findings suggest there is an increasing share of people with diabetes, especially with untreated diabetes, living in low- and middle-income countries. In 2022, only 5-10% of adults with diabetes in some sub-Saharan Africa countries received treatment for diabetes, leaving a huge number at risk of the serious health complications.' said Professor Jean Claude Mbanya, University of Yaoundé 1, Cameroon. Status in India, China Pakistan, Indonesia and USA In 2022, almost one third (133 million, 30%) of the 445 million adults aged 30 years or older with untreated diabetes lived in India, more than 50% greater than the next largest number which was in China (78 million) because treatment coverage was higher in China (45% for women and 41% for men) than in India (28% for women and 29% for men). Similarly, Pakistan (24 million) and Indonesia (18 million), the next two countries with the largest number of untreated diabetes, surpassed the USA (13 million), which had higher treatment coverage (65% for women and 67% for men). The information provided in this unique study will be very useful for public health authorities, particularly in 'low and middle-income countries' (LMIC) in using their limited resources more effectively. Government must organize massive, well planned public education programmes, at all levels, with the support and cooperation of NGOs, religious groups and community leaders among others to arrest the Unbelievable Benefits of Eating Family Meals Together at Home Among the benefits of eating family meals together at home are Lower rates of obesity, overweight and eating disorders. Better nutrition and knowledge about a variety of healthy foods. Can we ignore the elephant in the room? Uncontrolled sugar intake Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in its latest guidelines advise limiting added sugar to 25 g per day or even eliminating it from the diet as it adds no nutritive value to the food other than calories. The normal intake is higher. For children aged 2 to 19 years, the dietary guidelines for Americans for 2020-2025 prescribe 12 teaspoons (50g) of added sugar from both food and beverages. For kids and young adults (2–19 years old), the average daily consumption of added sugars was already 17 teaspoons in 2017–2018. Excess sugar intake at this age can have a profound adverse impact. As a first step, parents should read the labels on packed foodstuffs to estimate the amount of sugar their children consume daily. Family dinners taken together at home will help in reducing excess sugar intake. Family Dinnner Projects (FDP’s) constant advocacy of what is good will inspire the participants. They will not ignore this elephant (excess sugar intake) in the room	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRY-a1IJ0ETa2	2024-11-14T09:48:23-08:00	
Donald Trump’s Victory: A New Global Reality – Analysis	With a calm, exhausted tone and in words that, for the first time, lacked the harsh bitterness marking his speeches of the past four years, Donald Trump (R) addressed a small audience in Florida on the night of 5–6 November 2024. Announcing his victory in the U.S. election, he declared, 'We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing. Look what happened—is this crazy?' It appears he has indeed accomplished something remarkable. According to the final electoral vote results, Trump secured 312 votes, while Kamala Harris (D) received 226. From a former president pursued by numerous legal cases that could land him in prison, who survived two assassination attempts, and who faced a strong and highly organised Democratic opponent wielding considerable power and with a larger campaign budget, along with various polls predicting he would place second in the race, Trump emerged as the victor. Donald Trump defied television networks, newspapers, and polling institutions that forecasted a close presidential race, clinching a decisive victory for his second term as President of the United States. On 5 November, he ascended to the world’s most powerful position, becoming the next President of the United States. Trump’s victory was both decisive and impressive, with a lead of more than four million votes over his opponent, Kamala Harris. He won more than 74 million votes, compared to 70 million for his Democratic rival. The significance of Trump’s presidential victory was further amplified by the Republican Party’s success over the Democrats in the Senate, with a 53/46 margin, and in the House of Representatives, with a count of 212 to 200. This means that Republicans now have complete control over the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, allowing them to implement their policies, particularly domestically. These include providing tax cuts to stimulate the economy, imposing high tariffs on imports—especially from China—and continuing construction of the wall on the southern border with Mexico to curb illegal immigration. The economy and immigration were the main pillars of the Republican presidential and congressional campaign, with much of Trump’s rhetoric centred on connecting the two, as the economy was seen as the primary factor behind his Democratic opponent’s failure in leadership, driving voters towards the Republicans. At 78, Trump has become the oldest candidate ever elected to the presidency, breaking the record previously held by Joseph Biden. Now the 47th U.S. president, Trump returns to office four years after serving as the 45th president, becoming only the second president in American history, after Grover Cleveland, to serve two non-consecutive terms[2] . While the Republican campaign centred heavily on domestic policy, offering extensive details and information, many unknowns remain regarding foreign policy issues. This topic was always addressed only in passing or with rhetorical statements, such as Trump’s frequent claim that he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours and his recent pledge to Arab-American voters in Michigan, promising 'peace over there in the Middle East' but without clarifying how this would be achieved. Despite the scarcity of information and plans, some aspects of Trump’s foreign policy can be anticipated based on his previous term as president from 2016 to 2020. Why did Kamala Harris lose the U.S. election? The defeat of the sitting U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris by Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election is sure to be remembered and discussed for years to come. The topic is expected to generate numerous books, as well as a wealth of academic and expert discussions, with media analysts in particular examining data from various pre-election polls. Although Harris began her campaign on a strong note, she struggled to connect with voters through her speeches, much like Hillary Clinton (D) in 2016. She spent most of her time attempting to convince voters that Trump was unfit for office but struggled to clearly explain why she herself was the better choice. Jason Miller, Trump’s campaign manager and communications strategist, highlighted what he described as a turning point in the election race. This shift came after several weeks in which polls favoured Harris. Miller noted that Harris’s campaign truly started to unravel after her awkward response to a straightforward question from Sunny Hostin, host of 'The View,' on 8 October: 'Would you have done anything differently than Biden over the past four years?' Clearly flustered, Harris replied, 'Nothing comes to mind,' which sent her advisers into a panic and prompted a wave of online ridicule from Trump supporters. Harris faced an almost insurmountable challenge in trying to counter the steep decline in approval ratings and growing dissatisfaction with Biden, as roughly two-thirds of voters believed the country was heading in the wrong direction. Throughout 2024, Biden and prominent members of his party were convinced he merited a second term due to his impressive political career. Following the 2022 U.S. Midterm elections, in which the Democrats performed far better than expected—largely credited to an anti-Trump sentiment—Biden seemed overly self-assured. When journalists asked him the day after the election what he might do differently to address voter concerns about the economy and the prevailing sense that the country was on the wrong track, he simply replied, 'Nothing.' After Biden’s prolonged delay in withdrawing his candidacy, Harris was thrust from behind the scenes into the spotlight, with only three months to promote herself. By contrast, Trump had spent eight years shaping his public image, including his four years in office, followed by four years of relentless self-promotion. Amid rising inflation and two major wars—in Europe and the Middle East—many voters looked back nostalgically to the pre-pandemic period, which, under Trump, had experienced relative economic stability and growth. Following his decisive victory for the Republican Party’s nomination, even those who had previously opposed him resigned themselves to the reality and embraced his narrative. Meanwhile, the public and Trump’s supporters had become accustomed to a steady stream of negative news about him, blunting the impact of many of the allegations made against him. For many, it was of little consequence that he faced 91 criminal charges, with 34 convictions and a ruling holding him liable in a sexual assault case. Instead, his derogatory labels for Harris—like 'low IQ,', 'crazy Kamala,' and 'Comrade Kamala'—struck a chord and captured the attention of a large segment of voters. The political landscape in 2024 was primed for Trump’s return. Voter sentiment had shifted in ways that Harris’s campaign team didn’t fully grasp—for instance, cultural issues now held far greater importance than they had for decades, possibly even overshadowing economic concerns in their impact. In other words, the progressive issues that had permeated the Democratic Party, referred to as the 'woke era'[3], proved disastrous to Harris’s campaign, particularly as Trump and the Republicans managed to frame them as a far-left agenda, disconnected from the concerns of the average voter. As Harris lost support among certain social groups traditionally loyal to the Democrats, such as Arabs, Muslims, and young Black Americans, Trump played on exaggerated fears of migrants and focused on what he viewed as the average American’s main concern — the economy, in line with the catchphrase from President Bill Clinton’s era, 'It’s the economy, stupid!'[4]. High inflation rates (9.59% in 2022, 4.06% in 2023, and 3.1% in 2024)[5] eroded the real value of income for the vast majority of citizens, especially those in rural areas outside major urban centres. Trump’s approach was rooted in isolationism, flat tariffs and fiscal adjustments, promising to revive the economy through protectionist policies reminiscent of 19th-century practices. These policies would undermine the foundations of capitalism, which has long been a driving force of the United States. He also vowed to dismantle the structure of the current American system according to the conservative 'Project 2025' agenda. This message resonated with tens of millions of voters who have seen the 'American Dream' of prosperity collapse, while extreme wealth accumulates in the hands of the ruling class, the expert class, and elites who control the government for their own benefit. What will foreign policy look like in the Trump-2 era? Trump’s triumphant return appears to be reigniting a period of uncertainty, not only within a deeply divided American society but also on the global stage. During his first term (2016–2020), his actions were hard to anticipate due to his distinct personal style, unconventional proposals, and unusual relationships with leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and other authoritarian figures worldwide. Today, despite having had four years of experience with him in power and another four watching him prepare for a comeback, uncertainty around his foreign policy prevails. There’s little doubt that many outside the United States—from Beijing and Moscow to Brussels (EU), Tehran, and Tel Aviv—are attempting to anticipate the shape of the new administration’s policies and the extent to which it might seek to change the rules of engagement between the United States and the rest of the world. What is clear is that Trump does not trust the current state administration managing U.S. interests and will appoint a cadre of loyal supporters to influential positions, individuals who will act on his whims without regard for the consequences. When American voters chose Trump for president in 2016, U.S. allies responded with various 'hedging strategies'[6] for self-protection. This time, however, it seems they are in a far weaker position than they were a decade ago. Allies are likely to try to curry favour with him, offering concessions as a means of survival much as they did during his first term. Trump is expected to continue and expand his strategy of leveraging pressure on U.S. allies through diplomacy—a strategy that, at best, will yield superficial cooperation while leaving structural issues unaddressed. EU braces for potential new U.S. tariffs and duties The European Union (EU) faces the possibility that Trump will impose a set of additional taxes and tariffs on European exports to the U.S., a campaign promise that could threaten the already fragile European economy, strained by recession and inflation. Rather than issuing threats of counter-tariffs, the EU is now attempting to appease Trump by proposing certain trade agreements that might dissuade him from introducing the anticipated duties. It is unclear how China might respond to such a policy, as Trump may opt for a combination of tariffs and military posturing rather than direct conflict, given the interdependence of the Chinese and American economies. On the other hand, Trump has publicly criticised President Joseph Biden’s administration’s policy on Ukraine, pledging to push for an end to the war there immediately following his election—even before taking office on 20 January of the coming year. The president has expressed doubts about the necessity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has provided security for America’s allies since the end of World War II, preferring instead that they pay for the costs of American protection. Policy toward China and Iran The return of former U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House could signal tougher enforcement of American oil sanctions against Iran, potentially reducing global supply and introducing geopolitical risks by challenging China, Iran’s largest oil importer. Tough sanctions on Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), could drive up global oil prices. However, this situation might be mitigated by other Trump measures, such as promoting domestic oil production, imposing tariffs on China to curb its economic activities, or softening relations with Russia, potentially allowing for increased Russian crude oil shipments. A return to Trump’s 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran might cut Iranian crude oil exports by one million barrels a day. This could be implemented relatively quickly and without additional legislation, merely through the enforcement of existing sanctions. A tougher stance on Iran also translates to indirect but strict measures aimed at China, which does not recognise U.S. sanctions and remains the largest importer of Iranian oil. Trump has threatened to act on his campaign promises by imposing sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to shield American industry, with rates as high as 60%. In response, China might deepen its engagement with the BRICS bloc, which aims to become an Eastern alternative to the Western G7. China may also begin reducing its reliance on the dollar in oil and other commodity transactions. Trump is aware that such an aggressive sanctions policy poses a serious risk to the dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency. On 5 September 2024, at the Economic Club of New York, Trump discussed the potential risks that sanctions pose to the dominance of the U.S. dollar. He stated, 'So I use sanctions very powerfully against countries that deserve it, and then I take them off. Because look, you’re losing Iran, you’re losing Russia.' He further elaborated, 'I was a user of sanctions, but I put them on and take them off as quickly as possible because, ultimately, it kills your dollar and it kills everything the dollar represents.'[7] China and Iran have created a trading system that relies mostly on the Chinese yuan and a network of intermediaries to bypass the dollar and American regulators, complicating the enforcement of sanctions. Trump may also ease sanctions on Russia’s energy sector, which Western nations imposed in response to Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. He is expected to gradually lift all sanctions on Russia’s oil industry. Policy on the Middle East During his election campaign, Trump took a calmer and more pragmatic tone when discussing the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and the broader Middle East situation, in contrast to the Democratic camp, whose positions on various issues appeared vague or confusing, especially regarding the Palestinian question, pro-Iranian militias in Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, as well as relations with Afghanistan. Judging by his first term in office, it is expected that President Trump will likely prioritise the Middle East once again. In his first term, Trump made history by choosing Saudi Arabia as his first foreign visit and recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. On the Palestinian issue, he sought to mediate the 'deal of the century'[8] between Israelis and Palestinians and reinforced Israel’s regional ties with some Arab nations, such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan, where diplomatic relations were established. Is Trump planning to unseat Netanyahu? Regarding his stance toward the current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, prominent Israeli economist and political advisor Eran Yashiv believes that Trump will aim to remove Netanyahu from power at the first opportunity, despite their prior friendship. According to Yashiv, Trump is likely to work toward Netanyahu’s ouster sooner or later. According to this Israeli researcher, Trump’s stance is driven by two economic motives. First, he feels that Netanyahu’s policies come at a high price. Israel received roughly $18 billion in U.S. military aid last year, and Trump has expressed his reluctance to spend American funds either on Ukraine or Israel, stating that continued financial commitments in the Middle East are not on the agenda. The second reason is his desire for Israel to reach an agreement with Saudi Arabia under the 2020 Abraham Accords[9], with Saudi Arabia’s prerequisite for such a deal being the establishment of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu and his right-wing allies oppose this, which would prompt the Saudis to demand Netanyahu’s removal. Some analysts describe Netanyahu’s relationship with Trump as complicated. Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat in New York and writer, believes that Netanyahu is somewhat wary of Trump, 'He thinks he can manipulate him, but is afraid that if Trump realises this, he could get very angry—unlike Biden, who, for some reason, never pressured him or resisted his manipulations.' There is no doubt that the Middle East will be a focal point for the new U.S. administration. The rest of the world awaits in apprehension, anticipation, and patience Donald Trump’s electoral victory heralds a wave of sudden shifts in U.S. foreign policy. The newly elected president is expected to bring back the defining features of his first term: a trade war with China, deep scepticism—bordering on hostility—toward multilateralism, an affinity for powerful leaders, a style that defies diplomatic norms and standards, and an inclination for improvisational posts on his Truth Social platform. Trump’s advisors say, 'His ‘peace through strength’ approach is exactly what the country needs in this critical moment.' Trump has been given a mandate by the American people to change the course of U.S. foreign policy, and there is little doubt that this time he feels more assured in pursuing his bold and sometimes volatile ambitions. With his unique vision and unconventional style, Trump may well achieve a great deal. However, if he succeeds in restoring the United States to 'greatness,' true to his slogan 'Make America Great Again,' this greatness will inevitably come at a high cost to international relations. Until he officially takes the keys to the White House early next year, the rest of the world can only wait in apprehension, anticipation, and patience.

Maldives’ Suggests New Financial And Trade Instruments To Help SI...	At COP29, President Mohamed Muizzu spoke as a representative of a country most threatened by climate change At the COP29 summit held in Baku, Azerbaijan on November 13, a grim picture of the effects of climate change emerged. As the delegates shared their thoughts, scientists said that despite all the talk about mitigating climate change, another bump upward had occurred in greenhouse gas emissions. Euro News said that in 2024, the world is on track to put 37.4 billion metric tonnes of the main heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere. It's a 0.8% increase from 2023. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant and prevalent 'greenhouse gas' emitted by human activity. While carbon dioxide is essential for keeping the Earth's surface temperature above freezing, more of it intensifies the 'greenhouse effect' which is a rise in global temperatures. Once emitted, carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for thousands of years, with 40% remaining after 100 years. Methane is another powerful but shorter-lasting greenhouse gas. Methane is the main component of natural gas. In the first two decades after it's released, methane is more than 80 times more effective at warming the climate system than carbon dioxide. In 2023, both carbon dioxide and methane levels in the atmosphere reached record highs. The global concentration of carbon dioxide rose to an average of 419 parts per million in the atmosphere and Methane rose to an average of 1922 parts per billion. UN reports say the globe must cut emissions by 42% by 2030 to be in with a chance of limiting warming to the internationally agreed-upon threshold of 1.5 Celsius or the limit agreed to at the 2015 climate talks in Paris. Marginal Gains This year's pollution increase isn't quite as large as last year's 1.4% jump, scientists said while presenting the data at the UN climate talks in Azerbaijan (COP29). There is still no sign that the world has reached a peak in fossil fuel CO2 emissions. The world still has six years before passing 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Earth is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius, according a United Nations study. Therefore, countries are clearly not doing enough on a global scale to reduce emissions, said Mike O'Sullivan, a University of Exeter climate scientist. 'We need to massively increase ambition and actually just think outside the box of how we can change things, not be so tied to fossil fuel interests,' he urged. Biggest Carbon Emitters According to the Global Carbon Project team, the four biggest carbon emitters are China, the United States, India and Europe. China is the world's biggest annual carbon polluting nation with 32% of the emissions. India accounts for 7%. India's carbon pollution jumped by 4.6% in 2024. The US was responsible for 13% globe's carbon dioxide in 2024. Europe accounted for 7% of the world's carbon pollution However, China's emission could drop to zero in the next two months and is 'basically flat,' O'Sullivan said. Carbon emissions dropped in both the United States and the European Union. They fell 0.6% in the US mostly from reduced coal, oil and cement use. . Europe saw its carbon dioxide output drop 3.8% from last year - driven by a big cut in coal emissions. Urgency in Maldives One of the most threatened by climate change is Maldives. It is also the world's lowest lying country. The highest natural point is just 2.4 meters above sea level. Today, one of the main problems for Maldivians is water. And it is likely to get worse with climate change. While the Northern islands face drinking water shortages during the dry season, from April to May, most Southern islands face a different problem: flooding. The UNDP is supporting Maldives, to ensure that most vulnerable islands have year-round access to potable water and that they can cope with floods on their own. Nearly half of its population lives in Male, the capital, which is less than 1.4 sq,km. The rest is spread over 186 small, scattered islands. There are no rivers or streams on any of the islands. Except for Malé and a handful of other islands, most islands rely on rain for drinking water. Islands affected by floods and shortages of potable water receive relief from the capital island Malé. Transportation costs are high with the Maldives scattered geography. This makes emergency relief very expensive for a government already struggling economically. The danger is that climate change is expected to bring stronger storms, and longer periods without rainfall. A rise in the ocean's temperature and acidification has had devastating effects on coral reefs, affecting tourism and fisheries, both critical to the livelihoods of most Maldivians. Damaged reefs also function less effectively as a first line of defence against sea swells and flooding. Until the 1990s, Maldivians used groundwater for drinking. But over the past decade, the groundwater of most islands got contaminated. The freshwater lenses of most islands was badly affected by the Tsunami of 2004 and poorly planned urbanization. As a result, today, rainwater, together with water produced using desalination and expensive bottled water are the only potable water options. In the past ten years, the National Disasters Management Center in Malé had to send emergency shipments of water to about half of the 186 inhabited islands during the dry season. An expensive solution that sometimes can take up to two weeks to arrive. Most households have one tank of 2500L and fill it by collecting rain from their roofs. Bigger families might even have 2 or 3 tanks, since one is not enough for them to make it through the dry season. Biosphere Reserve UNESCO has designated certain areas as biosphere reserves. This designation sets up a 'learning place for sustainable development,' a site for testing approaches on how to sustainably manage natural systems that conserve biodiversity and manage and mitigate climate change impacts on local economies. In 2011, UNESCO designated Baa Atoll, in central-western Maldives, as a biosphere reserve. Comprising 75 islands inhabited by 12,000 people dependent on tourism and fisheries, it supports one of the largest groups of coral reefs in the Indian Ocean, which act as a conduit for the transport of 'plankton' necessary for biodiversity to thrive and to reduce the effect of waves and storm surges. Plankton are tiny organisms that float in water and are carried by tides and currents. Plankton are important for the health of the ocean and play a big role in the marine food chain. Since this designation as biosphere, Baa Atoll's sustainable ecotourism tourism industry has bloomed, hosting more than 350,000 tourists annually pre-COVID. USAID helped assess ecologically sensitive areas and the recovery potential of coral reef ecosystems. To improve climate resilience, USAID supported government efforts to develop a management plan for one of the largest and biologically diverse marine-protected areas in Maldives. Maldives' Suggestions at COP29 At the Leaders' Summit of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) on Climate Change, held at Baku in Azerbaijan on November 13, the Maldivian President Dr. Mohamed Muizzu emphasized that the current financial system does not provide SIDS with the necessary resources to address climate impacts, rendering their ambitious climate goals difficult to achieve. He outlined three major issues for action to reshape the global financial architecture to better support SIDS. Addressing climate change requires a coordinated support from various key players—including the UN, multilateral development banks, international financial institutions, and the private sector. The Maldivian President said that traditional lending and debt models need rethinking. He proposed the concept of linking 'debt forgiveness to the achievement of specific climate resilience milestones.' For example, a SIDS might see a portion of its debt forgiven if it reaches certain adaptation or emissions-reduction targets. This approach could provide immediate financial relief and an incentive for SIDS to pursue climate goals, especially since high debt levels often prevent these nations from making necessary investments in resilience, Dr. Muizzu said. He also called for a redefinition of creditworthiness, where a nation's climate resilience efforts factor positively into its ability to secure funding, rather than relying solely on traditional economic indicators. Dr. Muizzu urged COP29 to establish a new, more realistic climate finance goal that reflects the actual needs of SIDS. Current climate finance mechanisms often fall short in addressing the scale of funding required by SIDS to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, he pointed out. He sought discussions on establishing a 'comprehensive international carbon market mechanism', a platform that could allow countries to trade emissions reductions or offsets. 'Such a system, if well designed, could generate additional financial resources for SIDS and provide a new revenue stream for climate adaptation and mitigation efforts,' Dr. Muizzu said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRYtT_UQUxJ59	2024-11-14T09:44:44-08:00	
Shaping Outcomes: How Perspective Drives Decision-Making In Negot...	In negotiation and diplomacy, perspective is a defining factor that shapes how decisions are made, options are evaluated, and outcomes are reached. Perspective—the unique lens through which individuals and nations view their interests, intentions, and interactions—plays a crucial role in influencing the positions diplomats take, the strategies they adopt, and the compromises they are willing to make. In an interconnected world where power dynamics and cultural diversity are key elements, understanding perspective is essential for navigating complex diplomatic landscapes and reaching durable agreements. This article explores how perspective shapes decision-making in negotiation and diplomacy, affecting everything from goal-setting to conflict resolution. The Nature of Perspective in Diplomacy and Negotiation 1. Defining Perspective in Diplomacy Perspective in diplomacy refers to the subjective outlook that countries and their representatives hold toward international issues, shaped by national interests, historical experiences, cultural values, and geopolitical priorities. Each nation approaches diplomacy with its own 'worldview,' influencing not only what it aims to achieve but also how it interprets the motivations and actions of other countries. Perspective determines what each party values and fears, often revealing as much about a country's underlying priorities as about the immediate stakes of a negotiation. 2. Perspective as a Framework for Decision-Making Perspective offers a cognitive framework for understanding the negotiation process. It allows diplomats and negotiators to classify issues as more or less important, identify allies or adversaries, and distinguish between acceptable compromises and unacceptable risks. This framework serves as a guide, steering decision-making in ways that reflect a nation's overarching goals and limiting the possibilities for alternative interpretations or concessions. Influence of Perspective on Goal-Setting and Strategic Priorities 1. National Interests and Diplomatic Goals The priorities of a nation are largely influenced by perspective, which defines what it considers to be its national interests. For example, a realist perspective, which views power and security as paramount, might lead a country to prioritize military alliances and security commitments in negotiations. In contrast, a liberal perspective, which values cooperation and interdependence, might encourage a nation to seek multilateral agreements and partnerships that promote collective welfare. These differing perspectives shape the diplomatic goals that nations set for themselves, ultimately guiding the overall direction of negotiations. 2. Shaping Strategic Priorities Perspective affects how countries rank issues, determining which elements of a negotiation are viewed as 'core interests' and which are secondary. During trade negotiations, for instance, a country whose perspective emphasizes economic independence may resist agreements that reduce tariffs on certain sectors, while a nation with a more globalist perspective may prioritize access to foreign markets over domestic protections. In setting these priorities, nations often reinforce their perspective on a larger scale, emphasizing their long-term interests and establishing their values as a key component of their negotiation stance. The Role of Perspective in Defining Negotiation Tactics 1. Formulating Negotiation Positions Perspective influences the stances that diplomats take in negotiations, determining how strongly they push for certain terms and where they might be willing to compromise. A nation that views itself as a regional power, for instance, may adopt a more assertive negotiation style, seeking terms that affirm its influence. Conversely, a country with a perspective that emphasizes diplomatic cooperation may be more inclined to adopt conciliatory tactics. Perspective-driven negotiation positions can either facilitate agreement or create impasses, depending on how compatible they are with the perspectives of other parties. 2. Determining Bargaining Behavior Perspective also influences bargaining behavior, including how diplomats communicate their positions, the concessions they are willing to make, and the red lines they refuse to cross. For instance, nations with a zero-sum perspective on resources may employ hardline tactics, viewing any concession as a potential loss. In contrast, countries that prioritize long-term diplomatic relations might adopt a 'win-win' approach, using collaborative tactics and emphasizing mutual benefits. The chosen bargaining behavior, shaped by perspective, impacts not only the tone of negotiations but also the likelihood of reaching a consensus. Perspective as a Tool for Conflict Resolution 1. Understanding Opponents' Perspectives Conflict resolution in diplomacy often depends on the ability to understand the perspective of opposing parties. By recognizing the values, motivations, and fears that drive the other side, diplomats can craft solutions that address these concerns, even if they do not fully align with their own perspective. This empathetic approach can reduce misunderstandings, ease tensions, and lead to compromises that satisfy all parties' core interests. For example, in peace negotiations, understanding each faction's perspective on sovereignty, autonomy, or security can facilitate agreements that recognize these interests without violating fundamental values. 2. Reframing Issues to Align Perspectives In some cases, conflict resolution requires reframing issues so that they align more closely with each party's perspective. During the Paris Climate Agreement negotiations, for instance, developed and developing nations held different perspectives on responsibility and burden-sharing. By framing the agreement as a global effort where all parties contributed according to their capacity, negotiators were able to accommodate these varying perspectives and reach a landmark accord. Such reframing helps bridge divides, creating common ground even when initial perspectives are divergent. Challenges of Perspective in International Negotiations 1. Perspective as a Barrier to Consensus While perspective is crucial for understanding, it can also become a barrier when parties hold rigid, incompatible views. For example, in nuclear non-proliferation negotiations, countries like the United States and North Korea often adopt opposing perspectives on security and sovereignty. These clashing perspectives make consensus challenging, as each side interprets the other's actions through a distrustful lens, leading to a stalemate. Overcoming such barriers requires a willingness to shift perspectives, which is difficult in high-stakes issues with deep-rooted distrust. 2. Risk of Misinterpretation Perspectives can lead to misunderstandings when parties misinterpret each other's intentions or actions. Cultural perspectives, in particular, shape how communication styles, gestures, and negotiation tactics are perceived. For instance, in East Asian diplomacy, indirect communication is often valued, while Western negotiators may interpret such behavior as evasive or noncommittal. Misinterpretations rooted in perspective differences can derail negotiations, prompting parties to adopt positions based on assumptions rather than facts. 3. Balancing National and Global Perspectives Global challenges like climate change and pandemics demand a shared perspective, yet national perspectives can lead to conflicting priorities. In the case of global climate agreements, countries have struggled to balance their perspective on economic development with the need for environmental sustainability. Nations like India and China, whose perspectives prioritize economic growth to alleviate poverty, often find it challenging to commit to the same emissions targets as developed nations. Balancing these perspectives to reach a common goal remains one of the greatest challenges in multilateral diplomacy. Perspective and the Evolution of Diplomatic Strategies 1. Adaptive Diplomacy and Shifting Perspectives In a world where international issues are increasingly complex, adaptive diplomacy—shifting perspectives based on changing circumstances—has become essential. Nations that adapt their perspectives, such as those that integrate economic growth with environmental responsibility, are better positioned to address evolving global issues. By broadening their perspective, countries can engage in more flexible negotiations, allowing them to work with diverse partners and tackle multifaceted problems effectively. 2. Perspective as a Means of Building Trust Trust-building often depends on the ability to demonstrate an understanding and respect for other parties' perspectives. In negotiations involving historical tensions, showing empathy for an adversary's viewpoint can build rapport and lay the groundwork for future cooperation. For example, U.S. negotiations with former adversaries like Vietnam have evolved from contentious to cooperative, in part due to a shift in perspective that acknowledges past grievances and focuses on common interests. By aligning perspectives, diplomats can strengthen relationships and facilitate sustainable partnerships. 3. Developing a Global Perspective for Sustainable Outcomes As global challenges demand greater cooperation, developing a 'global perspective' that transcends national boundaries is increasingly vital. This perspective emphasizes collective responsibility, long-term vision, and the interconnectedness of nations. In negotiations on climate policy, pandemic preparedness, and human rights, a global perspective encourages countries to consider how their actions affect the international community. Adopting such a perspective allows for solutions that benefit all parties and reinforce the stability of the global system. Conclusion Perspective is more than a mere lens in negotiation and diplomacy—it is an active, influential force that drives decision-making, defines priorities, and shapes diplomatic outcomes. Nations approach international negotiations with perspectives rooted in their cultural, historical, and strategic values, guiding their goals and tactics. However, the dominance of particular perspectives can create barriers and conflicts that complicate consensus. As diplomacy becomes increasingly complex in a multipolar world, adaptive and empathetic approaches to perspective are essential for reaching enduring solutions. Developing a more global perspective that values shared interests and cooperation will be key to addressing the pressing challenges of our interconnected world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRdNrfgDu0Uzz	2024-11-14T09:42:59-08:00	
NATO Secretary General Attends Exercise Resolute Warrior In Latvi...	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Latvia on Thursday (14 November 2024) to observe Exercise Resolute Warrior 24, and to meet with President Edgars Rinkēvičs and Prime Minister ​Evika Silina. Involving more than 3,500 Allied troops, Resolute Warrior 24 marks the first major field war-fighting exercise for the NATO Multinational Brigade in Latvia. The Canadian-led brigade includes personnel from twelve other Allies and is part of NATO’s strengthened defence posture on the eastern flank. During his visit to Ādaži Military Base, the Secretary General said that exercises such as Resolute Warrior, 'give our forces experience of working together.' He added that such intense training, 'will make us more prepared to deter any aggression, and demonstrate our ability to defend all Allies.' During a press conference alongside President Rinkēvičs, Mr Rutte highlighted that Latvia spends more than 3% of its GDP on defence and supports Ukraine 'with military equipment, ammunition and training'. He called for more Allied support for Ukraine, including air and missile defence, to protect critical infrastructure during the winter season. Enhanced Forward Presence battlegroups and exercises like Resolute Warrior serve as critical elements of NATO’s reinforced deterrence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRZ7XZWGWhlJv	2024-11-14T09:40:31-08:00	
The Role Of Psychology And Psychoanalysis In Diplomacy And Negoti...	In diplomacy and negotiation, where power dynamics, cultural sensitivities, and high-stakes decision-making converge, psychological insights can be transformative. Diplomats and negotiators engage in complex interactions that require not only a strategic understanding of objectives but also a deep comprehension of human emotions, motivations, and cognitive patterns. Over recent decades, the fields of psychology and psychoanalysis have contributed substantially to diplomacy, shedding light on how psychological factors such as empathy, unconscious biases, defense mechanisms, and emotional regulation can influence negotiation outcomes. These insights enable diplomats to navigate more effectively through conflicts, bridge divides, and foster cooperation. This feature article explores how psychology and psychoanalysis enhance diplomacy and negotiation. It covers various dimensions, from understanding cognitive biases to managing emotions, building trust, and employing psychoanalytic tools to interpret deeper motivations. By integrating these approaches, diplomats and negotiators can achieve more constructive and enduring results in their engagements. 1. The Intersection of Psychology and Diplomacy Historically, diplomacy has often been analyzed from a political or strategic perspective, focusing on national interests, alliances, and power balances. Yet, human factors are at the heart of all diplomatic efforts. Diplomacy involves communication, persuasion, and compromise—tasks inherently influenced by psychological factors. Psychology offers insights into how individual personalities, emotional reactions, and social dynamics shape diplomatic interactions. Psychoanalysis, with its focus on unconscious motivations and defense mechanisms, goes a step further by exploring the hidden aspects of human behavior that impact decision-making. Understanding unconscious influences, such as projection, denial, or displacement, can provide diplomats with a more profound understanding of how unresolved personal or historical traumas might be affecting negotiations. By recognizing and managing these factors, diplomats can better anticipate potential roadblocks and tailor their strategies to foster cooperation. 2. Cognitive Biases and Their Impact on Diplomacy Cognitive biases—systematic patterns of deviation from rationality—play a crucial role in diplomacy and negotiation, often leading to misunderstandings or suboptimal decisions. Psychologists have identified various biases that can affect diplomats, including the following. Confirmation Bias Diplomats, like all people, may interpret information in ways that confirm their existing beliefs. This bias can lead negotiators to ignore important data that contradicts their assumptions. In high-stakes negotiations, confirmation bias may prevent diplomats from fully considering alternative viewpoints, thereby hampering compromise and conflict resolution. Attribution Bias Attribution bias can distort how diplomats interpret each other's actions. For example, they may attribute their adversary's behavior to inherent aggressiveness while viewing their own behavior as purely defensive. This mutual misperception can escalate tensions, making it difficult for diplomats to empathize with the other side and increasing the risk of conflict. Anchoring Bias Anchoring occurs when individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter. In diplomacy, anchoring can influence how initial offers or positions are perceived and lead to a narrow focus on early assumptions. Awareness of anchoring bias enables diplomats to remain open to alternative solutions rather than becoming rigidly fixed on initial terms.Understanding these biases helps diplomats recognize when they might be falling into psychological traps, allowing for more rational, open-minded, and flexible negotiations. This self-awareness can reduce misunderstandings and contribute to more balanced and fair agreements. 3. Empathy as a Diplomatic Tool Empathy—the ability to understand and share the feelings of others—is a cornerstone of effective diplomacy. By empathizing with counterparts, diplomats can better understand their motivations, fears, and priorities, which is essential for finding common ground. Building Trust and Rapport Empathy enables diplomats to build trust, which is often the foundation for successful negotiations. Trust is not only about transparency but also about genuinely acknowledging and addressing the concerns of the other party. Empathetic listening can validate the feelings of all parties involved, making them feel understood and reducing defensive reactions. Defusing Hostility Empathy can help de-escalate tension in contentious negotiations. When diplomats take the time to see an issue from their counterpart's perspective, they are more likely to frame their arguments in a way that reduces hostility. For example, instead of focusing on accusations, they may focus on shared concerns or mutual benefits. Humanizing Opponents In conflicts, opponents are often dehumanized or reduced to stereotypes, which can fuel aggression and inhibit peace efforts. Empathy allows diplomats to humanize their counterparts, understanding them as complex individuals with legitimate concerns. This can be particularly useful in post-conflict settings, where long-standing animosities may persist despite formal agreements.Incorporating empathy into diplomatic practices doesn't mean compromising one's position; instead, it enhances the ability to communicate persuasively and negotiate with greater awareness of psychological dynamics. 4. Emotional Regulation in High-Stakes Negotiations Negotiations can be emotionally intense, particularly when issues of national pride, security, or historical grievances are at stake. The ability to regulate one's emotions is critical for diplomats, who must maintain composure and think clearly, even in stressful situations. Psychological techniques can help diplomats manage their emotional responses, enabling them to stay focused and objective. Mindfulness and Stress Management Mindfulness practices, such as deep breathing, visualization, or progressive relaxation, can help diplomats stay calm under pressure. These techniques allow diplomats to maintain a clear mind and prevent emotional reactions from overshadowing rational thinking. In recent years, some foreign ministries have incorporated mindfulness training to help diplomats cope with the emotional demands of their roles. Emotional Intelligence Emotional intelligence (EI)—the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions and empathize with others—is a valuable skill in diplomacy. High EI allows diplomats to recognize and interpret emotional cues, which can help them adjust their strategies accordingly. For example, a diplomat with high EI might detect signs of frustration or impatience in their counterpart and adjust the pace of the negotiation to prevent escalation. Recognizing and Addressing Emotional Triggers Through psychological training, diplomats can identify their emotional triggers and learn to respond in measured ways. For instance, a diplomat who becomes easily frustrated by perceived disrespect might learn to reframe such interactions, focusing on the overall goal of the negotiation rather than reacting impulsively. Emotionally regulated diplomats are more effective in managing the challenges of negotiation, as they can keep their focus on long-term goals rather than short-term frustrations. 5. Psychoanalytic Approaches to Unconscious Motivations in Diplomacy Psychoanalysis brings a unique perspective to diplomacy by exploring the unconscious motivations and defense mechanisms that influence individual and collective behaviors. This approach can be particularly insightful when dealing with historical grievances, intergenerational traumas, or deeply rooted ideological conflicts. Projection and Scapegoating In some diplomatic conflicts, projection—a defense mechanism in which one attributes one's unwanted feelings or traits onto others—can lead to scapegoating. For example, a state may project its own internal problems onto an external enemy, escalating hostility and justifying aggressive policies. Psychoanalytic techniques can help diplomats recognize when projection is at play, making it possible to address underlying issues more constructively. Understanding Historical Traumas Nations, like individuals, can carry psychological scars from past traumas, such as colonialism, occupation, or genocide. These traumas can influence current diplomatic behavior, leading to hyper-sensitivity or hostility in certain contexts. By understanding how historical trauma shapes national identity and foreign policy, diplomats can avoid triggering emotional reactions and approach negotiations with greater sensitivity. Transference and Countertransference Transference occurs when individuals project feelings associated with past relationships onto current interactions. In diplomacy, this might manifest as a diplomat viewing a counterpart as an 'enemy' based on past conflicts, even if the situation has changed. Conversely, countertransference refers to the diplomat's own emotional reactions to the counterpart, which may influence their negotiation style. Recognizing these dynamics allows diplomats to separate past grievances from present realities, creating a more neutral space for dialogue. Psychoanalysis encourages diplomats to consider not only the visible aspects of negotiations but also the unseen psychological factors that shape diplomatic interactions. This deeper awareness can prevent misunderstandings and foster genuine resolutions. 6. Utilizing Psychological Insights in Cross-Cultural Diplomacy Diplomacy often involves navigating cultural differences that influence communication styles, attitudes toward authority, and concepts of honor. Psychological insights into cultural psychology and cross-cultural communication can enhance diplomats' effectiveness in diverse settings. Cultural Sensitivity and Adaptive Communication Psychology offers tools for understanding cultural dimensions, such as individualism vs. collectivism or high vs. low power distance, which affect diplomatic interactions. In some cultures, indirect communication and subtlety are valued, while others prioritize directness and clarity. A diplomat aware of these differences can tailor their communication to avoid unintentional offense and build rapport. Avoiding Stereotyping Cultural psychology helps diplomats avoid stereotypes, which can hinder meaningful interaction. Rather than assuming that all members of a culture behave in certain ways, culturally informed diplomats can appreciate the diversity within cultures and avoid making assumptions that may harm negotiations. Intercultural Empathy Understanding cultural values and social norms enables diplomats to empathize with foreign counterparts' perspectives, reducing misunderstandings and fostering cooperation. For example, a diplomat who understands the importance of 'saving face' in certain cultures may take extra care to avoid language or actions that could cause embarrassment, thus maintaining mutual respect and facilitating smoother negotiations. Cross-cultural psychology provides diplomats with the tools to approach international interactions with sensitivity, allowing them to bridge cultural divides and enhance diplomatic outcomes. The Future of Psychology and Psychoanalysis in Diplomacy As global challenges become increasingly complex and interconnected, psychology and psychoanalysis will likely play an even greater role in diplomacy and negotiation. By integrating these fields into diplomatic training and practice, diplomats can become more adept at understanding the human aspects of international relations. The next phase of psychology in diplomacy may involve even greater use of psychoanalytical and psychological techniques, such as scenario analysis, role-playing exercises, and emotional intelligence assessments. These methods can help diplomats refine their skills in managing emotions, interpreting unconscious motives, and fostering empathy. Additionally, advances in neuropsychology may provide new insights into how stress, fatigue, and decision fatigue impact diplomacy, leading to improved strategies for maintaining resilience in high-stakes negotiations. In an era marked by rapid technological change, cultural shifts, and unprecedented global challenges, psychology and psychoanalysis offer diplomats invaluable tools for achieving nuanced, sustainable, and empathetic solutions to complex issues. By embracing these perspectives, diplomats and negotiators can create more stable and harmonious international relationships, built on a foundation of deep human understanding.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRTI4q_bDTIiB	2024-11-14T09:38:26-08:00	
Remarks Of IMF Managing Director To 25th Jacques Polak Annual Res...	Good morning! Welcome to the 25th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference! Twenty-five years is a huge milestone. And I want to give my heartfelt congratulations and thanks to the Research Department and Pierre-Olivier for all you’ve achieved over the past quarter century. Over that time, we’ve had our ups and downs. Periods of high growth and low growth. Profound changes in the global economy, and crises. Through it all, the ARC has shed light on some of the most difficult questions facing our profession, helping policymakers navigate the most complex challenges. My task is to honor this incredibly distinguished history—in under 5 minutes. Impossible, but I will try! The first ARC was under Michael Mussa. It was the year 2000, when Maury Obstfeld laid out a new international macroeconomics research agenda looking beyond the Mundell-Fleming Model—at the Mundell-Fleming lecture, no less! That was 15 years before Maury became Chief Economist. After Michael came Ken Rogoff, whose accomplishments we celebrated here last year. Then, under Raghu Rajan's leadership, the ARC focused on fundamental issues that remain highly relevant today: from exchange rate regimes to capital flows and structural reforms. These insights were crucial in guiding policymakers' responses to mitigate the impact of the Global Financial Crisis. The next ARC explored the latest factors impacting exchange rates and examined their policy implications. It was led by Simon Johnson—who we're proud to say is now a Nobel laureate! Afterwards, Olivier Blanchard’s record-setting run of seven ARCs began, at the height of the Global Financial Crisis. And, in the years that followed, it was only natural that many of these ARCs allowed us to reflect on macroeconomic and financial policies in the shadow of the crisis. That work made us better prepared for the shocks of the past five years. Gita’s ARCs were shaped by the pandemic. They helped us better incorporate epidemiology into macroeconomic models early in the COVID crisis, and later gave insight into pandemic’s impact on capital flows. And with Pierre-Olivier’s stewardship, we have written a new playbook to help countries address the challenges of the post-pandemic, climate-impacted world, including inflation and elevated debt. This year will continue the ARC’s tradition of excellence, I am sure, as you Rethink the Policy Toolkit in a Turbulent Global Economy. The profound shocks of COVID and war have left us with inflation and fragmentation, even as we need economic growth to address challenges from poverty to climate change. Yet the growth outlook, while stabilizing, remains much lower than pre-pandemic. Inflation has declined, but not been fully defeated. And elevated debt levels constrain fiscal space, especially in countries that most need to spend to educate their young populations, build infrastructure, and increase their climate resilience. This conference will focus on how to address these and other challenges that central banks and fiscal authorities face—and what the international community can do together. With Gita, Pierre-Olivier, and the RES team in the lead, you are in great hands. I wish you the best for an illuminating, productive conference. Over to you, Gita.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRSfMM2zWgO-P	2024-11-14T09:36:57-08:00	
Prophet Abraham Started Three Unique Monotheistic Religions – OpE...	For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent thousands of prophets to thousands of tribes and nations on the earth, and not one of them were able to establish an ongoing imageless monotheistic community. So Allah decided to do things in a different way. Allah decided to make a covenant with a small tribe, and send hundreds of his prophets to this small tribe and worked continually for centuries with the people of this tribe until they were able to establish an ongoing community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal believers. Allah selected Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) and the descendants of Prophets Ishmael, Issac, and Jacob to be the first, but not the last monotheistic community. 'There is for you an excellent example (to follow) in Abraham and those with him.' [Qur'an 60:4] and 'Indeed Ibrahim was a nation obedient to Allah, a Hanif, he was not one of the polytheists.' [Qur'an 16:120]. God makes Prophet Abraham several promises that will be fulfilled if he heeds the comments he has been given: Genesis 12:2 states 'I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and it shall be a blessing. 12:3 I will bless those who bless you and curse him that curses you; and all the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you.' Most of these promises have already been fulfilled. Prophet Abraham was the first person to be called a 'Hebrew' in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 14:13). The term Hebrew probably comes from the verb to go over a boundary, like the Euphrates or Jordan river, or to be a migrant. Ten generations later the Philistines in Canaan used the term 'Hebrews' to refer to the 12 tribes of Israel: 'The Philistine commanders asked, 'What about these Hebrews?' (1 Samuel 29:3); and Prophet Jonah identified himself to non-Jewish sailors as 'a Hebrew' (Jonah 1:9). According to a new Pew Research Center study released on August 19 2024: 'Christians are about 30% of the world's population, the world's migrants are 47% Christian, according to the latest data collected in 2020. Muslims make up 29% of the migrant population and 25% of the world's population. Jews, who are only 0.2% of the world's population and 1% of migrants, are by far the most likely religious group to have migrated, with 20% of Jews worldwide living outside their country of birth compared to just 6% of Christians and 4% of Muslims. Prophet Abraham was the first Muslim Hebrew as Qur'an 3:67 states: 'He (Abraham) was not Yahuudiyyan, 'a Jew', nor Nasraaniyyan, 'a Christian', but rather a Haniifan', 'a monotheistic Hebrew believer submitting (Islam) to the one imageless God who created all space and time; and who made Prophet Abraham's descendants through Prophets Isaac and Jacob (Israel), into a great multitude of monotheists called the People of Israel-Banu Israel. The Prophet Isaiah said: 'Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the Lord: look to the rock from which you were hewn, and to the quarry from which you were dug. Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you; for he [Abraham] was only one when I called him, that I might bless him and multiply him. (Isaiah 51:1-2) and the Qur'an states: 'You have an excellent example to follow in Abraham.' (60:4) and 'Follow the way of Abraham as people of pure faith.' (3:95) And the Quran 2:130 states: And (everyone) who shuns the creed of Abraham (is) but a foolish soul. We chose him (Abraham the Hebrew Genesis 14:13) in the world and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous. 2:131 And when his Lord said unto him 'Submit!' (aslim) he said, 'I submit (aslamtu) to the Lord of the worlds.' Most people in the world have learned of Prophet Abraham, not by reading a book of Jewish history or religion, but by listening to and reading from the Christian Bible or the Muslim Qur'an. This unique and amazing situation is a reflection of a promise made to Prophet Abraham more than 36 centuries ago, and recorded in both the Torah and the Qur'an. 'I swear (says God) because you did this - not withholding your son, your favorite one, I will bestow My blessing on you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore; and your descendants shall seize the gates of their foes. All the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by your descendants, because you have obeyed My command.' (Genesis 22:16-18) and 'Indeed, We chose him (Abraham) as one pure and most distinguished in the world, and he is surely among the righteous in the Hereafter'. (Qur'an 2:130) Prophet Isaiah also said: But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, are the offspring of Abraham, my friend;' (Isaiah 41:8) So the biological offspring of Prophet Abraham (the Banu Israel) became the first ongoing monotheistic community when God rescued them from Egyptian oppression; and made an ongoing covenant with them at Mount Sinai. Prophet Abraham was not born a Jew, but his descendants from his grandson Jacob/Israel became the Banu Israel—Jewish People. For 1200+ years after Prophet Moses, the Banu Israel was the only ongoing monotheistic community in the world. 'Similarly, no Messenger came to the People before them, but they said (of him) 'A sorcerer, or one possessed''! (51:52) And as the Qur'an informed us: 'The people of Noah denied before them, and the companions of the well and Thamūd; and ʿAad and Pharaoh and the brothers [neighbors] of Lot; and the companions of the forest, and the people of Tubbaʿ. All denied the messengers [Allah sent to them] so My threat was justly fulfilled.' [50:12-14] And those monotheistic communities that did last for a few generations, always fell away during subsequent centuries; while most, but not all, of Banu Israel remained loyal to the covenant God made with them at Mount Sinai: 'Before (Messengers Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus) We sent messengers to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they call Allah in humility. When the suffering reached them from Us, why then did they not call Allah in humility? On the contrary, their hearts become hardened, and Satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them. (Qur'an 6:42-43) But as the centuries passed the ongoing need to protect the Jewish way of life became increasingly the focus of their efforts; and after the deaths of Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah, Banu Israel became more and more inclined to building a fence around the Torah, and making the rules more numerous and restrictive. In 1065 Pope Alexander called for a Crusade against the Moors in Spain. Then in 1073, Pope Gregory issued official proclamations urging Christian princes to recover lands occupied by Muslims in Spain, over which he claimed papal sovereignty on the basis of previous Christian rule and right. These decrees were really the beginning of the Christian Crusades against Islam. For example, in 1209, Pope Innocent III urged a band of northern French nobles to rally an army that swept into southern France, where they unleashed a crusade so bloody it included the sacking of Beziers by an army under papal authority. Just before the attack, which would kill 15-20,000 men, women and children, the pope's man on the scene, Arnaud Amalric, is reported to have uttered one of history's most famous orders: 'Kill them all. God will know his own.' The next 4-5 centuries of religious military war in Europe and the MiddleEast was the result of the previous 2-3 centuries of all-out polemic verbal war between Christianity and Islam. Religious truth became a zero sum game: anything positive said about another religion was seen as a weakening of your own side. The goal was not to modestly try to harmonize various religious perspectives of the one and only God; but to self-righteously exaggerate religious differences, well beyond any reasonable understanding of the two sides. In the Greek world, the Jerusalem Temple (Beit HaMikdosh) was well known, while the Ka'ba, the House of God (Baitullah) in Mecca was not known by name at all. The first Roman reference to the Baitullah is from Diodorus Siculus, a first century BCE Roman historian who wrote that in Arabia there was a temple greatly revered by the Arabs. According to G. E. Von Grunebaum, who I studied with at the University of California Los Angeles in 1959, Mecca was also mentioned by Ptolemy, a second century Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer who wrote, 'The name he gives it allows us to identify it as a South Arabian foundation created around a sanctuary.' (G. E. Von Grunebaum, Classical Islam: A History 600–1258, p. 19) Yet just seven centuries later both of these cities and sanctuaries, one almost unknown by the Romans and the other totally destroyed by the Romans, were destined, throughout the Middle Ages in both Europe and west Asia, to be viewed as the heart, lungs or navel of the world. Jerusalem and Mecca were frequently portrayed by Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the center of their maps. God willing, someday everyone may see both cities and their sanctuaries as central to our monotheistic connections to the One God of Prophets Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac. If we can live up to the ideal that religious pluralism is the will of God, we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5) So God's promise to Prophet Abraham, that the other families of humankind will ultimately bless themselves, and one another, thus aspiring to be like Abraham's descendants (Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14), and will have fulfilled the three Abrahamic religions of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. As a Hadith states: 'Abu Dharr narrated that one day he asked the Messenger of Allah (Prophet Muhammad): How many prophets are there in all? He replied: 124.000. Abu Dharr then asked: How many of them were messengers (bring a sacred scripture) prophets? He replied: 313 from the above group. He asked: Who was the first of them (the oral only prophets)? He replied: Adam...The first prophet among Bani Israel was Musa and the last of them (the Jewish prophets) was Isa (Jesus), and they (the Jewish prophets) were in all 600.' (Biharul Anwar, Vol. 11, Pg. 32.) This is why the 600 Jewish prophets who were the descendants of Prophet Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) were and still are to this very day the smallest and oldest base of an unbroken, ongoing, monotheistic nation of survivors. Prophet Abraham, like his early descendant prophets until Messenger Moses, the covenant with the children of Israel at Mount Sinai, and the Torah; was a muslim and not a member of the Jewish, Christian or Islamic religious community at that time; because there was no Jewish, Christian or Islamic religious community then. 'Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a muslim [submitting to Allah]. And he was not of the polytheists.' (Qur'an 3:67) Thus the Qur'an instructs members of the Islamic community when others say to them: 'Be Jews or Christians [so] you will be guided...' Muslims should reply: 'Rather, [we follow] the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth [imageless monotheism], and he was not of the polytheists.' (2:135)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRfQnvdSqZX8l	2024-11-14T09:34:53-08:00	
Inconvenient Question: Science Is Gifting Us New HIV Prevention T...	Any new HIV prevention method is not meant to sit on the shelf but to be used by the people who need it to protect themselves from HIV. We have to ensure that new HIV prevention technologies that are coming out of the scientific research pipelines, are accessible to people everywhere - especially those who are more at risk of HIV acquisition. Jim Pickett has passionately called for translating scientific gains into public health outcomes - not with delay, but with equity and justice. Currently Jim Pickett serves as a Senior Advisor for AVAC and directs their Choice Agenda programme focussed on HIV prevention research and its implementation. Inconvenient truth When asked what has changed between 2018 and now, he said: 'COVID-19 reshaped our entire world. Traumatizing as it was, it also changed some things for the better, I think, globally. We got better at finding new ways to deliver healthcare. We also learned that we could develop a vaccine quickly and that was a win. But we failed to deliver it equitably in many parts of the world.' Jim was speaking with CNS at the 5th HIV Research for Prevention Conference of the International AIDS Society (IAS) in Lima, Peru. Sadly, equity and justice are not driving our health responses. 'We have had some exciting scientific developments in the HIV prevention space. We have cabotegravir- a once-in-two months injection that can prevent HIV. But accessibility is a different issue. It is available in our country, but it is extremely expensive. It is also complex to deliver. So the number of users is very low. It is available, but not accessible for many,' he said. 'We now have another long-acting injectable lenacapavir- two shots a year- that is on its way to being approved. And people are calling it game-changing and transformative in terms of HIV prevention. But it remains to be seen what access will look like. Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Brazil are among the countries that have been left out (from the 120 countries list) by Gilead (makers of lenacapavir) to provide it at reduced costs, despite these 4 countries being part of the clinical study of the drug,' he added. Imagine the injustice: people of countries which participated in the clinical study of lenacapavir for a greater common good, will not be able to get the best of benefits when it comes to its rollout, as of now. 'I am also excited about the tenofovir-medicated rectal douche as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for men who have sex with men- a douche that provides hygiene before anal sex, and then leaves the drug behind that provides protection against HIV. In an early Phase-1 study examining its safety and acceptability, majority of the participants stated that they would prefer the douche over daily oral PrEP,' said Jim. 'If PrEP douche passes through phase-2 and phase-3 studies, and then move to regulatory approvals and get into the market, it would be our first-ever behaviourally congruent intervention, which means harnessing a behaviour that people already do,' he said. PrEP is a medication for HIV negative people to protect them from getting infected with HIV. A choice should be accessible Science finds new tools to create new HIV prevention options for people, but then to have success in terms of making it accessible to all so that we can reduce new HIV infection rate, continues to remain a struggle. 'It is like science gets you to the top of one Mount Everest and then we find that there is a second Mount Everest of 'access' to climb. And that might even be a taller version of the first Mount Everest,' rightly said Jim. 'While I am really excited for these new choices that we will have, I am also frustrated that they will not be real choices, unless people can truly access them. There is no change in the game if you cannot get on the field, and there is no 'transforming' anything if that drug looks really good on paper, and then it sits on a shelf, and the people, who really need it, do not have access to it. It needs to be cheap, affordable, and accessible to everyone anywhere in the world. We definitely need to have some strategy for this,' he added. We cannot put profit above people's health 'The focus of pharmaceutical companies is on their shareholders and on making money. But public health is not about profit; it is not about money; it is about rights-based access - for everyone, regardless of their means. So there is a conflict of interest in that relationship. We need people at the negotiating table who want to fix this. So, community involvement from the very beginning is very important. It is about having all hands on deck, I think everyone who is involved- from every community person, organisations, governments, policy makers, funders, pharmaceutical companies, we have to hold them accountable,' rightly said Jim. Take the example of Lencapavir. 'It does not need to be priced over US$ 40,000 per person per year to be profitable. We are not asking pharmaceutical companies to do this for free, but do they deserve rewards that are exponentially beyond profit and just so high that it can bankrupt health systems? Or make health systems say that it is beyond their financial capacity to pay that kind of money? We cannot bankrupt our health system for one innovation when we have multiple health needs for the community. We cannot subsidise products that are so grossly expensive. We do not know how much the price of lencapavir will be decreased through voluntary licensing by the generic manufacturers who are also for-profit companies. So there is a lot to do to make sure that when it moves forward and it gets produced, it is priced in a way that is affordable for the people,' he said. PrEP approved in 2012 but many high burden nations yet to roll it out in public programmes There are countries like India where even the oral daily PrEP is not in the government programme even 12 years after it was approved in 2012, forget about the long-acting new PrEP products. It is ironical that HIV treatment is free in India, but HIV prevention options like PrEP are not. 'So, in a way you are putting people at risk of getting infected with the virus and then offer them lifelong treatment, but not giving them prevention medication for free. What sort of economy is this? If you have HIV, you get those very drugs (that could have been given to prevent HIV infection in the 1st place),' he said. Even in richer nations like USA problems and disparities plague the development response. 'There are many HIV programmes for people living with HIV around housing, food security and transportation vouchers. And I am happy for that. I am a person living with HIV, and I am happy to see other programmes that help people who need support. But then there are many people who are HIV negative, and who still are struggling- they do not have good housing, do not have a decent job, and are struggling to find their next meal. If we can get someone safely housed, make sure they have a full meal, it would help a lot in HIV prevention too all on its own,' rightly remarks Jim Pickett. 'People who have HIV prevention as their concern have many other concerns as well, and many times those other concerns are more pressing problems for them- like where am I going to sleep tonight? Am I going to get a meal today? When will I get a job? How am I going to continue my education? These are their priorities, which make them more vulnerable to HIV infection,' he added. Reducing vulnerability of people to HIV requires society-wide structural interventions and political commitment backed with resources. 'We are one whole person, and not separated in compartments,' says Jim. He is right. All health and development enshrined in promises our governments have made are also contributing towards HIV prevention, support and care. We, the people need to connect the dots and call for integrated development responses that are socially just.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRUGye4ZrM_du	2024-11-14T09:33:05-08:00	
Bangladesh’s Pivot: A New Path In Regional Diplomacy – OpEd	In a remarkable departure from the recent past, Bangladesh is charting a new course in its foreign policy, distancing itself from India's sphere of influence and seeking to strengthen ties with Pakistan while reinvigorating regional cooperation within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). This shift, while strategic in its diplomatic ambitions, is also driven by deep domestic dissatisfaction with the previous government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid, whose long tenure came to an abrupt end amid growing allegations of human rights violations and corruption. For over a decade, under Sheikh Hasina’s leadership, Bangladesh's foreign policy was largely aligned with India, shaped by shared historical ties, economic cooperation, and geopolitical concerns. But the years of close ties with New Delhi have come under scrutiny. Many in Bangladesh now view this alignment as compromising the country's sovereignty, and public discontent has reached a tipping point. Accusations of widespread human rights abuses and political repression under Hasina’s rule have fueled a rethinking of the nation’s diplomatic and internal policies. The interim government, which replaced Hasina's administration, has moved decisively to shift the country’s diplomatic focus. In the wake of mounting allegations, including accusations of genocide and political persecution, the interim government’s actions signal a deliberate attempt to break free from India’s embrace. Notably, the decision to freeze the financial accounts of Hasina’s family — long a symbol of political power and influence — underscores the growing public anger over perceived corruption and authoritarianism. The country’s pivot is further evidenced by its bold moves within the defense sector. A key moment in this recalibration occurred on October 6, 2024, when Chief Advisor Yunus inaugurated the Bangladesh Army Selection Board at Army Headquarters. The event marked a significant step in fortifying the autonomy of Bangladesh's military, which had, in the past, been seen as closely aligned with India’s security concerns. This newfound emphasis on national pride, paired with the rollback of laws protecting the Mujib family, signals an effort to reclaim political independence and lessen the influence of external powers. Another critical step in this pivot came when the interim government invited the UN Commission for Human Rights to investigate allegations of human rights abuses during Hasina's tenure. This move — widely seen as an attempt to expose abuses tolerated under the previous administration — has further strained relations with India, which had historically lent tacit support to Hasina's government. Perhaps one of the most significant developments in this diplomatic realignment has been the rupture in Bangladesh’s relations with India. At the 79th United Nations General Assembly, Bangladesh’s request for a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Yunus was met with Indian reluctance, further highlighting the growing discontent with Indian influence in Bangladesh's domestic affairs. India’s behind-the-scenes efforts to bolster the Awami League — the political party led by Hasina — were seen by many in Bangladesh as an attempt to meddle in its internal politics, exacerbating the rift between the two nations. In response, Bangladesh recalled its envoy from New Delhi, signaling a clear intent to distance itself from India’s regional dominance. As Bangladesh seeks to recalibrate its foreign relations, it has begun to turn its attention toward Pakistan, a country with which it shares a complex history. A recent diplomatic meeting between Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary and the Pakistani High Commissioner marked the beginning of what could be a thaw in bilateral relations. The two countries, which have long been estranged due to the lingering wounds of the 1971 independence war, are now looking to strengthen trade ties, as evidenced by Bangladesh’s decision to remove the 100% physical inspection requirement for Pakistani goods. This move is seen as a step toward re-establishing a cooperative economic relationship. More importantly, Bangladesh has expressed strong support for reviving SAARC, the regional organization that has long been sidelined due to political tensions, particularly between India and Pakistan. In collaboration with Nepal, Bangladesh is promoting a regional agenda focused on economic integration and collaborative growth, presenting SAARC as a platform for cooperation unencumbered by the bilateral issues that have historically divided the region. Bangladesh’s efforts to encourage educational exchanges with Pakistan further reflect a growing desire for people-to-people connections, signaling a shift toward fostering regional unity rather than perpetuating divisions. This pivot is not just a reaction to domestic unrest or external pressures; it also reflects broader regional dynamics. India’s assertive foreign policy in South Asia, particularly its growing influence in Bangladesh, is facing increasing pushback from its neighbors. Both Bangladesh and Pakistan are keen to carve out independent spaces in the region, free from the shadow of any single dominant power. By revitalizing SAARC, Bangladesh and its regional partners may have an opportunity to build a cooperative framework that prioritizes mutual economic development over narrow geopolitical rivalries. For Bangladesh, the road ahead is one of balancing regional cooperation with the assertion of national sovereignty. Whether the country can successfully navigate this complex diplomatic landscape remains to be seen. But the clear shift away from India, combined with efforts to reintegrate Pakistan into the fold of regional cooperation, represents a pivotal moment in Bangladesh’s foreign policy — one that will shape its future trajectory and its place within South Asia’s evolving geopolitical order. The hope is that, in the coming years, Bangladesh can emerge as a more independent actor in South Asia, advocating for a vision of regional cooperation that transcends the dominance of any single power. Whether it will succeed in this endeavor depends on its ability to balance the aspirations of its people with the demands of its regional partners. For now, Bangladesh’s pivot toward Pakistan and SAARC is a powerful statement that its future lies in the hands of its own people — not in the spheres of influence of its larger neighbors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRdrjSC3Zu_vb	2024-11-14T09:31:14-08:00	
The US Presidency: A Challenging Role And Trump’s Management Stra...	The U.S. presidency is a demanding and exhausting role. To succeed, it requires a skilled and experienced team. However, the new cabinet members and senior management chosen so far by Donald Trump have raised some questions regarding their qualifications. Particularly, the choices for Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State are considered controversial in terms of their experience. Additionally, no announcements have yet been made for critical positions like Treasury and Energy. Trump's selections appear to favor loyalty and discretion, often choosing individuals unlikely to overshadow him and willing to carry out directives without hesitation. This dynamic is expected to require the U.S. deep state and bureaucratic structures to closely monitor and potentially restrain Trump's decisions. While Trump's policies are widely debated, some see potential positives. His plans include deporting undocumented immigrants, reducing government expenditures, and ending conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. He also aims to cut defense spending and address unemployment and inflation by raising tariffs to boost domestic production. Throughout this process, Trump's blunt rhetoric, criticisms of opposition journalists, and participation in summits like G7 and G20 will likely attract attention. Though he is expected to keep dialogue channels open with Turkey, a positive approach is not anticipated. At 78, Trump's health may provide a slight advantage in handling the physical toll of office. Despite his age, he avoids smoking and drinking, stays active by playing golf, and leads a relatively healthy lifestyle. By the end of his term, he may not appear as worn out as Joe Biden did. Whether Turkey will choose to mirror certain Trump policies remains to be seen. It is uncertain if a similar cabinet structure might emerge in Turkey, but this will likely become clearer in the coming period.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRbmi2KhiYMmk	2024-11-14T09:29:26-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Turkey Page (Part III) – OpEd	The economic history of Africa is as old as the first people of mankind. The economy of the continent moved from hunter gathering to agriculture (farming and livestock rearing), fishing, manufacturing, trade, and international trade. Major trading states grew up in many parts of the continent but the most known were those of the Sahel belt, the East and Southern Africa regions, the first across the Sahara desert to north Africa and further to Europe and the others to Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. But the regions of the central and equatorial Africa had their own economic activities which were mostly involved in agriculture and hunter-gathering. The Northeast Africa region of the continent gave rise to the ancient Egyptian and Nubian civilizations which preceded the Greek city states and the Mediterranean island states of Minoa, Crete, and Rhodes. They traded with the East Africa States starting from present day Horn of Africa States all the way to Mozambique and southern Africa. The trading nations on the east of the continent from Egypt to southern Africa traded in animal products (Rhino horns, ivory, hides and skins), gold, iron ore, agricultural produce and implements such as endemic cereals. Most of these states became eventually part of the immense Muslim world and were connected to Arabia, Persia, and Asia, all the way to China. The monsoon winds which blow towards India and Asia during the months of April to October and towards Africa during the months of November to March played pivotal roles in the trade with Asia. The natural growth of the economy of the continent was disrupted by the European colonialism of the eighteenth to mid-twentieth century and its, sometimes, sub-human treatment of the populations of the continent. There was not much of an African economy for some two hundred years other than those connected with Europe and treated as part of the European economy. Some countries were doing well during this period while others dipped deeply into oblivion. Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa were prominent economies during this period, as were the economies of East Africa. The Sahel belt dipped, and the large empires and states of that region were slowly dismantled. Today they appear to be shadows of their great past. No wonder there are coups and counter coups in that region. The article is not designed to address African economic history but the above was a brief introduction to the story of the African economies to enable us to address the Türkiye-Africa growing relationship, which mostly revolves around the economies of the two parties. This itself is a subject which can pose its own controversies such as the incomparability of a continent with a population of some 1.5 billion and an area of some 30.3 million sq. km., surrounded by two oceans and two seas to a single country of some 90 million people and an area of 784,000 sq, km. But one must address the subject though, since there is a growing relationship between Africa and Türkiye, as the recent regular meetings between the two parties indicate. These are mostly related to economic partnering between the two parties over the past two decades through summits and forums and even visiting by one party or the other, to regions of the other. The first Türkiye-Africa Summit was organized in Istanbul in 2008 and was attended by 50 African states. The Summit ended with two documents, namely the 'Istanbul Declaration on the Africa-Turkey Partnership' and the 'Cooperation Framework for the Africa-Turkey Partnership,' which laid down the basis of the cooperation between Türkiye and Africa. Three years later, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with all his family members became the first foreign leader to visit Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, which was then undergoing one of its worst moments of its over two-thousand-year-old history. It faced then, a severe food shortage through one of the recurrent droughts of the region and volatile armed groups. It was a gesture most Somalis were grateful for and would never forget. The Türkiye economic partnering with Africa and the growing diplomatic relations between the two parties was further complimented by security assistance from Türkiye to some of the countries of continent. These security issues include among others the construction of its first military base in the continent in Mogadishu, Somalia in 2017 to train and support Somali security forces who are constantly battling imported foreign terrorism in the country. Türkiye also supplied its advanced military technologies to Ethiopia (the drones) to fight off the difficult Tigray region and other rebellions. It also works with the Libyan government in Tripoli to support it through military training, intelligence and other activities in the defense realm. It is, indeed, a large supplier of arms to the continent. The third Türkiye-Africa Summit was held again in Istanbul in December 2021, where it was declared that the two parties would cooperate in the areas of a) Peace, Security and Governance, b) Trade, Investment and Industry, c) Education, STI skills, Youth and Women Development, d) Infrastructure Development and Agriculture, and e) Promoting Resilient Health Systems. Türkiye was granted observer status at the African Union in 2005 and ever since, its trade with Africa has surged from some US$ 5.4 billion to over US$41 billion as of end 2022. In the fourth Türkiye-African Summit in October 2023, it was noted that the diplomatic presence of Türkiye in Africa has increased to forty-four countries, while some 38 African missions were open in Ankara. The success of Türkiye in Africa is based on a win-win formula, which apparently the foreign policy of Türkiye, follows. It also supports Africa’s push to become a permanent member of the G20 through the AU or African Union and a reform of the United Nations Security Council. The attempt to mediate between Ethiopia and Somalia, which has not come to fruition as yet is again another manifestation of Türkiye’s interest in settling issues in the continent peacefully and maintaining peace and sustainable development processes in the continent instead of conflicts and wars. The footprints of Türkiye in Africa has so far been successful and welcomed in the continent. Every nation has its motivations and Türkiye’s growing relationship with Africa cannot be said to be devoid of Turkish interests and the same goes for the African partner countries and the continent as well. The relationship thus involves not only humanitarian aspects but also diplomacy, economic partnerships benefiting both parties and indeed, security issues involving not only arms supplies but also training and other technological supports. It works for both parties and should continue on the same rising gradient. The Horn of Africa States region is one of the main footprints of Türkiye in Africa. The region is a major geostrategic location, which attracts different powers. The governments of the region and particularly Somalia, with the weakest governance infrastructure, was confused with the powers that be in the world, be they from the West or the East and was looking for a helping hand with a different approach, which Türkiye fulfilled with ease. A new ten-year agreement between Somalia and Turkey on protecting Somalia’s waters and signed on February 8th, 2024, complimented by another agreement on a joint hydrocarbon exploration both offshore and onshore in the country, and other contracts involving the management of the airport and seaport of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia have been major features in Türkiye’s presence in the region. The bilateral approach of Türkiye has given it more freedom to make its presence felt not only in the region but further afield in the continent. They are now present in the Sahel belt and have helped the Ethiopian government fight off rebellions in the country through its supply of advanced drone technologies to Ethiopia. There are regional rivals as well as major power competitions in the region, noting that the region is not only a geostrategic location but is also a resource rich region. The United Arab Emirates is one such regional rival, which has had a long presence in the region since the collapse of the previous regimes of both Ethiopia and Somalia. The UAE had its own difficulties in both Eritrea and Djibouti which did not appreciate the way the small emirate was handling itself in the region. The UAE is now in Somalia’s Berbera and Bossaso ports which it manages through some agreements with both the regional authorities and the federal Government of Somalia. It is also reported that they have expressed interest in the port of Kismayo. Note that the region owns several deep ports unlike West Africa where deep ports are a rarity. The main successes of Türkiye in the region and Africa is related to its emphasis on development diplomacy unlike other powers whose main goals appear to be related to security and denying others of footholds. This has been received well not only in the Horn of Africa States but also in the rest of the continent, as far west as Senegal. The Türkiye approach involves an integrated approach to development and business, and peacebuilding and peace maintenance. This has worked well so far and contrasts with others who are more involved in security and fake humanitarianism through aid agencies (NGOs), which are more of a scourge on the region than help. Many fail to observe the changing continent and continue the old approaches which have failed both the continent and others. Africa’s population is growing, youthful and more educated and have access to as much information as is possible in the google world of today. The emerging young leaderships of West Africa in the Sahel belt and even southern Africa (Botswana) are but examples of what to expect in the future. They seem to be bent on taking control of the wealth of their nations and ready to deal with those who accept the new realities in good faith. Türkiye seems to be of this last category and uninterested in a new 'scramble for the continent' as many of the new Africa forums and summits are described.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRf_rEVaPdTk9	2024-11-14T09:27:49-08:00	
Turkmenistan Celebrates Its 29th Anniversary Of Neutrality: A Mod...	Understanding the Underlying Factors of State Neutrality On December 12, 1995, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring Turkmenistan’s status of permanent neutrality. This status was officially recognized and marked a significant milestone in the country’s modern history. Next year, Turkmenistan will celebrate the 29th anniversary of its neutrality. This day holds tremendous importance nationally, both for the Turkmen people and for international diplomacy. It is enshrined in the country’s constitution, for example in Article 2, where it states: 'The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan shall be the basis of its national and foreign policy.' And in Article 68, where it says: 'The president of Turkmenistan shall be the head of the state and executive power, the highest official of Turkmenistan, acting as guarantor of…state independence and the status of permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan…' (UN). Understanding State Neutrality This unique status aims to keep the country out of conflicts while promoting peace and international cooperation. The policy of neutrality is the set of political decisions and measures a neutral state freely takes in peace times with the aim of securing the credibility and efficiency of its legally binding neutrality. The policy of neutrality differs in neutral states and depends on their situation. Currently, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Ghana, and many other states are designated as neutral. However, all of them attained the status of neutrality to preserve themselves from the devastating effects of wars. Moreover, many states adopted neutrality policies during the Cold War era to avoid the political climate of the bipolar world. Turkmenistan chose neutrality after the Cold War ended, and it is the only state to adopt neutrality in peacetime, according to Kuru (2002). Historical Context of Turkmenistan’s Neutrality The origin of Turkmenistan’s neutrality dates back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when Turkmenistan gained its independence and quickly adopted a neutrality policy to avoid regional conflicts and external influences. This neutrality policy reflects a deep value of the Turkmen people: preserving and promoting their cultural identity while maintaining peaceful relations with other countries. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Turkmenistan began its political transition process. This process swiftly integrated the political culture of neutrality into the de-Russification process and as a strategy for building a post-Soviet state. From the moment of independence, the concept of neutrality. Initially, the concept of neutrality is more related to wars, where sovereign states adopt neutrality to avoid involvement in armed conflict between states. Neutrality was a response to the geopolitical instability in Central Asia. Indeed, the status of neutrality allowed Turkmenistan to remain outside military alliances and conflicts while conducting active diplomacy. According to Article 1 of the Constitutional Law of Turkmenistan on Permanent Neutrality: 'Within the scope of realizing the integral rights of the sovereign state, Turkmenistan declares voluntarily about its permanent neutrality and will support it and put into practice consistently. The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan is the basis of its foreign and domestic policy aimed at strengthening the stability and consent in society, developing friendly and mutually beneficial relations with the states of the region and the whole world.' (Constitutional Law of Turkmenistan on Permanent Neutrality, 1995) In July 1992, the former president of Turkmenistan, during the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, illustrated the strategy of positive neutrality. Former President Saparmurat Niyazov defined the key characteristics of neutrality as follows: • No interference in the internal affairs of other states. • The use of force should be avoided in interstate conflicts. • The role of the United Nations in maintaining global peace should be recognized. • Promoting cooperation in various sectors. • Alliances should be avoided, whether military or political. • Develop relations to maintain good relations, etc. (Ahmed, R-Q and al., 2018). There are also obligations under its neutrality status such as • Turkmenistan will not join any political, economic, or military alliance. • Military power will be limited to safeguarding freedom and stability. • Good relations with all states, regardless of their size, will be maintained. • The neutrality policy emphasizes friendship, mutual respect, equality, justice, mutual benefit, and the loyal fulfillment of all responsibilities and wishes. Turkmen Neutrality in Service of Diplomatic Relations 'The status of neutrality is a key factor for the development of Turkmenistan’s mutually advantageous and constructive international partnership that meets national interests as well as the goals to ensure peace, prosperity, and sustainable development in the region and throughout the world,' noted former President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov. Therefore, Turkmenistan has established balanced diplomatic relations with major powers such as Russia, China, and the United States, while preserving its independence. Neutrality has allowed Turkmenistan to maintain good international relations with major powers. This neutrality has provided economic and diplomatic opportunities for Turkmenistan. It has enabled the country to develop economic relations with different partners while avoiding alignment with any military or economic bloc. The country has established bilateral relations with the United States, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, China, India, Pakistan, and many others. Turkmen Neutrality: An Asset on the International Stage In 2002, Mr. Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, served from 1997 to 2006, congratulated Turkmenistan for its support of the treaty establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. Moreover, neutrality plays a crucial role in international organizations. Turkmenistan is a member of many international organizations, such as the UN, and advocates for peace and stability in the region. This is why UN Secretary-General António Guterres told journalists that 'Turkmenistan is playing a very important role in international relations,' particularly in cooperation with the UN. He was encouraged by the improved relations between Central Asian countries in the face of these challenges, and regional cooperation has deepened, once again highlighting the important role played by Turkmenistan. Conclusion In conclusion, Turkmenistan’s neutrality remains a cornerstone of its foreign policy, allowing it to navigate a complex international environment with a certain degree of independence. Over the past 29 years, this position has reinforced its role as a mediator and promoter of peace in the region. Next year, on December 12, 2025, Turkmenistan, the land of Ahal Teke horses, will celebrate its 30th anniversary of neutrality. Turkmenistan’s neutrality is a remarkable example of peace. Undoubtedly, Turkmenistan refuses to harbor or produce weapons of mass destruction, to be part of military pacts, to provoke conflicts, or to take sides in conflicts. This message of neutrality and peace is gaining increasing relevance in our decade, which faces the growing escalation of global conflicts. Bibliography Ahmed, R-Q and al., (2018).

In A Trumpian World – OpEd	Trump won but did America lose? Harris lost but did America win? What is being seen in America, and in many parts of the world, is a reconfiguration and reconstitution of many social beliefs. These had catalysed human progress but now in a Trumpian World are being turned on their heads. Therefore, today in this brave new world - Women's rights conflict with her identity – Both Trump and Harris focused on womanhood. Harris focussed on reproductive rights while Trump focussed on the transgendering of the identity of womanhood. Harris pointed to the threat of regressiveness, Trump discussed the dangers of progressiveness. That 3% fewer women voters voted for Harris in 2024 as compared to Biden in 2020 suggests that reproductive rights was not as important in this election as the threat to their identity based wellbeing. Majority Is the new minority – The phenomenon of the majority claiming to be a minority is growing across the world. This is communicated in many ways - 'way of life is threatened', 'demography is changing', 'jobs are being taken away'. There is a desire to maintain status-quo, which could be a response to the hyped-up socio-economic insecurities. That is the reason for Muslims being targeted in India; Roma's, Jews and LGBTQI being targeted in Hungary and, American's opposition to migrants and minorities. The rise of the rightwing Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in Germany, and anti-migrant political parties in other parts of Europe is a consequence of these beliefs. Liberalism has become its own worst enemy – Many Rightwing issues are reactions to progressive endeavours and diktats. Unfortunately, equality, equity and rights for one group can cause uncertainty for another group. For example, many feminists oppose Transgender rights as they believe it goes against women's rights, socio-economic schemes for migrants reduces opportunities for natives and it goes on. Liberals wish to make society sustainable, inclusive, respectful, equitable, just and so on. They do so by focussing on the marginalised and historically disenfranchised. The Liberal idea includes giving a platform to the voiceless and holding truth to power. Undeniably, the scope of progressivism is extensive. Given this broad swathe that is focussed on, there is a possibility the liberal attention span is transient as they are forced to move from issue to issue – reproductive rights, migrant rights, welfarism, hate speech, peace, equal pay, and so on. For the lay person there is no common thread underlying these myriad issues thus making these efforts whimsical and disjointed. There seems to be an underlying liberal assumption that the process of changing the status quo will also educate people on the subject. The issue becomes the hot-topic and not the underlying beliefs that fuel the desire to shift the needle. Consequently, there is no effort to change the minds of the dis-interested and conservative. It is almost as if Liberals assume that everyone will come to terms with, and accept, changes instigated by them. Understandably, the response to these progressive endeavours is antagonism, distancing and disrespect. Liberals fight each other as there is no limit and definition of progressive and liberal values. The liberal ethos is individualistic - transgender versus feminism is an example. Lack of frameworks also results in shocking hypocrisy as seen in the Palestinian-Israeli, and Ukrainian-Russia conflicts. This is nutrition for the Right. Importantly, the Rightwing is attractive because it has a low threshold for their idea of victimhood and discontent. Let's not forget, Liberal work can result in 'othering' something Liberals rail against. Democrats looked down on Trump supporters, calling them members of a cult did nothing to help their cause. This mix of self-righteous outrage and snootiness further increases the divide and repels potential converts. Secularism has a Rightwing Version - Trump's victory indicates a coalescing of disparate Rightwing agendas and cabals. Here are a few - the Christian evangelists; the Hindu Right; Republican Jews, Hispanics and African-Americans; the Constitutionalists; the white-supremacists; the socio-economic Conservatives; the America-Firsters, the conspiracy theorists and Q-anon followers; the small-government and pro-business group; climate change deniers; crypto-promoters; the pro-life coalition; the anti-woke brigade; the 'save-masculinity' caucus; the second Amendmenters; the traditionalists; the anti-immigration bloc; free-speech preservers; the book banners brigade; fascists and so on. Trump has been able to get them to forget their inherent differences and opposing stances, and coalesce. However, the question remains about the duration that these natural enemies will peacefully live in Trump's Ark. Just as there is a Liberal Tower of Babel, a Tower of Babel of the Right is emerging. Courage is being redefined – The Indian businessman and one of the world's richest - Gautam Adani- congratulated Trump with 'If there is one person on Earth who stands as the embodiment of unbreakable tenacity......courage to stay true to his beliefs it is Donald Trump....'. He is not the only person to appreciate Trump's bigotry, sexism, childish prattle, petulance, criminality, lies, and view it as a virtue that is commendable, courageous and possibly emulatable. Trump's victory suggests a majority of Americans think so too, as do other rightwing world leaders. There is a difference between speaking one's mind whilst knowing and accepting the consequences, and speaking one's mind knowing there are no consequences. The latter is the version celebrated today. Many question whether Trump's victory is a defeat of morality. Maybe, like the stock-market undergoing a correction, Trump rising victorious from his morass is a correction of what humanity has held dear.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRdp5VRQTAb3v	2024-11-14T09:24:19-08:00	
TTP And ISKP: Unraveling The Complex Web Of Militancy In South As...	Since the Taliban take over, the Afghanistan land has become a most volatile as many terrorists group have regained their strength under the patronage of Taliban regime. United States withdrawal from Afghanistan certainly have severe repercussions for the region. Since then, Afghanistan has faced a multifaceted security challenges and increased terrorist activities. The Taliban's return to power has created a power vacuum, reshaping security dynamics and impacting terrorism concerns on both regional and global levels. A major concern is the presence and activities of groups like ISIS-K (Islamic State Khorasan Province), which has taken advantage of the instability to expand its influence. ISIS-K has carried out numerous attacks targeting civilians, the Taliban, and neighboring countries, aiming to undermine Taliban control and promote its extremist agenda. Al-Qaeda, though weakened, also remains active in Afghanistan but has maintained a relatively lower profile. Meanwhile, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has found safe haven in Afghanistan, operating freely from the region to challenge the authority of the Pakistani state. The volatile security situation in Afghanistan affects neighboring countries like Pakistan, Iran, and the Central Asian states, heightening their concerns over potential cross-border terrorist threats. Additionally, the Taliban's limited governance experience and scarce resources have raised doubts about their ability to effectively curb terrorist groups and maintain control over the country. Globally, there is also fear that Afghanistan could once again become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations with transnational agendas, posing risks beyond its borders. Pakistan has repeatedly urged the Taliban government to take action against the TTP within Afghan territory, but significant cooperation has yet to materialize over the past three years. Pakistani authorities are deeply concerned about the TTP's operations from Afghanistan, emphasizing the threat it poses to Pakistan’s national security. Most terrorist incidents in Pakistan are attributed to the TTP, which maintains sanctuaries within Afghanistan. Pakistan has repeatedly shared intelligence with the Afghan government, providing specific details on TTP members’ locations and activities in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the TTP operates under the patronage of the Interim Afghan Government (IAG) due to its ideological and wartime linkages with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Afghanistan (TTA). Having supported the TTA during the war, the TTP now receives reciprocal support from the IAG. However, it is time for the Taliban government to understand that the continued presence of the TTP in their territory could strain bilateral relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is believed that the Afghan government is using the TTP as leverage against Pakistan. This approach allows the TTP to operate from within Afghan territory to exert pressure on Pakistan for political or strategic gains. The deaths of many TTP leaders and fighters in Afghanistan, along with their use of US weapons, confirm the TTP's presence there. International intelligence reports also verify these deaths and the use of US weapons, refuting Kabul's claims that the TTP is not operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan. The international community, including Chinese intelligence, acknowledges the presence of terrorist groups in Afghanistan and their role in the Bisham attack on May 27, 2024. Despite the Supreme Afghan leader's decree against jihad outside Afghanistan, the TTP's non-compliance demonstrates their defiance of the Taliban government. The TTP has links with ISKP and other terrorist groups operating in Afghanistan. Moreover, Pakistan has been facing and fighting 'Khawariji terrorists' for the past two decades. These terrorists, while claiming allegiance to different groups, are essentially the same due to their Khawariji ideology of killing and destruction, which religious scholars have declared un-Islamic and haram. Although Khawariji groups like the TTP and ISKP appear to be at odds with each other, they are fundamentally alike, as both share a Khawariji ideology rooted in un-Islamic, inhuman, immoral, and barbaric practices based on a misinterpretation of Islamic teachings. ISKP consists of former commanders and militants of the TTP (the first Ameer of ISKP, Hafiz Saeed, was a well-known TTP commander from the Orakzai agency). Therefore, in addition to their shared ideology, their human resources, terrorist tactics, and targets overlap, confirming that these banned outfits are covertly connected. ISKP has demonstrated the capability to conduct attacks both within and outside Afghanistan, highlighting a strong operational network and recruitment strategy. The Taliban's insufficient counterterrorism efforts raise concerns about the potential for terrorist groups to plan and execute operations against U.S. interests and allies, suggesting that the threats emanating from Afghanistan have increased rather than diminished since the U.S. withdrawal. Both groups are foreign proxies and puppets of Pakistan’s enemies, used against Pakistan to serve the interests of their foreign masters. ISKP abhors the Afghan Taliban, engaging in physical confrontations with them and condemning them in propaganda campaigns. Strangely, however, it takes a softer approach toward the TTP, reinforcing the perception that they are collaborating at some level. No clashes between the TTP and ISKP have ever occurred, and both enjoy safe havens in Afghanistan without conflict or friction, supporting the notion that the TTP is using ISKP for deception. The Khawariji TTP perpetrates heinous terrorist attacks on civilian targets through ISKP to manage public backlash. While ISKP launches suicide bombers against religious scholars, mosques, religious gatherings, and groups, the TTP only claims responsibility for attacks on security forces. Both the Khawariji TTP and ISKP radicalize youth and coerce teenagers into committing 'haram' acts like suicide attacks; meanwhile, not a single terrorist leader has shown the courage to blow himself up with a suicide vest. The presence of the Khawariji TTP and ISKP in Afghanistan is well-documented, substantiated by various reports from security organizations and media outlets, including UNSC reports, U.S. and Western think tanks, among others. Pakistani religious scholars have unanimously declared these terrorist groups and their activities haram through the Paigham-e-Pakistan fatwa, categorizing armed struggle within Pakistan as un-Islamic. Rather than remaining in denial, the Taliban government must collaborate with neighboring states to jointly combat and weaken the presence of the TTP and similar groups in Afghanistan. The prosperity and security of both Pakistan and Afghanistan are mutually dependent; thus, an insecure Pakistan means an insecure Afghanistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmReWeFEuPCrFf	2024-11-14T09:22:04-08:00	
Pakistan’s Strategic Reset With The US – OpEd	As the world braces for Donald Trump's second term as president, Pakistan finds itself at a critical juncture in its foreign policy and economic trajectory. While the return of a familiar face to the White House stirs its own brand of global anticipation, Pakistan sees this moment as an opportunity to reset, rebuild, and reassert itself on the international stage, particularly with respect to its relationship with the United States. The stakes are high, both for Pakistan’s domestic stability and its global positioning, especially given the turbulent history of US-Pakistan relations and the political challenges at home. The re-election of Donald Trump is notable not only for the political polarization it signifies in the US but also for the profound implications it holds for Pakistan, which continues to grapple with the legacy of past administrations’ foreign and domestic policies. While the Trump administration’s initial term was marked by sharp rhetoric and transactional diplomacy, Pakistan, like many others, hopes for a more constructive engagement in the years ahead. In this moment of global uncertainty, we are prepared to engage with the US in a manner that respects Pakistan’s sovereignty, acknowledges our efforts to combat terrorism, and supports regional stability. Pakistan has long played a pivotal role in the geopolitical dynamics of South Asia, particularly in the US-led war in Afghanistan. During Trump’s first tenure, despite the often contentious relationship, Pakistan proved to be a crucial partner in facilitating critical operations, particularly those related to the safe extrication of Afghans who had supported US forces. The role Pakistan played in facilitating peace talks, providing logistical support, and managing the delicate relationship with the Taliban was an essential component of the broader strategy that aimed to stabilize Afghanistan and secure US interests. Pakistan has also made significant contributions in the fight against terrorism, often at great cost to our own national security. Our army and intelligence agencies have been engaged in counterterrorism operations for over a decade, combating insurgents and militants that threaten both regional and global stability. As Pakistan continues its battle against extremism, we hope the new US administration recognizes and values the sacrifices Pakistan has made, especially in curbing terrorist networks operating across our borders. The relationship between the US and Pakistan has always been a balancing act—at times cooperative, at times fraught with tension. But the hope is that under Trump’s second term, this partnership can evolve into one of mutual respect, where both countries acknowledge each other’s interests and priorities, particularly with regard to Afghanistan, counterterrorism, and the broader quest for peace and security in the region. While Pakistan’s foreign policy challenges are significant, the internal political landscape is equally complicated. We face significant economic hurdles, a direct consequence of policy missteps by previous administrations. Over the last decade, Pakistan has struggled with fiscal instability, mounting debt, and a declining international reputation. These challenges were compounded by the policies of previous governments, which left the country isolated and burdened with unsustainable economic decisions. The current government recognizes that rebuilding Pakistan’s economy requires more than just fiscal adjustments—it demands strategic reforms, international cooperation, and a long-term vision for economic resilience. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, we are actively working to stabilize the economy, attract foreign investment, and restore Pakistan’s reputation as a reliable partner on the global stage. We are prioritizing infrastructure development, expanding our digital economy, and fostering an environment conducive to business growth. Our commitment to fiscal responsibility is underscored by ongoing efforts to meet the requirements set by international financial institutions, while also focusing on policies that will create sustainable jobs and improve the quality of life for our citizens. The government's focus on ensuring that economic policies serve the broader interests of the people, rather than narrow political agendas, will be crucial in navigating the current economic climate. As we move forward, Pakistan is keen to re-engage with the US administration on issues of mutual interest. Trade and economic collaboration should be at the center of this renewed relationship. For years, Pakistan’s economic potential has been stifled by a combination of internal mismanagement and external isolation. But as the world’s 25th-largest economy, Pakistan holds immense potential in sectors like agriculture, technology, energy, and services. With strategic international partnerships, we can unlock these opportunities and provide economic stability and prosperity for our citizens. At the same time, we must continue to assert our independence in decision-making. Pakistan is committed to engaging with the US and other global powers in a way that respects our sovereignty and prioritizes our national interests. This does not mean rejecting cooperation—it means approaching it with a sense of balance, ensuring that Pakistan’s priorities, particularly in terms of security and regional stability, are always at the forefront of any engagement. Pakistan is a country determined to move beyond the mistakes of the past. We are not blind to the flaws in our past policies, particularly those that exacerbated tensions with neighboring countries and the international community. However, Pakistan’s resilience is one of its defining features. Despite the economic setbacks and political challenges, our nation has weathered many storms, and we remain hopeful that with the right strategic guidance, we can overcome our current difficulties and emerge stronger. As we enter a new phase of engagement with the US, Pakistan must also look inward, working toward building a more transparent, inclusive, and accountable system of governance. This is not only critical for domestic stability but also essential in restoring international confidence in Pakistan as a reliable partner. The people of Pakistan, though weary from years of political instability and economic hardship, remain resilient and hopeful. They continue to believe in the potential of their country—a potential that has been stifled but is not yet extinguished. With the right international support, especially from strategic partners like the US, and a renewed commitment to internal reforms, Pakistan can return to the path of sustainable growth and development. In this new chapter, we call on the US administration, under President Trump, to engage with Pakistan as a partner in building a more stable, prosperous, and secure region. By doing so, we can turn the page on past grievances and focus on a future defined by collaboration, mutual respect, and shared goals.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRaH8jslmgCru	2024-11-14T09:20:11-08:00	
Northeast India: Obligatory 6 Assembly Seats Conduct By-Polls – O...	As the voting for by-polls in six assembly constituencies of Assam and Meghalaya in northeast India, obliged to fill up the vacant seats after all the legislators shifted their focus to the national politics, concluded peacefully on 13 November evening, the debates surfaced if the electoral exercises could have been prevented. The legislators, representing different political parties, participated and won in the recently conducted Lok Sabha polls and hence they had to resign from their respective assembly seats. The question definitely arises, why their party leaders selected them even though they were serving as legislators and whether it was not possible for them to break the cycle of repeated (often unwanted) elections for the sack of Indian tax payers' money! All the six seats (Assam-5 and Meghalaya-1) witnessed brisk voting by the electorates and the initial report suggests a voters' turn out of above 73 percent (out of cumulative 10 lakhs electorates). The fate of around 40 candidates (most of them are reportedly debutants) is now stored in the electronic voting machines, which will be opened on 23 November next. Along with these seats, by-polls for over 40 assembly constituencies (along with two Lok Sabha seats) in other parts of India are on the card along with the State assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand before the counting and result day. Assam's Samaguri assembly constituency remained in the media headlines for wrong reasons since the poll date was announced by the Election Commission of India. Frequent tussles between the supporters of various political parties were reported from the constituency in central Assam. Political violence even claimed the precious life of a BJP supporter and left many others injured. An incident of firing was also reported from Mari Puthikhaiti village targeting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Jitu Goswami. Three journalists were also allegedly intimidated by the Congress supporters. No doubt, a number of claims and counter-claims were raised by both the ruling BJP and opposition Congress leaders. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, also in charge of the State home portfolio, criticized the opposition Congress for resorting to violence under cover of darkness to frighten the BJP workers. The saffron leader however asserted that no one will be allowed to sabotage or undermine the democratic process in the State. It was responded to by the Congress leaders alleging that the BJP workers were creating troubles to garner support for their candidate in the by-polls. Samaguri assembly seat, represented by Congress veteran Rakibul Hussain for five consecutive terms, was vacated after he won Dhubri LS constituency (defeating AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal by over 10 lakh votes). Now Hussain wants to hand over the Muslim majority Samaguri constituency to his young son Tanzil Hussain. The ruling BJP also fielded a young leader and incidentally Diplu Ranjan Sarma was the only non-Muslim candidate in Samaguri as other parties (including Aam Aadmi Party) batted for minority leaders for the by-polls. As the Muslim-centric AIUDF avoided the electoral race in Samaguri, it's expected to be a frontal battle between the Congress and BJP candidates there. Dholai (SC) and Behali seats continue to be favourable for the ruling party, where the first one was vacated by Parimal Suklabaidya to fight successfully in LS polls from Silchar Parliamentary constituency and the second one was left by Ranjit Dutta to fight for Sonitpur LS seat fruitfully. The BJP has fielded Nihar Ranjan Das in Dholai (contested by Congress candidate Dhrubajyoti Purkayastha and others) and Diganta Ghatowal in Behali assembly constituency (electorally challenged by former saffron leader Jayanta Bora, Asom Sanmilita Morcha supported CPI(ML) candidate Lakhikanta Kurmi and others). Sidli (ST) assembly seat was vacated by Jayanta Basumatary (United Peoples' Party-Liberal) to get elected from Kokrajhar LS seat. Now Nirmal Kumar Brahma is fighting to retain the seat for the BJP ally against the challenges primarily from Congress nominee Sanjib Warle and Bodoland People's Front (BPF) candidate Suddha Kr Basumatary. Another important ally to the ruling BJP alliance Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) put Diptimoyee Choudhury for Bongaigaon seat against Brajenjeet Sinha of the Congress. A recent talk show, telecast by a Guwahati-based satellite news channel DY365, discussed various electoral issues reflecting in Assam ahead of the by-polls in five constituencies. Anchored by senior television journalist Snigdha Sikha, the show highlighted different perspectives of elections in the State with a serious observation that the electoral system in India needs an urgent reform. Joining the discussion, aired live and repeated telecast next day, this writer argued that all five assembly constituencies needed the polls as the legislators participated in the last general elections successfully and shifted their focus to the Parliament. It could have been evaded if the political parties prevented these legislators from fighting in the national polls till term is over. Senior media personality Adip Phukan expressed serious concern over the incidents of pre-poll violence in the State, which was otherwise unheard of across the region. He also remained critical to AGP leader Phani Bhusan Choudhury who had recently won from the Barpeta LS seat and thus a by-election was necessitated in his assembly constituency Bongaigaon. But surprisingly, the AGP put Choudhury's wife as the party nominee in the by-polls. Phukan lamented that Choudhury represented Bongaigaon assembly constituency for four decades together and when it was time to hand over the responsibility to another party leader he (also the leaders of AGP) could repose faith on a house wife only. Not only Choudhury, the same tendency was shown by Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma also, as he put his wife Mehtab Chandee Agitok Sangma in the by-polls for Gambegre assembly seat. The ruling National People's Party (NPP) nominee Mehtab Chandee has been challenged in the electoral battle by the Congress candidate Jingjang Marak, BJP nominee Bernard Marak, Trinamool Congress candidate Sadiyarani M Sangma, etc. The by-election became necessary as the influential legislator Saleng A Sangma of the Congress joined the Lok Sabha as its member from Tura Parliamentary constituency (defeating CM Sangma's sister Agatha in the last general elections). The constituency in Garo hills locality recorded as high as over 90 % poll-turnout. The ruling Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) won both the seats scheduled for by-polls in the tiny State as the opposition candidates withdrew their nominations. State chief minister Prem Singh Golay's son Aditya (Tamang) Golay won from Soreng-Chakung assembly seat as his lone opponent Prem Bahadur Bhandari of Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF, led by former CM Pawan Kumar Chamling) preferred not to contest. Similarly, Namchi-Singhithang seat went to Satish Chandra Rai as lone opposition candidate Danial Rai of SDF left the race. The 32-member Sikkim legislative assembly now slips to the complete domination of SKM with no space for the opposition.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRXVFsszcuGR2	2024-11-14T09:18:10-08:00	
Glimpses Of Everyday Imperialism At Work In The China-USA Trade D...	The U.S.-China Business Council report on 'U.S. Exports to China 2023' reveals that $151.3 billion worth of American goods were exported to China, supporting over one million U.S. jobs. According to the American Bureau of Economic Analysis, an official U.S. government agency, 'In 2023, U.S. exports of goods and services to China were $195.5 billion, down 0.9% from 2022, while imports from China were $447.7 billion, down 20.6% from 2022. As a result, the trade deficit with China declined to $252.1 billion'. However, these economic facts and figures do not determine U.S. policy toward China. Instead, the neo-colonial and imperialist strategies led by the U.S. and Europe shape the nature of the U.S.-China trade dispute. The imperialist, colonial, and capitalist core finds an alternative model of development and economic growth neither acceptable nor tolerable. In the name of trade disputes, U.S. President Donald Trump has consolidated and further reinforced the anti-Chinese policies and sentiments shaped by American business elites and their think tanks, such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the American Enterprise Institute, the Atlantic Council, and others. These institutes, under the guise of research, often serve as the propaganda arm of the American ruling elites, represented by the U.S. government. Trump's second term is expected to be even more aggressively anti-China, particularly in terms of imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and services. Trump has stated that 'tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,' Tariffs as an economic weapon used by imperialist countries like the U.S. and Western European nations to undermine and dismantle trading abilities of developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Tariffs are the foundations of unfair trade practices led by the imperialist countries in the name of protecting domestic industries, innovation and intellectual properties. American and European consumers suffer the most because of anti-Chinese trade practices. However, these anti-Chinese tariffs are not intended to benefit American, European consumers or global economy. Instead, they aim to protect corporate profits by undermining high-quality, yet more affordable Chinese goods and services. The trade dispute is often framed as a trade war between the U.S. and China, a conflict that was both intensified and accelerated under Trump. According to Josh Lipsky, the ripple effects of the U.S.-China trade war in 2018 could have cost the global economy $700 billion. It is going to grow in the second term of Trump presidency. Who paid this huge cost? The simple answer is consumers—the working masses. The trade dispute between China and America led to rising consumer prices on goods and services provided by China. As a result, working people bore the brunt of the increased cost of living, paying more for everyday products that are essential to their lives. In a capitalist market society dominated by imperialists, both at home and abroad, who truly cares for the masses? The policies that shape this system often prioritise corporate profits over the well-being of ordinary people. American imperialism, along with its Western European allies, views the world primarily in terms of trade surpluses and deficits. These powers often use military conflicts to ensure the smooth flow of trade, free from any barriers imposed by governments in countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These imperialist powers provoke anti-China sentiments in the China’s neighbourhoods by forming military, strategic and economic alliances. President Trump, as a businessman, aligned himself with this imperialist market trajectory in world politics, seeking to undermine and dismantle any successful models of state-led economic development, such as China's. There is little distinction between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to containing China's growth and development. Both parties compete to be more anti-China, striving to outdo one another in their approach to the issue. The Biden administration, for instance, continued Trump's policies on China, even increasing tariffs and levies on Chinese products and services. The recently concluded election campaign further revealed that there was little difference between President-elect Biden and his opponent, Kamala Harris, in their stance on undermining China's alternative development model. Both Republicans and Democrats share a common approach when it comes to China, united in their efforts to curtail its rise. American and European consumers are the beneficiaries of Chinese trade but these countries frequently accuse China of unfair trade practices, aiming to undermine its competitive advantage and progressive subsidy policies. They also accuse the Chinese state of engaging in business espionage and technology theft, alleging violations of international trade agreements. However, there is no truth to these accusations. In reality, China has reformed its Foreign Investment Law to encourage technological cooperation based on voluntary, mutually agreed-upon rules that govern business investments. The law not only bans forced technology transfers but also protects the trade secrets and intellectual property of foreign investors. These false allegations are part of a broader strategy to undermine China and its creative, technological, and scientific capabilities, as well as the productive potential of its skilled workforce. American imperialism and its European allies have failed to acknowledge the failures of their capitalist models of development, which has led to a declining ability to meet their consumption needs through domestic production. Capitalism, driven by the pursuit of profit and mass consumerism, has undermined domestic industries, contributing to deindustrialisation in both Europe and America. The trade deficit is a direct result of this imbalance between production and consumption. In contrast, China's trade surplus is driven by its technologically advanced workforce, which produces more than it consumes. As a result, China exports more and imports less, leading to a trade surplus. Meanwhile, capitalist countries like the United States and those in Western Europe consume more than they produce, which causes their imports to exceed exports and results in trade deficits. In this context, imperialist nations are engaged in an economic war with China over trade surplus. However, this trade dispute does not serve the interests of people worldwide. The imperialist powers are deflecting attention from their own capitalist failures by unjustly blaming China for its development, which is fundamentally centered around the well-being of its people and people across the world. China should reconsider its approach to retaliating against imperialist market logic. Moving away from a corporate-driven market strategy based on tariffs and levies is crucial. Increasing tariffs on American and European goods does not benefit consumers in China, Europe, America, or anywhere else in the global market. Instead, China should focus on promoting worker-led cooperative business models and investment strategies, both domestically and internationally. By prioritizing these models, China can foster more equitable and sustainable economic relationships that serve the interests of workers and consumers worldwide, rather than continuing to rely on punitive trade measures designed by the neocolonial imperialist and their crony capitalists.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-LikCFHQmRfedSx_iNpPQ	2024-11-14T09:16:40-08:00

Moscow Hopes Bishkek Can Help Control Kyrgyz Migrant Workers In R...	Popular militias made up of immigrants have been forming across the Russian Federation in cities with significant diaspora populations. These militias are composed of both citizen and non-citizen migrants. Ostensibly, these militias are meant to work with police to enforce laws and keep the peace between these communities and the Russian majority. These groups, however, also defend these immigrant communities against Russian police and Russian nationalist groups such as the Russian Community (see EDM, October 15). These immigrant militias are becoming models for indigenous and Roma populations, groups that the Russian police have not always been able to control (Window on Eurasia, October 31). As a result, over the last several weeks, Moscow has quietly entered into agreements with Kyrgyzstan and possibly other countries to have officers come to the Russian Federation to work with these immigrant groups, an action Bishkek has acknowledged openly but Moscow has sought to downplay (T.me/mvd_official_kg, November 5; T.me/mediamvd, November 7). Amid the escalating tensions regarding immigrants, the Russian media’s approach to downplay the issue is understandable but no longer sustainable. After an article by Russian journalist Vladislav Maltsev appeared in Zavtra on November 10 entitled '’Kyrgyz Policemen’ and ‘National Militias’ are Already in Our Cities,' the Russian journalist pointedly asked whether the state was losing control of order (Zavtra, November 10). Maltsev’s article is sure to trigger a flood of commentaries in the coming days and may even put pressure on Moscow to change course, and thus making the issue worthy of close attention. According to Maltsev, 'migrant ghettos that have formed in many Russian cities and are already acquiring their own official security forces either in the form of militias created by the immigrants themselves or by foreign interior ministry offices who [with Moscow’s permission] have come to Russia in uniform.' (See Zavtra, April 14, 2021; EDM, October 22 for more on migrant ghettos in Russian cities.) Maltsev suggests that many Russians will be concerned about how these foreign officers are not being subordinated to Russian police, but have diplomatic immunity and can thus interact with migrants with little regard for Moscow. Specifically, he notes that Bishkek officials intend these representatives to work in an 'independent' and 'extraterritorial' fashion, much like European officials did in China in the 19th century, which will alarm a large swath of Russians. Such terms are alarmist and are intended to be. Maltsev says what is occurring in Siberian and Russian Far Eastern cities such as Bratsk and Tyumen are far more disturbing and concrete. There, he reports, citing statements by local branches of the Russian interior ministry, ever more migrants, confronted by anti-immigrant moves from the Russian authorities and population, have sought to form ethnic militias. Adding that, to a lesser extent, similar trends are taking place in European Russia. The Russian authorities have told them that only citizens of the Russian Federation have the right to form militias, but that is less of an obstacle than many may think, Maltsev continues. Many migrants have now taken Russian citizenship, and Moscow has encouraged them to do so. Over the last two months, these migrants with Russian citizenship have been forming ethnic militias in cities east of the Urals. They now are going to be assisted by officers from Kyrgyzstan, raising the likelihood of new and larger clashes between these migrant groups and Russian nationalists, such as the Russian Community (Window on Eurasia, October 23; see EDM, October 15, 29). The danger of such clashes was highlighted last month in a suburb of Chelyabinsk, where Russian nationalist groups fought with Roma, who had taken control of local administrative bodies. This tension is increasingly found across Russia, where non-ethnic Russians, immigrant or indigenous communities, have assumed sufficient control over local institutions and feel free to ignore Russian laws and practices. This problem is only going to get worse, Russian journalist Kirill Shulika says. 'It is not surprising that already various groups such as ‘the Russian Community’ have emerged to assume the role of militias' and that these will grow as veterans of the war in Ukraine return home. (On that prospect more generally, see Window on Eurasia, September 15, 2023.) Moscow has been searching for some solution but has remained uncertain, although the agreement with the Kyrgyzstan interior ministry suggests it may now act on that more generally. Those who assume that the local police can handle this spreading problem are profoundly wrong. Instead, the fighting is likely to be not between the police and the closed diasporas but between the closed diasporas and militias that neither Moscow nor the regional governments will be able to control. If Moscow cannot come up with a more effective strategy, Shulika suggests, these trends will open the way to a war that will shake the Russian Federation to its foundations (Rosbalt, October 29). Moscow’s decision to allow interior ministry officers from foreign countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, to try to take control of this situation is an effort in that direction. Both that the Kremlin is feeding demands among immigrants for the formation of their own militias and that Russian officials are playing all this down suggest that such Russian invitations to foreign police forces are an act of desperation. Moscow will either have to reverse course or face even more problems ahead. Despite all the Putin regime’s coercive resources, it is unavoidable that Moscow is losing control of the streets and districts of Russian cities to militias, both Russian and non-Russian.

Japan: Shigeru Ishiba Reconfirmed As Prime Minister Amid Politica...	By Pratnashree Basu Japan’s domestic politics are experiencing a turbulent phase with a loss of public support for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has been in power since the Second World War. This loss of support can be attributed to ongoing inflation and rising costs of living, political corruption, an ageing society and a shrinking workforce. The results of the recent elections in late October reflect public frustration, with the LDP losing a majority vote share for the first time in a decade, prompting a special National Diet session on 11 November to elect the country’s Prime Minister. The LDP’s support rating dropped significantly, with Shigeru Ishiba’s cabinet’s approval falling as low as 34 percent in recent polls, prompting the LDP to court the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) for parliamentary support ahead of the prime ministerial vote on 11 November. Though the Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner Komeito retained the largest bloc in Japan’s recent election, they lost their lower house majority held since 2012, leaving Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reliant on smaller opposition parties to advance his policies. This fragility was highlighted when Ishiba’s confirmation vote went to a runoff for the first time in 30 years, reflecting tenuous support within the National Diet. Nonetheless, as the party with the most votes, Japanese lawmakers reconfirmed Shigeru Ishiba as Prime Minister in the special Diet session. Why Ishiba called for snap elections Ishiba’s decision to hold snap elections on 27 October 2024 was driven by the ongoing party finance scandal, involving unreported political funds, that had already weakened support for the LDP. To avoid further erosion of confidence, Ishiba aimed to dissolve the Diet immediately after fulfilling formal obligations, including his administration policy speech and responding to party representatives' questions. The quick election was intended to secure public confidence before the administration’s image deteriorated further, as it was crucial for the LDP not only to retain a majority but also to avoid losing seats, as the prolonged debate over the scandal could lead to more losses. The LDP, which has governed Japan for a decade despite frequent leadership changes, was poised to winagain due to low voter turnout and a divided opposition. This, along with support from its coalition partner, Komeito, made their victory highly likely. Relying on Komeito to secure a majority gives the party more influence over the LDP’s policies. Komeito has historically resisted some of the LDP's hawkish security measures, such as acquiring longer-range missiles and lifting restrictions on weapons exports, which have prevented Japan from sending arms to Ukraine or Southeast Asian nations opposing China's claims in the South China Sea. The general election was thus a critical test for PM Ishiba. The main opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), had just chosen Yoshihiko Noda as its leader and was believed to be ill-prepared for the election, especially with the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) contesting over a hundred constituencies. This split the opposition vote, potentially reducing seat losses for the LDP. A majority win would have strengthened Ishiba’s position within the LDP and could have boosted public support, helping to mitigate the fallout from the party finance scandal. Many LDP members of parliament (MP), therefore, backed the early election to swiftly stabilize the political landscape. The road ahead However, the general election left the country in political uncertainty, primarily due to unexpected losses for the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Ishiba. The failure to secure a majority in the lower house of parliament marked a significant shift in Japan's political landscape. This election, triggered by Ishiba’s attempt to consolidate power amid scandals surrounding political funds, resulted in gains for opposition parties such as the CDP and the DPP. While the LDP and Komeito won the most seats in the election, they must now rely on smaller opposition parties to pass legislation, signalling a tenuous and complicated road that the administration must now navigate. This new dynamic has a range of implications. For one, it could stymie the legislative progress, impacting policy continuity on key issues like economic recovery, security, and defence reforms—particularly as Japan seeks to bolster its defence capabilities in light of regional tensions in the Indo-Pacific. The election also raises uncertainties about the Bank of Japan’s ongoing monetary tightening, as any political reshuffling can interfere with planned financial policies aimed at tackling Japan’s economic challenges like inflation. Additionally, the political instability may strain Japan’s external relations and its commitments to regional security cooperation, especially with allies like the United States. These developments come at a time when Japan faces critical security challenges related to China's assertive posture in the East China Sea and the broader Indo-Pacific​. Ishiba is expected to introduce a new cabinet soon with Keisuke Suzuki likely to be the justice minister, Taku Eto as agriculture minister, and Komeito’s Hiromasa Nakano as land minister. Other posts will likely be retained by members from Ishiba’s previous cabinet. Ishiba’s immediate challenges include finalising a supplementary budget to address rising costs of living, likely needing backing from the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) whose leader, Yuichiro Tamaki, is also facing personal scandals. While the disunity among opposition parties, which are divided on major issues and failed to rally around an alternative candidate for prime minister, may prove to serve as an advantage for him, Ishiba certainly has a difficult road ahead. Party lawmakers are also reportedly pressuring Prime Minister Ishiba to consider resigning after next spring’s budget clears. With Upper House elections scheduled for next year, the ruling coalition's slim majority may further weaken unless Ishiba can rebuild public trust, which the finance scandal has shaken. LDP Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama addressed criticism regarding the party’s response to the political funds scandal, emphasizing that it was managed rigorously. He noted, however, that the LDP has struggled to convey this to the public, who perceive the issue as involving 'slush funds' and 'tax evasion.' With Ishiba set to continue as the Prime Minister, Japan’s previous foreign and security policies are likely to continue. However, domestically, Japan’s political future will depend significantly on the ability of the ruling coalition or any new alliances to stabilize the government, navigate internal divisions, and build a coherent policy framework in a politically fragmented Diet.

Transatlantic Energy Security From A Baltic Perspective – Analysi...	By Justina Budginaite-Froehly (FPRI) -- Years before Russia started its full-scale war against Ukraine, the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, correctly assessing the Russian threat, implemented far-reaching reforms to end their energy dependence on Russia. Successful implementation of multiple infrastructural projects and energy market liberalization significantly improved Baltic energy security. It made the region a role model for the rest of Europe. Further energy security upgrades are planned in the coming months when the Baltic states will desynchronize their electricity grids from the Russia-controlled IPS/UPS electricity system in February 2025. While celebrating these noteworthy achievements, the Baltic states and their NATO allies should be aware of the potential increase in Russian gray zone activities that could be directed against further consolidation of the European energy security stronghold in the Baltics. Baltic Energy Security Upgrades In terms of energy security, the Baltic states were an isolated energy island until 2014. Having no access to European electricity and gas networks and being heavily dependent on energy imports from Russia, they were exposed to Russia’s political blackmailing and interference in domestic politics. The game-changer was Lithuania’s decision to install an LNG terminal on its Baltic coast. Despite active pressure from Russia, Lithuania successfully implemented the project and at the same time carried out far-reaching reforms to liberalize its gas market, forcing Russia’s Gazprom out of the Lithuanian energy sector. Similar, albeit less principled, measures were also taken in Latvia and Estonia. While being quite an unusual project at a time when most of the European countries were still comfortable with fostering and even deepening their energy 'partnerships' with Russia (Germany’s decision to install the Nord Stream 2 pipeline serves as the best example), the Lithuanian LNG terminal brought the full spectrum of positive effects from short-term gas price reductions to the long-term ability to serve regional and broader European energy security interests. The Baltic states’ geo-economic shift in terms of energy supplies was remarkable. Having covered all its natural gas needs with imports from Russia back in 2013, Lithuania, followed by Latvia and Estonia, became the first European country to ban all Russian gas imports, including its LNG, in April 2022 as a reaction to the invasion of Ukraine. Other European countries, despite Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine, remain eager consumers of Russian gas and have even increased the import volumes of Russian LNG by 11% year over year in the first half of 2024. The fully operational LNG infrastructure in the Lithuanian seaport Klaipėda and well-established partnerships with LNG suppliers, mostly from the US and Norway, enabled Lithuania’s, and the wider Baltic region’s, principled energy policy and their smooth transition from Russia to other gas suppliers. Having become one of the first European importers of US LNG in 2017, Lithuania’s LNG imports from the US peaked in 2022, making the US the leading LNG supplier for Lithuania and setting a clear sign that increased transatlantic cooperation was the right answer to Russia’s aggression and destabilization attempts. In the first six months of 2024, Lithuania’s LNG imports were almost equally split between the US and Norway as the two main suppliers. In addition to the Lithuanian LNG terminal that symbolically holds the name 'Independence,' further infrastructural upgrades in the Baltics followed, strengthening the region’s leading role in European energy security efforts even further. The recent completion of the Enhancement of Latvia-Lithuania interconnection project (ELLI) provided Lithuania with better access to the Inčukalns underground gas storage (UGS) in Latvia, which is unique in the region, serving the function of a crucial gas backup facility. The Baltic countries fill the storage in summer when gas prices are low to avoid gas shortages in winter when both gas consumption and its prices increase significantly. At the same time, the bidirectional ELLI pipeline allows increasing gas flows from the Lithuanian LNG terminal to Latvia and Estonia. The importance of the Gas Interconnection Poland–Lithuania (GIPL), which has been operational since May 2022, cannot be overstated. The bidirectional pipeline serves as the key element of the European North-South gas corridor connecting the Baltic region and Finland with Continental Europe. It further diversifies the Baltic countries’ gas import routes and opens new possibilities for exploiting Lithuania’s LNG terminal as an entry point for LNG to the European gas market. A recent agreement between Slovakia and Poland to bring LNG originating from the US through the Klaipėda LNG terminal, where Poland’s oil and gas company Orlen has secured long-term capacity, and further onwards through GIPL and the Vyrava interconnector between Poland and Slovakia from January 2025, marks the changing geo-economic realities in the region. Instead of using the traditional East-West interconnection originating in Russia and going through Ukraine, Slovakia will be supplied with natural gas from the North for the first time by using this new route. This is a crucial step forward for the country as its traditional gas supply route originating in Russia and passing Ukraine in transit counts its last days as the gas transit contract between Russia and Ukraine comes to an end on January 1, 2025. Beyond dismantling dependencies on Russian gas, the Baltic states are about to get rid of remaining links with Russia in the electricity sector, too. Currently, the Baltic countries are connected to Russia on the power system level, but in February 2025, they will disconnect their grids from the so-called BRELL electricity ring, which has provided unified terms for grid operation in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, and Russia within the Russia-controlled centralized dispatch of Integrated Power System/Unified Power System (IPS/UPS). After a decade-long preparation, the Baltic states will finally synchronize their electricity grids with the Continental European Network (CEN). To achieve this goal, multiple power interconnectors with Finland (Estlink 1 and 2), Sweden (NordBalt), and Poland (LitPol Link) have been installed on- and offshore, allowing the Baltic states to halt electricity trade with Russia and Belarus. All of these changes in the Baltic energy landscape have significantly increased regional and European energy security. But exactly because of their central role in consolidating the North-South energy corridor that will contribute to eliminating Russia’s role as an energy supplier to Europe, the new infrastructural installations — Klaipeda LNG terminal, gas pipelines, and power cables — risk becoming a target of Russian gray zone activities. Russia and its allies China and Belarus already have a long list of hybrid involvement in the Baltic states and Poland that ranges from damaging Balticconnector, an underwater gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia, to orchestrating a migrant crisis in the border region between Belarus, Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania, among multiple other hostile actions. Kaliningrad as a Security Factor for the Baltics In light of current energy security upgrades in the Baltic states, Russia can be expected to try to exploit any opportunity to harm their progress in advancing the consolidation of the North-South energy corridor. The fact that the last ties of the Baltic states to Russia are cut might provide additional motivation for Russia to increase its hybrid activities in the region. The Kaliningrad exclave, with its geography and high militarization level constituting a permanent security threat to the Baltic states, might become an important focal point in this respect. With the Baltic states’ energy supply routes switching from the East-West to North-South, the Kaliningrad exclave is becoming an isolated energy island. Situated on the Baltic coast between Lithuania and Poland and separated from mainland Russia by the territories of Lithuania and Belarus, Kaliningrad is traditionally supplied with energy through the Lithuanian territory. It is also (still) an integral part of the BRELL electricity ring via the Baltic states’ grids, but with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia leaving the BRELL agreement in February 2025, Kaliningrad will be left to operate in an isolated regime. In preparation for desynchronization by the Baltic states, isolated operation tests have been carried out annually in the Kaliningrad power grid since 2019. Even though the official Russian position states that the exclave is ready for the upcoming changes, the fact that the power system stability in Russia and Kaliningrad will not be tied to the situation in the Baltics anymore might encourage Russia to increase its pressure on the Baltics through provocations and sabotage. One of the most likely Russian hostile measures is expected to be oriented toward testing the Baltic states’ and NATO’s resilience to increased levels of propaganda, accentuating the need to defend the economic and security interests of Kaliningrad amid the shifting geo-economic realities in the region. Similar claims concerning the enforcement of EU sanctions on the supply of certain goods to Kaliningrad via Lithuania by rail have already caused unrest in the EU. Increased attempts to sabotage Baltic energy infrastructure can be expected a year later when Lithuania’s long-term gas transit contract with Gazprom will run out in December 2025. After losing its stable pipeline gas supply through the Lithuanian territory, Kaliningrad will be exclusively supplied by Russian LNG through the Kaliningrad LNG terminal and supported by an underground gas storage facility. This will increase the presence of Russian LNG vessels in the Baltic Sea, leading to the growing risk of targeted damage to the Baltic states’ offshore energy infrastructure. Given the exclave’s proximity to the NATO members Lithuania and Poland, other security risks, such as increased spying attempts as witnessed in the case of the Russian shadow oil fleet off the coast of Gotland, should also be taken into consideration. Conclusion Two main conclusions can be drawn from the Baltic success story in transforming the region into a European energy security stronghold. First, the transatlantic partnership in the energy domain is crucial for Europe in changing its gas trade patterns. With stable imports of US LNG, the North-South energy corridor has emerged as a strategically important solution for energy security issues in Central and Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. It is, therefore, fatally wrong to halt new gas export permits for US LNG exporting companies in such a crucial stage of geo-economic re-orientation in Europe. Second, energy security strategies are only semi-mature if they are not backed with appropriate measures of energy infrastructure protection. Although NATO is moving in the right direction strengthening its role in this area, there is still much room left for Russia’s malign strategies, especially in the contested Baltic Sea, where Russia’s concerns over the energy security of Kaliningrad might soon emerge as a new justification for its increased presence along the Baltic shores. It is clear that for the Baltic energy security stronghold to withhold the pressures from Russia and expand toward consolidating the North-South energy corridor in Europe, the transatlantic commitment to shared political, economic, and security goals must adapt to a new security environment while pro-actively pursuing its strategically important geo-economic agenda.

Sri Lanka’s Political Elite Fails To Gatekeep Change – Analysis	By Roshni Kapur The victory of Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Sri Lanka’s 21 September 2024 presidential elections signals more than a domestic shift towards anti-incumbency and popular discontent with mainstream politics. It also reflects a global trend where non-elite actors are disrupting established institutions by assuming power and promising to bring deep structural change. In Sri Lanka’s case, traditional political gatekeepers were unable to prevent the National People’s Power (NPP) party’s rise to power. Dissanayake’s victory marks a fundamental shift in Sri Lankan politics. In an unprecedented move, neither of the two main parties — the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, or their alliances or political offshoots — managed to regain power. Previously on the fringes of mainstream politics, the NPP has promised to change the political culture by ending patronage, corruption, authoritarianism, public sector waste and poor decision-making. Dissanayake is the leader of both the NPP and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a former insurgent group that attempted to capture state power through rebellion in the 1970s and 1980s. The JVP transformed into a mainstream political party under new leadership in the 1990s and its decision to establish the NPP in 2019 represents a strategic rebranding to distance itself from its turbulent past. As head of the party, Dissanayake exemplifies this new generation of reformist young leaders committed to democratic processes, with his assumption of power marking the start of a new political culture that promises to be inclusive, representative and democratic. The NPP’s electoral transformation is noteworthy. After securing little more than three per cent of votes in the 2019 presidential elections, Dissanayake won the competitive contest of the 2024 elections. This turnaround stems from several factors. Although democratic backsliding has been taking place for years in Sri Lanka, the militarisation and further centralisation of power during COVID-19 has greatly eroded civil liberties and democratic freedoms, leading to further deterioration of social, political and economic crises. The Aragalaya protest movement in 2022 triggered a fundamental shift, managing to compel former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down. But it lacked the political power to bring institutionalised change and enabled Rajapaksa’s successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, to use repressive measures and revive the old order. Yet the movement’s momentum continued, enabling the NPP to advance demands for political change through democratic processes. Repeated postponements of local government polls gave the NPP time to strengthen its presidential campaign and ascend as a formidable electoral contender. The NPP’s strong anti-corruption campaign also allowed the party to effectively position itself as the champion of a principled political order. Leveraging strong anti-incumbency sentiment and public mistrust of the dominant elite and state institutions that are seen as corrupt, self-serving and deeply politicised, the NPP promised to transform state institutions and reverse decades of institutional decay. The rise of a political contender from a non-traditional party is not unique to Sri Lanka but part of a wider pattern occurring in many democratic states which has seen power shifting from mainstream actors to newcomers outside of elite politics. These newcomers challenge the legitimacy of traditional elites by accusing them of corruption, nepotism and patronage, convincing their support base that the current order lacks democratic and inclusive values. Political elites usually employ two strategies to prevent a loss of power and relevance. They might attempt to harness the newcomer’s potential and outmanoeuvre political rivals through co-option, though this type of devil’s bargain usually benefits the outsider by providing them with sufficient support to become legitimate actors in a bid to govern. Alternatively, political elites gatekeep by spreading false or exaggerated narratives to marginalise a political outsider, including by forging alliances with rivals to prevent the novice from entering mainstream politics. This tactic was used in Sri Lanka — false narratives were spread that the NPP had instigated violence during the Aragalaya and that it intends to monopolise all sectors. But these propaganda tools were unsuccessful in socially and politically marginalising the NPP. The JVP’s transformation from an insurgent group into a political party and the subsequent formation of the NPP not only showcases its resilience to survive as a social entity but also its ability to adapt to changing domestic and global shifts. The NPP understands that it needs to go beyond its core voter base to gain broader support, including by adopting a more inclusive approach to overcome decades of deep mistrust within minority groups. Despite the inter-ethnic and inter-religious solidarity during the 2022 protest movement, the country continues to be divided along ethnic and linguistic lines. Dissanayake’s government is currently enjoying a honeymoon period that could bring a marginal victory at the upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for 14 November 2024. But there are doubts on whether the NPP can secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority and more broadly, whether the government will continue the path of constitutional and political reforms or lose momentum as elite actors seek to delegitimise it. These actors will likely stress the NPP’s lack of political experience and the JVP’s violent past as the party attempts to lead the country to full economic recovery, navigate great power relations and strengthen engagement with minority groups.

Biden’s Economic Time Bomb: A Warning To Trump – OpEd	By Daniel Lacalle The insane neo-Keynesian policies implemented by the Biden-Harris administration have created persistent inflation and record levels of debt with two objectives: to bloat Gross Domestic Product and jobs with public spending and government jobs. The United States’ insane inflation is solely due to out-of-control spending and currency printing. Corporations, wars, or supply chains cannot cause aggregate prices to rise, nor can they consolidate the increase even at a slower pace. Although this can have an impact on individual prices, the only factor that causes aggregate prices to rise year after year is the decline in the value of the US dollar that the government issues. Over 20.5% accumulated inflation over the past four years, government deficit spending has reached nearly $2 trillion annually despite record tax receipts and a growing economy, public debt has reached almost $36 trillion, and the monthly job figure includes an astonishing 43,000 new government jobs each month. In 2023, nearly 25% of all job gains were government ones, and the entirety of the growth of the labor force in the past four years came from foreign workers. The latest jobs figure is so poor it seems disingenuous to blame it on hurricanes and strikes, as if economists and forecasters had not considered those two factors in their estimates. Furthermore, the only factor that continued to increase uncontrollably was the number of government jobs, adding 40,000 new positions to an overall total of just 12,000 jobs. No wonder the labor participation rate and employment-to-population ratios remain below 2019 levels. Furthermore, in the latest GDP figure, government spending accounted for 30% of the annualized growth, while investment was basically stagnant. In the past nine quarters, government spending has been one of the top drivers of GDP growth, and its contribution to GDP in the third quarter of 2024 was the largest in a year. This is upside-down economics in full swing. Private sector investment weakness, higher taxes for the productive economy and government spending and debt driving the economy. Of course, this never ends well. The Harris-Biden administration arrived in January 2021, when the economy was bouncing back strongly. Instead of allowing the private sector to thrive, it embarked on a strategy of out-of-control spending and tax increases with two objectives: increase the size of government in the economy so much that the next administration would be unable to reduce it enough in four years. The second objective was to bloat growth and job figures so aggressively that the next administration will see a recession if it reduces public sector growth. You may ask yourself why they would do it if Harris intended to win the elections. If Kamala Harris wins, she will continue to expand the size of government, inflate prices through spending and printing, and blame companies and stores for these actions. The Biden-Harris administration has left a massive time bomb for Trump and Elon Musk’s government efficiency office if they win. It will be almost impossible to avoid a recession if they cut discretionary spending and eliminate duplicate jobs. It is the same strategy that the socialists followed in Greece, Spain, and France, by the way. However, the socialist strategy may backfire. The evidence is that citizens do not value Biden’s policies and the state of the economy. The approval rate regarding the economy is atrociously low, 39.8%, according to RCP. United States citizens do not believe that they are better off than in January 2021. Inflation, immigration, and rising taxes have crippled small businesses and families. Furthermore, a strong pro-growth strategy and lower taxes will likely boost the dormant investment figure, create jobs in the private sector, and help small businesses achieve critical mass and grow. In Argentina, Milei recognized the necessary actions and cautioned the citizens about the inevitable reduction of the bloated state. The Kirchner socialists left a more significant time bomb legacy than what Trump might inherit. The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Lower inflation led to lower taxation, an eight-month budget surplus, and rapidly improving public finances. The biggest risk for the United States economy and the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency is out-of-control public spending and constant currency printing added to tax hikes. Healing public finances and reducing government jobs may have a temporary negative impact on GDP, but higher exports, investment, and private sector jobs will likely compensate for it, and the result will be better for the US dollar and American citizens. More government is always poorer citizens. The potential of the United States economy’s private sector is much greater than the short-term negative impact of efficiency and budget control on headline GDP.

Malaysia Energy Profile: Second-Highest Producer Of Petroleum And...	Malaysia is the second-highest producer of petroleum and other liquids in Southeast Asia and the fifth-highest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) globally in 2023. Malaysia is strategically located in the South China Sea and borders the Malacca Strait, both of which are important maritime routes for energy trade.1 Malaysia’s oil and natural gas production is expected to peak at 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) in 2024, according to national oil company Petronas.2 This would be an increase of just over 200,000 BOE/d from the 1.79 million BOE/d produced in 2023.3 Malaysia’s national oil company Pertonas, with Enilive and Euglena, will build Petronas’s first biorefinery. The biorefinery, which will be located at the Pengerang Integrated Complex, will produce 12,500 barrels per day (b/d) of sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel. Construction will begin at the end of 2024, and commercial operation is slated to start in 2028.4 According to Malaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap, Malaysia plans to achieve a 70% share of installed electricity generation capacity for renewable energy by 2050. The government estimates it will need $143 billion in investments to meet its target. To help develop its renewable sector, Malaysia lifted its ban on renewable energy exports that it initiated in 2021.5 The increase in demand for renewable energy from foreign markets will prompt development of domestic renewable generation capacity on a larger scale to meet the higher demand. Petroleum and other liquids In 2023, Malaysia had proved oil reserves of 2.7 billion barrels—the second-largest oil reserve in the Southeast Asia. Although reserves have declined since 2022, there were 19 new discoveries in 2023, which could add over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to Petronas. Of these discoveries, 16 are located in the Sarawak state, and 3 are in the Sabah state.7 Following the Malaysia Bid Round 2023 (MBR 2023), six production sharing contracts and one discovered resource opportunity (DRO) were awarded. A DRO is an opportunity where a company can obtain the rights to an undeveloped discovery from a government to invest in its development. All offshore blocks for MBR 2023 in Sarawak and Northwest Sabah Basins are now licensed as a result of this bid round.8 In the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021–2025), the government outlined its plan to reduce carbon intensity economy-wide by 45% from 2005 levels against gross domestic product (GDP) and to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To support these goals, Petronas plans to cap operational emissions at 49.5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in its Malaysian operations by the end of 2024. Petronas and its subsidies has also targeted a 50% reduction from 2019 levels in methane emissions from its natural gas value chain by 2025.9 Block nameCompanyBlock PM342Petronas; E&P Malaysia VentureBlock PM428Jadestone Energy; PetronasBlock SK330Petronas; E&P Malaysia Venture; Petroleum Sarawak E&PBlock SK510Petronas; INPEX Malaysia E&P; Pertamina; Petroleum Sarawak E&PBlock 5EShell; Petronas; Petroleum Sarawak E&PBlock SB403Petronas; E&P Malaysia Venture; SMJ EnergyBamabazon ClusterE&P O&M ServicesData source: World Oil From 2024 through 2026, Petronas expects more than 25 wells (oil and natural gas) to be drilled per year. The Penisular Malaysia and Sarawak will be the focus of shallow water wells, and deepwater wells will be in Sabah.10 Malaysia’s petroleum and other liquids production declined from 2017 to 2023—to 597,000 barrels per day (b/d)—due to maturing fields.11 After a dip in 2020, Malaysia’s petroleum and other liquids consumption returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, driven mainly by a rebound increased gasoline demand.12 Malaysia had a refining capacity of 997,000 b/d in 2023.14 By 2034, proposed projects could add an additional 181,000 b/d of capacity.15 Name of siteCompanyCrude oil refining capacity(thousand barrels per day) KemamanKemaman Bitumen30Port DicksonHengyuan Refining Company156KertehPetronas121Melaka (PSR-1)Petronas100Melaka (PSR-2)Petronas170PengerangPetronas300Port DicksonSan Miguel/Petron85Total 997Data source: FACTS Global Energy, Asia Pacific Databook 2: Refinery Configuration, Spring 2024 Natural gas At the end of 2023, Malaysia had proved natural gas reserves of 32 trillion cubic feet (Tcf).16 Although lower than the 2014 peak of 101 Tcf, reserves have increased since 2018 as a result of new discoveries.17 Malaysia’s natural gas production increased in 2022 to an all-time high of 2.7 Tcf,18 which was the result of developing both brownfield and greenfield projects.19 The Jerun gas field, located off the shore of Sarawak, northwest of Bintulu, was brought online by SapuraOMV in 2024. According to SampuraOMV, the project will reach peak production in 2030 at 550 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas and 15,000 b/d of condensate. The project will supply the Petronas LNG complex in Bintulu via a 50-mile pipeline.20 The complex consists of MLNG Satu, MLNG Dua, MLNG Tiga, and MLNG T9. Shell operates the Timi natural gas project, which is located in Sarawak. Shell expects the project to produce 300 MMcf/d at peak production. The natural gas will support a production hub, located off the shore of Sarawak, via a 50-mile pipeline. Commercial production is slated to start in 2025.21 The Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area is located in the Gulf of Thailand and overseen by the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority; each country has 50% ownership of the area’s resources. The area produced natural gas for both Malaysia and Thailand and is linked to Malaysia via the Peninsular Gas Utilization (PGU) pipeline network.22 The industrial sector’s natural gas consumption share surpassed the power sector’s share in 2017 and has remained the top natural gas-consuming sector since that year. The Malaysia natural gas pipeline network, which has helped the manufacturing sector grow, is a major supplier for industrial natural gas consumption. Residential, commercial, and transportation sectors together have accounted for less than 1.5% of natural gas consumption per year from 2013 to 2022.23 Malaysia has one of the most extensive natural gas pipeline networks in Asia. Much of the natural gas pipeline network is located in Peninsular Malaysia and is known as the Peninsular Gas Utilization (PGU) pipeline network. The PGU is 1,630 miles long and can transport 3,500 MMcf/d. The network transports processed natural gas to the power sector and to non-power end-use sectors and exports natural gas to Singapore. The four entry points into the PGU are in Kertih, Pengerang, Sungai Udang, and Thailand.24 A floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) vessel called ZFLNG is under development off the shore of Sabah. The facility’s liquefaction capacity is 2 million metric tons per year, and its completion is set for 2027.25 Petronas and MISC Group signed an agreement in October 2023 that will convert a 4.9-million-cubic-foot LNG shipping vessel into floating storage for the Pengerang LNG terminal. The conversion is scheduled to be completed by 2025.26 Malaysia has limited coal resources. Its reserves were 249 million short tons in 2022.27 Nearly 99% of the reserves are located in Sarawak, and the remainder is in Sabah.28 In 2022, coal made up 21% of Malaysia’s primary energy consumption.29 Under the National Energy Policy 2022–2040, Malaysia’s goal is to reduce coal’s share of primary energy supply to 17% by 2040.30 Malaysia’s coal production decreased 4% in 2023. This came after an increase of almost 20% the previous year, from 3.4 million short tons in 2021 to a record 4 million short tons in 2022.31 Electricity Malaysia’s electricity generation increased 8% from 2021 to 194 terawatthours in 2022. Fossil fuels made up 81% of all electricity generated in 2022, and non-hydroelectric renewables made up less than 2%. Although total generation increased in 2022, the increase was dispersed evenly across most generation sources.32 In 2022, Malaysia pledged not to build any new coal power plants after 2040. In 2021, they created a phase-out plan to reduce existing coal capacity by 50% by 2035 and completely by 2044.33 Currently, 5 coal-fired power plant projects are under development, which are slated to come online by 2031 and will add 11.7 gigawatts (GW) of capacity.34 In April 2024, Malaysia’s government announced its intention to create the Energy Exchange Malaysia (ENEGEM) to export electricity from renewable sources to other Southeast Asian countries. ENEGEM aligns with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) goals of an integrated power grid among Southeast Asian countries.35 Malaysia’s installed electricity capacity remained relatively flat in 2022; it increased less than 1% from 2021 levels. All added capacity came from growth in solar installations.36 Energy Trade Malaysia’s crude oil and condensate exports decreased by 14% in 2023 from 2022. The largest declines by importing countries were China and India, which represent a combined decrease of 29,000 b/d.37 Virtually all of Malaysia’s crude oil and condensate exports in 2023 went to the Asia Pacific region. Southeast Asia was responsible for 52% of imports.38 Malaysia imported almost 1.2 million b/d of petroleum product imports in 2023, a 3% increase from the previous year. Asia was the source for 58% of all petroleum product imports.39 Fuel oil (28%) accounted for the largest share of petroleum product imports in 2023, followed by diesel (25%) and gasoline (20%).40 Malaysia also exported 1.3 million b/d of petroleum products in 2023, a 7% increase from the previous year. The Asia Pacific region was the destination for 79% of all petroleum product exports.41 Diesel (24%) accounted for the largest share of exports in 2023, followed by fuel oil (20%) and biodiesel (19%).42 Natural Gas In 2023, Malaysia exported 85 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas to Singapore via pipeline.43 Malaysia’s LNG exports declined 7% from 2022 to 1.3 Tcf in 2023. Although Japan still receives the largest share of Malaysia LNG exports, in 2023, Japan imported approximately 90 Bcf less than in 2022.44 Electricity Malaysia’s electricity exports significantly increased after 2016. The increase was driven by a power trading project established in 2016, between Sarawak Energy Berhad and Indonesia’s state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara. The power is exported through the 275 kV Sarawak-West Kalimatan Interconnection. In October 2021, Malaysia banned the export of renewable energy which may account for some of the decrease in exports in 2021 and 2022. The ban was lifted in May 2023 to attract more development in its renewable sector.45 Coal In 2023, Malaysia’s coal imports increased almost 10% from 2022 to 42 million short tons. Most imports came from the Asia Pacific region (91%). Malaysia increased its imports of Indonesia’s coal to 31 million short ton in 2023, up approximately 3 million short tons from 2022.46 Source: This article was published by EIA Endnotes: U.S. Energy Information Administration, International Energy Statistics; International Gas Union, 2024 World LNG Report, page 24.

More Countries Sign Declaration To Triple Nuclear Capacity	At the COP29 UN climate change conference taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan, six more countries - El Salvador, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kosovo, Nigeria and Turkey - have added their support for the tripling of global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. During COP28 - held in Dubai, UAE, in December last year - 25 countries backed a Ministerial Declaration calling for the tripling of global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The heads of state, or senior officials, from Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Ghana, Hungary, Jamaica, Japan, South Korea, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, the UAE, the UK and the USA signed the declaration on 2 December, with Armenia and Croatia also signing up during the summit. The declaration says the countries recognise the need for a tripling of nuclear energy capacity to achieve 'global net-zero greenhouse gas/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century and in keeping a 1.5°C limit on temperature rise within reach'. It also recognises that 'new nuclear technologies could occupy a small land footprint and can be sited where needed, partner well with renewable energy sources and have additional flexibilities that support decarbonisation beyond the power sector, including hard-to-abate industrial sectors'. On Wednesday, in an event co-organised by the COP29 Presidency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the USA and World Nuclear Association, a further six countries signed the declaration. This brings the total number of countries endorsing the declaration to triple to 31. Kazakhstan's Ministry of Energy said the country's signing of the declaration 'demonstrates its commitment to sustainable development goals and its desire to make a significant contribution to combating climate change. Nuclear energy is considered one of the key components of Kazakhstan's energy balance, which will allow the country to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, increase the share of clean energy sources and ensure reliable energy supply.' 'We warmly welcome these six new countries to the Coalition of the Ambitious,' said World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León. 'Today's announcement highlights the essential role of nuclear energy in meeting the Paris Agreement goals in a cost-effective and equitable manner. 'Leadership requires a clear-eyed assessment of the here and now, but also the foresight to prepare for what the world will need not only in 2050, but in the decades after. The signatories to this declaration are making a long-term commitment. But it is a long-term commitment with a long-term pay off, providing energy certainty and reliability in an uncertain world.' World Nuclear Association noted the announcement 'is the latest moment of recognition for the essential role of nuclear energy in achieving net-zero emissions'. On Tuesday at COP, the US Administration issued a roadmap outlining plans for the deployment of 200 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050. Other recent developments have included the recognition of nuclear energy - for the first time in a major COP decision - among the solutions needed to keep the 1.5-degree goal within reach, as part of last year's Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement. In March, the IAEA and Belgium co-chaired the first Nuclear Energy Summit, in which countries highlighted the role of nuclear energy in reducing the use of fossil fuels, enhancing energy security, and boosting economic development. In September, at New York Climate Week, 14 of the world's largest banks and financial institutions from five countries signalled their support for tripling global nuclear capacity. 'Nuclear can now count on the world's biggest banks to back the growth of the nuclear industry,' Bilbao y León said. 'Nuclear has attracted the interest and investment of the world's largest and most advanced technology companies. And nuclear has ever-increasing support from the public, who recognise that in nuclear they have an answer to their demands for energy security, reliable supply and prices, and a response to climate change. This is truly a global coalition of the ambitious. And thank you all for being part of it.' World Nuclear Association and the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, with support from the IAEA's Atoms4NetZero and the UK government, launched the Net Zero Nuclear initiative in September 2023 seeking 'unprecedented collaboration between government, industry leaders and civil society' ahead of COP28. The Net Zero Nuclear Industry Pledge, has been endorsed by more than 130 companies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRccCom8yuDXlD	2024-11-13T16:06:26-08:00	
What Do We Know About The Mufti Bill 2024? – Analysis	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof and Minderjeet Kaur A bill introduced in Malaysia’s parliament earlier this year to expand the powers of the muftis – Muslim legal experts – in the federal territories (FT) of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya is expected to be tabled for debate and possible passage within a month. Traditionally, muftis are appointed by state rulers in Malaysia, giving religious authorities significant autonomy. Critics argue the bill could expand to the states in Malaysia, potentially infringing on individual freedoms and intellectual diversity. What is the Mufti Bill 2024? The bill outlines the specific duties and powers of the Department of the Mufti for the Federal Territory. It specifies the mufti’s role in advising the King on Islamic affairs, according to Sirajuddin Suhaimee, Malaysian Islamic Development Department (Jakim) director-general. Currently, Muslim fatwas serve as advisory opinions rather than enforceable law except in cases where they become part of the Sharia Law. However, under the bill’s Article 10, the fatwas could become law without needing parliament’s approval once they are published in the Official Gazette. Sirajuddin told BenarNews that no official date has been set, adding the bill is expected to be tabled before the parliament session ends on Dec. 12. Why are some opposed? While proponents argue the bill would improve the consistency of Islamic rulings throughout Malaysia, critics including northern-state Perlis Mufti Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, called it a move toward unchecked religious authority and a threat to intellectual autonomy. One contentious aspect of the bill is its restriction of Islamic interpretations to only four Sunni schools of thought – Shafi’i, Hanbali, Maliki, and Hanafi – which has drawn particular criticism. Non-Sunni interpretations include Shia and Ahmadi views, which are often seen as deviant in Malaysia. Ahmad Farouk Musa, founder of the Islamic Renaissance Front, a progressive Islamic think-tank, argued that the bill enforces a narrow theological stance, leaving no room for alternative streams of thought. 'There will be no more freedom of conscience in this country. All Muslims [in the country] must adhere to this theology of the state,' he told BenarNews. 'I thought that the government celebrates diversity. But in actual fact, we are killing that diversity with the bill.' Meanwhile, Sisters in Islam (SIS), a women’s rights group, warned that legally binding fatwas could result in punishments for actions not criminalized under secular law. 'Fatwas are traditionally advisory, meant to guide Muslims on religious matters – not to be enforced as law,' the group said in a statement. What are implications for states’ rights? The constitution divides religious jurisdiction between federal and state authorities, with the country’s nine sultans overseeing Islamic matters within their states. The federal territories fall under the purview of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Malaysia’s king, who acts as head of Islam in these regions. One constitutional analyst argued the bill does not infringe on states’ rights, as it pertains solely to the federal territories. 'The autonomy of the religious authorities of other states are not affected because they are protected under their respective state constitutions,' Wan Ahmad Fauzi, a constitutional law analyst at the International Islamic University Malaysia, told BenarNews. Does it impact non-Muslims? Although the bill applies only to Muslims, critics argue that an increase in unchecked authority for a religious official could potentially strain interfaith relations. As of mid-2023, Malaysia’s population of 34.2 million was predominantly Muslim (63.5%), with significant Buddhist (18.7%), Christian (9.1%), and Hindu (6.1%) communities. 'The bill’s implications on race relations need careful consideration, given the high percentage of non-Muslims in the FT,' think tank founder Farouk Musa said. Could bill influence political power? Some observers see the bill as a strategy to win over conservative Malay voters who make up over 70% of the population by showing the government’s commitment to the traditional Sunni doctrine, Sunnah Wal Jamaah. 'The government may view passing this bill as a way to gain Malay support, as it reinforces Malaysia’s orthodox Sunni values,' Azmil Mohd Tayeb, a political analyst at Universiti Sains Malaysia, told BenarNews. Analyst Tunku Mohar Mokhtar of the International Islamic University Malaysia had a different take, telling BenarNews the strategy could be seen as overreaching. 'If the bill is designed to gain votes, it may backfire,' he said, pointing out that much of the opposition comes from those aligned with Pakatan Harapan, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s multiethnic coalition. 'It also cannot get votes from [Islamist party] PAS supporters who aren’t into much theological debates.' Is it necessary? Even as government officials defend the bill as an essential update to streamline Islamic governance, many critics remain unconvinced over concerns it risks intensifying bureaucratic control over religious life. 'Yes, we need this bill for better administration of Islamic matters in the federal territories,' analyst Ahmad Fauzi said. In contrast, Farouk Musa sees the bill as 'sectarian and divisive,' adding it is unnecessary and could hinder inclusivity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcbzdeg1qAiu3	2024-11-13T16:04:51-08:00	
Medicare ‘Advantage’ By The Numbers – Analysis	By Emma Curchin, Brandon Novick, and Peter Hart The quasi-privatized system called 'Medicare Advantage,' otherwise known as Part C, was created in 2003 as a means of expanding the role of private sector corporations in the publicly-funded Medicare system. Proponents claimed it would lower costs and improve health care for seniors. It has achieved neither of those goals; instead, MA has become a wildly profitable scheme for private insurance giants, who have become adept at taking advantage of Medicare's billing model to claim exorbitant profits. At this point, MA is more profitable for many companies than their conventional insurance businesses. And the program continues to grow. MA now has more enrollees than traditional Medicare, thanks in no small part to aggressive public relations campaigns that sell seniors on the idea that the plans cut costs and increase choice. Congress has simultaneously failed to plug the holes in traditional Medicare, pushing seniors towards MA to avoid high out-of-pocket costs. Policymakers can fill these gaps and guarantee true comprehensive coverage simply by redirecting the overpayments to MA insurers into Medicare. Numerous studies and media investigations have documented the problems with Medicare Advantage. What follows is a collection of some of the most notable figures documenting the high costs of this failed experiment in privatizing Medicare. $88-$140 billionThe amount that the federal government overpaid private insurers under Medicare Advantage in 2022, according to the Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP). $612 billionThe amount that Medicare Advantage plans overcharged the federal government due to upcoding and favorable selection between 2007 and 2023, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent congressional agency established to advise Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. $600 billionAccording to one study, this is the projected excess spending between 2023 to 2031 due to the ways that Medicare Advantage plans use 'upcoding,' the process of classifying beneficiaries as being sicker than they really are in order to increase payments. $35 billionThe amount that MedPAC estimates taxpayers will overpay MA insurers this year through 'favorable selection,' the practice of targeting healthy seniors for their plans. $4.2 billionThe amount that MA insurers received for questionable home visit health risk assessments (and related chart reviews) in 2023, according to an October 2024 report from the Department of Health and Human Services. 80 percentThe percentage of mental health providers in a sample of MA plans that were determined to be 'ghosts' (meaning they were unreachable, not accepting new patients, or not in-network), according to a recent Senate investigation. 1.8 millionEstimated number of Medicare Advantage customers whose health plans will be canceled in 2025. 167 percentThe amount that drug deductibles will increase for roughly two-thirds of all Medicare Advantage enrollees next year. 55.7 percentThe increase in MA care denials from 2022 to 2023, according to research from the American Hospital Association. 54 percentThe increase in the denial rate for long-term acute care hospitals in Humana's Medicare Advantage plans from 2020 to 2022 (Senate Majority Staff Report, 10/17/24). $660 millionThe amount of taxpayer money that CVS/Aetna stashed away in 2018 by denying Medicare Advantage patients' claims for treatment at inpatient facilities (Senate Majority Staff Report). 78 percentThe percentage of physicians in a 2023 American Medical Association survey who said that Medicare Advantage's prior authorization processes caused a recommended treatment for a patient to be abandoned. $6 billionOne estimate of the amount spent in 2022 on the marketing companies that work to attract new subscribers in Medicare Advantage plans. 556,068The number of English-language TV commercials touting Medicare Advantage that aired during the seven-week open enrollment period in 2022. $50 billionThe amount that the Wall Street Journal estimates private insurers received between 2018 and 2021 for 'hundreds of thousands of questionable diagnoses that triggered extra taxpayer-funded payments.' $2,329The amount that MA insurers receive per beneficiary above the estimated costs of Medicare. $1,730The gross profit margin posted by MA companies in 2021 – more than double their profit margin on the individual market. $172 millionThe amount that Cigna agreed to pay in 2023 to 'resolve allegations that it knowingly submitted and failed to withdraw inaccurate and untruthful diagnosis codes for its Medicare Advantage Plan enrollees to increase its payments from Medicare.' The Justice Department continues to investigate similar allegations involving other MA providers.

Conflict In Amhara Region Threatens To Ignite Another Ethiopian W...	Gun battles in late October shattered the typical tranquility of Debark town, nestled in the foothills of the Semien mountains in Ethiopia’s Amhara region. Months of intense fighting in Ethiopia’s second-largest region have dislodged any sense of peace in the war-torn country, as the federal government struggles with what potentially could be another civil war. While the Pretoria Agreement was intended to end Ethiopia’s conflict in the Tigray region in November 2022, it left unresolved many issues such as decades-old territorial disputes between Amhara and Tigrayan people. 'The peace deal two years ago was supposed to ensure that Ethiopia’s warring parties could mend such rifts through further negotiations rather than violence. But no such talks have materialized,' The Economist magazine wrote in an October 27 article. 'For now, it is no more than a ceasefire — and one that could easily collapse.' After fighting alongside federal forces against the Tigrayans, ethnic Amhara militias known as Fano were told in April 2023 to disarm and integrate with the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF). Rather than comply, Fano unleashed an insurgency by seizing towns and roadways. In late September 2024, federal forces launched an offensive against Fano, ominously declaring it the 'final operation.' The ENDF attacked the militias and briefly entered several towns, including Gondar and Metema. Fighting has escalated since the end of the rainy season, as drier conditions have allowed troops to move more easily, and clearer skies make way for military drones. There were 43 drone attacks and airstrikes in 22 districts across the Amhara region between September 25 and October 24, killing 196 including civilians and injuring 77, according to the Amhara Association of America. The ENDF reportedly has poured tens of thousands of troops into the Amhara region. 'Over the past two weeks, there have been numerous reinforcements (of the federal army) and many arrests of officials suspected of collusion with the Fano,' a security source told Agence France-Presse on the condition of anonymity in early October. While the ENDF has wrestled back control of several towns, it continues to face a resilient foe that enjoys popular support from the Amhara. Fano is less an organized group than it is a fragmented coalition of autonomous militias. The ENDF’s gains have forced Fano fighters to retreat into the mountains and wage guerilla warfare. 'Fano’s decentralized structure makes it hard for it to leverage its strength into political power,' analyst Liam Carr concluded in a September intelligence assessment for the Critical Threats Project. 'A strengthened Fano insurgency increases the risk of ethnic conflict with neighboring regions in Ethiopia, such as Tigray and Oromia, and would affect transnational issues involving Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan that could further destabilize Ethiopia or other areas in the Horn of Africa.' A contingent of the ENDF on October 26 met with members of the Debark community to discuss a path to sustainable peace. The military’s representative, however, blamed Fano for the violence. 'The extremist group that is full of hatred and blind thinking, has brought the people into conflict, robbed their own people and put government development institutions in danger,' Maj. Gen. Amare Gebru, head of Debark command post, said during the gathering, according to the ENDF. Peace talks are unlikely and neither side appears capable of a military victory, according to Adem Abebe, senior advisor on peacebuilding for the Sweden-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. 'The Fano are not ready for peace negotiations,' he told The Africa Report for an October 10 article. 'The government may try and talk to some leaders here and there, but until there is some coordination among Fano, it is going to be very difficult for any individual Fano leader to commit to a peace process publicly. 'I don’t think much will change on the battlefield, but the situation will continue bringing terrible suffering for the people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcTcODhEWHFgj	2024-11-13T15:58:42-08:00	
Liberal Arrogance And Hatred On Display After Trump Victory – OpE...	While Donald Trump is frequently called a fascist and is even compared to Adolph Hitler, some angry democrats are engaging in their own racist and eliminationist rhetoric in the wake of his impending return to the presidency. Their reaction to Trump’s victory reveals that intolerance and bigotry are not unique to Trump and his followers. 'F*** ‘em. I hope they are all deported. And I can’t wait until Netanyahu gets the green light to turn Gaza into a parking lot.' 'Can’t wait for the next Muslim ban. F*** them. They get the president they deserve.' 'I hope every woman who voted for Trump and lives in a no abortion state gets what they wanted. To bleed out in a parking lot due to a miscarriage and no doctor will help you because THAT’S what you voted for. Y’all deserve it.''To the black men in Georgia that voted for Trump next time a cop has their knee on yall necks PLEASE LEAVE US BLACK WOMEN OUT OF IT!' 'Good morning to all my Arab Americans, dearborn Michigan, Palestinian supporters and Gaza pearl clutchers! Black Americans, Black Women & Black Men are done! We won’t donate to your causes or feel sorry about any bombings! We had your back but you turned your back on us!' These are just a few of the missives that angry democrats posted on social media after Kamala Harris was defeated in her campaign against Donald Trump. While every Trump utterance is examined for proof of racism and other forms of bigotry, liberals suddenly became very illiberal after the campaign ended. Many of them literally wished death upon Black men, Latino men, Arabs and anyone they hold responsible for Trump’s return to the white house. The white people who still form the base of his support are somehow exempt from these attacks. While disturbing, these behaviors are not entirely unexpected. Instead of telling their voters how a Harris administration would benefit their lives, her campaign engaged in a propaganda effort, amplifying former Trump officials to attest to his fascist beliefs or resuscitating old stories about his alleged affinity for Hitler and Nazi ideology . If Trump and his supporters are in fact comparable to Nazis then no scorn or condemnation of them is too harsh. But these opinions did not indicate any level of political maturity or analysis. The tit for tat expressions which wished suffering upon others are akin to the worst sloganeering of the MAGA hat wearing Trump followers who are so despised, the 'deplorables' as it were. The people who think of themselves as being more enlightened actually took the time to consider and publicly share their violent sentiments as they wished bombings on civilians or death from abortion bans. Much of the blame falls on the Democratic Party itself which, absent any intention of legislating programs that would help their voters prosper in their material lives, has instead chosen to stoke hatred against republicans. Emotions are substitutes for policy, as the administration which billed itself as the 'most progressive since FDR' allowed covid era stimulus payments, expansions of unemployment insurance, freezes on student loan payments, eviction protection, and SNAP and Medicaid benefits to lapse. There was no action on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act or on the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act which would restore enforcement provisions to the Voting Rights Act. The federal minimum wage didn’t go up and, as Joe Biden promised, Medicare for All was never on the agenda. In the absence of tangible policies to run on, they had nothing but a bipartisan vote to make Juneteenth a national holiday and then tapped into fear mongering against republicans. The end result is not only anger and sadness that Trump will again be president but also a kind of mass psychosis that endlessly repeats that he is a liar who received five draft deferments for bone spurs while never mentioning that Biden also received five draft deferments as a student and a medical exemption for asthma. Trump’s lies are endlessly dissected but not Biden’s campaign promise that he would not permit oil drilling on federal land but did just that in 2023 when he approved the Willow Project in Alaska. Black democrats are particularly confused. Every four years they are barraged with appeals to vote for the 'Black party' and send the republicans, the 'white party' down to defeat. The Republican Party has received the majority of votes from white people in presidential elections since 1964. It is the home of open and unfettered white racist sentiment and action, so the feelings of doom are understandable. But the duopoly trap creates political passivity, encouraging voter participation only in presidential election years while giving a myriad of reasons for telling Black people not to demand anything other than a democrat sitting behind the big desk in the oval office while promising little else in return. In such a system, everyone becomes an enemy. If a democratic presidency is the one and only prize, then every issue that argues against support must be ignored or opposed and anyone raising issues such as the US-funded genocide in Gaza is also an enemy. Palestinians who refuse to support the genocidal Democratic Party which is killing their people are now called the enemies of Black people. Latino support for the democrats falls every election cycle but still, a majority of voters in that group voted for Harris, approximately 53% . No matter. If the media say that Latino men are voting for Trump then liberals conclude they must all be punished by the deportations they claimed to oppose before the election. Of course, only citizens can vote and by definition cannot be deported. The anger defies logic. It is noteworthy that there is a great deal of punching down, but very little punching up. The Democratic Party clearly failed its voters after raising more than $1 billion and still losing to the man they spent so many years vilifying as a liar, buffoon, criminal, and evil incarnate. The not-so-enlightened liberals rarely even questioned how the debacle came about, much less showed anger at the candidate, or the party, or the process by which an unpopular and frail president face planted in a debate before being taken out of the election by rich donors, and replaced by a Vice President without a vote – a Vice President who did not even earn one delegate in earlier primary elections. Liberals also did not challenge the questionable strategy of chasing a handful of 'never Trump' republican votes and spending millions of dollars on concerts with celebrities. One would think that the mental energy needed to conjure up a destroyed Gaza might also manage to ask hard questions of the woman at the top of the ticket. Apparently, Trump is not the only authoritarian in U.S. politics. Democratic voters also believe in a hierarchy that tells them to act like children abused by an unstable parent who demands their silence. Politics is now about feeling superior to others rather than being able to cogently argue against them or defend one’s own position. It is not about asking their betters anything, including why they lost. It seems that the U.S. is full of mean and angry people. Of course, their own government engages in austerity meant to grind them down economically and to deprive them of any political recourse. But the people don’t have to accept this treatment. They don’t have to become the angry mob. The truth is that people in this country have been dehumanized to the point where they lack empathy for others. They also have been kept uninformed and ignorant. Even the liberal professional class, which holds itself up as the best among the population, is just as indoctrinated as thousands of Trumpers on January 6th. Its members do not know how to activate themselves politically, how to struggle with like minded people, or how to make political demands. Seeing oneself as the good group is thought to be enough. Or perhaps these enraged liberals know what they are up against. Despite the celebrity endorsements and happy talk, maybe they know that their party is controlled by an oligarchy that will fight them tooth and nail. They only feel safe spewing vitriol on social media.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcYs8972QQGta	2024-11-13T15:55:53-08:00	
Stunning Defeat Should Prompt Soul-Searching Among Democrats – Op...	By Alon Ben-Meir The Democrats’ stunning electoral defeat will be debated for months if not years. Recrimination and finger-pointing will abound. The Democrats must search their souls, carefully study what went wrong, and develop a compelling new domestic and foreign policy agenda while cooperating with the Republicans on any issue that advances America’s well-being and global leadership Trump won the 2024 election fair and square. Certainly, the economy and immigration played a significant role, aided by gains among younger Black and Hispanic voters as well as inroads in traditionally Democratic urban and suburban areas in the swing states. And Trump’s uncanny skill in portraying himself as the victim of the leftist elite became the mantra of his MAGA followers and the whole Republican party. However, instead of emphasizing the bread-and-butter issues from which the public at large is suffering, the Democrats’ obsession with Trump and their depiction of him as the greatest menace to democracy, an authoritarian who is unfit to serve, did not resonate with the majority of the public. But regardless of the reasons behind the Democratic party’s defeat, what should matter is how the party moves forward, reorients itself, and is responsive to the disenchanted public looking for change. Reflect, Not Recriminate The Democrats need to prioritize self-examination and rebuilding rather than blame. As one Democratic operative stated, 'It’s not a pointing fingers day. It’s a reflection day.' This approach allows the party to constructively analyze its shortcomings and develop strategies for future success. Recrimination distracts from addressing the fundamental problems that led to the defeat. The party needs to focus on reconnecting with working-class voters and addressing economic concerns that resonate with the electorate. Internal finger-pointing could exacerbate existing divisions within the party. Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-IL) noted, 'Finger-pointing is not worth it at all. This was a message. The voters were speaking to us. It would be to our detriment to not hear it.' Continued attacks on Trump may backfire. Multiple impeachments and legal proceedings against Trump made him appear as a victim, energizing his base. Excessive recrimination could further damage the party’s credibility with voters who felt disconnected from Democratic messaging. Focusing on recrimination could prevent the necessary 'comprehensive reassessment' called for by many Democrats. By avoiding recrimination and concentrating on constructive analysis and forward-thinking strategies, the Democratic Party can better position itself to address voters’ concerns and rebuild its coalition for future electoral success. The Democrats Need Soul-Searching The Democrats should engage in soul-searching and introspection and reflect on several critical points. Many Democrats believe the party lost touch with working-class voters, including Latino and Black workers. There’s a call to refocus on economic issues and address the everyday concerns of voters rather than primarily focusing on Trump’s character or threats to democracy. There are calls for fresh leadership and new strategies. Harris’s campaign focused too much on moderate Republicans at the expense of the party’s working-class base, and its warnings about Trump’s threat to democracy as a campaign strategy were not effective. Analyzing why Trump gained ground with younger voters, African Americans, and Hispanics, and examining the party’s weakening relationship with working-class voters across racial lines, are needed. Debating the party’s stance on critical issues like immigration, calling to address economic concerns, and reflecting on whether the Democratic Party has become too associated with elites and lost its connection to working-class Americans is necessary. Additionally, it is critical to increase diversity among party decision-makers and reassess the party’s infrastructure and fundraising methods. There should also be a discussion on how to work with Trump’s administration. Finally, the party must craft more effective messaging strategies and communication with the electorates for future elections, which was missing. Developing a Positive Agenda The Democrats must focus on crafting a compelling vision for the future rather than dwelling on past grievances. As Filippo Trevisan, Associate Professor of Public Communication at American University stated, 'You can’t just be a ‘No’-party, you need to come up with proposals.' With midterms in 2026 and the presidential election in 2028, the party needs to focus on developing new strategies and cultivating new leadership. The defeat highlighted deeper problems within the party structure and strategy. It’s important to note that there’s significant debate about the best path forward. Some argue for a more populist economic approach, while others caution against abandoning the party’s current coalition. Additionally, the effectiveness of policy-based appeals versus cultural messaging is fiercely contested. Others suggest that Democrats need to focus on enacting policies that produce clear, immediate benefits for working families. In that vein, there are several vital points to consider regarding how Democrats could potentially reconnect with this crucial demographic: Refocus on economic issues Many analysts argue that Democrats ought to prioritize kitchen-table economic concerns that directly impact working families’ lives. This includes addressing issues like wage stagnation, job security, affordable healthcare, and the rising cost of living. Incremental changes are not enough; the Democrats must propose bold, ambitious economic and political reforms to convince voters that they can deliver real change. Improving messaging and communication: Even when Democrats have enacted pro-worker policies, they’ve sometimes struggled to effectively convey the benefits to voters. There’s a need to better articulate and communicate how Democratic initiatives tangibly improve working people’s lives. Recruiting more working-class candidates: Fielding candidates who personally understand the challenges faced by working-class communities could help Democrats rebuild trust and credibility with these voters. Furthermore, Democrats must find ways to bridge the growing cultural gap between the party’s leadership and working-class voters, particularly on social issues. Focusing on corporate accountability Challenging corporate power and economic inequality could resonate with workers who feel the system is rigged against them. At the same time, strengthening ties with unions and the labor movement could help Democrats reconnect with their working-class roots. Addressing regional economic disparities Democrats must dive deeper into economic issues and pay more attention to the economic challenges facing working-class communities in areas that have experienced industrial decline or economic stagnation. They must rethink trade and globalization while developing a more worker-focused approach to trade policy and addressing the negative impacts of globalization on specific communities. Ultimately, rebuilding trust with working-class voters will likely require a multi-layered approach that combines policy initiatives, effective communication, and a demonstrated commitment to addressing the economic and social challenges facing these communities. Cooperating with the New Trump Administration In the current political atmosphere, the Democratic Party should cooperate with the new Trump administration while positioning itself as constructive rather than obstructive. America is stuck with Trump for the next four years, and instead of opposing every move he makes, they should find a way to cooperate, especially where it is in the national interest to do so and use cooperation to mitigate the harm that may otherwise result from his actions. Domestic policy Even in a polarized environment, Democrats could offer alternative solutions rather than simply opposing Trump’s policies. While methods may differ, both parties often share common objectives like improving the economy, enhancing national security, addressing healthcare costs, reforming immigration, and securing borders. Additionally, some policy areas still have bipartisan support, which the Democrats could prioritize, including cybersecurity, improving national defense capabilities, specific economic policies aimed at supporting working-class Americans, infrastructure development, and reforming government processes and ethics rules. The renewable energy industry is another path for cooperation, as the Republicans will continue clean energy projects already in place, and see that as a path for job creation and economic growth as these industries advance. Democrats should be willing to engage in constructive discussions and negotiations, even on contentious issues, to demonstrate their commitment to finding common ground. To be sure, the Democrats could frame their collaboration regarding these shared goals by voting for legislation that benefits the country, even if proposed by Republicans, to show their commitment to governance over partisanship. Foreign policy Foreign policy is an area where there’s often more bipartisan consensus. Democrats could support efforts to counter China’s influence while advocating for a balanced approach. They could also work on strengthening alliances and international partnerships and collaborate on addressing global challenges like climate change while framing it in terms of economics and job creation. In addition, both sides could find common ground to end the war in Ukraine and Gaza and establish a path that would lead to a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, which both Republican and Democratic administrations have been advocating for decades. By taking these approaches in domestic and foreign policy, the Democratic Party could cooperate on many critical issues while maintaining its fundamental values and positioning itself anew as a constructive force in American politics. This strategy could help bridge some of the partisan divide and potentially lead to more effective governance. The Democratic Party needs to heal itself while also healing a dangerously polarized nation by building bridges rather than deepening the divide and, in so doing, rising and answering the call of the American people, who deserve and expect better governance.

A Year After Offensive, Rebels Control Most Of Myanmar’s Rakhine ...	One year after renewed fighting in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, the rebel Arakan Army controls some 80 percent of the state while the military junta’s airstrikes and its blockade of trade routes have left residents worried about their safety and food shortages. The ethnic Arakan Army, or AA, began its offensive on Nov. 13, 2023, and has since captured 10 out of the state’s 17 townships, as well as one township in neighboring Chin state. The group is battling for self-determination for the mostly Buddhist Rakhine people. It would be the first Myanmar rebel group to take over a state if it seizes – as it has vowed to do – all territory under military control in Rakhine state. Myanmar’s military, which took control of the country in a 2021 coup, has been battling various rebel armies and militias across the country, and has faced some of its biggest setbacks in Rakhine. The AA’s battlefield successes over the last year has been unprecedented since the fall of the Arakan Kingdom to the Burmese in 1784, according to Pe Than, a former member of parliament from Rakhine state. 'Our Arakan people lost our sovereignty about 240 years ago,' he told Radio Free Asia. 'Throughout this period, the successive generations in Rakhine have engaged in revolutionary efforts, yet we did not achieve victory. 'Now, during the era of the AA, we have found success,' he said. 'It is believed that the national dignity of the Rakhine people can be restored along with that of the AA, as it has been a great achievement.' The AA has repeatedly vowed to capture Sittwe, the state capital and one of the last important military holdings in Rakhine. Last month, AA fighters advanced on the junta’s Western Command headquarters in Ann township, about 120 km (75 miles) southwest of Sittwe. Additionally, there have been heated battles for control of Maungdaw township near the Bangladesh border since July. Junta air attacks In the townships where it has won control, the AA and its political wing, the United League of Arakan, have been operating civilian administration, judicial and development sectors, AA spokesperson Khaing Thu Kha said during an online news conference on June 8. 'We will diligently follow our roadmap to build a society prevailed with justice, peace and human dignity for the Arakan people,' he said. 'We are also committed to establishing a future that guarantees equality and rights for all communities residing in Arakan state.' But the threat of junta airstrikes remains a significant concern for locals, and many towns and homes have yet to be rebuilt because of financial constraints and difficulties obtaining supplies, he said. Additionally, the fighting has severely hindered children’s ability to get an education, he said. The junta had already closed many of Rakhine state’s schools, and in some areas children aren’t allowed to walk to school that remain open because of the threat of air strikes, which often target civilian buildings. 'Parents are hiring private teachers for their children,' Khaing Thu Kha said. 'It has been a form of self-reliant education.' Junta air attacks and artillery targeted at Rakhine state’s civilian populations have left 486 people dead and 1,043 injured over the last year, according to the records of the AA and the statements from residents. 'Over the past year, the military junta has carried out excessive airstrikes, destroying religious buildings, hospitals, clinics, residential areas, villages and refugee camps,' said Wai Hin Aung, a volunteer helping war displaced persons in Rakhine. Rakhine civil society organizations have estimated that more than 600,000 people have been forced to flee their homes due to the fierce fighting between the junta and the AA. RFA was unable to reach junta spokesperson Major Gen. Zaw Min Tun on Wednesday to ask about the current situation in Rakhine state. Refugees eye return Across the border in Bangladesh, where some 1 million stateless Rohingya refugees live in tightly packed border camps – including more than 50,000 who have fled the fighting in Rakhine this year – there is some hope that refugees can return once the AA gains full control of Rakhine. 'The AA has a visionary approach, and I believe their governance would not mirror the harsh policies of the military council,' one refugee who has been living in Bangladesh since 2017 told RFA. 'If the AA succeeds in capturing Maungdaw and gains international recognition, I believe they would engage in dialogue with the Rohingya,' he said. Another refugee who identified himself as Kairo thought that international recognition of the AA as a legitimate government was unlikely. 'I believe our chance of returning to Rakhine state will be very slim if the AA takes control now,' Kairo said. 'I don’t think UNHCR will hand us over to an unrecognized organization,' referring to the U.N refugee agency. 'Even if they gain control of 17 townships, it could take at least two to three years for them to achieve international recognition.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcVykU-QRFq_o	2024-11-13T15:50:47-08:00	
Robert Reich: What Will You Do? – OpEd	Many of you are still in shock about what happened a week ago today. Some of you don’t even want to read a newspaper or hear the news. I get it. A few of you are coping with the catastrophe by minimizing or denying it. Several friends assure me that a second Trump term won’t be much different from the first and that the checks and balances in our system will continue to constrain him. This is wishful and dangerous thinking. Trump and his Republican lapdogs will almost certainly win the House, which means that starting January 20, they will take full control of the federal government — both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency. The Republicans soon to be in control of Congress are more MAGA, less principled, and more intimidated by Trump than the Republicans who had control when Trump took office in 2017. There are no Liz Cheneys in the House, no Mitt Romneys in the Senate. Republican senators seeking to become the majority leader are already competing to please Trump, promising immediate confirmation of his appointments. The Republican Party as a whole has now been effectively purged of people willing to stand up to Trump. Trump already has effective control of the Supreme Court, a majority of whom have ruled that he (or any president) is presumptively immune from criminal liability for whatever he chooses to do. This time, moreover, there won’t be people in the administration to stop him. Trump learned from his first term about the importance of surrounding himself with lackeys who will do whatever he wishes. His early picks (Susie Wiles as chief of staff, Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff, Thomas Homan as border czar, Lee Zeldin as EPA administrator, Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the U.N., and Michael Walz as national security advisor) have only one thing in common and it’s not their expertise. It’s their unblinking loyalty to Trump. Don’t get me started about Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, who has turned his X platform into a swamp of Trump lies and propaganda, and now seems joined at the hip to Trump — appearing wherever Trump is. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a nut job. And unlike Trump’s first term, the president-elect is now backed by a network of dangerous extremists — including those who have been imprisoned for their part in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, whom Trump has suggested he’ll pardon. They will feel emboldened to carry out what they understand to be Trump’s wishes. Finally, also unlike before his first term, Trump has explicitly told us what he plans to do and already has people working on getting it done starting January 20: mass deportations, prosecution of his political enemies, the use of the military against U.S. citizens, the purging of the civil service across the government and substitution of Trump loyalists, and a promise to play politics with disasters. Project 2025, which was written by more than 140 people who served under Trump the first time around, including several of his former Cabinet secretaries, explicitly calls for 'abortion surveillance' and the stripping from Americans of reproductive freedom (page 455). It also calls for jailing teachers and librarians over banned books (page 5), gutting of overtime pay rules (pages 587 and 592), and prioritizing 'married men and women' over other types of families (page 489). To enforce these attacks on our rights, Project 2025 would use the Justice Department to prosecute district attorneys Trump disagrees with, invoke the Insurrection Act to shut down protests, and mobilize red-state national guard units against blue states that resist his authoritarian agenda. In sum, my friends, we are facing a catastrophe far worse than what occurred in Trump’s first term of office. The meager guardrails that existed then will be gone. We must not avert our eyes from this calamity, or minimize it, or throw up our hands in despair or retreat. We must prepare to fight it. But how? Let me ask you: If this were Germany in 1933, what actions would you take? How different will this be from Germany in 1933? I put this question to some of you last Wednesday during my weekly Office Hours. Forty percent said your most important goal will be to protect those in harm’s way, and 34 percent said it will be to organize and mobilize politically. Of the remainder, 9 percent said it will be to resist with civil disobedience. (Others had additional or different ideas.) Obviously, none of these alternatives is exclusive. We must consider all, and many others. Protecting the vulnerable and preserving our rights and liberties will require a great deal of hard work by people who believe in our Constitution, democracy, and the rule of law. The work includes: Monitoring Trump and his government — despite the disinformation, propaganda, and lies we’ll be receiving — and disseminating the truth. Maintaining a watch over the people and institutions we value. Being ready to sound the alarm in our communities and networks when those people and institutions are under assault. Organizing and mobilizing nonviolent resistance to such assaults. Using civil disobedience wherever possible. Litigating through state and federal courts where possible. Speaking out against malicious lies like those that spread during the election by Elon Musk on his propaganda machine X and against vicious lies amplified on other MAGA mouthpieces. Using our economic muscle to boycott corporations that support Trump, Musk, and other centers of MAGA power. And much more. It will be up to us — the American people who still cherish democracy — to protect and preserve our system of self-government. As difficult as it is to fully accept what we are up against, the first step is to acknowledge it.

Arab Americans Have A Second Chance To Influence Trump – OpEd	After Donald Trump was sworn in as America’s 45th president in 2017, the Arab American community made the mistake of joining the Democrats’ attacks on him, refusing to meet him or engage with him on policies. This was despite the fact that one of Trump’s closest business friends on his hit TV shows 'The Apprentice' and 'The Celebrity Apprentice' was a Palestinian, Farouk Shami. Many Arab Americans incredulously expected Trump to do what their own Democratic allies refused to do: undermine the extremist government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and elevate the interests of Palestinian rights. Instead of engaging with Trump, they joined in the personal attacks and confrontation orchestrated by Democrats, including defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was responsible for many failures in the Middle East when she was secretary of state. One of the consequences was that Palestinians boycotted the 2019 'Peace to Prosperity' conference organized in Bahrain by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew with strong ties to Israel. With no Palestinians present to push back, the conference strengthened the agenda of Israel and Netanyahu with Trump and the White House. As a result, Trump pursued policies that gave a clear signal of marginalizing Palestinian needs. Eight years later, Trump today not only has an Orthodox Jewish son-in-law who has his ear, but also an Arab American son-in-law, Michael Boulos, the husband of Tiffany Trump, and his influential father, Dr. Massad Boulos, who both also have the new president-elect’s ear. More importantly, Trump and pro-Arab Jewish American candidate Jill Stein took a great deal of Arab American votes away from Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. For example, in Dearborn, Michigan, which has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country, Trump won nearly 42 percent of the vote, beating Harris’ 40 percent, with Stein third with 15 percent. Arab Americans are on a precipice. They can again turn away from Trump, angered by his statements of support for Israel, or they can engage with him and attempt to influence his policies. Politics is a game of diplomacy and competition, much like a football match. Arab Americans can either be on the field and compete with Israel, or they can walk off the field in protest and leave the entire diplomatic arena to Israel’s control. They do not have the luxury of taking umbrage or showing their anger at Trump’s past and the current Israeli genocide in Gaza and violence in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Lebanon. They need to set aside their personal feelings and emotions, step up to the political plate and play ball. That is their responsibility. Politics may be like a football game that two sides are striving to win, but Arab Americans do not have to win. All they have to do is turn up and play to minimize what Trump will do in the Middle East if the only people speaking to him are Israelis. There is a great imbalance in America when it comes to the truth on Middle East issues, mainly because Israel has dominated the playing field for more than 75 years. They are better at media manipulation and spin, as we saw with the distorted coverage of last week’s violence in Amsterdam, in which Israeli football fans went on the rampage and clashed with locals. However, the media described the incidents as 'antisemitic' and highlighted claims of a new 'pogrom' against Jews in Europe. Despite the spin, and their support for Trump, Arab Americans were not the factor that gave Trump his election victory. Although they played an important role, Trump won because he was able to cut into the Democratic base at every level, including among Hispanics and African Americans. Trump succeeded in not only winning the Electoral College, which determines who becomes president, but he is also poised to win the popular vote. Arab Americans need to recognize the political reality and adapt to it. They need to set aside their emotions, no matter how grievous the pain coming from Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Lebanon, and engage Trump fully and strategically. They have often been reduced to playing the victim card, attempting to push back against political and media bias and the false narratives spun by Israel’s public relations mastery. However, it is easier to be the victim and be angry than to work hard to change the dynamics of the forces driving that suffering. To change that dynamic, Arab Americans need to be better not just at organizing among themselves, but also at engaging the mainstream news media using professional public relations and communications strategies rather than street protests or angry confrontations. Can Arab Americans set aside the pain of Gaza, Lebanon and historic discrimination in America to replace their emotions with a strategic plan to change America’s foreign policy the right way? We have yet to see that happen.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcWSGgqUU2Ifs	2024-11-13T15:48:27-08:00	
Trump’s Influence Looms Large Over The World – OpEd	By Mohamed Chebaro As the world digests the result of last week’s momentous US presidential election and prepares itself for a Trump 2.0 presidency, it is not difficult to imagine how the world might look according to the new president. The Palestinians could lose Gaza for good and possibly the West Bank too, as settlers exacerbate the plight of the Palestinians unhindered and unsanctioned by the new US administration, while Lebanon’s destruction continues, with the country teetering on the brink of implosion. Ukraine’s fate will be to prepare to capitulate, according to a peace plan hastily drafted in Washington but guided by the Kremlin. The prospect of electing a Black woman maybe did not cut it for the heavily polarized Americans, despite Kamala Harris’ offer of hope and message of a sunnier future, preferring instead a twice-impeached convicted felon. Maybe this was due to an innate prejudice against women, the travails of dark forces, foreign interference or the tech realm and its manipulation of public opinion. Trump in power, I am led to believe, is likely to magnify and further inflame the stark divide between two Americas. On top of this, he will have full control of Congress, a blank check from the Supreme Court and a renewed faith in his supremacy and in his ability to pander to his supporters’ most basic instincts and prejudices. His first victim is likely to be Ukraine, despite President Volodymyr Zelensky rushing to send his carefully crafted best wishes, in which he praised the president-elect for his 'peace through strength' approach. This is despite knowing all too well that Ukraine is likely to be left in the cold, before the Trump administration forces on Kyiv a peace plan tabled by Washington but penned in the Kremlin that will be just short of total capitulation. Biden and his Western allies’ support for Ukraine initially stemmed from the need to defend the post-Second World War order, but Trump has disregarded that all along, expressing unhidden admiration for President Vladimir Putin and having a long-held belief that 'Ukraine must be part of Russia,' according to one former aide. During his campaign, he often boasted how he could end the Ukraine war 'in a day' and blamed Zelensky for the conflict. Here, I do not need to remind everyone how, over the past two years, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has spared no efforts to vote down and interrupt crucial US government deliveries of weapons and aid to Ukraine. As for the Palestinian question, Arab and Muslim Americans were maybe right to mobilize against the Democrats over the Biden-Harris administration’s inability to find a way to preserve Palestinian lives in Gaza and to hold it responsible for the continued Israeli onslaught. But through backing Trump, the best friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they have helped sow the seeds of a potential total loss of any faint hope for a just solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Netanyahu, who many believe has blocked all efforts that could have led to a cessation of the violence in Gaza over the past few months, was maybe part of a strategy to embarrass the Biden administration and expose its international weakness. Netanyahu, who sacked his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant while the counting of votes was underway in the US, has shifted his war Cabinet further right, expecting the new president to free him from any restraints. And he continues his scorched-earth policies in Gaza and elsewhere that could send the Palestinians further into despair and the political wilderness for at least the next generation or two. Lebanon is unlikely to fare any better, despite Trump’s so-called promises to end the war between Hezbollah and Israel. Trump’s old rhetoric about his previous record of squeezing Iran with sanctions, while deterring war, is set to be tested, as Tehran claims that it is readying another list of Israeli targets to strike after Tel Aviv’s attack on its air defenses and missile plants last month. Trump’s reelection was the result of a complex web of dark forces and the culmination of events that were built on exploiting fears. He has convinced people that his power will earn them salvation, meaning they endorsed his unique approach that could hurt democracy gradually or even sooner come Jan. 20, 2025. Mohamed Chebaro is a British Lebanese journalist with more than 25 years of experience covering war, terrorism, defense, current affairs and diplomacy. He is also a media consultant and trainer.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcZSc96iO33yr	2024-11-13T15:44:26-08:00	
Blinken: Israel Has Met Its Goals In Gaza, Time To End The War	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Israel has achieved its objectives in Gaza and that it is now time to pursue an end to the ongoing war. Blinken said that ending the conflict would be the most effective means of addressing the urgent needs of Gaza’s civilian population. He called for 'real and extended pauses' in fighting to allow essential humanitarian aid to reach those affected by the hostilities and said that Israel holds an ongoing responsibility to facilitate this assistance, urging sustained efforts to address Gaza’s humanitarian crisis. Blinken also called for increased international pressure on Hamas, seeking 'genuine, sustained, and effective pressure' to cease hostilities. He said that achieving peace requires cooperation from all parties involved, with humanitarian access as a central priority.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcai6pnQp13G1	2024-11-13T15:41:29-08:00	
FBI Arrests Alleged Leaker Of US Intelligence Related To Israel’s...	The U.S. Justice Department has charged a man for allegedly leaking highly classified U.S. intelligence about Israel's plans for retaliation against Iran, according to U.S. media reports on November 13. The reports said that Asif W. Rahman was indicted earlier this month for willfully transmitting national defense information. He was arrested on November 12 in Cambodia by the FBI and was to appear in court in Guam. Court documents indicate that he was employed by the U.S. government. According to a person familiar with his employment, he was employed by the CIA. This employment gave him a top-secret security clearance and allowed him to access sensitive information. The New York Times, which first reported the story, said that Rahman was indicted on a charge related to the posting of the intelligence on Telegram in mid-October. The documents posted included Israeli plans for moving munitions and Israeli Air Force exercises involving air-to-surface missiles.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcci6QlmHplcK	2024-11-13T15:39:21-08:00	
Biden, Trump Pledge Peaceful Transfer Of Power In January	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returned triumphantly to Washington on Wednesday, pledging a smooth transition of power in January as he met for two hours at the White House with his longtime political rival, President Joe Biden. 'It was a substantive meeting,' White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. 'They discussed important national security and domestic policy issues facing the nation and the world.' Biden invited Trump for the traditional visit — a show of the coming Jan. 20 peaceful transfer of power in American democracy between the current U.S. leader and the incoming chief executive. It was Trump’s first visit to the White House since his first presidential term ended in January 2021. The two men sat in front of a roaring fireplace in the Oval Office ahead of their private talks and traded niceties in a peaceful tableau. 'I'm looking forward to having a smooth transition and we're looking forward to talking about some of that today,' Biden said. 'Thank you very much,' Trump replied. 'Politics is tough and in many cases it's not a very nice world. It is a nice world today and I appreciate very much a transition so smooth — it will be as smooth as it can get — and I very much appreciate that, Joe. Thank you.' 'You're welcome,' Biden responded. First lady Jill Biden joined her husband in greeting the president-elect upon his arrival at the White House. The White House said she gave Trump a handwritten letter of congratulations for his wife, Melania, and expressed her team’s readiness to assist with the transition. The former first lady, who lived in the White House from 2017 to 2021 during her husband’s first presidency, did not accompany him to Washington and has not indicated whether she plans to move into the White House again when he takes office. Biden, a Democrat, had sought to defeat Trump, a Republican, for a second time in the Nov. 5 election, but ended his campaign in July after faltering badly in a debate against Trump. Biden quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him, but Trump swept through seven political battleground states in the election and easily defeated her. When Biden defeated Trump in 2020, Trump offered no White House invitation to meet him ahead of the inauguration and left Washington two hours before Biden’s swearing-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Trump, who to this day claims falsely that he was cheated out of winning the 2020 election by vote fraud, was the first president to not witness his successor’s inauguration since Andrew Johnson skipped the swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. Biden has said he plans to attend Trump’s inauguration. Trump also met with Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives. Republicans hold a narrow majority in the chamber in the current Congress and are nearing a slight majority control in the Congress set to be sworn in Jan. 3, but the outcome of more than a dozen House elections remains uncertain. Trump has moved quickly to fill his nascent administration with Republican officials who have been the most politically loyal to him in the four years he has been out of office. In his latest announcements Wednesday, Trump named Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, the country’s top diplomat; Florida Representative Matt Gaetz as attorney general, the top law enforcement position in the government, and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Hawaii Democratic congresswoman turned Republican advocate for the president-elect, as director of national intelligence. On Tuesday, Trump named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to be his next defense secretary. The choice of Hegseth was outside the norm of those usually named as the Pentagon leader. But he was a vocal supporter of Trump during his first term, embracing his 'America First' agenda of trying to withdraw U.S. troops from abroad and often taking up the cause of combat veterans accused of war crimes. Trump has also announced South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as his choice for Homeland Security chief and picked John Ratcliffe as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Both Rubio and Noem were on Trump’s short list of possible vice presidential running mates several months ago. While Trump later picked first-term Ohio Senator JD Vance, now the vice president-elect, to join him on the Republican national ticket, both Rubio and Noem remained Trump stalwarts as he won the election. Ratcliffe was the nation’s sixth director of national intelligence, serving for the last eight months of the Trump administration after a rocky confirmation process. Trump also announced that billionaire businessman Elon Musk and entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead what Trump called the Department of Government Efficiency. The announcement said they would provide advice and guidance to 'drive large-scale structural reform' of the federal government. The acronym for the new agency, DOGE, is a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, dogecoin. Other notable picks by Trump include William McGinley as White House counsel, Florida congressman Michael Waltz as national security adviser and Thomas Homan, Trump’s former acting immigration chief, to be 'border czar' to head efforts to deport undocumented migrants, possibly millions of them, who are living in the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcW02XAMeMq0t	2024-11-13T15:37:37-08:00	
Iran’s FM Says That Contact Channels With US Exist	There are still means of contact between Iran and the US despite the fundamental differences, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a weekly cabinet session on Wednesday, Araqchi said a series of disagreements between Iran and the US are so foundational that may not be resolved forever. 'However, we need to manage them to reduce the costs and tensions,' he added. The foreign minister noted that the contact channels between Iran and the US are still in place. Asked about Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Grossi’s upcoming visit to Iran, Araqchi said Iran and the UN nuclear agency are involved in extensive and age-old cooperation despite a series of problems and differing views on interaction. Expressing hope that Iran and the IAEA would reach an agreement on a number of differences during Grossi’s visit, Araqchi said the UN nuclear chief has reportedly 'positive morale'. Grossi is scheduled to hold formal meetings with Iranian officials on Thursday, November 14. In an interview with Al Arabiya television channel in September, Grossi expressed the UN nuclear agency’s desire to visit Tehran and hold talks with the administration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The IAEA director general also said he had received a response from Pezeshkian on assurances about Iran’s peaceful nuclear program.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-XEvYaUlRcR-205OfcDJ2	2024-11-13T15:35:36-08:00	
Trumpnomics: Why Is India Resilient To Tariff Wars And America Fi...	Donald Trump’s thumping victory for a return and second term as president has unleashed a mixed bag of signals for India-USA relations. Unlike the first term, rising global political tension due to the Russia-Ukraine war and Russian sanctions have led India’s situation to now be different than when Trump was previously in office. India threw a big challenge to the USA while thwarting Russian sanctions and shifting its oil import dependency to Russia. This led to a new era of India–Russia economic relations, giving an edge for power balancing between the two super powers. Russia emerged as the 6th largest trading partner of India in 2023-24, up from 25th in 2021-22, while USA retained its spot as the top trading partner of India. The climax between India-USA and India-Russia trade relations unveils that oil and oil based products emerged as the major determinants. While oil based petroleum products are one of the major items of exports to the USA, Russian oil has become pivotal to manufacture oil based products, which are then exported to the USA. In 2023-24, Russia accounted for 34.4 percent of India’s total crude oil imports and oil based products accounted for 7.5 percent in total exports to the USA. Eventually, oil and oil based products will emerge as being crucial for India to engage both the USA and Russia as important economic partners during Trump's second period. Given oil is sensitive to inflation, high import tariffs by the Trump administration does not bode well for the USA. To this end, India’s relations with Russia will remain inextricable, notwithstanding the USA's pressure on India to abide by Russian sanctions. Donald Trump claimed in his election campaign that he would impose a 10 percent import tariff on all nations and 60 percent on China. He focused his America First policy, embarking on protectionism, with the end goal to benefit American workers and their families. Nevertheless, during his first term (2017-21), counter measures to restrict imports from India, such as the withdrawal of Special Status under GSP scheme (Generalized System of Preference) and imposition of high tariffs on steel and aluminium, could not instill weapons to dwarf exports from India. During this period, India’s exports to USA sustained unstoppable growth for the first 3 years. The growth trajectory continued during the successive period under the Presidenship of Biden, even though the Biden administration did not relax tariffs. Eventually, the USA continued undeterred to be the biggest export destination for India. How could India overcome Trump’s protectionism in his first term? It lies with the composition of India's export basket. Besides oil products, there are 3 other major products in the export basket. They are gems and jewelry (mainly diamonds), drugs and pharmaceuticals and readymade garments and textiles. Together with petroleum products, these four products accounted for 43 percent of India’s export to USA in 2023-24. One of the main reasons is that for most of these products the USA is import dependent, owing to lackluster domestic manufacturing due to cost effectiveness and skill. For example, India is currently the third biggest exporter of pharmaceutical products and fourth biggest exporter of readymade garments in the USA market. In 2022, it accounted for 5.5 percent of total imports of pharmaceutical products and in 2023, accounted for 7 percent in total imports of readymade garments in USA market. As regards drugs and pharmaceutical products, the USA largely manufactures branded products that are highly profitable. For generic drugs Americans rely on for standard prescriptions like antibiotics, which are predominantly sourced from developing nations where production costs are low, according to Coalition for a Prosperous America. Concerns are looming large in the pharmaceutical and readymade garments industries in India with the Trump’s assertion for imposing 10 percent import. Notwithstanding, there is a caveat. Given the fact that China is the biggest supplier of these two items in USA market and they will attract much higher import tariff sthan India, viz, 60 percent, this will give an edge to India to cut into the share of Chinese products in the USA market. To this end, higher import tariffs on China could give a lease of life to Indian exporters to counter-balance the impact of a 10 hike in import tariffs on Indian products. In addition, the collapse of the Bangladesh government will leverage more scope to Indian exporters for garment exports in the USA market. Bangladesh is the third biggest exporter of garments in the USA market, sharing about 11 percent of imports of garments. Protectionism with regard to immigration is another important threat of Trump’s America First policy. India is the biggest beneficiary of H1B visas. Annually, more than 70 percent of H1B visas is issued to Indians. In his first term, Trump immigration policy increased the denial rate for H1B visas to 24 percent in 2018 and 21 percent in 2019. Nevertheless, this inversely acted in a benign manner to benefit India. Negated by restrictions on immigrants, US IT firms, who were more dependent on India for cost effective employees, opened their branches in India for off-shore services. This led USA investment to soar in India during the Trump period. It made a big leap from US$2.2 billion in 2017 to US$14.3 billion in 2020. The big IT and financial services companies, such as Intel and Morgan Stanley, made bulk investments in India. Currently, nearly 44 percent of US investment in India embraces computer software and hardware (mainly software). In summing up, a new era is likely to emerge for India’s relations with the USA, which will likely mitigate the threat of Trump's protectionism. This should dilute fears for SMEs, who are the backbone of India’s exports of garments and gems and jewelry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8DHWCY69-HV2	2024-11-13T08:57:21-08:00	
Introduction Of Psychology In Economics: The Emergence Of Behavio...	Economics, traditionally a field focused on mathematical models and rationality, experienced a major shift in the late 20th century with the introduction of psychology into its frameworks. This shift marked the birth of behavioral economics—a discipline that blends economic and psychological insights to better understand human decision-making. Unlike classical and neoclassical economics, which assume people make rational, utility-maximizing choices, behavioral economics considers cognitive biases, emotions, and social influences that often lead to irrational or inconsistent behaviors. The integration of psychology into economics has revolutionized our understanding of consumer behavior, public policy, and financial markets, making it one of the most exciting developments in the field. 1. Traditional Economic Models and Their Limitations For much of its history, economics relied on models that depicted individuals as 'homo economicus'—rational agents who always act in their own best interest and consistently make logical choices to maximize their utility. This model offered a simplified, orderly view of human behavior that allowed economists to create mathematical predictions about markets, prices, and consumer choices. However, as economists examined real-world data, they began to notice systematic discrepancies between these theoretical models and actual human behavior. People often made choices that seemed irrational or against their self-interest, defying predictions of classical economic models. For example, people would save less than they knew they should, gamble with risky investments, or prefer immediate rewards over future gains, despite knowing the potential costs. These 'anomalies' suggested that economic models based solely on rationality were incomplete and that human behavior could not be fully understood without accounting for psychological factors. 2. The Birth of Behavioral Economics The integration of psychology into economics began to take shape in the 1970s, led by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Their groundbreaking research on cognitive biases challenged the traditional view of rationality in economic decision-making. In a series of experiments, Kahneman and Tversky identified patterns of 'irrational' behavior that they termed cognitive biases—systematic errors in thinking that affect how people perceive risk, make judgments, and evaluate probabilities. One of their most notable contributions was prospect theory, which demonstrated that people do not evaluate potential losses and gains in a strictly rational way. Instead, they tend to exhibit 'loss aversion,' meaning they feel the pain of losing something more acutely than the pleasure of gaining something of equal value. This insight helped explain why people might hold onto losing investments for too long or avoid taking risks, even when potential gains outweigh potential losses.Behavioral economics, as this new field came to be known, quickly gained traction. It expanded to explore a range of cognitive biases, such as anchoring (relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered), confirmation bias (seeking information that supports one's beliefs), and overconfidence bias (overestimating one's own abilities or knowledge). These insights began reshaping economic thought, challenging the view that individuals act purely out of rational self-interest. 3. The Impact of Psychology on Economic Policy The integration of psychology into economics has had profound implications for public policy. Traditional economic policies often relied on incentives, such as tax breaks or penalties, to influence behavior, assuming people would respond in rational ways. But behavioral economics has shown that people's responses to incentives are often shaped by biases, framing, and social influences. One of the most influential concepts from behavioral economics is nudging—a technique popularized by economist Richard Thaler, who won a Nobel Prize for his contributions to the field. Nudges are subtle interventions that guide people toward making better choices without restricting their freedom. For instance, placing healthier foods at eye level in a cafeteria can encourage healthier eating choices, while automatically enrolling employees in retirement savings plans can help increase savings rates. By understanding the psychological factors behind decision-making, policymakers can design interventions that lead to better outcomes for individuals and society. 4. Behavioral Finance: Psychology in Financial Markets Psychology's influence on economics has also reshaped how we understand financial markets. Behavioral finance, a subfield of behavioral economics, examines how psychological factors influence investment behavior and market outcomes. Researchers have identified cognitive biases that often lead investors to make poor financial decisions, such as the herding effect (following the actions of others) or the endowment effect (overvaluing owned assets). These insights challenge the 'efficient market hypothesis,' which claims that markets are always rational and efficient. Instead, behavioral finance reveals that markets can be irrational and prone to bubbles or crashes fueled by collective biases and emotions. This understanding has influenced asset management, investment strategies, and financial regulations, as well as helped investors avoid common pitfalls. The Future of Economics with Psychological Insights As behavioral economics continues to grow, its influence has broadened beyond academic theory, impacting fields as diverse as marketing, healthcare, education, and environmental policy. The blending of psychology with economics has not only provided a more accurate view of human behavior but also sparked innovations in how we approach social issues and design economic systems. In the coming years, behavioral economics is likely to become even more integral to economics as a whole, integrating insights from neuroscience, sociology, and artificial intelligence. By embracing the complexity of human psychology, economics is evolving into a discipline that is not only more realistic but also more attuned to the diverse factors shaping human decisions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8OMa83tGKrNn	2024-11-13T08:55:07-08:00	
The Introduction Of Psychology In International Relations: A New ...	For much of its history, international relations (IR) was shaped by political theories that emphasized power, state interests, and strategic decision-making. Traditional schools of thought, such as realism and liberalism, have largely assumed that states act as rational, unitary actors pursuing clear national interests. However, this perspective often overlooks the complexities of human psychology, including emotions, cognitive biases, and social identities, all of which profoundly shape the behavior of leaders, policymakers, and citizens. In recent decades, the introduction of psychology into IR has provided valuable insights, highlighting how mental processes influence foreign policy decisions, shape conflicts, and determine the outcomes of diplomatic efforts. This article explores the role of psychology in international relations, examining its impact on the understanding of leadership, group dynamics, conflict escalation, and peace negotiations. Through psychological theories, IR scholars gain a richer, more nuanced understanding of international events, moving beyond simplistic models of rationality to account for the complexities of human behavior in global politics. 1. The Traditional Theories of International Relations and Their Limitations International relations theories have historically focused on material factors, such as military capabilities, economic power, and geopolitical interests. Realism, for example, assumes that states act rationally to maximize their security and power, often operating in an anarchic international system. Liberalism, by contrast, emphasizes cooperation, democratic institutions, and the role of international organizations in promoting peace. While these theories provide valuable frameworks for understanding state behavior, they often neglect the human elements that shape decision-making. Traditional IR theories tend to treat states as 'black boxes,' analyzing interactions between them without delving into the internal processes that drive decisions. But as psychology has entered the field, scholars have started to investigate how cognitive biases, emotions, and individual leadership traits influence foreign policy. By incorporating psychological insights, researchers are uncovering the limitations of models based on purely rational decision-making and gaining a deeper appreciation of the complex dynamics at play in international relations. 2. Leadership Psychology: How Leaders Shape International Relations One of the most influential areas of psychological research in IR concerns the role of individual leaders. Leaders' personalities, values, and cognitive processes significantly influence their decisions, sometimes even shaping the course of entire nations. Psychological theories offer insights into how leaders' personalities affect their foreign policy choices, particularly in times of crisis.• Personality Traits and Decision-MakingStudies show that leaders' personalities can strongly influence their political choices. For instance, leaders with high levels of openness may be more inclined to seek diplomatic solutions, while those with high levels of aggression or narcissism might favor confrontational approaches. Psychological profiling of leaders can reveal tendencies toward risk-aversion, compromise, or assertiveness, helping IR scholars and diplomats anticipate possible policy shifts and reactions. Cognitive Biases and Misjudgments Leaders are subject to cognitive biases that impact their perception of international events. One notable example is confirmation bias, where leaders seek information that supports their preconceived beliefs, leading to flawed assessments and potential conflicts. During the Cold War, both U.S. and Soviet leaders often misinterpreted each other's actions due to deeply entrenched biases, escalating tensions that nearly resulted in nuclear conflict. Emotional Influences on Decision-Making Emotions play a significant role in international relations, especially in high-stakes situations. Fear, anger, and pride can drive leaders to make irrational choices that defy strategic logic. For example, fear of perceived threats can lead to preemptive strikes, while national pride can make it difficult for leaders to make compromises or concede territory. 3. Group Dynamics and the Psychology of Policymaking Teams Psychology has also illuminated the ways in which group dynamics within governments and advisory teams influence foreign policy decisions. Decisions are rarely made by a single leader; instead, they emerge from interactions among small groups of advisors, diplomats, and military officials, each with their own perspectives and motivations. Psychological insights into group behavior reveal how groupthink, social identity, and in-group biases shape policy outcomes. Groupthink and Foreign Policy Groupthink occurs when a cohesive group strives for consensus, leading members to suppress dissenting opinions. This phenomenon has been implicated in several foreign policy failures, such as the U.S. decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Groupthink can prevent policymakers from critically assessing the risks and consequences of their actions, leading to flawed decisions based on incomplete information. Social Identity and National Interests Social identity theory posits that individuals derive part of their self-concept from their group memberships, which can influence international relations. Leaders and policymakers may prioritize the interests of their 'in-group' (such as their nation or ethnic group) and perceive 'out-groups' (foreign nations or cultures) as threats. This tendency can lead to increased nationalism, stereotyping, and conflict escalation, making cooperation more challenging. Collective Emotions and Public Opinion National crises, wars, and diplomatic tensions often evoke strong emotions among the public. Leaders, in turn, may feel pressure to respond in ways that align with popular sentiment, even if those responses are not strategically sound. Collective emotions, such as outrage over an attack or empathy for allied nations, shape public opinion, which influences foreign policy decisions. Psychological studies on collective emotions provide valuable insights into how leaders might respond to crises under domestic pressure. 4. Conflict Escalation and Misperceptions: The Role of Cognitive Biases Cognitive biases often play a critical role in conflict escalation, as states misinterpret each other's intentions, misjudge threats, and overestimate their own abilities. A psychological approach to IR helps explain why conflicts sometimes escalate even when neither party initially desires war. The Attribution Bias Attribution bias occurs when states attribute hostile intentions to others' actions while viewing their own actions as defensive. For example, during the Cold War, both the U.S. and Soviet Union interpreted each other's military build-ups as aggressive, despite seeing their own actions as defensive. This mutual suspicion created a dangerous cycle of arms races and brinkmanship. The Overconfidence Effect Overconfidence bias leads leaders to overestimate their chances of success in conflict, underestimating risks and costs. This bias has been observed in numerous conflicts, where leaders pursue aggressive strategies without fully considering the consequences. For instance, studies suggest that overconfidence played a role in the decisions leading to the Vietnam War, as U.S. leaders underestimated the resilience and commitment of the North Vietnamese forces. The 'Mirror Image' Bias Mirror image bias causes states to view themselves as morally superior while perceiving their adversaries as fundamentally aggressive or dishonest. This bias reinforces hostile perceptions and impedes diplomatic solutions, as neither side is willing to concede or acknowledge the validity of the other's perspective. Recognizing this bias can be a first step toward reducing tensions and fostering dialogue. 5. Negotiation and Peace Processes: Psychological Insights for Conflict Resolution The psychology of negotiation and conflict resolution has made significant contributions to peace processes and diplomatic efforts. Psychological research offers insights into how negotiators can build trust, overcome biases, and foster cooperation. Building Empathy and Trust Research shows that empathy can be a powerful tool in negotiations, allowing parties to understand each other's perspectives and motivations. In peace negotiations, such as those in Northern Ireland, empathy-building exercises have helped negotiators overcome historical grievances, leading to more constructive dialogue. Overcoming Hostility Through Cognitive Reframing Cognitive reframing, or the process of changing how a situation is perceived, can be instrumental in peace negotiations. By reframing issues to focus on common interests rather than historical conflicts, negotiators can reduce hostility and encourage cooperation. This approach was used in the Camp David Accords, where Egypt and Israel were able to reframe their historical animosities to focus on mutual benefits of peace. Promoting Positive Intergroup Contact Psychological theories on intergroup contact suggest that positive interactions between rival groups can reduce prejudice and foster cooperation. In post-conflict settings, programs that bring together former adversaries—such as cultural exchanges, joint economic projects, and educational initiatives—have helped build social cohesion and reduce the risk of renewed conflict. The Future of Psychology in International Relations As global challenges like climate change, migration, and technological disruption reshape the international landscape, psychology will likely play an increasingly important role in IR. Understanding the psychological factors that drive leaders, shape public opinion, and influence intergroup dynamics is essential for developing effective, sustainable solutions to complex global issues. Integrating psychology into IR provides valuable tools for conflict resolution, humanitarian efforts, and diplomatic negotiations. By recognizing the role of human psychology, IR scholars and practitioners can move beyond traditional models to create more adaptive and resilient strategies. In an interconnected world, psychological insights offer a pathway toward more empathetic, cooperative, and stable international relations, helping leaders and nations navigate the complexities of global politics with a deeper understanding of the human mind.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8BnsMDxGLWvH	2024-11-13T08:53:26-08:00	
Centcom Conducts Strikes In Yemen, Syria	By C. Todd Lopez Since Friday, U.S. Central Command has conducted strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi targets in Yemen and against targets in Syria as part of the defeat-ISIS mission there. On Saturday and Sunday, Centcom forces executed airstrikes against multiple Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, said Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder during a briefing Tuesday. 'These facilities housed a variety of advanced conventional weapons used by the Iran-backed Houthis to target U.S. and international military and civilian vessels navigating international waters in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,' Ryder said. Both Air Force and Navy assets, including F-35C fighter aircraft, were involved in the strikes, which were in response to Houthi attacks on commercial, U.S. and coalition vessels in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandab Strait and Gulf of Aden. 'As you've heard us say before, we will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks,' Ryder said. Yesterday, Ryder said, Centcom also conducted strikes against nine targets in two locations associated with Iranian groups in Syria. The strikes, he said, were in response to two attacks on U.S. personnel in Syria that happened Nov. 10 at Mission Support Site Green Village in northeast Syria. One of those attacks involved a UAV, while the second attack involved an indirect fire incident with two rockets. There were no U.S. injuries involved with either attack. Ryder said the U.S. strikes will degrade the ability of Iranian-backed groups to plan and launch future attacks on U.S and coalition forces who are in the region to conduct the defeat-ISIS operations. Centcom commander Army Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla said the U.S. will do what's needed to defend its personnel in the Centcom area of responsibility. 'Our message is clear. Attacks against U.S. and coalition partners in the region will not be tolerated,' said Kurilla. 'We will continue to take every step necessary to protect our personnel and coalition partners and respond to reckless attacks.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8Luofv7p8eIb	2024-11-13T08:51:31-08:00	
American Interventionist Foreign Policy: One And A Quarter Centur...	When Theodore Roosevelt succeeded William McKinley as president in 1901, he realized the US was no longer just a continental republic; with the Spanish-American War of 1898, America now claimed Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines as territories, Cuba a protectorate and annexed Hawaii. Roosevelt 'believed it was the burden of ‘civilized’ nations to uplift ‘uncivilized’ nations,' says Michael Patrick Cullinane. He believed U.S. interests were global interests, and that it was actually good for 'civilized' nations to intervene in other countries’ affairs. Moreover, the 26th president made sure the U.S. played a larger role in international affairs by extending the Monroe doctrine through the Roosevelt Corollary – the United States, henceforth, would protect countries in the Americas from recolonization by European powers, and would intervene militarily if necessary to do so. It was a foreign policy he described as 'speak softly and carry a big stick.' US presidents since Roosevelt have pursued his 'big stick' foreign policy agenda. In the slightly less than a hundred years from 1898 to 1994, the U.S. government (directly or indirectly) has intervened successfully to change governments in Latin America, alone, at least 41 times. That amounts to once every 28 months for an entire century. Overall, while the United States engaged in 46 military interventions from 1948–1991, from 1992–2017 that number increased fourfold to 188. The 'first' Roosevelt era was the beginning of America's orientation towards interventionism – it would influence America’s interventionist policies for the next one and a quarter century. In more than 80 countries worldwide, the US manages over 750 military facilities. With such distribution of military capabilities, it has and continues to influence (if not actually intervene) in major and minor conflicts – most recently in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. In May of this year, the Editorial Board of the Wall Street Journal called for the US to assist the opposition in overthrowing the Iranian regime after the death in a helicopter crash of Iran’s President, Ebrahim Raisi. And in the 'breadbasket' of Europe, former Deputy Secretary of State (and 'war hawk') Victoria Nuland continued to agitate for greater belligerency – urging the White House to help Ukraine strike deep inside Russian territory. Given the recent incursion by Kiev into Russia’s Kursk region, Biden appears to have acquiesced to that view. The US has since the Second World War and especially after the fall of the Wall in ‘89, pursued foreign policy initiatives that foster calls for escalation, rather than diplomatic discourse, in potentially serious geopolitical situations. In the late 1970s and ’80s, the U.S. funneled billions of dollars to Islamist extremists, including the Mujahideen Muslim guerrilla fighters that resisted the Soviet’s 10-year invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. While those fighters eventually expelled Russian influence, they later fought each other for dominance. In the ensuing power struggle (using American weapons), a cadre of those rebels (including Osama Bin Laden) ultimately coalesced into the Taliban, al-Qaeda – and 911. Since 9/11, America has expended over $8 trillion on wars with 'enemies' and 'friends' in the Middle East. Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen define the former – Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan the latter. And this while thousands of American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of civilians perish in America's foreign policy interventions to 'nation-build' and make the Middle East safe for democracy. Yet, irrespective of America’s decades-long failed foreign policy initiatives in the region, there are those who remain sanguine about further meddling in the Middle East. America's history in Iran is a prime example of what we should not have done in the past and should not do in the future. In 1953, the U.S. CIA along with Britain’s MI6 engineered the overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian leader, Mohammad Mosaddegh. The latter had nationalist leanings and opposed British petroleum companies’ exclusive oil rights in the country. The West further feared (without substantiation) that Mosaddegh had Communist sympathies that might push him to support the Soviets. Following the coup, the U.S. installed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi – a brutal dictator – loyal to the policies of the West. Decades of the Shah’s repressive rule inspired hatred toward America that culminated in the 1979 Iran hostage crisis and the Iranian Revolution. The Shah was ousted and the government replaced with the theocratic Islamic Republic we have today. And as we saw earlier, some want the U.S. to (once more) overthrow an Iranian government we were instrumental in bringing to power. Former Congressman Ron Paul said it very well in 2008: Terrorists 'don’t come here and attack us because we’re rich and we’re free. They come and they attack us because we’re over there.' The wars in Iraq are quintessential examples of American foreign policy initiatives based on shortsighted aims of neoconservative ideology during the George W. Bush years. Personal enmity and faulty (or unpopular) intelligence resulted in thousands of Americans killed based on a false premise. There never were any weapons of mass destruction – just the hatred of an arrogant Iraqi leader and the questionable notion of nation-building in the Middle East. Today, the wars continue. The US played an integral role in the events that led to the devastating war between Russia and Ukraine. Despite the fall of the Soviet Union in ‘89, NATO remained intact and expanded eastward. Soviet expert George Kennan, a key architect of US Cold War policy, warned such action would be 'a tragic mistake' that would ultimately provoke 'a bad reaction from Russia.' For over a decade now, against the warnings of former ambassador to Russia and current CIA Director William Burns, the U.S. has openly advocated for Ukrainian entry into NATO, a hard 'red line' for Russia. Even though Western meddling in the affairs of Ukraine was anathema to the Russians, the U.S. helped engineer a coup to overthrow the democratically elected president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014. The latter had announced that he would sign an economic agreement with Russia instead of the E.U. This would eventually lead to the Ukraine-Russia war currently in its second year of hostilities. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has disclosed that in 2021 (one year before the Ukraine-Russia conflict began) Russia sent NATO a draft treaty regarding Ukraine. The terms required NATO to abandon any future plans of expansion as a precondition for Russia not invading Ukraine. The West refused. Only then did Russia invade. The invasion, while reprehensible, certainly was telegraphed by Moscow and with no less than due warning. Recent research by Monica Duffy Toft, professor of international politics at Tufts, is instructive. The US she finds, is indeed engaging in military interventions more often than previously, and for different reasons. 'The rate of interventions has accelerated over time, and since the end of the Cold War, we’ve been pursuing fewer and lower national interests,' says Toft. Just since the year 2000, Toft's 5-year research project documents 72 interventions. And in one region of the world, the Middle East and North Africa, the U.S. has been involved in 77 military interventions, mostly since the 1940s. Toft likens the current state of U.S. foreign policy to a game of 'whack-a-mole,' in which the U.S. sees issues popping up and has 'only one way of dealing with them, which is the hammer' of military force. The professor is clear in her assessment: Overreliance on destabilizing sanctions and military force rather than diplomacy, intelligence gathering, economic statecraft, and the powers of persuasion harms America's reputation abroad, causing itself to be viewed as a threat – diminishing its influence in the process. America's current self-imposed role as the 'world's policeman' is a capitulation of US diplomatic leadership. But this is what happens when a great country like the United States allows decades of mediocre leadership to prevail. Political agendas produce foreign policy initiatives (Vietnam, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine) inconsistent with what is in the best interest of America. US foreign policy should seek two objectives: Keeping America safe and fostering America’s economic and political hegemony through strategic leadership rather than jeopardizing both by trying to be the 'world's policeman.' Professor Toft declares against an isolationist position, but neither she says should America's foreign policy default position be one of military intervention first. A century of this has failed to produce a safer world for anyone – including America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDYOMqMjkA8B8w23QCkPP1	2024-11-13T08:50:06-08:00	
Russian Experts Find Trump’s Ukraine Policy Fanciful – OpEd	Since Zelensky will not accept Trump's purported peace plan, he should be replaced by a more amenable Ukrainian leader, a Russian expert has said. Russian foreign policy experts are broadly appreciative of US President-elect Donald Trump's foreign policy pronouncements. But they have grave doubts about his ability to get Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to sit across a table and thrash out a mutually acceptable way of ending the war. Russian experts writing in Russia Today website find Trump's approach to the Ukraine question to be based on simplistic notions and not on a good understanding of the deep-rooted sentiments among Ukrainians about independence from Russia. Also, Trump has not grasped the Russia's well-founded fears about Europe and NATO using Ukraine against it. In fact, one of the experts even hinted that the only way Trump can bring an end to the war is by bringing about a regime change in Ukraine to bring in a leader who is amenable to giving Russia the concessions it expects to ensure its security. Appreciating the general drift of Trump's foreign policy, Fyodor Lukyanov says: 'Trump stands for a change in positioning. Instead of global dominance, there will be a vigorous defence of specific American interests. Priority will be given to those that bring clear benefits, not in the long term, but now.' Lukyanov goes further and says that Trump's belief in the primacy of domestic over foreign policy, which has always characterized Trump's supporters and has now spread throughout the Republican Party, means that his choice of international issues is going to be selective and restricted. 'Preserving the moral and political hegemony of the US is not an end in itself, but a tool. In such a system of priorities, the Ukrainian project loses the destiny it has in the eyes of the adherents of the liberal order. It becomes a pawn in a larger game,' Lukyanov points out. Another peculiarity he sees in Trump, is that the President-elect doesn't see war as an acceptable tool. 'Yes, Trump will use hard bargaining, muscle-flexing and coercive pressure (as practiced in his usual business), but not destructive armed conflict, because that is irrational.' Lukyanov looks at Trump's previous term and notices his refreshing approach to regional conflicts. One was the 'Abraham Accords', an agreement that facilitated formal relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries. The second was the meetings with Kim Jong-un of North Korea, including a full-fledged summit in Hanoi. 'The first was the result of shuttle diplomacy by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. The powerful financial interests of America, the Gulf monarchies and Israel led to a series of shady political deals. The current situation in the region is many times worse than it was then, but it cannot be said that the arrangements (the Abraham Accords) have collapsed. The framework is still in place,' Lukyanov asserts. However, that Middle Eastern settlement model may not be applicable to the situation in the Ukraine conflict, where the warring parties are fighting for their very existence and where room for manoeuvre is more limited. Be that as it may, it cannot be denied that Trump has thrown open a window of opportunity for Russia and Ukraine to explore solutions so that the extremely destructive war is brought to an end, Lukyanov says. But a leading Russian columnist on military affairs, Mikhail Khodarenok, is less sanguine. He is convinced that Trump's reported Ukraine peace plan is doomed to fail. Khodarenok quotes Wall Street Journal to say that Trump envisages a suspension of military operations along the front line, the creation of a demilitarized zone (DMZ), a guarantee that Ukraine won't join NATO for at least 20 years, and the West continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons. Wall Street Journal further says that Trump's promise to end the war by January's Inauguration Day puts him in the position of having to choose between competing proposals from his advisers, though all advisors are agreed on one basic point, that Joe Biden's plans to transfer arms and military equipment to Ukraine 'for as long as it takes' should be rejected outright. Khodarenok recalls that throughout his election campaign, Trump had sharply criticized Biden's handling of Ukraine, warning that it had brought the world closer to World War III, and that Ukraine had cheated the US out of billions of dollars in free weapons. According to Wall Street Journal Trump has not yet approved the final plan for resolving the conflict. He intends to continue discussing it with his closest advisers, the paper said. It is not clear what the de-militarized Zone (DMZ) would look like. Does it cover all the regions taken by Russia including the Crimean Peninsula? And if the classic definition of a DMZ is applied, military facilities on it must be removed, and the deployment of armed forces, the fortification of the terrain, and the conduct of combat and operational training activities on it are prohibited. According to the purported plan, the US will continue to supply Ukraine with arms and other military equipment. The US has promised this only to keep the Russians in check and prevent them from swiftly moving in and taking over all of Ukraine In all likelihood, Ukraine will reject this package, Khodarenok says. Maintaining the security regime in the DMZ will require, among other things, the presence of a contingent of peacekeepers (if only to separate the parties' forces). But since the US will not put its boots on the ground, its European allies may have to contribute units. Then, there is the question of Russia being allowed to keep (for ever), the territories it captured. Also, the role of NATO has to be restricted. According to Wall Street Journal, Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO for the next 20 years. Khodarenok wonders if such an assurance can be extracted from Ukraine when it is mortally afraid of Russia. And what is the sanctity of a 20-year bar on entering NATO, he asks. The Russian expert says the Ukrainian leadership will be the main stumbling block on the road to peace, as they completely and 'insanely' believe that there is only one way to keep the Russians away, and that is to defeat them militarily. But Ukraine lacks the means to do so. According to the expert, the only way in which Trump can move forward on Ukraine is to install in Kiev a new leadership capable of fulfilling his peace plan. The leadership should be reasonable, only then will negotiations be possible, Khodarenok says. In other words, Trump US must bring a regime change in Ukraine as part of the peace process.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0rjmhE2TKDTJ	2024-11-13T08:48:15-08:00	
Tripolar Instability: Nuclear Competition Among The United States...	The development of nuclear weapons by the erstwhile Soviet Union (USSR) in 1949 marked the beginning of nuclear polarisation between the USSR and the US, which became the major element of the Cold War. China joined the nuclear club when it crossed the nuclear threshold in 1964 and maintained a minimum deterrence policy with a No First Use (NFU) doctrine. However, recent developments in Taiwan Straits, South and East China Seas have transformed the strategic status quo compelling China to work towards achieving a more favorable nuclear equation vis-a-vis the US in terms of warheads and delivery systems, altering the strategic landscape in response to the changing global environment. In his book Tripolar Instability: Nuclear Competition among the United States, Russia and China, Robert Litwak explores the transition from a bipolar nuclear world to what Henry Kissinger called 'a new era' of tripolar nuclear security and rivalry between the US, Russia and China. The book comprises four chapters. First chapter addresses the destabilising shift from the two great powers (US and USSR) to an emergent tripolar nuclear order in which China seeks to maintain a balance of power with the US and Russia. Chapters two and three describe the strategic stability as an interaction between arms race stability and crisis stability. The final chapter assesses the risks and challenges to security in the event of a tripolar world phenomenon in which the rules-based system has been largely destroyed. The theme of the book revolves around the argument that the combination of emerging nuclear tripolarity and geostrategic tensions over Ukraine and Taiwan are recreating two interlocking Cold War risks. These factors threaten to undermine both arms race stability and crisis stability – the two elements that comprise strategic stability (p.6). Analysts have identified two major risks in the emergent tripolar nuclear order: (i) the stability-instability paradox; and (ii) balance of terror. The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis was a clear example of the potentially catastrophic consequences of 'unmanaged competition' between the US and the USSR. In its aftermath, a key factor in strategic stability has been the threat of retaliation, based on assured second-strike nuclear capability. From this perspective, China’s development of a larger survivable nuclear force may play a stabilising role (p.87) by deterring potential aggression from other nuclear powers and reducing the risk of nuclear conflict. Litwak, in describing the transition period of the post-Cold War era, argues that the triangular relationship among the three powers – US, Russia and China – has created new strategic challenges and complexities that are not adequately addressed by existing nuclear deterrence theories and arms control agreements. According to the author, each leg of the triangle is not equivalent because of the uneven distribution of their power (economic and military) and trilateral politics, which have evolved over the decades. (p.22) One of the book’s strengths lies in its thorough analysis of each country’s nuclear strategy and posture. Litwak delves into the doctrinal shifts, modernisation efforts, and strategic calculations that underpin the nuclear policies of the US, Russia and China. He provides a nuanced understanding of how these countries perceive each other’s capabilities and intentions, and how these perceptions shape their respective approaches to deterrence and arms control. For example, the US withdrawal from Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, had implications for the sufficiency of China’s minimum deterrent posture. Secondly, the termination of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, concluded with the Soviet Union in 1988, could now permit US deployment of intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Asia to counter China. (p.33) The author has also explored the implications of emerging technologies, such as hypersonic weapons, missile defense systems, cyber capabilities and artificial intelligence, on the strategic stability of the tripolar nuclear competition. The extension of strategic competition into the domains of cyberspace and outer space creates additional escalatory risks that undermine crisis stability. He raises important questions about the potential for miscalculation and inadvertent escalation in today’s more complex and less predictable environment. Beyond assessment, Litwak also offers thoughtful policy recommendations aimed at mitigating the risks associated with tripolar nuclear competition. He advocates renewed diplomatic engagement and avoiding the use of conventional military weapons to prevent inadvertent escalation among the three powers, emphasising the need for innovative arms control frameworks that account for the realities of the current strategic landscape. The author also underscores the importance of crisis communication mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of accidental or unintended conflict. (p.107) The book is well-researched and comprehensive in its contents. The issues discussed are complex and require close attention of the reader. However, for scholars, policymakers, and practitioners in the field of global security, Litwak’s analysis provides invaluable insights and a fresh perspective on the evolving dynamics of nuclear competition in the 21st century. The author’s work stands out for its depth of analysis and relevance to contemporary global security challenges. The book not only elucidates the dangers inherent in the current tripolar nuclear order but also offers a constructive path forward for reducing the risks associated with catastrophic conflicts. The book is a timely contribution to the discourse on global security, particularly in an era marked by growing geopolitical tensions and the erosion of established arms control frameworks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0jDFtH9RotFd	2024-11-13T08:46:07-08:00	
Will Artificial Intelligence Develop At The Expense Of Natural In...	Since time immemorial, humans have taken pride in the natural intelligence they possess, which helps them analyse information, process ideas, assess the pros and cons of various scenarios, and arrive at firm judgements. This is an essential human attribute that animals lack, as they are driven solely by survival instincts and do not possess the capacity to discern between good and bad. While this natural intelligence—featuring analytical ability, memory power, and the capability for quick thinking and logical conclusions—is inherent in every human being, it must be developed and fine-tuned through practice. If neglected, this ability will become dormant and may decline over time. Failure to nurture and apply our natural intelligence effectively amounts to disregarding this God-given capacity. At a recent consultative meeting, a school teacher from India shared an anecdote illustrating how the learning process is evolving among young students in line with technological advancements and the proliferation of electronic gadgets. The teacher recounted asking a student his age, to which he correctly responded, '12 years and 4 months.' When asked for his grandfather's age, the student also answered correctly, saying, '79 years and 3 months.' However, when asked to calculate the difference between the two ages within 20 seconds, the student initially tried to count on his fingers before starting to look around. Upon being asked what he was searching for, he replied, 'A calculator.' The teacher noted that, in earlier times, mental arithmetic exercises were common in schools. Teachers would give students timed sums to solve mentally, aiming to encourage quick and alert thinking among students in their formative years. Nowadays, however, this practice seems to be disappearing, with many young students relying on calculators for basic arithmetic. In the past, teachers also insisted that students memorise tables and poems, a practice intended to strengthen memory from an early age—an invaluable skill as they grew older. Similarly, précis writing was once considered an essential exercise for helping students distil the key points of a text, organise information, and convey it succinctly, aiding comprehension for the reader. Today, however, this practice appears to be fading, with many believing artificial intelligence can accomplish this task instead. With the growth of technology, even public speaking has transformed. Many speakers now rely on teleprompters, and the art of extemporaneous speaking, which requires a dynamic thought process tailored to the occasion, seems to be diminishing. In another instance, a college student studying world history was asked by his teacher to quickly outline the events leading to World War II. The student responded that he would need to open his laptop to retrieve the information. When the teacher stressed the importance of memory, the student replied that, in his view, it was unnecessary to retain such details when they are readily available online. He added that he didn't see the point in using his mental resources for information that could be accessed instantly on the internet. Taken aback, the teacher was left questioning whether the student's perspective might be valid. Noticing his teacher's confusion, the student politely suggested that he 'use artificial intelligence to find an answer'! Despite the rise of artificial intelligence, fostering and utilising natural intelligence remains crucial. Artificial intelligence itself must be guided and assessed by natural intelligence, given that it is a creation of human ingenuity. Therefore, excessive dependence on artificial intelligence for analysis, interpretation, and judgement may pose significant risks. While artificial intelligence offers an impressive array of tools, it should be seen as a limited aid, not a comprehensive solution. Artificial intelligence is still an evolving field, and policies regarding its use are yet to be fully developed or standardised globally. Currently, there is no international consensus on the strategies and frameworks for its implementation. For humanity to progress as a civilised society, natural intelligence, memory power, analytical ability, and the capacity to discern right from wrong based on ethical values are indispensable. In short, natural intelligence can be complemented but never wholly replaced by artificial intelligence. Let it not be a case of artificial intelligence versus human intelligence; rather, let artificial intelligence be scrutinised, evaluated, and deployed thoughtfully by natural intelligence at all times.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0iUZlNZE-2vR	2024-11-13T08:44:17-08:00	
Turkey Cannot Halt Oil Shipments From Azerbaijan To Israel Withou...	Turkey lacks the authority to halt oil shipments from Azerbaijan to Israel without a UN sanctions resolution. At most, Turkey can request or advise Azerbaijan on the matter. Ultimately, Azerbaijan has the sole right to decide who buys its oil. If Turkey were to block shipments through the BTC (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) pipeline because they are destined for Israel, it would be liable for compensating investors and producers for their financial losses. The agreements governing BTC, IGA, and HGA pipelines are structured to protect such investments; otherwise, investors would be unwilling to fund these major projects. The BTC pipeline and the broader East-West energy corridor were initially conceived with the goal of securing energy supplies for Israel. For instance, prior to the Blue Stream project, there was the Lassere Project, which aimed to transport natural gas to Israel. Gazprom, one of the Lassere Project partners, adapted the plan to cross the Black Sea, proposing three pipeline routes: two lines for Turkey and one for Israel, each with a capacity of 8 billion cubic meters. However, when Israel discovered its own offshore natural gas reserves, the Israeli pipeline portion of the project was abandoned. The United States places a high priority on ensuring Israel's energy security, given Israel's role as its most important ally in the region. From their perspective, this focus is understandable. We are not presenting these observations as a criticism but to illustrate that the realities we recognized in the past are now becoming more widely understood.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0jwEB3BCQvc6	2024-11-13T08:40:21-08:00	
Ukraine ‘Outgunned And Outnumbered’: Desertions En Masse – OpEd	Early 2022 witnessed the high morale of the Ukrainian military and civilian population resulting in to be a force multiplier for the Ukrainian army’s defense power against the war with Russia. In comparison, the low morale of the Russian supported forces and military near neutralized Russia’s overwhelming military superiority over Ukraine in the early months of the war. The initial euphoria of February 2022 of joining the forces to protect their motherland has evaporated, owing to an astronomical number of deaths. Ukraine’s military is now ‘Outgunned and Outnumbered’, struggling with low morale and high rate of desertions. As the battlefield situation deteriorated, an increasing number of troops have started to desert. In just the first four months of 2024, prosecutors launched criminal proceedings against almost 19,000 soldiers who either abandoned their posts or deserted, according to the Ukrainian parliament. This prolonged war nearing three years have near decimated many Ukrainian infantry battalions making the situation grim on the battle fronts. Reinforcements are few and difficult to be created, leaving soldiers exhausted, demoralized and desert. Despite Ukrainian President Zelensky determined to continue fighting the war, young Ukrainians are fiercely opposing conscription and refusing to go to the warfront to get killed. The escalating fighting along a more than 1,000-km front line is stretching Ukraine's already outnumbered troops. Ukraine said on Nov 11 that its hard-pressed military was battling 50,000 troops in Russia's Kursk region to its north, while also scrambling to reinforce two besieged fronts in the east and bracing to meet an infantry assault in the south. Crucially, soldiers say they are poorly armed and complain of having the enemy in sight, watching them advance, and being unable to fire because they have no ammunition, according to accounts from soldiers reported by CNN. The figures vary Truth is the first casualty in any war and so has been in this Ukraine- Russia War. True statistics are not available from both the nations and their militaries. The casualty figures and damage destruction estimates for both sides have been exaggerated for the opposing sides! Military War Casualties. Citing a confidential estimate from Ukraine earlier this year, the report suggested that 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died, while 400,000 had been wounded. Meanwhile, Western intelligence estimates suggest Russian losses range from 200,000 dead to around 400,000 wounded. Both Russia and Ukraine have kept their war casualties confidential. In February, Ukrainian President Zelensky stated that around 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed. However, former political and security officials believe this figure underplays the true scale of losses in order to maintain public morale and continue recruitment efforts. Desertions. According to the Kyiv Post, it is believed that about 60,000 people have been facing criminal charges for fleeing their posts since the war started. However, British daily The Times also cited figures from the prosecutor general which, it said, showed some 51,000 criminal cases were initiated for desertion and abandonment of a military unit between January and September of this year. El Pais cited a closer figure of 45,543 desertions between January and August this year, which it said was data from the Prosecutor General’s Office which had been leaked to the Ukrainian press. Ukraine’s youth not willing to fight a war that’s not their own. Ukrainian army today faces a serious desertion crisis as 30,000-plus soldiers have already fled from their posts. Civilian Deaths. As of 31 August, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) had verified that conflict-related violence had killed 11,743 civilians and injured 24,614 in Ukraine since 24 February 2022.Independent assessments have put the civilian toll closer to 100,000. Migrants. Some 14 million Ukrainian Migrantshave fled their homes either to other countries or other parts of Ukraine. According to the UN refugee agency, Poland is sheltering more than 1.5 million people from Ukraine. Will the majority migrants ever come back. Russian leaflets calling for Ukrainian troops surrender Russian troops dropped leaflets using drones with special QR codes (23 September 2024) calling for the surrender of Ukrainian troops, who are still entrenched in Novoukrainka in the South Donetsk direction west of Ugledar. Each leaflet dropped contained a call to immediately abandon their weapons, giving the enemy the opportunity to surrender on the battlefield, and instructions on how to do so, before their positions are powerfully stormed! The two-year battle for Ugledar, is likely to end with a victory for the Russian troops! This situation was expected much earlier and truth had to prevail about the ground reality; 'They do not want to fight because they don’t see a clear cause worth fighting for: they are beginning to realize that they are not fighting for Ukraine; at best, they’re fighting for Zelensky and his circle, who are profiting tremendously from this Ukrainian tragedy. They realize that they are fighting for Europe and for the Americans, and that neither Zelensky, nor the Europeans, nor the Americans care about Ukrainian lives.' As part of the plan to boost morale of the front-line troops specially trained officers are posted to provide moral and psychological support. No one talks of Peace including the UN The US, NATO and the West wants the war to continue and escalate in order to weaken Russia. Zelensky has a so called ‘Victory Plan’ if adequately supported by the Western allies led by the US. From the heads of states of the stake holders to gun makers, traders, diplomats, the war is lucrative for everyone. Will the US President-elect Donald Trump having promised to bring an end to these ongoing wars of Ukraine and Gaza succeed? Both the wars have brought profit and prosperity to the US arms industry. Militarism is the US national religion 'We believe in wars. We may no longer believe in formal declarations of war…We believe in weaponry, the more expensive the better'. Will Donald Trump change this American belief in his second tenure as the US President? No one talks of Peace including the UN. The powerful players do not listen to the UN.

Pollsters Miss ‘Sleeper Issues’ – OpEd	Pollsters seeking to tap what is on the mind of voters are right to focus on the big issues: the economy, illegal immigration, crime, abortion, education, healthcare, foreign policy, and the like. But there are other matters that affect voters, though they are not front and center in most people’s minds. They are more like 'sleeper issues.' Lots of Americans these days, especially those in their middle years and older, are voicing a sense of uneasiness, even bewilderment, about the state of our society in general. Their apprehension is not necessarily rooted in something that Washington has done. It’s more a realization that things have gotten out of whack. Extremes dominate. In large part, the extremes are rooted in culture, not politics. We can tell from public opinion research that Americans are very concerned about the moral direction of the country. Selfishness, self-absorption, rudeness, and a complete disregard for the rights and sensibilities of others is evident in school and the workplace. Inappropriate use of cell phones—on trains and buses and in bars and restaurants—is commonplace. Those who sport vulgar lyrics and videos take no responsibility for how they corrupt young people. Car drivers are increasing distracted and unwilling to yield. Those on bicycles and scooters—the motorized ones are the worst—show no regard for public safety. All of these things feed the perception that America is becoming unhinged. The fact that few are held accountable for their transgressions makes things worse. There are also policy issues that matter in this regard. When school officials and politicians aid and abet mentally challenged young people who want to transition to the opposite sex—absent parental consent—they are contributing to our culture of opportunism. Ditto for hospitals that exploit these disturbed minors by fast-tracking the changes. It’s all about ideological extremism and greed. It could be argued that it would be illogical for voters to blame politicians for the cultural issues that are making people uneasy. Technically, that is true. But in the real world, we are all a blend of reason and emotion. In other words, those upset with extremism in the culture are likely to blame officials who harbor an extremist political agenda for cultural depravities. For example, politicians who believe that tampons should be put in boys’ bathrooms are clearly not responsible for those who talk loudly on their cell phones in public places, but because they promote extremist policies, voters may see them as emblematic of our overall condition. This is the kind of 'sleeper issue' that is in the back of people’s minds. Such issues are capable of exploding at election time—it’s like a frustration time bomb—yet they are not likely to be discerned by pollsters. In short, cultural issues are often treated as insignificant by pollsters during election season. This explains, in part, why they are so often wrong in their prognostications. What’s in the back of people’s minds has a way of leaping to the front, or at least becoming more important, when they cast their ballot. The price for extremism is costly in a democracy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0kx3cU0zDwjT	2024-11-13T08:34:43-08:00	
Karachi-Chittagong Ports Connectivity Between Pakistan And Bangla...	On November 13, a direct cargo ship from Karachi, Pakistan, arrived in the port of Chittagong, Bangladesh, establishing the first-ever direct maritime connection between the two nations. This was a huge step to strengthen the connections. The Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea bind Bangladesh and Pakistan, who are close neighbors. Both nations would gain from the growth of these marine linkages in terms of regional communications, trade, and investment. 2907 nautical miles separate the ports of Chittagong, Bangladesh, and Karachi, Pakistan. Trade was conducted through Singapore and other nearby ports due to the lack of marine connectivity between Chattogram Port and Pakistan's port in Karachi. Consequently, trading volumes have not yet reached a noteworthy level. However, Pakistan and Bangladesh are positioned well on a number of economic indices. Therefore, they wish to use this marine link to improve bilateral commerce. Although ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan remained chilly under Sheikh Hasina's 15-year administration, optimism about the possible normalization of comprehensive economic connections has been reignited by Bangladesh's recent political upheaval. Bangladesh is looking for additional overseas partners to help it overcome the present economic issues. Therefore, increasing trade and economic cooperation as well as looking into joint ventures and investment possibilities may be advantageous to both parties and promote regional development. The direct route promises to save travel times and greatly simplify supply networks. With an expected capacity of 2,300 TEUs and the ability to carry a wide range of cargo, the ship's journey demonstrates the rising need for direct trade between the two nations. In addition to creating a more integrated commerce network throughout the area, Syed Ahmed Maroof, Pakistan's High Commissioner to Bangladesh, described the direct shipping route as a significant step forward in strengthening corporate and bilateral trade connections between Pakistan and Bangladesh. According to him, the program would not only quicken current trade flows but also open up new business prospects for companies of all sizes, from tiny importers to major exporters. Cotton accounted for the majority of Pakistan's $839 million in exports to Bangladesh in 2022. Jute and other textile fibers were Bangladesh's top exports to Pakistan, which brought in $74 million. The majority of Bangladesh's imports from Pakistan include equipment, cotton, salt, and sulfur—raw materials used in the apparel sector. At least $2.95 billion worth of commodities, including textiles, agricultural products, food, chemicals, and more, might be exported from Pakistan to Bangladesh. Bangladesh might potentially be a major market for Pakistani exports like jute and medicinal items. Through organizations like the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), both nations might investigate further regional economic integration.With increased commerce between the two nations, there has been a renewed push for the establishment of direct shipping services between the ports of Chittagong and Karachi. The primary seaport in Bangladesh is Chittagong. The Chattagram Port Terminal handles 90% of Bangladesh's commerce, with the remaining 80% going through the ports of Mangla and Payra. For the same reasons and with a notable increase in commerce, Bangladesh may likewise profit from using Pakistan's Gwadar port. commerce between Karachi and Bangladesh's Chittagong, Payra, and Mangla ports will increase commerce and shorten the distance between the two nations. After that, this network may be expanded to Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia, and Northeast China. Connectivity at sea is essential. To establish a trilateral access and distribution center, Sri Lanka's Colombo and Hambantota Ports can be used to link Pakistan's Gwadar ports, which include Karachi, Port Qasim, and Keti Bandar, with Bangladesh's Chittagong, Payra, and Mangla ports. Products like cotton are imported by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka from Pakistan, Central Asian nations, Western and Central China, and even Russia. Bangladeshi clothing, pharmaceuticals, fruits, and vegetables, as well as its emerging IT services and electronic sectors, can be combined with Sri Lanka's traditional tea, clothing, rice, and agricultural businesses, as well as emerging mechanical and industrial manufacturing industries like car tires. Bangladesh is well situated to serve as a gateway between SAARC and ASEAN, giving each region's export-oriented businesses possible access to both. Whereas SAARC comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Between Central Asia, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Northwest China, Pakistan serves as a gateway and a hub. As a result, supply chain value and regional commerce may be developed in a way never seen before. It is anticipated that direct maritime connectivity between Karachi and Chittagong will be crucial to the growth of trade and commerce between the two nations. They may significantly cut down on the time and expense of shipping products between them, and they will probably be crucial in forging connections with other Middle Eastern and Central Asian nations, such as China and Russia. Direct shipping between the two nations will incentivize traders to increase their regional investment and trade. It is anticipated that both countries would gain from the development of trade and commercial corridors that are coordinated between Bangladesh's Look West Policy and Pakistan's Dhaka rapprochement, as well as from the building of connection through coastal shipping.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0k3v2dZmQm4T	2024-11-13T08:33:00-08:00	
Pakistan’s Potential Benefits From Effectiveness Of CSTO Proposal...	The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a regional security bloc led by Russia, has recently proposed enhancing security around Afghanistan through a comprehensive approach that includes counterterrorism efforts, border security, economic cooperation, and regional diplomatic engagement. This proposal primarily targets Afghanistan's unstable political and security situation and seeks to stabilize the broader Central Asian region. For Pakistan, a key neighboring country to Afghanistan and an important player in the region’s geopolitical dynamics, the success and effectiveness of CSTO’s security proposal could offer several potential benefits. While Pakistan is not a member of the CSTO, its interests align in several ways with the objectives of the organization, making it a key stakeholder in the success of these initiatives. One of the most immediate and significant benefits for Pakistan from the CSTO’s effectiveness would be enhanced regional stability. Afghanistan has long been a source of instability for Pakistan, with various terrorist groups operating along the porous border between the two countries. The resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, along with the presence of extremist factions like ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K), has directly impacted Pakistan's security, particularly in the tribal areas and Balochistan province. The CSTO’s proposal to strengthen border security and deploy joint counterterrorism forces along Afghanistan’s borders could reduce the flow of militants into Pakistan. By improving border surveillance and creating stronger intelligence-sharing networks, the CSTO's efforts could help Pakistan better control cross-border insurgent movements, thus alleviating the strain on Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies. In addition, the proposal aims to address the drug trade that funds terrorism. Afghanistan has long been the world’s leading producer of opium, much of which is trafficked into Pakistan. By tackling the roots of this illicit trade, the CSTO’s initiatives could disrupt terrorist financing and reduce the overall level of violence and instability in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Economic development is another area where Pakistan could benefit from the effectiveness of the CSTO’s proposal. The CSTO’s emphasis on regional economic cooperation, particularly in trade, infrastructure development, and job creation, aligns with Pakistan’s interests in expanding economic ties with its neighbors. As a country with a growing economy and a strategic location at the crossroads of Central and South Asia, Pakistan stands to gain from a more stable and prosperous Afghanistan. If the CSTO’s proposal succeeds in fostering regional economic integration, Pakistan could benefit from enhanced trade routes and more open access to Central Asian markets. Afghanistan, situated between Central Asia and Pakistan, is a natural trade corridor. The development of infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and energy pipelines, could improve connectivity between Pakistan’s ports (like Karachi) and Central Asia, offering Pakistan better access to regional markets. Moreover, the CSTO’s security framework could complement Pakistan’s own efforts to combat terrorism and extremism within its borders. By enhancing regional security cooperation, Pakistan would gain from coordinated efforts with Central Asian states, Russia, and other key players in addressing shared security concerns. The CSTO’s approach could open the door for more comprehensive regional security pacts and multilateral initiatives that could help Pakistan deal with its own security challenges, particularly in Balochistan and the tribal areas. While Pakistan’s relations with India are primarily characterized by rivalry, particularly over the disputed Kashmir region, the success of the CSTO’s initiatives could help Pakistan counterbalance India’s growing influence in the region. By engaging with the CSTO’s efforts, Pakistan could ensure that it plays a central role in shaping Afghanistan’s future, while simultaneously preventing India from exerting disproportionate influence in the region. If the CSTO succeeds in stabilizing Afghanistan and creating economic opportunities, the flow of refugees into Pakistan could decrease, alleviating the socio-economic burden on Pakistan’s border provinces. By supporting or engaging with the CSTO’s initiatives, Pakistan could not only secure its own national interests but also contribute to broader regional stability and prosperity. For Pakistan, the CSTO’s efforts represent an important opportunity for regional cooperation, but the country must carefully assess the geopolitical landscape and its own strategic priorities as it seeks to maximize the benefits from these initiatives. The effectiveness of the CSTO’s proposal, coupled with Pakistan’s proactive engagement, could indeed play a significant role in fostering a more stable and prosperous South and Central Asia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYIf6ud5Xd0mR71TIEldhh	2024-11-13T08:31:44-08:00	
The Clock Is Ticking On Sub-Saharan Africa’s Urgent Job Creation ...	As the rest of the world grapples with aging populations, Africa’s population is booming. By 2030, half of all new entrants into the global labor force will come from sub-Saharan Africa, requiring the creation of up to 15 million new jobs annually. As the Chart of the Week shows, this challenge is particularly acute in fragile, conflict-affected, and low-income economies. They account for nearly 80 percent of the region’s annual job creation needs, but to date have struggled the most to create jobs. These economies have high fertility rates, with youth populations yet to peak. For example, Niger has a population of 26 million people and a youth population share that is not expected to peak until 2058—the country will need to create 650,000 new jobs annually for the next 30 years. In contrast, many middle-income countries like Botswana, Ghana, Namibia, and Mauritius have seen their youth shares of populations peak already and will face less severe job creation pressures. Harnessing Africa’s booming population growth potential requires generating vast numbers of productive, quality jobs that provide above-subsistence-level income, whether in formal roles or self-employment. There are three main challenges to creating enough good jobs, but policymakers have the tools at their disposal to make a difference. Shifting informal jobs from a trap to a stepping-stone. Targeted policies include boosting productivity in the informal sector through well matched skills training, better access to finance, and policies that encourage transitioning to formal employment. It is valuable to create labor market programs that help young people, especially women who face additional barriers, enter the workforce, ensuring they have the tools to succeed. Creating conditions that are conducive to jobs growth in high-productivity sectors like modern services and manufacturing. Given limited public finances, governments can prioritize measures that benefit multiple sectors, such as improving market competition and making value-for-money infrastructure investments. They should be cautious with industrial policies that target specific sectors, as they can be expensive, distortionary, and pose corruption risks. Breaking down barriers to private business growth. Prioritizing important infrastructure like electricity, internet, roads, and affordable public transport can ease the flow of goods and services. Cutting red tape and curbing corruption will also help companies grow. Attracting more foreign direct investment and developing local capital markets can make more financing available. And strengthening regional integration and trade can expand markets. The international community has much to gain from thriving employment in sub-Saharan Africa. Not only is robust jobs growth good for the countries and the people of the region, but it will also provide an engine of growth, consumption and investment for the global economy. Failure could exacerbate poverty, fuel instability and drive migration, while success can unlock prosperity for both Africa and the globe. Policymakers must strive for meaningful change that will create a path for millions of people toward a brighter jobs future. —This article is based on an analytical note included in the October 2024 Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa, The Clock is Ticking on Sub-Saharan Africa’s Urgent Job Creation Challenge, by Wenjie Chen, Khushboo Khandelwal, Athene Laws, Faten Saliba, Can Sever and Luc Tucker of the IMF’s African Department.

Intelligence Sharing As An Alternative To ‘Asian NATO’ – Analysis	By Asher Ellis Recent proposals for a military alliance in the Asia Pacific region risk escalating tensions and overlooking regional dynamics. A different approach — focused on intelligence sharing — offers a pragmatic way to enhance regional security while maintaining stability. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office in October 2024, drew international attention just weeks into his term by advocating for an ‘Asian version of NATO‘. His proposal has faced significant pushback from China, which accuses Japan of escalating tensions and promoting a ‘Cold War mentality‘, and from the United States and several Southeast Asian nations wary of increasing regional tensions. The US ambassador to Japan has echoed the need for enhanced regional cooperation, albeit advocating for a different approach. He proposed an economic trade–defence alliance aimed at countering China’s coercion rather than a traditional military pact. The need for enhanced cooperation in the Asia Pacific is clear. Chinese aggression against Taiwan, the militarisation of artificial islands in the South China Sea and North Korea’s ongoing missile testscontinue to exacerbate regional security concerns. But adopting a Cold War-era alliance model, designed for a different geopolitical context, is impractical. It overlooks the region’s complex geography, diverse political and economic systems and many Asian states’ significant economic ties with China. Instead, the United States and its Asian partners should focus on enhancing intelligence-sharing efforts. Existing frameworks — such as the Quad partnership between the United States, India, Japan and Australia — have made progress in maritime domain awareness and cybersecurity. The Quad’s Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness leverages advanced satellite-based radio frequency data to aid partner countries in monitoring their waters more effectively. Australia has engaged extensively in intelligence cooperation with its neighbours, both bilaterally and multilaterally, particularly in fields such as policing and counterterrorism. This cooperation dates back to responses to the Bali and Jakarta bombings in the early 2000s, efforts to combat piracy and smuggling in maritime Southeast Asia and support during events like the Marawi siegein the Philippines in 2017. Some Asian countries also engage in bilateral intelligence-sharing efforts. The General Security of Military Information Agreement between South Korea and Japan facilitates the exchange of sensitive military information. But it exists largely due to US mediation and pressure, underscoring the United States’ role in brokering and sustaining such frameworks. ASEAN’s ‘Our Eyes’ Initiative aims to facilitate intelligence exchange among Southeast Asian nations, focusing on counterterrorism and violent extremism. New efforts between the United States and the Philippines, as well as between the United States, Japan and Taiwan, seek to increase intelligence sharing in specific contexts, such as cyber threats and geospatial intelligence. Despite these initiatives, intelligence sharing in Asia remains sporadic and lacks integration into broader networks, leaving gaps that adversaries could exploit. To build a more cohesive regional security network, countries like the United States and Japan must broaden their efforts, starting with less sensitive but highly valuable domains to build trust and demonstrate the benefits of cooperation. Geospatial intelligence, derived from satellite imagery and remote sensors, is becoming less sensitive due to the growing availability of commercial satellite data, but is helpful for monitoring shipping lanes, detecting illegal activities and responding to natural disasters. The growth of open-source intelligence datasets from private companies can also enhance the capabilities of countries with limited traditional intelligence assets. Cyber threat intelligence is another area ripe for collaboration, as nations face common threats from cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure and government networks. Collaboration in these domains would help establish a shared understanding of regional security challenges. To facilitate this cooperation, the United States and its Asian partners should develop standardised, secure protocols for sharing information, with tiered access levels allowing countries to participate based on their capabilities and trust levels. Building upon existing frameworks like the Quad to create a ‘Quad+’ network that includes key regional players such as South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia would enhance collaboration. Initial cooperation could focus on sharing maritime surveillance data and cyber threat intelligence, setting the foundation for expanding into more sensitive areas as trust builds. But significant obstacles remain. Many Asian countries lack adequate security infrastructure and the capacity for secure information handling, complicating the sharing of classified data. Indonesia suffered a major cybersecurity breach in May 2024 when hackers attacked its national data centre, disrupting critical public services and exposing vulnerabilities. Chinese hacking groups have targeted Southeast Asian government and military entities, seeking to steal intelligence related to South China Sea strategies. Taiwan faces extensive infiltration by Chinese intelligence, raising concerns about the security of shared information. The United States and its allies can provide technical support and training to enhance cybersecurity defences and information-handling protocols. This capacity-building approach not only facilitates intelligence sharing but also strengthens the overall security posture of partner nations. Enhancing intelligence-sharing frameworks rather than establishing a NATO-like military alliance represents a pragmatic path to regional security. By standardising protocols, expanding existing networks and building nations’ capacities to protect information, the Asia Pacific could bolster its security needs without exacerbating tensions or forcing countries to take sides. The future of Asia Pacific security depends not on adopting old structures, but on strategic cooperation that builds trust and tangibly enhances regional readiness and stability.

Malaysia Could Lose Western Investments Over Project With Chinese...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Malaysia could risk losing future investments in the technology sector if it aligns too closely with Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, which the United States and its allies have accused of espionage and intellectual property theft, analysts warn. Western firms could think Beijing has an unfair advantage in Kuala Lumpur’s growing tech market, said Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, a partner at regional consultant ADA Southeast Asia. Malaysia’s partnership with the U.S.-blacklisted Huawei to set up the country’s second 5G network 'could be perceived as favoring Chinese interests,' he said. 'The Malaysian government may consider Huawei’s partnership a pragmatic economic decision,' Asrul told BenarNews. 'However, Western investors might view this differently, especially since several countries, including the U.S., United Kingdom and Japan, have blacklisted the company and view it as a security threat.' In addition, the partnership with Huawei could trigger uncertainty among international investors, according to Farlina Said, an analyst at the Institute of Strategic & International Studies Malaysia, a research think-tank. 'Considering Malaysia is in phases of strengthening the digital economy and some of the nation’s digital economy development plans come with international collaboration, [the project with Huawei] could create an environment of uncertainty,' she told BenarNews. Malaysia plays a significant role in the global technology and semiconductor supply chain, attracting more than U.S. $20 billion from tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle and Infineon over the last two years. Chinese company ByteDance, TikTok’s parent, also committed U.S. $350 million to expand its data center operations in Malaysia into a regional AI hub. Kuala Lumpur hopes that the multi-billion dollars of investments in the technology sector will create thousands of jobs in the country by 2030, according to the government. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim views a second 5G network as essential to meet surging broadband demand and attract more global investments amid heightened U.S.-China trade tensions. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission conducted a technical and commercial evaluation to choose a mobile network operator for the project, Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said last week. The decision to award U Mobile – Huawei’s local partner – complies with licensing conditions, he said. 'The factors for selection include contributions to projects [for rural telecommunication access], as well as performance on 4G upgrade initiatives.' The government also reviewed U Mobile’s business and technical plans, customer satisfaction record and prior performance on infrastructure projects, the minister said. U Mobile, backed by powerful stakeholders such as Malaysia’s king, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, defended itself from criticisms by pointing to its 17-year history in the sector and promising a cost-effective 5G rollout. Huawei’s communications team did not immediately respond to a BenarNews request for comment. Malaysia-China relations Previously, Anwar said Malaysia was committed to using Chinese technology in its tech infrastructure. 'We have adopted the policy of getting the Chinese technology, 5G, involved in the development of our country,' Anwar told Chinese President Xi Jinping during his four-day working visit to China last week, his third trip to the Asian superpower since being named prime minister in 2022. China has been Malaysia’s biggest trading partner since 2009. Bilateral trade between the two countries surged to over $117.5 billion in the first seven months of 2024, state news agency Bernama quoted Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Ouyang Yujing as saying. During his Beijing trip, Anwar also met with Huawei executives, discussing the company’s '5.5G' tech, cloud and artificial intelligence applications. Espionage concerns In May 2023, the U.S. and European Union issued a rare joint letter to the Malaysian government cautioning against Huawei’s involvement. A Financial Times report cited a leaked letter from former U.S. Ambassador Brian McFeeters warning that 'allowing untrusted suppliers in any part of the network also subjects Malaysia’s infrastructure to national security risks.' The U.S. has banned Huawei from its 5G networks and European countries have followed suit because of espionage concerns. Investigators determined Huawei equipment installed near U.S. military bases can intercept and disrupt sensitive defense communications, including those related to the oversight of the country’s nuclear deterrent, Reuters news service reported in July 2022. Ong Kian Ming, former deputy minister for International Trade and Industry, said the Malaysian government should have been more transparent in awarding the 5G contract to U Mobile. 'I do not think that having Huawei as the vendor for the second network is necessarily damaging for investor confidence, provided that: (i) the award of that contract is open and transparent and (ii) the [government company Digital Nasional Berhad which oversees Malaysia’s 5G network initiative] remains in place and is performing well,' Ong told BenarNews in a message. Second Trump term Meanwhile, a foreign affairs analyst said a second term for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could mean stricter policies toward Chinese technology abroad. 'Trump will have greater flexibility and pragmatism in handling China, which might not always be transactional in nature and can also be more direct and forceful,' said University of Malaya’s Collins Chong Yew Keat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVqO8JswWMgxc	2024-11-12T16:36:36-08:00	
What Are Republics, Exactly? It’s A Good Time To Learn – Analysis	Republican ideals have evolved over millennia, shaping governance across the globe. Modern republics continue to adapt, but face challenges in upholding their foundational principles. The 2024 U.S. presidential election was framed as a crucial test for the nation's political system, with ongoing concerns over oligarchy, mob rule, a breakdown of equal protection under the law, and the ultimate power of citizens to determine the fate of the nation. Republics have suffered total collapses throughout history, and there's no reason why the United States should be immune. The fear of that often prompts a superficial reference to the final fall of the Roman Republic or the end of Greek democracy. But there's a deeper history: Republics came into being far earlier in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean civilizations. And we can draw from a much wider range of examples to learn from as we try to understand the challenges and the opportunities. A true republic is a political system without monarchy or concentrated political power in any office, branch, or individual. Elected officials represent citizens to make decisions on their behalf, with separate branches of government providing checks and balances. While many associate republics with direct democracy in our times, there's a much wider array of power structures that developed in the formative era of republics. The 20th century established republics as the global standard, with monarchies declining after World War I and most former European colonies declaring independence as republics following World War II. Fascist and communist countries, which centralized power in individuals or ruling parties, also reduced in number. Despite their concentration of power, however, many fascist and communist states claimed the title of republics, and while 149 countries out of 193identify as republics today, far less uphold republican principles and blend them effectively with democracy. Examining the historical evolution of republics highlights those best positioned to serve as the most resilient modern examples. Republics require regular gatherings and assemblies, making them difficult to establish in sparsely populated agrarian societies, while empires generally concentrate power too heavily for self-rule to gain traction. It was in smaller city-states, particularly trade-focused ones, where citizens could form factions, exchange ideas, and influence government decisions and rules for commerce. Some of the earliest experiments with republican governance appeared in ancient Sumerian city-states (4500–2000 BC), centered in modern-day Iraq. Kings acted more as neutral arbitrators rather than rulers, sharing power with aristocratic families and groups, as well as common citizens. In Kish, citizens could appoint a new king during crises, while in Uruk, assemblies of townsmen and elders had to ratify major military decisions. The Sumerian city-states fell to the Akkadian and Babylonian Empires by 1750 BC, but Phoenician city-states, emerging about 250 years later in what is now Lebanon, revived republican ideals. Here, monarchical power was often shared with a merchant class and citizen council. Egyptian records dating to the mid-14th century BC describe Phoenician cities sending delegates to represent citizens rather than monarchs, with mentions of alliances and aid requests by the 'men of Arwad' and 'elders of Irqata.' By the 6th century BC, the Phoenician city of Tyre had functioned for seven years without a monarch, governed instead under suffetes, or judges, elected for short terms. In Chios, a 'people's council' allowed citizens to debate laws and hold officials accountable. However, beginning in the 9th century BC and continuing over the next few centuries, Phoenician city-states were successively conquered or subjugated by the Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and Macedonian Empires. Like other civilizations, Phoenicians established colonies and trading posts. Carthage, founded by Tyre in 814 BC in modern Tunisia, grew into a powerful city-state with its own republican features. By the early 7th century BC, two elected suffetes from aristocratic families replaced the monarchy. They governed alongside an aristocratic Senate, while newer merchants could gain influence and a popular assembly allowed citizens input on major decisions. Military and religious leaders also held considerable power. Republican ideals weren't confined to Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean. Buddhist texts like the Maha Parinibbana Sutta mention Indian republics called Gana-Sanghas in the 6th century BC. Some adopted republican styles of government, while others formed republican confederations, like Sumerian and Phoenician city-states, to make decisions collectively and protect against larger threats. The Indian republics were gradually absorbed by the Maurya Empire (321–185 BC) and other entities. Ancient Greek city-states also developed republican ideals. Sparta was governed by a constitution and popular assembly as early as 600 BC, though it remained largely monarchical. Athens established a direct democracy in 507 BC, known as demokratia, meaning 'people' and 'rule.' Greece's slave-based economy allowed some citizens time to participate in politics, though this limited political fairness. In 431 BC, Attica, the region surrounding Athens, had an estimated population of 315,000, of which only 172,000 were citizens, and just 40,000 male citizens could vote. Still, Athens's democratic system allowed these citizens to frequently debate, deliberate, and vote. They were overseen by the Council of Five Hundred, which was chosen annually by lot to draft laws and manage administration. However, following Athens's Golden Age, 4th century BC Greek critics likePlato and Aristotle, and later historians like Polybius in the 2nd century BC, criticized the system for inefficiency and vulnerability to charismatic leaders to sway public opinion, leading to volatile policy shifts. They emphasized balancing public, aristocracy, and monarchical roles to avoid the typical political cycle of chaos and order: first, a strong leader unites a restive society under a monarchy, which evolves into tyranny. It is overthrown and replaced by an aristocracy, which reduces into oligarchy. Democracy eventually replaces it but deteriorates into mob rule, restarting the cycle. Invasions further weakened Greece's republican and democratic systems, including in 338 BC, when Greece fell under the control of the Macedonian Empire, ending the independence of many city-states. Despite this, Greek states formed republican confederations to protect against threats, including the neighboring Roman Republic. The term republic derives from the Roman res publica, meaning 'public affairs,' emphasizing shared governance, civic participation, and checks and balances. Since its founding in 509 BC, the Roman Republic's political structure had evolved considerably. Polybius expressed appreciation for Rome's system, where two tribunes were elected annually to represent the common citizens, while two consuls were elected and held executive power, checked by an aristocratic senate. Romans were skeptical of Greek democracy, especially in Athens, due to its instability, infighting, and mob rule. Carthage's republic seemed overly commercial and lacked the civic loyalty the Romans valued. This loyalty was central to Rome's military, staffed by a citizen army motivated by shared rewards. In contrast, Carthage's strong, citizen-led navy protected trade routes, but its reliance on mercenaries for land campaigns made them costly and unpredictable. These factors reduced the ability to push back against Roman rule. By 146 BC, Rome defeated both Greece and Carthage, cementing its dominance and expanding political system. Polybius suggests that Rome's success over Carthage was partially due to its powerful, aristocratic Senate, while Carthage's policies were increasingly shaped by popular influence. He believed that Rome's decisions were made by elites versus the influence of the masses in Carthage. Yet by this time, Rome was approaching its Late Republic phase. The scholar Harriet Flower's research argues that the Roman Republic wasn't a single entity but a series of six republics, each with unique political characteristics. Others have also challenged the notion of a single Roman Republic, placing Republican Rome into three main periods characterized by changing centers of power. The Early Republic (509–367 BC) was marked by tensions between patricians (aristocratic elites) and plebeians (common citizens). The struggle for plebeian rights led to significant reforms, including the establishment of tribunes, elected by the Concilium Plebis to represent common interests, and often from the plebeian class. During the Middle Republic (367–133 BC), the Licinian-Sextian laws of 367 BC were passed to again alleviate tensions between patricians and plebeians, limiting patrician land ownership, providing debt relief for plebeians, and ensuring that at least one of the two consuls was a plebeian. However, political power increasingly concentrated in the Senate, undermining these reforms. During the Late Republic (133–31 BC), Rome's military success over rivals coincided with the growing influence of ordinary citizens in the judicial system, especially as jurors. Yet the republic was plagued by social conflict, corruption, and civil unrest. Sulla's march on Rome in 88 BC and his curtailing of the tribunes' power exemplified rising instability. After, figures like Pompey in the '70s BC and Julius Caesar in 59 BC began consolidating power, further undermining republican values. In 27 BC, Augustus formally transitioned Rome into an empire, while maintaining the illusion of republican traditions. Roman orator Cicero, a prominent defender of the Republic, inadvertently accelerated its demise through his support for Augustus, endorsement of dictatorial powers, and willingness to suspend legal norms during crises, showing the dangers of sacrificing republican ideals to manage turmoil. For the next few centuries, republican ideals were largely sidelined. The collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD saw feudalism and monarchies spread across its former territories and peripheral regions. This instability nonetheless allowed new republics to emerge, such as Venice, founded in 697 AD. It maintained a 1,100-year run as a republic through a political system that encouraged merchant participation and representation, shrewd diplomacy, social mobility, community cohesion, and an extensive trade network. It was eventually conquered by France in 1797. During the Italian Renaissance (14th to 17th centuries), urbanization, advancements in communication, and Enlightenment ideals enabled the rise of new city-states. Merchant classes and other groups established republican systems as alternatives to European monarchies elsewhere as well. However, they were ultimately absorbed by empires, partly due to their inability to exploit the expanding Atlantic trade routes that reduced the importance of the Mediterranean. Republics were not confined to Europe. The Kongsi Republics in modern-day Malaysia, particularly the Lanfang Republic declared in 1777, arose when Chinese settlers recruited by local sultans for mining formed companies to safeguard their interests. Over time, they evolved into self-governing territories with elected leaders and various levels of democratic governance. The Lanfang Republic was eventually defeated by Dutch colonial forces in 1884, with the rest absorbed through treaty or militarily defeated by the century's end. The establishment of the United States marked the reemergence of the large-scale republican state. In 1787, after the Revolutionary War, the U.S. formally became a constitutional republic, aiming to eliminate monarchy while avoiding a chaotic direct democracy. The Founding Fathers created a mixed system, balancing public participation with safeguards against aristocracy and emphasizing consent of the governed (though limited to white male landowners). The debates over constitutional amendments and expanding democracy continued for decades, paralleling similar discussions in post-Revolutionary France after 1789. Today, many republics exist, but their authenticity and stability can be compromised. Being conquered imposes outside authority, while others pursue foreign expansion themselves, centralizing control and subjugating other territories. Republics such as those in 16th century Netherlands, 17th century England, and 18th century U.S. and France grew into empires or reverted to monarchies, adapting in ways whose lessons are still relevant today. These expansionist policies, often justified as essential for wealth and security, led to the abandonment of certain republican and democratic principles. Republics can also shift toward authoritarianism, with modern policymakers perceiving more open democratic systems as unstable and vulnerable to manipulation. In recent years, China and Russia have seen reductions in public accountability, civil liberties, meaningful political participation, and concentrations of power behind Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. In North Korea, power has been concentrated in the leader's office since its founding, with leadership passed within the Kim family. Similarly, a dynasty has developed under the Aliyev family in Azerbaijan since the 1990s, with concerns that Turkmenistan may follow. Countries with strong presidential systems, common in the Americas, risk concentrating power in the executive branch. Fixed terms limit the removal of unpopular leaders, since, unlike in parliamentary democracies, no 'confidence vote' mechanism exists for crisis situations. Partisan loyalty can also weaken checks and balances, and coups can be common. Alliances and federations of Greek city-states like the Achaean and Lycian Leagues, as well as the Native American Iroquois Confederacy, formed assemblies and councils for representation and collective decision-making, influencing models like the U.S. Constitution and European Union (EU). The statement that the U.S. is 'a republic, not a democracy' reflects the original aim to keep political power within the states rather than the federal government. However, authority has increasingly centralized in Washington, D.C., reducing state sovereignty, tensions mirrored in the EU between individual states and Brussels. Political apathy and extremism can also stem from the influence of billionaires and corporations over the political process, government corruption, and the erosion of social mobility. Social media platforms offer the chance for heightened political participation, but are increasingly vulnerable to disinformation spread by big tech and political actors, revealing new ways in which democracies can veer toward mob rule. The diversity of republics today reflects their historical variety, with countries still navigating the governance structures in their own contexts. Kazakhstan, initially authoritarian, has seen some shift toward a more balanced systemwith a more powerful parliament following popular protests in 2022, though it remains less democratic. Similarly, Singapore, often described as authoritarian, is still considered a republic due to some checks and balances, maintaining a blend of controlled leadership and political structure. An informed and engaged citizenry, supported by a strong economic base, is essential for a successful republic. Citizens must feel the benefits of their system, and these must endure through fair elections, the rule of law, and due process. Effective foreign policy also relies on wide-ranging trade networks and adaptable alliances, while maintaining a strong military and avoiding military overreach or falling into the trap of foreign conquest. Historically, empire and monarchy have been more common than republics, shaping world order through hierarchical and anarchic systems. Within the global UN framework, which is designed to support the sovereignty and equality of nations (a principle rooted in republican ideals), republics can govern more democratically by collaborating in a way similar to ancient confederations. The Achaean League and Lycian League consisted of states with varying political systems cooperating within a loose, republican-style confederation. Modern blocs like the EU, ASEAN, and African Union allow countries to work together under common principles and boost their voice in the international system. Changes in domestic politics have meanwhile seen the growth of direct democracy in the 2010s, as more referendums and popular votes of legislative and constitutional issues emerged globally, but especially in Europe. While larger republics like the U.S., Germany, and India still avoid national-level votes on major issues, direct democracy is increasingly apparent at regional and local levels. Challenges remain in terms of deliberation and integration, as states like California and Arizona have seen ballot initiatives often rushed, leaving limited time for meaningful debate. Modern citizens' assemblies, based on those originating thousands of years ago, have also elevated these referendums in recent years and provided an alternative to traditional political processes. They have influenced major policy changes, such as climate policies in France to abortion laws in Ireland, with assemblies, typically convened by legislative bodies in partnership with nonprofits, designed to reflect demographics. While they have led to concrete policy shifts, some recommendations have not been adopted, with lawmakers citing the importance of expert-led decision-making. With the U.S. election behind us, reassessing republican ideals, both domestically and globally, is crucial. As the GOP potentially gains control over all three branches of government in a divided nation, how it implements policies will either ease concerns or amplify them. The future of republicanism depends on the U.S. shaping its domestic agenda for the common good and using its influence on the global stage in line with democratic principles.

Prabowo’s US-China Balancing Act – OpEd	Indonesia is on the rise. As ASEAN’s largest country and economy, with a growing domestic consumer market and a large supply of natural resources, its economic potential is clear. Sitting in the South China Sea surrounded by its fellow ASEAN nations and encircled by India, China, Japan, and Australia, it also commands great geopolitical importance. It is no wonder that over 30 ministers and world leaders attended President Prabowo Subianto’s recent inauguration. An ex-military general and oligarch, Prabowo is taking the reins on foreign policy, appointing his long-time follower Sugiono as foreign minister. This is not surprising. With his foreign education at The American School in London and knowledge of several languages, Prabowo is a natural statesman. As president-elect, he has already made visits to China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the Middle East, Europe and Australia, displaying a more active, centralized and personalized approach to foreign policy than his predecessor, Joko Widodo. But the difference in personality has not meant a difference in policy. Prabowo has reaffirmed Indonesia’s non-alignment stance and has committed himself to the same 'good-neighbour foreign policy' as Widodo did. However, Indonesia’s neutrality is under pressure as the competition between the United States and China intensifies and the world becomes more fragmented. The United States and its allies in Asia, notably the Philippines and Japan, expect Prabowo’s support in resisting China’s aggression in the South China Sea, where China continues incursions into Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone. Global conflicts are also testing Indonesia’s non-alignment. The wedge between the pro-Palestinian Indonesia and the pro-Israeli United States over the war in Gaza has grown. There is clear cooperation between China, Russia, and North Korea in opposing the United States and NATO in Ukraine. Prabowo personally felt this divide when his plan for ending the war in Ukraine was denounced as 'Russian-made' by Ukrainian and European officials. Although he will not formally end the policy of non-alignment, Prabowo is aware that his ability to simultaneously maintain ties with the United States, China and their respective allies is at risk. If push comes to shove, which way will he lean? A Fragile Friendship: Prabowo and the U.S. Prabowo has a strained relationship with the United States. Despite studying there in his youth, he was banned from entering the United States until he became defense minister over his role in the invasion and occupation of East Timor during the Suharto regime. As dictator Suharto’s son-in-law, he ran the Kopassus, Indonesia’s special forces, which allegedly committed human rights abuses against activists in East Timor and Papua. Furthermore, Prabowo’s election represents a trend towards authoritarian nationalist populism after decades of democratic regression under Widodo and Bambang. His ex-military strongman persona and ties to Suharto lead scholars to believe that Prabowo represents a challenge to Indonesian democracy. Although the United States wants to increase collaboration with Indonesia to counteract China’s aggression in the South China Sea, Prabowo is a partner who may not represent basic U.S. values and principles—and Prabowo knows this. U.S.-Indonesia defense ties, however, have flourished. Indonesia and the United States announced a new defense cooperation agreement in 2023 and hold over 220 defense engagements annually, including Exercise Super Garuda Shield, which builds U.S.-Indonesia military interoperability and jungle warfare capabilities. To modernize the Indonesian military, Prabowo is looking to the United States for fighter aircraft upgrades and sales, such as the $14 billion sale of 36 advanced fighter jets in 2022 (although the United States may limit these, given Prabowo’s human rights record). There are other restrictions to the relationship. It is built around the joint rejection of China’s aggression in the South China Sea, which Indonesia has back-pedaled on following criticism from China. Being economically reliant on your biggest security threat is a tightrope to walk. An Increasing Dependency: Prabowo and China China has no qualms about Prabowo’s past or leadership. China is Indonesia’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $128 billion in 2023, over double that of the United States. China funded the $7.3 billion Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway through the Belt and Road Initiative and pledged a further $67 billion of investment in 2023. These investments are a combination of loans and exports rather than traditional foreign direct investment (FDI). Prabowo, given his pragmatism and bullish attitude to taking on debt, is looking to China for further investment. Indonesia pitched three major railway projects during a rail expo in Shanghai this June. Chinese businesses are making crucial FDI into Indonesia’s most forward-looking industries, with BYD planning a $1.3 billion plant to grow the Indonesia EV market and Xinyi Glass Holdings building a $11.5 billion quartz sand processing plant necessary for solar panel production. These deals, along with those from Chinese mining firms like Tsingshan, are crucial to Prabowo’s aim of increasing downstreaming projects in Indonesia’s lucrative commodities sector, especially in nickel mining where Indonesia has gained 40 percent of the global market share. China’s grip on Indonesian growth is tightening and Prabowo will look to China, not the United States, to reach his ambitious target of 8 percent annual GDP growth. Although it announced an economic partnership with Indonesia in 2023, the United States has fallen behind China on Indonesian economic ties.But Japan, too, is also competing with China in Indonesia. Japan is Indonesia’s second largest trading partner with a similar value of trade as the United States. After losing out on the Jakarta-Bandung railway project to China, Japan has leveraged its historical and cultural ties to Indonesia to increase its investment into rail modernization projects in Jakarta, Bogor,and Depok. In a 2023 economic agreement, Japan agreed to consider investment in geothermal and waste management plants in Muara Laboh and West Java. China is ahead of both the United States and Japan, but together they represent an economic alternative for Prabowo to consider. Prabowo’s Tough Choices China represents Indonesia’s largest security threat. Indonesia maintains it has 'no territorial dispute with China' in the South China Sea. However, China’s 'nine-dash line,' which denotes its territorial claim, overlaps with Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone near the Natuna Islands. China continues to send coast guard and fishing ships to patrol the area, in particular to the Tuna block where Indonesia is exploring an offshore natural gas opportunity. As recently as October 2024, the Indonesian navy had to turn away another Chinese coast guard ship. As defense minister, Prabowo had been building up new air and naval bases in the Natuna Islands, which host three Indonesianfrigates and corvettes. It is clear that Prabowo expects friction with China. Given his reputation for being tough on national security and his history of modernizing the military, any engagement with China will weaken his position. It is therefore confusing that Prabowo is also expanding Indonesia-China defense ties, with reports that Indonesia is looking to buy, of all things, coastal defense missiles from Beijing. However, this defense partnership remains underwhelming in the face of tensions in the South China Sea and Jakarta’s reliance on Western military training and education. Given these increasing security tensions with Beijing, Prabowo might consider reducing Indonesia’s economic dependency on China in favor of strengthened relations with the United States and Japan. But in the current environment, given Prabowo’s strongman personality and his ambitious economic targets, China is the closer and more valuable partner. Prabowo thinks that he can deter China in the Natuna Islands by building up military capabilities. The Indonesian public seems to agree, with surveys showing in the absence of neutrality they would lean towards China over the United States. Prabowo’s push to join the BRICS bloc also supports this. But if China were to step up its aggression, there is little doubt that Indonesia would choose security over economic ties and look toward the United States and its allies for support. If the U.S.-China rift enlarges, Prabowo may have to make that shift sooner than he thinks.

Russia, India Are Early Birds As Pax Americana Is Ending – OpEd	The working visit of Russia’s First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov to Mumbai and Delhi on November 11-12 has been in the cards for sometime. It assumes added interest today as, in a delightful coincidence, it overlaps with the beginning of the end of Pax Americana in international politics. Manturov, 55, is one of the brightest stars of the new generation of leaders in the Russian political firmament with a brilliant record as an economist and technocrat in the energy and military-industrial complex, two key sectors of the economy. President Vladimir Putin has entrusted him with responsibilities that go far beyond the portfolio of Minister of Trade and Industry, a position he held for 12 years until May 2024 when he was elevated as First Deputy Prime Minister. Manturov is now a familiar face at the high table when Putin takes meetings on Ukraine war, which shows he wears many hats. Manturov is the co-chairman of Russian-Indian joint commission, alongside External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. To be sure, Jaishankar will have wide-ranging discussions with Manturov. Who else Manturov is meeting in Delhi will be an indication of the stirrings in the air in the Russian-Indian cooperation. The timing of the visit is notable since the neoconservatives who dominated the Biden administration — Secretary of State Antony Blinken, CIA director William Burns, et al — are on their way out and a brave new world is taking shape in Washington, DC. The influential CEO of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs Ivo Daalder, who was the US ambassador to Nato, succinctly captured the imminent power shift in DC when he wrote in Politico in the weekend, 'Trump won in a landslide. He helped Republicans take control of the Senate and may well help them keep the House (by the way, Republicans have flipped the House as well) — ensuring single-party control across all three branches of government. He can rightly claim a mandate to implement all the policies he touted… All the while, he’ll be shielded by a Supreme Court.' Of course, Ambassador Daalder is an acolyte of the 'rules-based order' and a firm believer in America’s manifest destiny to lead the world. He wrote in his column titled The end of Pax Americana: 'I also worry about what this means for the rest of the world. In his first term, Trump made clear he doesn’t buy into Washington’s global leadership role as his predecessors have done. He doesn’t believe in leading — he believes in winning… 'Moscow and Beijing have long chafed at Washington’s leadership, and for the past decade, they’ve sought to counter and undermine it. They may now get their wish. Trump isn’t interested in sustaining the Pax Americana in the ways his 14 predecessors were… The end of the Pax Americana will have profound consequences…The Pax Americana will officially end on Jan. 20, 2025, when the US inaugurates Donald J. Trump as its 47th president. The country and world will be very different because of it.' Suffice to say, we are getting a preview of this historic juncture. Although taking place in the conditions under sanctions, Manturov’s agenda of discussions in Delhi will have a futuristic dimension. The point is, while the sanctions against Russia may take some time to be scrapped, their cutting edge — the fanaticism and the sound and fury with which Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen applied that intrusive diplomatic tool to dictate other countries’ economic and military relations with Russia — may now become blunt, what with all signs already pointing toward a Russian-American engagement. The Indian side should be mindful of this transition in the power dynamic to accelerate the economic and military-technical cooperation with Russia with a medium and long-term perspective. This is one thing. Second, we are edging toward a conversation between Trump and Putin. Do not be surprised if they decide to meet at an early date. Historically speaking, there is nothing like summitry to energise political systems with top-down culture such as the US and Russia have. Suffice to say, we are nearing a point when the International Criminal Court which has an arrest warrant against Putin, won’t know where to hide itself. From our perspective, that opens the door leading to the rose garden for a state visit by Putin to India — perhaps, as the chief guest at the celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the Indian Republic on January 26, 2025. Putin is a great friend of India’s. Only two days ago, he described India as unparalleled in the global arena and went on to say Russia is strengthening its relationship with India on multiple fronts, with a high level of trust underpinning their bilateral ties. Putin paid fulsome praise to India’s rise saying, 'India should undoubtedly be added to the list of superpowers, with its billion-and-a-half population, the fastest growth among all economies in the world, ancient culture, and very good prospects for further growth.' To be sure, India finds itself in a truly privileged position in the international political arena with the consolidation of the Indian-Russian partnership, with prospects opening up for a spurt to take the US-Indian ties to new heights taking advantage of Trump’s goodwill, and, indeed, with the nascent signs of a thaw appearing in the troubled Sino-Indian relationship — and, of course, as the fastest growing major economy in the world. India’s optimal aim should be to create synergy out of all three relationships running on parallel tracks — with Russia, US and China respectively. No matter the complexities of their mutual relationships, India should aspire for a confluence of the three streams for advancing its comprehensive national development. There is a whiff of hope in the air for a warming of bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington under Trump, which have been in a free fall. But Russophobia is deeply entrenched in the American elites and Russia will remain a toxic issue. Yet, Trump has repeatedly stressed good relations with Putin, as well as mutual respect. And Putin is a very talented politician who understands Trump. As for Russia-China relationship, Moscow and Beijing are at a high noon of partnership unparalleled in their history. That relationship is anchored in the great camaraderie between Putin and Chinese president Xi Jinping, is rock solid and will remain so despite the fluidity in the international environment. Of course, there are misgivings about the trajectory of the US-China relationship going forward. But, here again, the crux of the matter is the US’ economic rivalry with China in the American mindset. Per se, China does not hold any threat to the US. Nor is China an expansionist power. Certainly, it is a stakeholder in a stable, predictable global environment where the all-important mission of creating wealth becomes sustainable uninterruptedly. And China, unlike Russia, does not even challenge American power, influence and interests directly or by design. This is the plain truth cutting through the shibboleths of self-serving narratives by China’s detractors. The point is, a military confrontation between the US and China will not happen under Trump’s watch. Neither side is interested in waging wars. Trump pledged this as a solemn promise in his victory speech on Wednesday. Besides, the Indo-Pacific strategy itself is floundering. The latest sign of it is that Indonesia, the largest country in Southeast Asia, is turning its back on US-led alliance systems. and seeks BRICS membership following the footfalls of Malaysia, another important ASEAN country. The presence of Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Trump’s inner circle can be seen as a stabilising factor for US-China relations. Above all, only China can be a meaningful interlocutor to help Trump realise the ambitious MAGA project.

Will Spain’s New European Commissioner Be Telefonica’s Woman? – O...	By Natalia Hidalgo Martínez (EurActiv) -- Spain's Commissioner-designate for a Clean, Just, and Competitive Transition, Teresa Riberá, will be grilled by MEPs on Tuesday (12 November), and her views on telecoms market consolidation, in light of Telefonicá's influence on Spanish politics, could be a key issue. Many expect her to please her home country’s national champion, Telefonica. Spain does not have a digital policy; the charge goes; it has a Telefonica policy. And Telefonica’s interests are clear: as one of Europe’s three largest telecom companies, it will lead any consolidation. How to fix Europe’s struggling telecom companies has become one of Europe’s most vexing policy tussles. Many struggle to make money and invest in upgrading the continent’s digital infrastructure. They blame market fragmentation and rigid competition laws. The EU counts 34 mobile operators – compared to just four in China and three in the United States. If confirmed, Ribera faces this and other hefty challenges.She will have to decide whether to soften antitrust rules to allow for the creation of European champions while enforcing a crackdown on Big Tech. In addition to her new job policing tech competition, she is tasked with completing Europe’s Green Deal, an area she knows fairly well as Spain’s ecological transition minister and as an international climate negotiator. Born in 1969, Ribera grew up as the eldest of five children in a family of academics in a comfortable Madrid neighbourhood. Her mother was a philosophy professor and expert inKrausism, named after the German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause, who advocates tolerance and academic freedom from dogma. Her father, a member of the Royal Academy of Medicine, was a promoter of modern geriatrics in Spain. A lover of hiking and reading, she earned her bachelor’s degree in constitutional law and political science from Universidad Complutense de Madrid. She became an associate professor at the department of public law and philosophy of law at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. Mother of three daughters, she lives in the Spanish capital with her husband, Mariano Bacigalupo, an Argentine lawyer and board member of the Spanish national securities market commission. Ribera’s political rise began in 2005 when she became director of Spain’s climate change office, following different positions in the ministries of public work, transportation, and environment. In 2008, she was appointed secretary of state for climate change. 'She is a person of dialogue, who listens and knows how to be open to certain proposals,' praised the director of Greenpeace Spain, Eva Saldana. This year, Ribera was awarded the Progressive Person of the Year by the Foundation for European Progressive Studies. She participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement while directing the Paris-based think tank, the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations. Ribera has also been a member of the World Economic Forum’s Global Advisory Council on Climate and Sustainable Development Solution Networks’ Global Leadership Council. 'She is really knowledgeable about all the questions surrounding sustainable development,' says Nicolas Berghmans, director of IDDRI’s new industrial policies program. 'I was always impressed by her ability to read the political landscape and find alliances.' As Spain’s Ecological Transition Minister for the past six years, Ribera oversaw the shutdown of Spain’s coal industry, negotiated a nuclear phase-out, and secured an exemption from EU electricity market rules for Spain and Portugal during the 2022 gas crisis. Spain pioneered setting a legal target to reach climate neutrality by 2050 – a goal the EU later adopted for the entire Union. In Brussels, she will be tasked with overcoming a backlash from farmers, consumers, and businesses fearful of high prices, and the impact on competitiveness. Navigating the job The role will require ideological flexibility. She already has been forced to make a U-turn on nuclear energy. The socialist Ribera once described the EU's decision to label it a sustainable investment as 'a huge mistake.' Nuclear-friendly countries led by France raised alarms. She now assures that she will not oppose nuclear power expansion in Europe. Ribera declined an interview request for this article. Ribera also will oversee EU antitrust enforcement. That is a powerful position, and her nomination generated strong opposition from the European People’s Party (EPP), which was reluctant to see a choice they described as 'too radical, too green.' The Spaniard replaces Denmark’s Margrethe Vestager, who ordered Apple to repay €13 billion in underreported taxes and earned Donald Trump’s epithet as a US-hating 'tax lady.' Vestager has warned that a sweeping overhaul of competition policy and merger rules to create European industrial champions could open a 'Pandora’s box.' Ribera has acknowledged Vestager’s contributions but suggested that change may be necessary, stating, 'Margarethe has done a great job, and we need to see to what extent this great job needs to evolve.' Ribera could renew the push for additional 'fair share' payments from US tech companies who account for much of the telcos' traffic. And she could allow the telephone companies to consolidate, despite the risk of higher prices.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVpBRA-3kjB8m	2024-11-12T16:31:05-08:00	
The Corrupt Nature Of DEI – OpEd	By Wanjiru Njoya Once it is averred that inequality is wrong and the government ought to do 'something' to make people more equal, tyranny is always around the corner. Equalization methods and strategies may vary, but some degree of coercion is guaranteed once it is decided to equalize human beings. The philosopher Antony Flew characterized egalitarianism as a procrustean ideal—some must be stretched to breaking point, while others must be cut down to size, in order to ensure that all are enjoying equal life opportunities. As David Gordon often reminds us, this is why Murray Rothbard regarded 'equality of opportunity' as an absurd and anti-human ideal. Egalitarian ideology currently marches under the banner of 'diversity, equity and inclusiveness.' Jordan Peterson refers to DEI as 'the great ideological lie,' and pointedly reverses the acronym from DEI to DIE to emphasize the inevitable outcome of diversity enforcement. Commenting on diversity policies in Canadian higher education, Peterson wrote: All my craven colleagues must craft DIE statements to obtain a research grant. They all lie (excepting the minority of true believers) and they teach their students to do the same. And they do it constantly, with various rationalizations and justifications, further corrupting what is already a stunningly corrupt enterprise. Some of my colleagues even allow themselves to undergo so-called anti-bias training, conducted by supremely unqualified Human Resources personnel, lecturing inanely and blithely and in an accusatory manner about theoretically all-pervasive racist/sexist/heterosexist attitudes. In the United States, Christopher Caldwell traces diversity policies to the Supreme Court interpretation of the Civil Rights Act 1964 in the case of Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). In his book Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties, he describes affirmative action as 'the main avenue through which civil rights law was changing the country’s public and private institutions.' Describing university programs that reserved a number of places for African Americans, Caldwell explains: 'That such programs discriminated, by reallocating opportunities from whites to blacks and other minorities, was obvious. It was their whole point.' It was not disputed at the time that these programs were discriminatory; the question was not whether they were discriminatory, but whether they were justified as a means of correcting inequality. Caldwell adds that, 'The justices were concerned with how the programs discriminated, and on what grounds.' Caldwell explains that the 'new definition of 'diversity' provided a rationale for four judges in Bakke who approved of this pro-black discrimination. These judges 'accepted Lyndon Johnson’s description of American society as a footrace to which one runner had arrived shackled—on that basis, they could countenance some infringement on whites’ individual rights in order to fix a society-deforming wrong.' Following from Bakke, diversity was thereafter depicted as the overarching goal of equal opportunities. Discrimination against white people was seen as nothing more than promoting diversity, and endorsed by the courts as a 'justified' means of achieving what many egalitarians describe as 'true equality.' Caldwell points out that although Bakke purported to distinguish between quotas (illegal) and 'diversity' (legal), the end result of diversity is precisely the same as using quotas: '[Justice Lewis] Powell’s opinion, in short, did not eliminate quotas. It just dressed them up as something else. It required all schools that used racial preferences to recast them as programs to promote their interest in the diversity of their student bodies.' Thus arose the hegemony of diversity, which was later reinforced by the concepts of inclusiveness and equity. Diversity as a legal obligation Caldwell further explains how the notion of 'diversity' upheld in Bakke not only justified discrimination against whites and in favor of minorities, but also came to be regarded by many institutions as an implicit legal obligation—in the sense that failing to promote diversity came to be seen as a breach of the equal opportunities obligations of the Civil Rights Act. Paradoxically, the use of critical race theory 'divisive concepts' and anti-white racism, both of which many people regard as a violation of the equal protection clause of the US constitution, came to be regarded as a positive legal obligation under civil rights law. This explains the shouting matches often observed between traditional supporters of the Fourteenth Amendment – those who believe in 'colorblind equality' and supporters of the Civil Rights Act who believe in DEI. The colorblind egalitarians insist that DEI is racially discriminatory against whites and therefore illegal, while the DEI egalitarians retort that banning DEI violates the Civil Rights Act by ignoring discrimination against blacks, and is therefore illegal. Both sides also invoke the First Amendment free speech protection to defend their position. From a Rothbardian perspective, both protagonists that are yelling 'that’s illegal!' at each other are lost (though arguably the DEI egalitarians are more woefully lost than the colorblind egalitarians) and the only workable solution would be to repeal both the Civil Rights Act, as Lew Rockwell has argued, and the FourteenthAmendment. This is the dispute currently unfolding in several states that have banned DEI in public schools and universities. In Alabama, for example, the University of Alabama guidance states: 'Following the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision, federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, and sex. On June 29, 2023, the Court ruled race conscious admissions programs used by Harvard University and the University of North Carolina were not legal in the cases Students for Fair Admissions (SSFA) v. Harvard and Fair Admissions v. North Carolina. In addition, the Alabama State Legislature passed, and Governor Kay Ivey signed into law, Senate Bill 129 (SB129),2 which defines and imposes limitations related to 'divisive concepts' as well as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs.' The guidance goes on to define the meaning of DEI programs, emphasizing that programs deemed to be 'necessary to comply' with other legal obligations are not DEI programs: 'Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs are defined as '[a]ny program, class, training, seminar, or other event where attendance is based on an individual’s race, sex, gender identity, ethnicity, national origin, or sexual orientation, or that otherwise violates [the law].' Under the law, programs, classes, trainings, seminars, or other events that are necessary to comply with applicable state law, federal law, court order, or accreditation requirements are NOT considered DEI programs.' The reference to 'other legal obligations' with which it is still necessary to comply includes things like civil rights obligations and Department of Education mandates. For example, the National Center for Education Statistics requires 'maintaining, collecting, and reporting racial and ethnic data to the U.S. Department of Education.' DEI bans do not affect these reporting obligations and it is likely that through statistical reporting on diversity the corrupt enterprise of DIE referred to by Jordan will continue its hegemony. Another reason why it may be premature to celebrate the end of DEI is that DEI bans are under attack from Democrat politicians who claim that banning DEI is a breach of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their argument is that providing equal protection to minority groups requires DEI programs, therefore banning DEI programs strips minorities of the equal protection encompassed in DEI. Hence institutions closing down their DEI offices are remaining cautious, aiming 'to review their workplace policies and training programs with respect to existing obligations under federal, state, and local laws, such as the anti discrimination requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and other civil rights statutes.' Some have also argued that banning DEI is potentially a breach of free speech, an interpretation upheld by courts in Florida in striking down parts of Florida’s 'Stop WOKE' law. Florida’s experience illustrates the cost hazards for states fighting against DEI. 'Florida could face paying nearly $750,000 in legal fees for businesses that successfully challenged part of a 2022 law that Gov. Ron DeSantis dubbed the 'Stop WOKE Act.' Citing what they called a 'resounding victory,' attorneys for the businesses filed a motion Friday seeking $749,642 in fees. Also, they sought $41,144 in additional costs related to the lengthy legal battle.' In addition to this unfolding lawfare, it should be noted that the Supreme Court in SFFA stated that 'nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.' Many academics committed to DEI have seized on this enthusiastically as a potentially rich vein to exploit in advancing their diversity ambitions. It is therefore clear that the fight against DEI is by no means over. In many ways, it is only just beginning. About the author: Dr. Wanjiru Njoya is the Walter E.

Missed The Mark: Why Pollsters Misjudged The 2024 Election – OpEd	Most political pollsters were wrong about how close the 2024 U.S. presidential election would be, especially in so-called battleground states, which were expected to be toss-ups just days before November 5. Why did the polls underestimate Donald Trump’s popular vote margin wildly and, by extension, his dominance of the Electoral College? One answer is that public opinion polls, and surveys in general, are seriously flawed. Respondents to questions about their preferences for political candidates or policy outcomes are not asked to make real choices over real options. The cost of stating that candidate A hypothetically is preferred to candidate B essentially is zero. Nothing is sacrificed when the respondent opines one way rather than another or says that he or she is undecided. We also know that survey results depend on the precise wording of questions. Some are 'leading,' biased, or vague. Questioners’ body language, facial expressions, or vocal tones may influence respondents’ beliefs about acceptable answers during in-person or telephone surveys. Opinion surveys administered online raise challenges relating to sample sizes and participant self-selection. Polling failed miserably in the run-up to Election Day 2024. Pollsters and political pundits consistently misjudged the 'red wave' that swept the nation on November 5, missing the mark in the opposite direction from 2022’s midterm elections when broad Republican gains had been anticipated. Although political candidates and parties closely monitor pre-election polls, they are misleading at best and useless in practice. They are no more informative than the 'focus groups' and marketing surveys that produced commercial flops like the Edsel or New Coke. Even with sample sizes in the thousands rather than the millions, no one response to a survey determines a poll’s overall results. Error rates in most opinion polls typically amount to three percentage points in either direction. A vote cast in a mass democratic election also is unlikely to be decisive. As of this writing, more than 140 million voters turned out for 2024’s presidential race. Donald Trump outpolled Kamala Harris nationally by about four million popular votes. It is impossible to say which of those four million voters put Trump 'over the top.' The probability of one vote being decisive or pivotal in 2024 was vanishingly small (roughly one in 140 million). The late public-choice economist Gordon Tullock relied on such evidence to conclude that voting in mass democratic elections is irrational because the costs of voting (becoming informed about the candidates and issues on the ballot, traveling to and from the polls, or filling out and mailing a ballot) exceed the benefits of doing so for most voters, measured by the nearly zero chance of influencing the election’s outcome. For Tullock, the probability of one voter’s decisiveness on Election Day is smaller than the chance of being struck by lightning on the way to or from polling places or ballot drop boxes. However, Tullock also launched a research agenda concluding that voting is rational if seen as a low-cost way of expressing political preferences. Because one vote is not consequential, voters can support candidates or policies they would not support otherwise. Many voters would reject a policy that raises their annual tax bills by $10,000 if a single vote determined the outcome. But if the chance of being pivotal is one in 10,000 (0.0001)—much larger than one in 140 million—a vote in favor of the policy raises the voter’s expected tax bill by just $1 (= 0.0001 times $10,000). Even uncharitable people can afford to be charitable under such circumstances, supporting programs and policies they would reject if they faced the full cost of their choices. Close elections almost always trigger challenges by losers, ballot recounts, and other consequences that introduce uncertainty into voting processes. Such uncertainty makes it more difficult to conclude that one vote will 'matter' ahead of time. The point is that opinions expressed in response to political polls and decisions made in the voting booth differ substantially from ordinary market decisions, where costs and benefits are more closely aligned. Because they have skin in the game, people’s market choices do reveal their preferences. Thus, it should be no surprise that pollsters claiming to forecast hypothetical political preferences often get it wrong.

European Lackeys In Panic Mode As Trump Signals Detente With Russ...	It’s early days yet. However, there are signs that President-elect Trump is moving toward a detente with Russia over Ukraine. One good sign is that Trump will not invite Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley to join his cabinet when he is inaugurated as the 47th U.S. president on January 20. Both of these figures were rabid anti-Russia hawks during Trump’s previous administration. There were suggestions that Pompeo and Haley might return with senior posts in his second administration. But Trump has announced the pair will not be offered new positions. Another positive sign is from people close to Trump’s inner circle who are letting the Kiev regime know – rudely – that the U.S. military aid spigot is being turned off. Donald Trump has yet to hold a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the Kremlin. But both leaders have already expressed a willingness to negotiate a peaceful settlement over the Ukraine conflict. Another promising sign of potential detente between the United States and Russia is the sheer panic among European leaders. The news of Trump’s election last week has caused most European elites to scramble like scared children on hearing 'boo!'. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron are consoling themselves by urging Europe to 'come together' in the wake of Trump’s stunning election victory. The collapse of Germany’s coalition government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz is an early casualty of the Trump impact. European leaders fear that if Trump pulls the plug on military aid to the Kiev regime they will be left holding the can to fund the proxy war against Russia, which the weak European economies have no chance of sustaining. It’s no secret that the main European states were betting on Democrat candidate Kamala Harris winning the race to the White House. Harris would have ensured the continuation of NATO’s backing for the Kiev regime. With Trump becoming president, all bets are off. The political price will be ruinous for European leaders who have invested huge political capital in waging war to 'defend Ukraine from Russian aggression.' Trump has shown skepticism toward that false narrative. He has told Europe to go it alone if it wants to. And the European Russophobes know they can’t do that. If Trump follows through on his election promise to negotiate with Putin on a settlement in Ukraine, then the Europeans are going to be left with serious amounts of egg on their faces. One thing about Trump that is of concern to the Europeans is his frustration with them as being, in his view, freeloaders on American protection. Another is Trump’s vindictive streak. He’s not going to forget that most of the European leaders wanted him to lose the election. Take Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer. His Labour Party sent volunteers over to the U.S. to advise Harris on winning the election. The British Foreign Secretary David Lammy has also been reminded that he previously disparaged Trump as a racist 'sociopath.' Trump’s election is bad news for Britain and there is no doubt that Starmer is now trying to repair post-Brexit relations with Europe as a hedge against the expected chill from Washington during the next four years. When Britain pulled out of the European Union after its 2016 Brexit referendum, there were high hopes that it could negotiate a special trade deal with the U.S. That deal didn’t work out and looks even less likely now. Hence, Starmer has been busy since taking office in Downing Street trying to restore relations with the EU. This week, the British leader attended the Armistice ceremony in Paris to commemorate the end of the First World War. The last time a British leader honored that event in Paris was in 1944 when Winston Churchill visited the French capital following its liberation from Nazi occupation. Macon invited Starmer to lay wreaths in the Champs-Elysee and the Arc de Triomphe. The choreographed caper of European unity is a reflection of the panic gripping European leaders in the aftermath of Trump’s return to the White House. But everything is up in the air for the European politicians. Starmer was bending over backward to renew relations with Germany as a way to forge a warmer connection between London and the European Union after years of post-Brexit bitterness, only for that to be thrown into doubt. Last month saw a landmark security deal between Britain and Germany in which German arms maker Rheinmetall would open a new factory in Britain, and the German Luftwaffe would be able to fly warplanes from an RAF base in Scotland. The deal was touted as 'a sign of joint European security in the face of Russian threat.' With the collapse of the government in Berlin over the unbearable financial costs of the Ukraine war to the German economy, the British security treaty may not materialize. That means a big setback to Starmer’s reset plans with Europe. Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Slovakia’s Robert Fico are in the minority of European politicians who genuinely welcomed Trump’s election as an opportunity to wind down the NATO proxy war in Ukraine against Russia. On the other hand, the ardent NATO warmongers in Europe, including Britain, Germany, France, Poland and the Baltic states now face a desperate dilemma. Along with EU leaders like Von der Leyen and the Dutch NATO chief Mark Rutte, they have all nailed their colors to the mast for continuing the reckless proxy war against Russia. Trump seems to be showing good sense in calling off that proxy war and finding a way to negotiate sensibly with Russia on detente. Moscow wants its long-term security demands to be met. That means no NATO membership for Ukraine, an end to the NeoNazi regime in Kiev, and recognition of its historical lands in Crimea and the Donbass. This is all eminently negotiable, and Trump might just be ready to cut a deal to avoid World War Three, as he has repeatedly indicated he would do. That would mean Trump dumping the false narrative that Biden, Harris and the Democrats – and their European vassals – contrived about 'defending Ukraine'. That would leave the European lackeys in a disastrous lurch. How will they explain to their electorates the three-year slaughter in Ukraine? How will they justify the tens of billions of Euros and Sterling wasted on pushing a war that not only destroyed millions of lives but their economies as well? The stupid European leaders are in panic mode, and that’s a good thing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVtefpb4p6OU0	2024-11-12T16:19:25-08:00	
This Time, Trump’s Win Is Not An Oddity: It Is The American Reali...	By Yossi Mekelberg It is not only Donald Trump’s election victory that has sent shockwaves across the US and many parts of the world, but also its decisiveness, which defied all forecasts of a close race. If Trump’s first victory in 2016 felt like a fluke, benefiting from a combination of him being a political novice but with star qualities as a multimillionaire businessman and a well-known reality TV presenter, this time he was elected, and by a big margin, for who he is. Make no mistake, the margin of Trump’s victory and the Republicans’ control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate should not conceal the depth of the divisions within American society. This is a feature that will dominate the US for the foreseeable future. And for a stunned Democratic Party, there is an uphill battle, first to come to terms with defeat, but more significantly to reconnect with those who are its natural electorate yet have been swayed by Trump. A quick glimpse of the distribution of votes across the US shows that most of this vast territory has been painted red, emphasizing that the party representing leftist-liberal progressive ideas and values has lost the working class, who should be its backbone. These are mainly white men who are angry at seeing their jobs disappearing abroad and who feel marginalized. Trump is appealing to them. Trump is not a Republican in the traditional sense and not even strictly a politician. Democrats cannot exonerate themselves from having no answer to Trump. It became apparent that the economy played a significant role in voters’ preferences and the increase in the cost of living over the last four years has cost them dearly. Anyone who visits a grocery store in the US will be astonished by how expensive fresh produce is in comparison to most other countries of similar economic development. Raw figures about employment or economic growth matter very little in many parts of the country when earnings do not allow a decent standard of living and when the younger generations do not enjoy a similar degree of prosperity to that enjoyed by their parents. It was those who have a job — who are sometimes forced to take two or three jobs and who feel stuck in survival mode with no way out — that painted much of the US red last week. Whenever this mood prevails, it is usually those in power who are punished by the voters and Kamala Harris is the vice president. It was not only the economy that decided last week’s election, but immigration too. The debate over this divisive issue has been hijacked by the populist right and, interestingly, even Latinos voted for Trump in big numbers. There is an interesting phenomenon operating here: those who are legal migrants begrudge the undocumented ones, whom they perceive as skipping the hard work they had to do to earn their status. Moreover, they perceive illegal migration from Latin America as the main reason they are disparaged by others in US society and face a more difficult path to social acceptance. Yet the Biden administration and Harris in particular, who was in charge of securing the borders, did very little to stop illegal migration. Trump’s appeal to just over half of the American people is a mystery to the rest of the nation and to many around the world. However, he rides his status with pride and has appealed to enough voters. For the Democrats, this should be the beginning of a period of soul-searching: how do they reconnect with their electoral and ideological roots? If their position on the economy and migration put them in an inferior position, their inability to bring an end to the war in Gaza also cost them votes in certain parts of the country. However, it was their pushing too hard and too fast for some aspects of their progressive agenda that made some voters uncomfortable and left them feeling that an elite was trying to force upon them changes that clashed with their traditional values. This is not to suggest that these progressive ideas are wrong as such, the opposite is often the case, but they cannot be enforced from the top down and by patronizing those who object to them. Instead, they should engage with people and allay their fears. What’s more, it should not be forgotten that, while Trump won the Republican primaries easily and had months to build his campaign, Harris won her party’s nomination almost by default when it became apparent that President Joe Biden was not fit to run for another term. Going through the grinding process of the primaries gains the winner credibility, legitimacy, better engagement with the public and the momentum for a presidential campaign. But the result of last Tuesday’s election made it clear that Harris had too little time to lift the campaign and build trust, as well as being too closely associated with the Biden administration as his second in command. For the second time in eight years, we are once more entering the territory of the unknown and the unpredictable. Trump won this election fairly and squarely and there will not be a repeat of the ugly scenes of Jan. 6, 2021, but an orderly and civilized transition of power, as we should expect. Nevertheless, there will be many Americans, along with many in the international community, who will be deeply skeptical.

Trump Regime: Southeast Asia’s Options – OpEd	As Trump Returns to Power, Allies and Adversaries Expect a Wave of Revenge' -- New York Times Donald Trump's presidential victory has generated a frenzy of commentary on global geopolitics and geoeconomics unlike any previous election. For a start, leaders critical or contemptuous of Trump have had not only to swallow their pride. Many have now publicly retracted their earlier opinions and started to eat crow. Possibly the most striking example is Australia’s former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, currently Australia’s Ambassador to the United States. In 2020, Rudd condemned Trump as the 'most destructive president in history,' while in 2022 he denounced Trump as a 'traitor to the West' for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. Immediately after Trump’s victory, Rudd purged his personal and social media accounts of his anti-Trump posts - an action which Peter Dutton, Australia’s opposition leader responded to by predicting that Rudd would follow up with further attempts to ingratiate himself with the new government. 'He’ll be down at the tie shop, he’d be buying up red ties, he’d be buying red hats, he’ll be ordering those MAGA hats. He will do everything he can to ingratiate himself with the Trump campaign. So he’s indefatigable, as we know.' None of the leaders in the Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) are likely to engage in the brown nosing and submissive behaviour that we are seeing from allies of the US - including from the Asian Pacific region - in their efforts to apple-polish Trump and his incoming administration, and to curry favour. What Southeast Asians Really Think of the US Not only is there no need for ASEAN leaders to buy MAGA merchandise especially submarines and missile systems or to ingratiate themselves further with the new US president, there is every reason we can expect ASEAN member countries and leaders to uphold the organisation’s independent and non aligned principles in the tumultuous era that lies ahead. An important marker for ASEAN’s foreign policy stance for the next four years has already been established by Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim. While congratulating Trump on his remarkable comeback victory, Anwar expressed the hope that Trump’s victory would bring positive changes in geopolitics, particularly to end the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. 'We will welcome any positive stance by the United States towards peace, particularly efforts to halt Israel's violent attacks on Gaza and to acknowledge the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.' This call by Malaysia as the incoming chair of ASEAN in 2025 for the new US administration to change its war-oriented ideological position pursued by the Biden administration, and presently playing out in respect to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine and elsewhere where earlier presidents have sought to reinforce American dominance, should not be regarded as unrealistic or futile. Although criticised by western liberal media and think-tanks for his unpredictable ways and combustible foreign policy, Trump previously undertook an unprecedented peace initiative in dealing with North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. During his recent campaign Trump repeatedly promised to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. It is equally possible that he will do the same in Gaza if there is strong and sustained pressure from his western allies and the rest of the world. Standing up for ASEAN’s core principles means standing up for regional peace and security. This is a position which Trump, even if he disagrees with it, can and should be willing to live with. Despite his election rhetoric of making America great again, he is ultimately a businessman and realist with bigger concerns and issues to deal with in the United States, America, Europe, the Middle East and China. Draining the deep state and Capital Hill swamp may be his biggest challenge. This means that ASEAN will be relatively low and unimportant in his agenda. At the same time the reality for Trump’s hawkish foreign policy advisers is that ASEAN is a regional force that needs to be given due respect. With a larger population than North America’s, ASEAN is a middle level power in geopolitics but one of the world’s most diverse, fastest growing and competitive economic regions. The combined gross domestic product of US$3.8 trillion makes ASEAN the fifth largest economy in the world. During the period 2013-2022, ASEAN’s economy grew at an annual rate of 4.2% and is expected to grow just as or more strongly in the coming decade. Should Trump want a stronger counterweight to China, his team will be out to solicit for ASEAN’s support. The reality is also that should Trump want to restore the US to a more respectable standing in this part of the world, he has to begin with the recognition that many in ASEAN - possibly the great majority of the population - do not see the US as a role model for democracy, freedom, human rights and a force for peace. This representation is regarded by most people - including Americans - as a hollow claim though ceaselessly propagandised by the military-industrial-media complex. The prevailing dark view of the US in Southeast Asia is not only because of the recent history of its military campaign in Vietnam which spilled over into Laos and Cambodia and killed more than a million of the Indochinese population. It is also due to the US’s war record in the Middle East and elsewhere and its support of the Israeli genocidal war in Gaza which has adversely affected Muslim as well as other non-western opinions of the US. Alignment Preference of Southeast Asians With regard to China which the Biden administration assessed as America's greatest geopolitical and geoeconomic rival, a recent survey of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute found that over half of Southeast Asians preferred alignment with China over the US. Its polling sample included respondents from the public and private sector, and researchers and academics who are in a position to influence policy. If the poll numbers from the Philippines, the most pro-American among ASEAN nations because of its history and the large population of Filipinos with relatives in the US or dependent for their livelihood on US military bases in the Philippines, are discounted, the finding would be more lopsided in favour of China. Policy advisers of President Trump will do well to point out to him that more than 40% of the population of Southeast Asia is Muslim. The way for Trump to make America better - great is in many ways a hopeless ambition - is to focus on dealing with the domestic issues that divide US society. It is not to engage in efforts to enforce the primacy of a nation whose preeminent standing in the world has been irretrievably lost. Trump’s exclusion of Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo, well known war hawks, in his new administration is a hopeful sign that he may, against all expectations, help build a peace-oriented road for the US in its foreign policy to embellish his place in history.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVuG26cpUQSMP	2024-11-12T16:10:56-08:00	
The Two-Trillion-Dollar Challenge – OpEd	There is an old proverb known as the 'law of holes.' It goes something like this: 'Let me tell you about the law of holes: If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.' This particular version of the proverb was coined by Bill Brock while serving as President Reagan’s Secretary of Labor. It matters today because it applies to the poor fiscal state in which the U.S. government finds itself. It’s no secret that the U.S. government’s fiscal situation has deteriorated since 2000. During the last four years, that fiscal deterioration sped up for the worse. U.S. politicians and bureaucrats have dug into a deep hole because of excessive spending. This spending directly contributed to 2021’s inflation surge, which subsequently led to 2024’s explosion in the U.S. government’s cost of borrowing. How to stop digging The outcome of the 2024 elections offers the potential to deliver a change in fiscal direction. Washington D.C.’s incoming leadership acknowledges the need to address the nation’s growing fiscal crisis. Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s call for 'at least' $2 trillion in cuts to federal spending is drawing skepticism from experts as the billionaire tech magnate cements himself as one of former President Trump’s most prominent backers. 'How much do you think we can rip out of this wasted, $6.5 trillion Harris-Biden budget?' Howard Lutnick, a Wall Street CEO and Trump’s transition team co-chair, asked Musk at the former president’s recent rally held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Without offering specifics, Musk said in response that he thinks 'at least $2 trillion' in a brief moment that has since gained widespread attention online and drawn mixed reactions from budget world. Although the size of the figure draws skepticism, Musk’s two-trillion-dollar spending reduction target is typical of his 'set a big goal then go after it' business philosophy. To be sure, it will be opposed by many Washington D.C. institutions that will work hard to make it impossible to achieve. That is not a bad thing because achieving any significant portion of the target against that self-serving opposition can deliver at least one positive outcome. Writing at Reason, Veronique de Rugy describes how U.S. politicians and bureaucrats can rediscover a key principle of good governance: The best way to cut $2 trillion out of the budget is to ax everything the federal government does that it shouldn’t be doing in the first place. It’s time we rediscovered the exercise of thinking critically about government and the role it should or shouldn’t play in our lives. Questions like, 'Is that the role of government?' or 'Should the federal government pay for that?' haven’t been seriously considered in years. The muscle of fighting for first principles has atrophied among Republicans as it’s no longer in style to call for small government…. Cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget should be easy. Of course, it will be anything but, given Congress’ continued lack of interest in discussing spending cuts and the president’s sorry track record. If anything, let’s hope this Musk-led effort to cut spending will hopefully reintroduce seemingly forgotten rationales for cutting the federal budget. There is a related proverb that applies here, called Stein’s Law: 'If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.' The deep fiscal hole Washington D.C.’s players have dug through their excessive spending cannot continue forever. Certainly not as has been allowed during the past four years. Setting a $2 trillion target for spending cuts and working to make them happen is a means to stop digging the nation’s fiscal hole deeper at the speed they have been. It is both common sense and long overdue. This article was published by The Beacon	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVhuMFkiHKqM3	2024-11-12T16:08:05-08:00	
How Gov. Gavin Newsom And Jerry Brown Disenfranchised California ...	On election days, voters become public officials, and on November 5th Californians made the most of the opportunity by, as it now appears, rejecting Proposition 5 and passing Proposition 36. While they celebrate those victories, the people might recall a greater loss. Proposition 5 was an attack on the 'People’s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation,' the famous Proposition 13 from 1978, when some Californians were literally being taxed out of their homes. Proposition 5 would have reduced the two-thirds vote to pass bonds to 55 percent, making property tax hikes more likely. Proposition 36 aimed to restore the damage from the 2014 Proposition 47, which reduced some felonies to misdemeanors. The 'Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act,' so named by state attorney general Kamala Harris, looked the other way at theft of property valued at less than $950. The measure launched a wave of shoplifting and vandalism that continues to this day. As Katy Grimes of the California Globe notes, Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats had 10 years to deal with escalating crime, but failed to do so until Proposition 36 qualified for the November ballot. Another key measure qualified for the same ballot, but voters did not get the chance to make the call. California’s Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act required voter approval for all new taxes passed by the legislature and two-thirds voter approval for all new special tax increases. The act required that before any tax or fee is enacted, politicians must clearly outline how revenues would be spent. The measure gathered nearly one million signatures and qualified for the November 5 ballot. That disturbed Gov. Gavin Newsom and former governor Jerry Brown. Gov. Newsom contended that the measure is a constitutional revision, rather than a constitutional amendment, and would 'effectively block the state’s ability to quickly respond to major challenges.' Proponents of the measure charged that Newsom was simply attempting to disenfranchise the voters. Brown’s amicus brief made the same argument as Gov. Newsom, that the measure was a constitutional 'revision' rather than an amendment, basically a distinction without a difference. The former governor mentions Proposition 13, which Brown loudly opposed until it passed in a landslide. The state supreme court ruled that Proposition 13 'was both modest and does not change our basic governmental plan.' According to Brown, a Yale law alum, the Taxpayer Protection and Accountability Act, 'turns our governmental plan inside out.' If taxpayers thought that was exactly what the state needs it would be hard to blame them. Consider the government’s ongoing plan to keep income and sales taxes among the highest in the nation. Unfortunately, the state’s high court sided with the ruling class, booting the Taxpayer Protection Act from the ballot. On the other hand, the people scored victories by, as it now appears, rejecting Proposition 5, rejecting Proposition 33, (rent control), and passing Proposition 36.In Santa Ana, yet another victory escaped notice. By a 62-38 margin, voters rejected Measure DD, which would have allowed non-citizens to vote. Non-citizens voting is like an imposter replacing an elected official and, say, casting a vote to increase taxes. Those who support non-citizen voting, regardless of party affiliation, have no claim to support the rule of law. Proposition 13 made California a national leader but a reactionary ruling class now bars the people from curtailing tax and fee hikes. To restore national leadership and respect the rights of the people, the state should put the Taxpayer Protection Act on the next ballot, along with a measure to ban non-citizen voting statewide.

The Case For Stopping Russia Sanction-Busters – Analysis	By Stephen J. Blank and Mark Temnycky (FPRI) -- When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the international community quickly came together to condemn the aggressor. United Nations resolutions denounced the military incursion. Over 100 countries across the globe have consistently spoken out against the Russian war since it began, but many of them are violating the Western sanctions on the Kremlin, buying Russian energy resources, and selling goods and services. Still, the international community did not just talk—it imposed stiff penalties on Russia. The Russian Federation was expelled from the Council of Europe and suspended from the United Nations Human Rights Council. Furthermore, several Russian companies, government officials, and oligarchs were sanctioned. Several politicians and oligarchs also had their assets frozen or seized. Finally, numerous countries have banned exports to Russia, reduced Russian gas imports, and reduced or ended their business relationships with Russia. Numerous Russian banks were removed from SWIFT, the global monetary banking system. As a result, the Russian Federation has lost billions of dollars, and the Russian economy has been under significant strain. Yet, these losses were not enough to end the war. Russia can still sustain its war machine, even paying for North Korean troops to assist with the fighting. This is because multiple companies and banks are undermining the impact of international sanctions on Russia. The European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western actors maintain normal trade relations with most neutral countries across the globe. This has created an opening for Russia as some countries in South America, Africa, and Asia serve as third-party intermediaries, re-exporting Western goods and services to Russia. Many restricted goods, including dual-use items and other forms of equipment, are being sent to Russia from these countries, providing Russia with the material and equipment it needs to continue its invasion of Ukraine. To streamline this process, Russia uses intermediaries to sell its crude oil, which ends up in gas tanks everywhere including the United States. Countries like India, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates purchase oil from the Russian Federation. This information is publicly available. Companies such as India’s Reliance Industries, Turkey’s STAR Refinery and Tupras Refinery, and the UAE’s Amur Trading FZCO import Russian crude that is then blended with other crudes at purchaser oil refineries. The mixed substance is refined into gasoline and sold worldwide, allowing Moscow to profit. All of this would be impossible without a sophisticated system of financial facilitation. Banks from former USSR countries—still heavily dependent on Russia in everything from energy supplies to security—are natural suspects. For example, when the full-scale invasion began, financial institutions such as Kazakhstan’s Kazpochta, Uzbekistan’s Kapital Bank, Kyrgyzstan’s Kompanyon Bank and MBank, and Armenia’s Ardshinbank continued doing business with Russia, primarily through the Russian money-transfer company Unistream. These financial institutions suspended their operations with Unistream after the United States imposed sanctions on the currency transfer company in July 2023. Not all have heeded warnings about sanctions. For example, banks in Kyrgyzstan, which is heavily dependent on Moscow, continued their business openly with the Russian Federation until this past summer when additional sanctions announced by the Biden administration persuaded a number of them to finally announce that they would be cutting ties with Russia. When the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, Kyrgyzstan mysteriously increased its trade relations with Western entities. At the same time, international financial transactions from Kyrgyzstan to Russia also increased. Current reporting indicates that Kyrgyzstan may still be involved in sanctions evasion. This includes dual-use goods, vehicle parts, and other equipment from China used by the Russian military for its invasion of Ukraine. Similarly, recent reporting indicates that Kyrgyzstan continues to help keep Russia’s energy sector going. For example, reporting on September 30, 2024, Euronews quoted Irina Tsukerman, president of Scarab Rising, a security strategy advisory firm, 'Russia is managing its energy exports, primarily oil and gas in various forms, using Kyrgyzstan as an effective trade hub to circumvent sanctions and get the fossil fuels into Europe.' One of the banks suspected to be involved in facilitating business with Russia is Kyrgyz MBank, which reportedly belongs to the country’s former Prime Minister Ömürbek Babanov. This bank was reported as receiving payments from buyers of Russian oil and partnering with Russian banking organizations such as Sberbank, which has been sanctioned by the US and the EU. The bank has also been working with the Russian card processing center Kartstandard, part of the Center of Financial Technologies (CFT), which was sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in August 2024. MBank finally announced that it had suspended direct transactions with Sberbank and other sanctioned Russian entities only in mid-August 2024. However, the flows of payments were fully restored in less than a week with the help of intermediaries. MBank is reportedly working with one of Sberbank’s trusted intermediaries, Bank 131. Sberbank advises its clients that it makes payments to MBank and brags on its official website that wires could be made to any bank in Kyrgyzstan. South Korean Kookmin Bank, one of the key correspondent banks for Central Asian financial institutions, has decided to cease dollar SWIFT transfers with MBank, along with 20 other regional banks suspected of facilitating Russia’s sanctions evasion. However, it is estimated that at least five other international correspondent banks, including Pasha Yatirim Bankasi in Turkey, Mashreqbank in the UAE, and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Germany, continue to work with Kyrgyzstan despite the reputational and legal risks. MBank and four of its corresponding international banks have been contacted to comment on this article but failed to respond at the time of the publication. Landesbank, in an emailed response, declined to comment citing 'banking secrecy' but insisted it 'consistently complies with all applicable regulations.' In the context of sanction-busting business schemes, Central Asian banks like MBank are obviously just small fry. Extending secondary sanctions to those working directly with Russia is essential but may prove insufficient. For Western sanctions to have a real impact, they will need to increase pressure on the larger international partners of these smaller banks and firms and take additional measures to prevent financial facilitation of Putin’s war machine. MBank is not the only institution undermining these sanctions. In fact, OFAC recently announced new sanctions on prominent organizations that are helping Russia undermine international sanctions. The listincludes companies from countries such as India, China, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Thailand, and Turkey. Sanctioning these businesses will put additional pressure on their decision to aid Russia, and this will help bring a quicker end to Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. In other words, Western collective action is the only way to impose real economic costs on Russia and, thereby, make progress toward ending the Russian invasion and restoring international order.

The Very Definition Of Tyranny: A Dictatorship Disguised As Democ...	Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Unadulterated power in any branch of government is a menace to freedom, but concentrated power across all three branches is the very definition of tyranny: a dictatorship disguised as democracy. When one party dominates all three branches of government—the executive, the legislative, and the judicial—there is even more reason to worry. There’s no point debating which political party would be more dangerous with these powers. This is true no matter which party is in power. This is particularly true in the wake of the 2024 election. Already, Donald Trump, who promised to be a dictator on 'day one,' is advancing plans to further undermine the nation’s already vulnerable system of checks and balances. To be fair, this is not a state of affairs that can be blamed exclusively on Trump. America’s founders intended our system of checks and balances to serve as a bulwark against centralized power being abused. As constitutional scholar Linda Monk explains, 'Within the separation of powers, each of the three branches of government has ‘checks and balances’ over the other two. For instance, Congress makes the laws, but the President can veto them, and the Supreme Court can declare them unconstitutional. The President enforces the law, but Congress must approve executive appointments and the Supreme Court rules whether executive action is constitutional. The Supreme Court can strike down actions by both the legislative and executive branches, but the President nominates Supreme Court justices, and the Senate confirms or denies their nominations.' Unfortunately, our system of checks and balances has been strained to the breaking point for years now, helped along by those across the political spectrum who, in marching in lockstep with the Deep State, have conspired to advance the government’s agenda at the expense of the citizenry’s constitutional rights. By 'government,' I’m not referring to the farce that is the highly partisan, two-party, bureaucracy of the Republicans and Democrats. Rather, I’m referring to 'government' with a capital 'G,' the entrenched Deep State that is unaffected by elections, unaltered by populist movements, and has set itself beyond the reach of the law. This is exactly the kind of concentrated, absolute power the founders attempted to guard against by establishing a system of checks of balances that separate and shares power between three co-equal branches. Yet as law professor William P. Marshall concludes, 'The system of checks and balances that the Framers envisioned now lacks effective checks and is no longer in balance. The implications of this are serious. The Framers designed a system of separation of powers to combat government excess and abuse and to curb incompetence. They also believed that, in the absence of an effective separation-of-powers structure, such ills would inevitably follow. Unfortunately, however, power once taken is not easily surrendered.' The outcome of the 2024 elections is not a revolutionary bid to recalibrate a government run amok. Rather, this is a Deep State coup to stay in power, and Donald Trump is the vehicle by which it will do so. Watch and see. Remember, it was the Trump Administration that asked Congress to allow it to suspend parts of the Constitution whenever it deemed it necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic and 'other' emergencies. In fact, during Trump’s first term, the Department of Justice quietly trotted out and tested a long laundry list of terrifying powers to override the Constitution. We’re talking about lockdown powers (at both the federal and state level): the ability to suspend the Constitution, indefinitely detain American citizens, bypass the courts, quarantine whole communities or segments of the population, override the First Amendment by outlawing religious gatherings and assemblies of more than a few people, shut down entire industries and manipulate the economy, muzzle dissidents, 'stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease,' reshape financial markets, create a digital currency (and thus further restrict the use of cash), determine who should live or die… Bear in mind, however, that these powers the Trump Administration, acting on orders from the police state, officially asked Congress to recognize and authorize barely scratch the surface of the far-reaching powers the government has unilaterally claimed for itself. Unofficially, the police state has been riding roughshod over the rule of law for years now without any pretense of being reined in or restricted in its power grabs by Congress, the courts, the president, or the citizenry. This is why the Constitution’s system of checks and balances is so critical. Those who wrote our Constitution sought to ensure our freedoms by creating a document that protects our God-given rights at all times, even when we are engaged in war, whether that is a so-called war on terrorism, a so-called war on drugs, a so-called war on illegal immigration, or a so-called war on disease. The attempts by each successive presidential administration to rule by fiat merely plays into the hands of those who would distort the government’s system of checks and balances and its constitutional separation of powers beyond all recognition. In this way, we have arrived at the dystopian future depicted in the film V for Vendetta, which is no future at all. Set in the year 2020, V for Vendetta (written and produced by the Wachowskis) provides an eerie glimpse into a parallel universe in which a totalitarian government that knows all, sees all, controls everything, and promises safety and security above all comes to power by capitalizing on the people’s fear. Concentration camps (jails, private prisons and detention facilities) are established to house political prisoners and others deemed to be enemies of the state. Executions of undesirables (extremists, troublemakers and the like) are common, while other enemies of the state are made to 'disappear.' Populist uprisings and protests are met with extreme force. The television networks are controlled by the government with the purpose of perpetuating the regime. And most of the population is hooked into an entertainment mode and are clueless. In V for Vendetta, as in my novel The Erik Blair Diaries, the subtext is that authoritarian regimes—through a vicious cycle of manipulation, oppression and fear-mongering—foment violence, manufacture crises, and breed terrorists, thereby giving rise to a recurring cycle of blowback and violence. Only when the government itself becomes synonymous with the terrorism wreaking havoc in their lives do the people to finally mobilize and stand up to the government’s tyranny. V, a bold, charismatic freedom fighter, urges the British people to rise up and resist the government. In Vendetta, V the film’s masked crusader blows up the seat of government on November 5, Guy Fawkes Day, ironically enough the same day that Trump won his landslide return to the White House. Yet there the comparison ends. So, while we are overdue for a systemic check on the government’s overreaches and power grabs, this year’s electoral victory for Republicans was no win for the Constitution. Rather, it was a win for the very entrenched, hawkish, establishment power structure that has exhibited no regard for the Constitution or the rights of the citizenry. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, the Deep State works best through imperial presidents—empowered to indulge their authoritarian tendencies by legalistic courts, corrupt legislatures and a disinterested, distracted populace—who rule by fiat rather than by the rule of law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVvbeQt8OzNL8	2024-11-12T15:47:54-08:00	
North Korea Approves Deal With Moscow That Allows Troop Deploymen...	(RFE/RL) -- North Korea has ratified a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' agreement with Russia, cementing a deal that has paved the way for its soldiers to fight on Russian soil against Ukraine. North Korea's state-controlled news agency KCNA said on November 12 that the deal, which was agreed between Moscow and Pyongyang in June, will take full effect once both sides exchange ratified copies of the agreement. According to reports from South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Russian President Vladimir Putin has already signed the documents.The deployment of North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, which has been confirmed by U.S., NATO, South Korean, and Ukrainian intelligence, has raised concerns that it will further destabilize the Asia-Pacific region and broaden Moscow's war on Ukraine. South Korea has raised questions about what new military technologies North Korea might get from Russia in exchange for supplying troops. 'Russia working together with North Korea, Iran, and China is not only threatening Europe, it's threatening peace and security, yes, here in Europe, but also in the Indo-Pacific and in North America,' NATO Chief Mark Rutte said in Paris on November 12 ahead of talks later in the day with French President Emmanuel Macron. Russia has had to shift some resources to the Kursk border region to respond to a Ukrainian incursion launched in August, and its forces have struggled to push back Ukrainian troops there. The United States has estimated about 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia now. Seoul and its allies assess that the number has increased to 11,000, while Ukraine has put the figure higher, at up to 12,000.Moscow and Pyongyang have trumpeted their increased defense cooperation since the launch of the invasion, but the Kremlin has neither denied nor directly confirmed the presence of North Korean troops on its soil. The bolstering of Russian forces comes at a time when it appears to be making advances in Ukraine despite incurring heavy casualties. NATO's Rutte, in the face of the battlefield gains by Russia and the election in the United States of Donald Trump, who has been critical of how much aid the West has given to Kyiv, called for continued support of Ukraine from allies. 'We must recommit to stay the course of the war and we must do more than just keep Ukraine in the fight,' Rutte said.'We need to raise the cost for Putin and his enabling authoritarian threats by providing Ukraine with the support it needs to change the trajectory of the conflict.' Macron agreed, saying the 'only way toward negotiations' was to make sure that nothing is decided about 'Ukraine without the Ukrainians and on Europe without the Europeans.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVjliLstpT1dl	2024-11-12T15:46:12-08:00	
Patriarch Kirill Says He Doesn’t Oppose Restoration Of Death Pena...	In yet another example of Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill’s willingness to engage in mental gymnastics to come out in support of whatever he believes the Kremlin wants, he now says that the apostles didn’t object to the death penalty when the Romans applied it to Jesus so he won’t oppose its restoration in Russia. That creative interpretation of the Bible, Aleksandr Soldatov says, is just a small part of the neo-paganism which Kirill has long been associated with, a religion that has little to do with Christianity as it is typically understood but fits perfectly with Putin’s view (t.me/mozhemobyasnit/19287 reposted at poligonmedia.appspot.com/aleksandr-soldatov/ and summarized at charter97.org/ru/news/2024/11/7/617975/). According to the specialist on religious life in Russia, Kirill has led his church to completely substitute military patriotic views in place of Christian ones, with the center of his faith 'not the Gospels but with an ideology connected with the romanticism of military actions' taken by the Russian state. For Kirill and those who follow him, 'Jesus no is only one of the gods in the pantheon of the Russian Orthodox Church: on its icons appear the image of Stalin, and the main church of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation features amulets from the computer game Warhammer' rather than the Bible. Those who follow the current patriarch including both the priesthood and the laity are told that 'in war all means are good' and shown that the church is prepared to support 'any mechanism' to promote them 'including those which are purely occult' and have nothing to do with Christian traditions, according to the specialist on the Russian Orthodox Church today. The teachings of Christ are turned upside down, the researcher says, with Christ’s injunction not to kill being recast as an order to do just that, Soldatov concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVmgWWBmRxHQw	2024-11-12T15:44:54-08:00	
Biden Reiterates ‘Ironclad’ Commitment To Israel During Meeting W...	President Joe Biden reiterated his 'ironclad' defense of Israel during a Tuesday Oval Office meeting with Israel’s president – and he echoed the wish to see the return of the remaining hostages still held by militant group Hamas after more than a year of brutal conflict in Gaza. 'My commitment to Israel is ironclad,' Biden told President Isaac Herzog during their morning meeting in the White House. 'And we share a deep friendship.' Herzog underscored his government’s main objective: 'First and foremost, we have to get the hostages back.' 'It all starts in Tehran,' he said. 'It all starts in the empire of evil, where, in Tehran, with its proxies, they are doing whatever they can to derail stability and security and peace, calling for the annihilation of the State of Israel and seeking nuclear weapons, Mr. President, this has to be a major objective all throughout your term and the next term of the next president, because we have to make sure that they cannot fulfill their evil intentions.' A day earlier in Washington, Herzog told a gathering of North American Jewish community groups that the Israeli administration considers incoming President Donald Trump 'a champion of peace and cooperation and a great friend of Israel.' Washington is Israel’s top military and diplomatic supporter, and these mannered talks are happening against a backdrop of violence. Israeli strikes killed at least 14 people in Gaza, Palestinian authorities said Tuesday, and plumes of smoke were rising above the southern Beirut’s suburbs less than an hour after Israeli forces told residents to evacuate. While fighting continues, international aid groups issued a report saying Israel has not met a Tuesday deadline set by the U.S. to allow more aid into the Gaza Strip. But the Israeli military said hundreds of packages of food and water have been brought to an area in northern Gaza where it has been focusing operations. Last month, the Biden administration told Israel to 'surge' more food and supplies into Gaza or risk a cut in military aid. The State Department said Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer met in Washington on Monday and 'reviewed steps that Israel has taken to improve the dire humanitarian situation inside Gaza in a response to the letter sent by the secretary and Secretary of Defense [Lloyd] Austin on October 13.' 'The secretary emphasized the importance of ensuring those changes lead to an actual improvement in the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, including through the delivery of additional assistance to civilians throughout Gaza. The secretary further reiterated the importance that Israel take every possible step to minimize civilian harm,' said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller in a statement on Tuesday. On Tuesday, a group of eight international aid organizations said that of 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands, Israel failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four. 'Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza,' the report said. 'That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.' The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 85% of its attempts to coordinate aid convoys and humanitarian visits to northern Gaza were denied or impeded last month. The office made 98 requests to Israeli authorities for authorization to go through the checkpoint along Wadi Gaza but only 15 made it, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday. On Monday night, the Israeli security Cabinet approved more aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter each day, an official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Airstrikes in Gaza, Beirut A late Monday strike killed at least 11 people in a cafeteria west of Khan Younis, according to officials at Nasser Hospital. A strike early Tuesday hit a house at a refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Early Tuesday, the Israeli army told residents in Beirut's southern suburbs to leave immediately, warning that it would strike Hezbollah targets there. 'You are located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah, against which the Israel Defense Forces will act in the near future,' military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X that included a map showing the buildings it would target in the Lebanese capital. Less than an hour later, according to Agence France-Presse, two strikes hit the area and plumes of gray smoke were rising. Witnesses told AFP gunfire could be heard in the area ahead of the strikes warning shots by residents for people to leave following the evacuation call. Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, said on X Tuesday that during a meeting with military officials, he reiterated that Israel will continue hitting Hezbollah with full force and that there will be no cease-fire. The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVsi3VDybq_GJ	2024-11-12T15:41:31-08:00	
Humanitarian Chiefs Say Israel Failed To Meet US Deadline For All...	By Ephrem Kossaify Israel has failed to meet critical Gaza-related humanitarian demands set by the US government, according to a report published jointly by eight major humanitarian organizations. The failure comes 'at an enormous human cost for Palestinian civilians' in the enclave, where the humanitarian situation 'is now at its worst point' since the war began in October 2023, they said. Their assessment comes a month after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to Israeli officials demanding the implementation of concrete measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within 30 days. This deadline passed on Tuesday with no significant signs of progress. Instead, Israeli forces have accelerated their efforts 'to bombard, depopulate, deprive and erase the Palestinian population of the North Gaza governorate,' said Abby Maxman, the president of Oxfam America. 'We are witnessing a campaign of ethnic cleansing,' she added. 'Oxfam and partner organizations are unable to provide any support to the remaining civilians in the North Gaza governorate, where people are dying every day. 'Access to the rest of Gaza is also severely restricted, with civilians facing starvation and relentless violence. The US must finally make this overdue call to suspend deadly arms sales to Israel or be complicit in the horrific atrocities unfolding before our eyes.' The aid organizations that contributed to the report, which also include Refugees International, Save the Children and MedGlobal, called on Washington to make an 'immediate determination' that Israel is in violation of its assurances under US and international law, and to suspend arms sales and impose restrictions on security cooperation, as required by US law. The report also urges the American government to press for immediate humanitarian pauses in military operations, the opening of more routes for deliveries of aid, and efforts to ensure civilians and medical facilities are protected. 'With experts again projecting imminent famine in northern Gaza, there is no time to lose,' said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International. The report 'clearly demonstrates that the Israeli government is violating its obligations (to) facilitate humanitarian relief for suffering Palestinians in Gaza,' he added. Zaher Sahloul, the president and co-founder of MedGlobal, said the organization’s local medical teams and international volunteers in Gaza have personally witnessed 'the complete failure by the Israeli authorities to ensure the delivery of critical supplies, including food, water and medicines, and to protect civilians and medical spaces.' He added: 'Our teams are living through the relentless bombing of hospitals, and our medics continue to treat wounded women and children every day. These are egregious violations of the cornerstone principle of international humanitarian law, which protects civilians in time of war.' Sahloul called on the Biden administration to 'do everything possible to push for the full provision of aid to Gaza’s desperate people.' In addition to the medical crisis, the blockade of Gaza has severely limited the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver aid. The report says convoys are still often blocked, delayed or looted, and access to key parts of the territory, especially in the north, remains severely restricted. 'I witnessed during my visit to Gaza last week the deliberate starvation of almost 2 million civilians, while the bombardment continues,' said Jan Egelan, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. 'There is barely any aid crossing into Gaza. The little that does get through is often looted, as the occupying power has obliterated the Palestinian police and refuses to secure, or provide secure access routes to, places where humanitarian organizations could distribute aid to a starving population.' Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, the CEO of Mercy Corps, said the US government must do 'everything in its power to ensure the unfettered provision of essential aid to people in desperate need.' The report highlights the dire food insecurity among the population of Gaza. Janti Soeripto, the president of Save the Children, said: 'Systemic impediments to the humanitarian system are making a deadly conflict even deadlier. 'Enough is enough. The facts are there. Adults have been failing children for over a year. What more will it take?' With winter and famine looming, the organizations warned that children in particular are at imminent risk, with many of them already suffering the effects of malnutrition. Sean Carroll, the president and CEO of American Near East Refugee Aid, said the organization’s 'humanitarian workers in Gaza have spent the past year expending superhuman effort in subhuman conditions to provide assistance to civilians.' He added: 'In the past month, we’ve seen families throughout Gaza, and particularly in the north, subjected to increasingly horrific conditions. This is a damning indictment of Israel’s failure to follow international humanitarian law and to respond to the critical and reasonable demands of its greatest ally, the United States. The consequences will be more innocent lives ended and destroyed. 'They should also include restrictions on Israel’s ability to continue prosecution of this war in a manner that is increasingly being seen as consistent with ethnic cleansing.' The report warns that with more than 2 million civilians in Gaza facing starvation, daily bombardments and lack of access to the basic necessities of life, the humanitarian situation in the territory is on the brink of catastrophe. 'There is no time to lose,' it concludes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeBKGk1sWOPVr0AcgOF4eBb	2024-11-12T15:40:05-08:00	
Canvas Of Diplomacy: How Art And Culture Shape Global Relations –...	In a globalized world, art and culture serve as powerful forms of communication and soft power. Nations employ cultural diplomacy, harnessing art, music, literature, and film to foster goodwill, build alliances, and bridge ideological divides. Beyond official diplomacy, art and culture influence how societies perceive each other, shaping international relations through public opinion, mutual respect, and shared values. This article dives into the nuanced ways in which art and culture impact international relations, from facilitating cross-cultural understanding to acting as subtle tools of influence and soft power. Art and Culture as Tools of Soft Power Soft power, a term popularized by political scientist Joseph Nye, refers to the ability of a country to shape the preferences of others through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion. Art and culture play a central role in this process, as they offer avenues for countries to express their identities and values. Through cultural products such as music, film, and literature, nations present an idealized version of themselves, building a global image that fosters affinity and cooperation. For example, American pop culture has been instrumental in shaping perceptions of the United States as a land of opportunity and freedom. Hollywood films, jazz music, and fashion trends project an image that appeals to youth and progressive thinkers worldwide. Similarly, Japan's post-World War II recovery saw the export of cultural phenomena such as manga, anime, and culinary traditions, contributing to Japan's modern image as a technologically advanced and culturally rich nation. Cultural Diplomacy: Bridging Divides and Building Alliances Governments increasingly recognize the value of cultural diplomacy in forging stronger international ties. Cultural exchanges, art exhibitions, language programs, and festivals promote cross-cultural understanding, fostering goodwill that can ease diplomatic tensions. For instance, the Goethe-Institut, Alliance Française, and the British Council are state-funded organizations that promote German, French, and British cultures, respectively, around the world. These organizations provide language classes, fund art exhibits, and organize cultural events to foster understanding and cooperation. During the Cold War, cultural diplomacy played a crucial role in U.S.-Soviet relations. The U.S. State Department funded jazz tours in Eastern Europe, using American music to counter Soviet propaganda and humanize Americans in the eyes of communist societies. Similarly, the Soviet Union promoted ballet, classical music, and literature as symbols of its cultural sophistication, hoping to win the hearts and minds of audiences in the West. By focusing on shared cultural values, these initiatives sought to lessen ideological divides, creating points of contact that would be difficult to establish through traditional diplomacy. Art and Culture in Public Diplomacy: Shaping National Image Public diplomacy uses art and culture to reach foreign populations, presenting a favorable image of a country to build mutual understanding and respect. This form of diplomacy is increasingly essential in a digital age, where information—and disinformation—spreads rapidly. For instance, South Korea's government actively supports the global spread of K-pop, fashion, and Korean drama, cultivating a positive international image known as the 'Korean Wave' or Hallyu. Through entertainment, South Korea has attracted millions of fans globally, fostering a youth-driven affinity for Korean culture that enhances its diplomatic relationships. China's Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture abroad, are another example. While some view these institutes with suspicion, seeing them as a tool for political influence, they offer many people around the world their first exposure to Chinese history, art, and philosophy. This mix of education and cultural immersion can soften perceptions of China, presenting it as a nation with a rich, centuries-old civilization and promoting cooperation on issues like trade and education. The Role of Art in Cross-Cultural Understanding Artistic exchanges and collaborations provide opportunities for countries to understand each other's perspectives and values. When people engage with foreign art, literature, or film, they gain insights into the cultural context and worldview of the artists, building empathy and reducing stereotypes. For instance, African art exhibitions in Europe and North America have exposed global audiences to diverse African cultural expressions, challenging reductive narratives of Africa as a monolithic entity. Literature, in particular, has been a powerful force in fostering cross-cultural understanding. Writers like Chinua Achebe, Haruki Murakami, and Gabriel García Márquez have captivated readers globally, offering perspectives on Nigerian, Japanese, and Latin American life, respectively. By reading stories that reflect the values, struggles, and triumphs of different societies, audiences around the world develop a more nuanced understanding of these cultures, which can influence how they view these nations on the world stage. Art as Protest and Political Commentary: A Double-Edged Sword While art and culture can promote understanding, they also serve as vehicles for political critique and resistance. Artists often address themes of oppression, human rights, and political freedom, challenging authoritarian governments and exposing social injustices. Art that critiques state policies or champions minority rights can resonate internationally, creating solidarity movements and putting pressure on governments to uphold democratic values. One example is the influence of Soviet dissident art during the Cold War. Writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and artists like Marc Chagall challenged Soviet repression, influencing international views of the USSR. In modern times, artists like Ai Weiwei have used their work to critique Chinese government policies, drawing attention to issues of censorship and human rights in China. Such art has become a diplomatic issue, as countries hosting dissident exhibitions can strain relations with the artist's home country. Music as a Unifying Force and Cultural Ambassador Music, as a universal language, has a unique ability to connect people across cultural divides. Jazz, rock, and hip-hop have become globally popular, bridging gaps and creating shared experiences. During the Cold War, jazz was used as a diplomatic tool, with musicians like Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie performing worldwide to embody American ideals of freedom and creativity. More recently, hip-hop has emerged as a voice for youth globally, with artists in countries like France, Brazil, and South Africa using the genre to address social and political issues. Cultural exchanges in music have also fostered collaborations between nations. In the Middle East, for example, programs that bring Western musicians together with local artists help to build mutual respect and understanding. Such musical diplomacy initiatives foster goodwill, allowing nations to connect on a human level, beyond politics. Cinema and Media: Shaping Global Perceptions Film and television have a far-reaching impact on international relations, as they reach global audiences and shape perceptions of foreign cultures. Hollywood, for example, has long played a role in portraying American society and values, sometimes reinforcing stereotypes but also celebrating the diversity and resilience of American life. Films like Schindler's List, The Kite Runner, and Slumdog Millionaire have raised awareness of historical events, cultural practices, and social issues, influencing how audiences perceive different nations and inspiring empathy. Non-Western cinema also shapes international perceptions. Indian Bollywood films, known for their vibrant storytelling, have gained popularity in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, building a cultural bridge between India and these regions. Iranian cinema, with directors like Abbas Kiarostami and Asghar Farhadi, has won international acclaim for its storytelling, offering viewers a glimpse into Iranian society and countering simplistic narratives about the country. Cultural Festivals and International Showcases Cultural festivals offer platforms for countries to showcase their art, music, food, and traditions, providing audiences a firsthand experience of diverse cultures. Events like the Edinburgh International Festival, Venice Biennale, and Cannes Film Festival serve as hubs for cultural exchange, where artists, critics, and audiences from around the world come together. These festivals foster dialogue and mutual understanding, allowing countries to celebrate their heritage while contributing to global cultural discourse. Sports events, such as the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, also play a significant role in cultural diplomacy. While primarily athletic competitions, these events allow nations to display their cultural heritage on a global stage, as seen in the elaborate opening ceremonies that showcase art, dance, and music. Hosting these events gives countries a chance to enhance their international image and foster pride and unity among their citizens. The Digital Age: Art, Culture, and the Internet's Role in Diplomacy In the digital age, social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok allow artists and cultural influencers to reach global audiences instantly. Cultural diplomacy has taken on new dimensions as individuals, rather than governments, become ambassadors of their culture, sharing their art, traditions, and perspectives with the world. For example, TikTok has popularized K-pop dance challenges, bringing Korean music to millions of people and furthering South Korea's cultural influence. Digital art exhibitions and virtual museums, which became particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, allow people worldwide to access art and culture, democratizing cultural diplomacy. Online collaborations between artists from different countries also foster cross-cultural exchange, as creators share ideas, techniques, and themes that reflect their unique cultural contexts. Conclusion Art and culture profoundly impact international relations by shaping perceptions, building alliances, and fostering understanding. Whether through public diplomacy, cultural exchanges, or digital media, the power of art and culture extends beyond national borders, influencing how societies view each other and interact on the global stage. As technology advances, the reach of cultural diplomacy will only grow, offering new opportunities to connect across divides, promote mutual respect, and find common ground in a diverse and interconnected world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfrlHnSWGDEcJz-NZWV9yh7	2024-11-12T08:59:22-08:00	
Tajikistan’s High-Level Round Table At The European Parliament: U...	On November 19, 2024, the 'Tajikistan High-Level Round Table' will take place at the European Parliament. The Tajik government, highly concerned with the climate crisis, aims to engage Europeans in the fight against climate change and to address the melting glaciers in Tajikistan, which also affect neighboring countries. Tajikistan, a land of glaciers and mountains, is facing a climate crisis. Over the past 40 years, Tajikistan has lost more than 1,000 of its 14,000 glaciers, with harmful consequences for the entire Central Asian region, as noted by Deputy Director of the Hydrometeorology Agency of Tajikistan, Karimjon Abduhalimov, at the 2019 Central Asia Climate Change Conference (CACCC-2019) in Uzbekistan. The Country Needs Help President Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan proposes establishing an international fund for glacier protection and declaring 2025 the International Year of Glaciers. During his speech at the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 24, 2024, President Rahmon emphasized the importance of uniting the international community to ensure security, maintain stability, and achieve sustainable development. With the scientific consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) affirming climate change, it is hopeful to see heads of state aware of this urgent global issue. In parallel, Rahmon emphasized his country’s unwavering support for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Tajikistan, a mountainous Central Asian country, is particularly sensitive to climate change and directly impacted by global warming. Research shows that both the Tajik population and government are highly aware of climate change issues. Tajikistan is a partner country of the EU, and aligns with the EU on several issues. Despite the crises and rising extremism across its border with Afghanistan, Tajikistan rejects extremism and refuses any engagement with the Taliban. Although the two countries share a similar language, related to Persian—one of the oldest Indo-European languages—Tajikistan remains hostile to the Taliban. At the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit held in Dushanbe on September 16-17, President Rahmon denounced the Taliban’s 'medieval Sharia' and expressed concern over the potential spread of their 'destructive ideas in the region.' This alignment with the EU is particularly beneficial for both sides, especially on environmental and climate issues. EU Interest in Climate Change Mitigation The EU is particularly attentive to climate change and aims to help developing and underdeveloped countries face climate risks. The EU intends to support the Tajik government’s efforts to address climate change. Tajikistan also faces other environmental challenges, such as land degradation, water shortages, and rising temperatures. The EU’s engagement with Tajikistan has grown significantly since the country’s independence in 1991. The foundation of EU-Tajikistan relations is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), effective since 2010. In early 2023, the EU and Tajikistan began negotiations on an Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA). Regionally, At the regional level, the Republic of Tajikistan is a partner in the EU’s Central Asia Strategy, adopted in June 2019. This strategy outlines the overall cooperation objectives and priorities for EU engagement in the region, focusing on promoting resilience, prosperity, and regional cooperation in Central Asia. Enhancing resilience also means enabling the region to cope with climate change. The EU’s cooperation with Tajikistan for the 2021-2027 period will build on past achievements in key areas such as health, public financial management, water, energy, and agriculture, while expanding support for empowering SMEs, greening the economy, and reducing disaster risks. Water is a particularly critical issue for Tajikistan. The EU’s bilateral development assistance allocation for the 2021-2024 period amounts to €91 million. Three priority areas have been identified for the 2021-2027 Multiannual Indicative Programme: Inclusive Green and Digital Economy; Human Development; and Natural Resources Management, Efficiency, and Resilience. Many glaciers cover the high altitudes of the Pamirs, including the longest glacier outside the polar regions, the Fedchenko Glacier, which stretches over 70 km and has an estimated depth of 800 meters. The Tajik Pamirs thus contain a massive water reservoir for Central Asia, feeding the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers—key contributors to the desiccation of the Aral Sea. Eastern Pamir is dominated by a high, arid plateau with tall mountains at an average altitude of 4,420 meters (ranging from 2,970 to 7,130 meters), while Western Pamir features high, steep valleys with an average altitude of 4,060 meters (ranging from 900 to 7,490 meters). According to the World Bank, Tajikistan is the most climate-vulnerable country in Central Asia and Europe, with significant temperature variations between high and low altitudes. Six percent of Tajikistan’s territory is covered in glaciers. Located at the edge of the Pamir Mountains, the country has lost 'more than 1,000 of its 14,000 glaciers [out of over 200,000 glaciers worldwide]' in the past 40 years, as lamented by the President. This glacier melt will impact all countries in Central Asia. In conclusion, The climate issues to be discussed with the Tajikistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs will therefore be key points for both Central Asian countries and the rest of the world.

NATO Secretary General And President Macron Discuss Defence Produ...	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and President Emmanuel Macron discussed on Tuesday (12 November) the need to step up support for Ukraine, ramp up defence production and boost transatlantic defence industrial cooperation. During his first official visit to Paris since taking office, the Secretary General highlighted the importance of France’s high-end military capabilities and skilled armed forces for the collective security of the Alliance. They discussed the need for increased defence investment and robust transatlantic cooperation to ensure the Alliance’s lasting security. 'The more we spend on defence, the more we reduce the risk of future conflict,' said Rutte. Mr. Rutte and President Macron also discussed the need for more support for Ukraine ahead of what could be its harshest winter, as Russia relentlessly targets its energy infrastructure. Mr Rutte commended France for training and equipping an entire Ukrainian brigade, the Anne of Kyiv Brigade, and for its pledge to send Mirage fighter jets early next year. 'France has delivered advanced artillery guns, air defence systems, cruise missiles, and armoured vehicles,' he said. The Secretary General also raised concerns about deepening military ties between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, which pose a threat to European security and global peace. Prior to his meeting with the French President, the Secretary General visited the factory floor of the French defence industry company Thales Group. During the visit, Mr Rutte met with young talents and engineers developing cutting-edge capabilities for NATO Allies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSlOFVi6qNTiVKazl6QtDd	2024-11-12T08:54:38-08:00	
How Political Psychology And Political Economy Shape Great Power ...	Great power politics has long been influenced by a complex interrelationship of psychological motivations and economic interests. Political psychology delves into how perceptions, biases, and ideologies drive the decisions of leaders and nations, while political economy analyzes how resources, trade dynamics, and economic policies define power relations and influence global strategies. Together, these disciplines illuminate the underlying forces shaping the ambitions, rivalries, and alliances that characterize great power politics, offering insights into the strategies employed by nations in pursuit of dominance and security. The Historical Roots of Power and Psychology Historically, great power dynamics have been influenced by both psychological and economic factors. The realpolitik approach, often attributed to Niccolò Machiavelli and Otto von Bismarck, emphasized power and pragmatism, grounded in a psychological understanding of self-interest and survival. Leaders like Bismarck strategically used economic power to consolidate alliances and counter rivals, illustrating how psychological acumen and economic prowess have been central to maintaining influence. The 20th-century Cold War era further underscores the impact of political psychology and economy on great power behavior. The ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union was driven by psychological elements, such as the fear of mutually assured destruction, as well as economic competition for influence through development aid and trade agreements with allied nations. This bipolar rivalry illustrates how deeply psychological and economic factors define not only bilateral relations but also the alignment of third-party states. Economic Power as a Tool of Influence In contemporary great power politics, economic influence has become a primary tool for projecting power and securing alliances. Joseph Nye's concept of 'soft power' highlights how economic strategies—such as trade agreements, investment in infrastructure, and economic aid—allow nations to shape global politics without direct military intervention. For example, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is not only an economic venture but a geopolitical strategy aimed at extending influence across Asia, Africa, and Europe. Through the BRI, China is both satisfying economic interests and shaping global political alignments, reflecting the dual role of political psychology and economy in its international strategy. Economic sanctions, as employed by the United States and European Union against rivals, further demonstrate how political economy intersects with psychological tactics. Sanctions leverage economic interdependence to coerce states into policy changes without armed conflict, capitalizing on the psychological pressures of financial distress and the fear of isolation. This tool exemplifies how economic measures can target the psychological resilience of a state, aiming to weaken morale and create internal political pressure. Psychological Drivers Behind Strategic Decision-Making The psychological dimension of great power politics often centers on national identity, prestige, and the perceived need for security. Leaders of great powers are often influenced by cognitive biases, such as prospect theory, which suggests that decision-makers prioritize avoiding losses over achieving equivalent gains. This loss aversion often drives states to maintain aggressive foreign policies and resist changes that could diminish their status, even if such strategies are costly. For example, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, despite economic sanctions, reflects a decision driven by national identity and loss aversion, prioritizing historical ties and strategic interests over economic concerns. National identity and status are also critical psychological drivers. Research on social identity theory, initially introduced by Henri Tajfel, reveals how groups define themselves by distinguishing from 'others.' In great power politics, this translates to a pursuit of status and recognition on the global stage. For instance, the United States and China often engage in psychological signaling, each promoting its system—democracy versus authoritarian capitalism—as superior, while vying for leadership in global organizations such as the United Nations and World Health Organization. Geopolitical Rivalries and Economic Competition Economic competition among great powers fuels rivalries, with political economy playing a significant role in shaping alliances, trade policies, and resource control. The competition for technological supremacy in fields like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing illustrates how economic power underpins geopolitical influence. Countries like the United States and China invest heavily in technology, viewing it as both an economic asset and a strategic advantage in intelligence, defense, and economic productivity. The rivalry over rare earth minerals—a key resource for advanced electronics and green technology—further highlights the strategic value of economic assets in great power competition. As China controls the majority of rare earth production, other powers like the United States, Japan, and the European Union are developing policies to diversify their supply chains. This competition reflects not only economic interests but also psychological dimensions of distrust, competition, and a desire for security against supply disruptions. The Role of Domestic Political Psychology in Shaping Foreign Policy Domestic public opinion and national sentiment significantly impact great power politics. Leaders often cater to domestic psychological pressures, such as nationalism, to gain public support for foreign policy initiatives. Graham Allison's concept of the 'Thucydides Trap' argues that rising powers (like China) and established powers (like the United States) are prone to conflict due to mutual distrust and competition. These psychological underpinnings shape how domestic politics influence foreign policy, as leaders seek to rally public support by framing rival states as threats to national security and identity. Elections and political cycles also affect great power behavior. Politicians often adopt aggressive foreign policies to appeal to nationalist sentiments during elections, creating short-term escalations in global politics. This tendency is evident in both democracies and authoritarian regimes, where leaders seek to unify public opinion through foreign policy stances that emphasize strength and resilience. Psychological Warfare and Strategic Communication Psychological operations and information warfare are increasingly central to great power conflicts. Disinformation campaigns, cyber espionage, and propaganda exploit cognitive biases, shaping public opinion and undermining adversaries' social cohesion. Russia's use of information warfare in the 2016 U.S. election demonstrates how psychological tactics can influence the political landscape of rival states, destabilizing them from within. China's media influence in Africa and Asia also exemplifies psychological tactics in geopolitical strategy. By controlling narratives through state-run media, China seeks to shape perceptions of its leadership model, challenging Western influence in developing regions. Such psychological strategies complement economic investments, aiming to foster positive public sentiment and political support in strategically valuable regions. Conclusion The relationship between political psychology and political economy is central to understanding the complexities of great power politics. Psychological factors such as identity, status, and perception of threats drive strategic decisions, while economic assets and policies provide the means to execute these strategies. As global power dynamics continue to shift, the convergence of political psychology and economy will remain essential in shaping the behavior and ambitions of great powers, underscoring the enduring connection between the human psyche, economic interests, and the pursuit of global influence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSlOFVi6qNTiYmEnCHkSAu	2024-11-12T08:53:22-08:00	
Oil Demand Forecasts And The Future Of The Middle East – OpEd	World oil consumption has increased by nearly 10 percent over the past decade, reaching 4.5 billion tons last year. (1) This performance was achieved despite a 9 percent drop in 2020 due to the pandemic. Considering that the growth rate in the preceding decade was roughly the same, it is hard to say that global consumption shows signs of slowing. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) disagrees. (2) According to its recently published World Energy Outlook 2024 report, (3) global oil consumption will peak in the next 10 years and then start to decline. Moreover, this is the agency’s most optimistic forecast. The report also includes two disaster scenarios for the oil industry: In the first scenario, if governments fulfill their climate commitments to the United Nations, oil consumption will fall by almost 50 percent in just 15 years. In the second, if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions target by 2050, then consumption 15 years from now will be less than half of today’s level. According to this Paris-based organization, the era of fossil fuels is nearing its end. The momentum behind the transition to clean energy is so strong that global demand for coal, oil, and natural gas has begun to fall rapidly. The agency bases its view on oil mainly on the slowdown in Chinese consumption and the acceleration of electric vehicle sales. However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) forecasts paint a completely different picture. OPEC insists that global oil demand will continue to grow at least until 2050 and that the peak is nowhere in sight. (4) Moreover, it regards the IEA’s forecasts as fantasies (5) that have no connection with reality and even considers them dangerous. (6) Consequently, it seems highly unlikely that these two organizations will be able to reach an agreement on the future of oil. However, the question of which side is right is of vital importance for oil-producing countries, especially for those in the Middle East, one of the hottest regions in the world today. Most countries in this region, which hosts the world's largest oil reserves, have economies heavily dependent on this fuel, with oil exports accounting for a significant portion of both their budgets and national income. For instance, oil revenues contribute around 40 percent to Iraq and Kuwait's GDP, over 20 percent for Saudi Arabia and Oman, and around 20 percent for Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. (7) Therefore, considering their high levels of dependence on oil, it would not be an exaggeration to say that these countries could face existential challenges if even the most optimistic forecasts of the IEA come true. Middle Eastern countries, aware of the risks posed to them by the transformation process from fossil fuels to cleaner sources, are taking measures to ease the transition and are making plans to survive in a low-carbon future. To this end, they are trying to take part in all kinds of projects aimed at restructuring supply chains and seeking strategic partnerships amid global power struggles. However, it is difficult to say that all countries in the region are successful in this regard, and they are the ones that should be most concerned about the approaching danger. It is clear that oil demand estimates are creating significant tension in the Middle East. Now the question is: Which of the two organizations will be proven right? Will it be the IEA, a creation of the Western bloc led by the US following the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, which is now accused of manipulating the process with analyses tailored to the bloc's interests? Or will it be the OPEC, an organization established to manage global oil supply and wholly dedicated to the interests of exporting nations? We can foresee that the increasingly visible energy transition will heighten tensions in the region and that much harder times are coming for the geography. Moreover, if the IEA proves to be right in the forecasting wars, it would not be a prophecy to say that the geopolitical balances in the Middle East will be turned upside down within a few years, leaving those relying on today’s status quo on the losing side.

Iran’s Military-Security Budget To Increase By 200 Percent – OpEd	In conjunction with the ratification of Iranian regime President Masoud Pezeshkian’s budget proposal in parliament, the spokesperson for the government announced that the country’s military budget would see a 200 percent increase. She stated, 'Every effort has been made to address the country’s defense needs, with special attention given to this matter; consequently, the military budget will experience a 200 percent increase.' This increase effectively triples the military budget of the clerical regime. Economist Ahmad Alavi views the 2025 budget as rooted in rent distribution among the nation’s political and economic players. One defining feature of Iran’s economy is the divide between inclusive organizations, which promote economic growth and development, and extractive institutions, which function to capture rents and serve the interests of a small elite, the oligarchy that holds power. A significant portion of the budget is allocated to institutions controlled by oligarchs, power factions, and groups close to the regime. These institutions include large foundations and economic enterprises such as the 'Execution of Imam Khomeini’s Order' foundation, and Astan Quds Razavi, which are tax-exempt or evade taxes and operate under the direct supervision of the regime Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. These entities benefit from state funds, part of which they direct towards commercial, political, and religious activities without significant economic returns for society. Additionally, substantial budget allocations go to military and security entities like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), IRGC Basij forces, and affiliated propaganda, religious, and quasi-political organizations. Such allocations align with the theory of extractive institutions, where resources are used not for infrastructure or production, but to strengthen political control and influence. A Quarter of the Budget Directed Toward Military and Suppression Forces Research by Iran Open Data Center shows that this year, the direct budget for armed forces, including the Ministry of Defense, the Army, the IRGC, and the police, has reached at least 7.22 quadrillion rials. This amount is allocated not only within the main budget lines but also from crude oil revenue. In the 2023 budget, military appropriations totaled 5.25 quadrillion rials. Oil Sales to Fund Military-Security Expenditures According to Clause B of Exemption Four, 1.37 quadrillion rials’ worth of crude oil is allocated to the armed forces under the heading 'strengthening defense capability.' In addition, 1.8 billion euros in crude oil is earmarked for 'special projects' for the military, but due to its confidentiality, little information is available. Thus, as outlined in Budget Table 21 for 2024, the armed forces will receive over 2.53 quadrillion rials from oil quotas. In his continued pursuit of warmongering policies, Khamenei stated, 'The quality of expressing the nation’s power and will must be determined by the officials, and what is in the nations and country’s best interest must be done.' This anti-people policy is clearly reflected in Pezeshkian’s government military budget. On October 29, Euronews reported that the budget allocated to Iran’s military forces next year is expected to be around 2.17 quadrillion rials. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Iran’s regime spent $10.3 billion on military expenses in 2023. The IRGC’s share of total military expenditures in 2019 was about 27 percent, rising to 37 percent in 2023. According to Clause One, Exemption Three of the 2025 budget proposal of the 11.96 quadrillion rials in revenue from crude oil, gas, and condensate exports, 5.61 quadrillion rials will be allocated to the armed forces to 'strengthen defense capability.' This amount is four times the oil quota allocated to the armed forces in the 2024 budget. In addition, another 1.26 quadrillion rials is earmarked as 'other allocations for specific projects,' likely distributed among military and security institutions. In defense of the budget proposal, Pezeshkian said: 'We obtained permission from the supreme leader to use some foreign exchange, usually reserved mid-year to cover deficits and address social protests.' Despite severe concerns within the regime about uprisings by millions of impoverished citizens, budgetary imbalances and deficits have left no other options for the people than rising prices, inflation, and worsening poverty. Final uprisings soon are inevitable and unavoidable. Increased pressure on the suffering people will pave the way for the courageous and aware youth of Iran to rise until the flames of their struggle engulf the oppressors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSlOFVi6qNTv9eaE-o_WFl	2024-11-12T08:48:36-08:00	
Donald Trump’s Victory And The Iranian Regime’s Concerns Over His...	Contrary to polls and predictions that anticipated a tight race between the Democratic and Republican candidates, Donald Trump made a historic return to the White House by defeating his opponent, Kamala Harris, Vice President under President Joe Biden. According to CNN’s exit polls, slightly over half of voters preferred Trump over Harris for economic management, with 31% of voters identifying it as their top issue. Following the announcement of Trump’s victory and his return to the White House, Iran’s currency, the Rial (Iran currency) hit a record low. Speculations about the impact of Trump’s second term on Iran largely stem from his policies during his previous presidency, which included 'maximum pressure' on Iran. These policies could mean additional sanctions and heightened military tensions. On Thursday evening, October 7, Brian Hook, former head of the 'Iran Action Group' in Trump’s previous administration, accused the Biden administration in a CNN interview of seeking 'compromise with the Iranian regime,' which he claimed has led to a 'failure of deterrence policy.' The former U.S. envoy on Iran emphasized that Trump understands that the primary source of instability in the Middle East today is the Iranian regime.' But 'Trump has no interest in regime change' in Tehran but is focused on isolating and weakening the Islamic Republic. He also stated that Trump’s 'Peace Plan' for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, known as the 'Deal of the Century,' is likely to return to the table. With Trump’s return, Iran’s state-controlled media have acknowledged that the various crises confronting the Iranian regime, including economic turmoil and social discontent, will intensify. This time, however, the situation is markedly different from Trump’s first term. The regime is grappling with a severe economic crisis, having withstood two nationwide uprisings demanding its overthrow, with no end to the economic crisis in sight. The escalating conflict with Israel, efforts to dismantle Iran’s regional proxies, and attempts to acquire nuclear weapons as a survival guarantee have raised global concern. On Thursday, November 7, the newspaper Ham-Mihan noted: 'Iran’s economy today in November 2024 is weaker than in 2018. The internal challenges and crises we have faced are now more extensive than ever. According to our foreign minister, international conditions are vastly different from the period when the JCPOA was signed and subsequently abandoned by Trump. We are dealing with the fallout from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and issues between Iran and the West have become more complicated over the past six years. There is no short- or medium-term solution in sight. Hardliners are trying to promote BRICS as a substitute for addressing Iran’s sanctions issues, but even the most optimistic experts believe it will take decades for BRICS to yield significant results. At least two of its most influential members, China and India, remain among the top ten U.S. trading partners.' Donald Trump's potential policies may follow the same path as his previous term but with greater intensity and a focus on threats beyond Iran’s nuclear program. Trump’s policies toward Iran were based on maximum pressure and targeting Iran's oil revenues, which in 2020 reduced Iran’s oil exports to an unprecedented level. These policies would likely be repeated in a new term with a stronger emphasis on economic pressure and limiting Iran’s regional influence and its support for proxy groups. Given that Trump and his team see the Iranian regime as the 'axis of evil' in the Middle East, the focus of their policies could be on Iran's nuclear threat and its regional policies and support for armed groups and militias. The goal of these actions could be an attempt to isolate the regime and weaken its bases of influence and survival in the region, which, according to some analysts, could lead to internal weakening of the regime and make it more vulnerable to domestic protests and organized resistance. Trump and his team would likely use stronger sanctions and a more extensive crackdown on Iran's oil trade and its supporters to push Iran into the most restricted economic and strategic position possible. These pressures, disregarding new regional conditions and developments, would pose a serious challenge for Iran and might lead to responses and decisions from Iran. In this regard The Wall Street Journal wrote: Donald Trump intends to significantly increase sanctions against Iran and reduce the country’s oil sales. His new team will quickly move to choke off Iran's oil revenue, including targeting ports and foreign traders handling Iranian oil.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfkd3ocFgFNXvSsGeDso5kF	2024-11-12T08:44:11-08:00	
COP29: Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter Publishes Its First Repo...	The Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC) published on November 11, its Baseline Report, setting a foundation to help prioritize and track progress on emissions reductions made by the 54 oil and gas companies - representing almost 45% of the global oil production, that have signed up to the Charter’s ambitions. These ambitions include to work toward net-zero operations by 2050, near-zero upstream methane emissions and zero routine flaring by 2030 in addition to measuring and publicly reporting progress towards meeting OGDC’s goals. The publication of the Baseline Report is a key milestone for OGDC that sets out the work achieved in the first year since the initiative was launched at COP28. In the past 12 months, OGDC has established a governance framework and launched a survey to determine signatories’ emissions reduction ambitions and implementation plans to set a baseline to track future progress. OGDC has also implemented a Collaborate & Share program to disseminate solutions, promote peer-to-peer collaboration and encourage the adoption of best practices to reduce emissions. In a sign of a positive momentum, the initiative has also attracted three new members, with Oil India Limited, PetroChina and Vår Energi joining. 'We are proud of the 54 companies that have already signed up to the Charter and are encouraged by the extent of their engagement in this first major piece of work that helps to establish a base on which to build future success,' OGDC’s three CEO Champions and founding members – Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) CEO Sultan Al Jaber, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser and TotalEnergies Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanné, said in a joint statement. 'Each company is at a different phase of the decarbonization journey. For some, the Charter reflects existing commitments and aligns with pledges already made via other initiatives. For others, it marks their first steps toward climate action.' 'The diverse nature of our signatories is an opportunity as well as a challenge. Each company brings different experiences, capabilities, stakeholders and national circumstances. Signatories will have the opportunity to learn from the best practices and insights of peers from a wide range of backgrounds and from across the globe,' the CEOs said. OGDC’s Charter Baselining Survey found that the majority of signatories are already consistent with the Charter’s ambitions for net zero operations by 2050, and goals to reduce methane emissions to near zero and eliminate flaring by 2030. Gaps identified in the survey will help prioritize support and knowledge transfer from companies with relevant experience. The survey also found that a majority of the signatories already report on their greenhouse gas emissions, though there is a need for common standards and methodologies to establish a robust reporting framework for the group. According to the survey, most of the signatories are already investing in the energy systems of the future, including renewable energy, energy storage, low-carbon fuels, hydrogen, methane abatement, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) and carbon removals technologies, and plan to increase investments. Bjorn Otto Sverdrup, the head of the OGDC Secretariat said: 'A survey of oil and gas industry climate performance has never been attempted on this scale. Participants ranged from companies that pioneered decarbonization decades ago to those still in the early phases – all with different capabilities and reporting methods. The lessons learned will be used to improve reporting visibility and data quality and to create more targeted programs.' This baselining survey sets the foundation for the collective work ahead: over the next year, OGDC will focus on providing the resources and guidance the signatories need to reduce their GHG emissions, methane emissions and flaring. OGDC will also help signatories to shape their net-zero roadmaps and develop emissions reporting to ensure progress can be tracked and to demonstrate how collective action can deliver positive climate impact on a global scale.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfkd3ocFgFNXsVKTEsRjnGi	2024-11-12T08:38:01-08:00	
Collective Actions On Climate Change Urgent Instead Of Empty Prom...	The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement on climate change, was signed on January 11, 1997 in Kyoto, Japan to limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Although the protocol entered into force in 2005, its achievement remains questionable. Many countries may be complacent that they have reduced carbon emissions. But from the review of the data, it is not seen anywhere, instead, many people have opined that the situation is getting worse day by day. Bill Clinton was the US president when the treaty was executed. He hailed it as an 'environmentally and economically robust deal'. But ironically, US lawmakers rejected the deal in the Senate, and Bill Clinton's successor, President George W. Bush, withdrew America's support for the Kyoto Protocol. The Bush administration has criticized the Kyoto Protocol, saying that 80 percent of the world's countries have been exempted from emission standards in the agreement. Also, there is a danger of economic damage to the United States due to this. Russia is a major power. According to Andrey Illaryonov, a former adviser to the country's President Vladimir Putin, since human civilization is now based on the use of hydrocarbons, the adoption of the Kyoto agreement could have a negative impact on the Russian economy. Several developed and developing countries are major sources of carbon dioxide emissions and have not imposed any restrictions on themselves. So Illarionov's comment regarding the Kyoto agreement is discriminatory. James E. Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and distinguished climate scientist, claimed that the United Nations Climate Change Conference (including the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change—Cop 15 and Kyoto) held at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Denmark, 7–18 December 2009 included the Fifth Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol) a 'farce'. He planned to boycott it. According to him, it is essentially trading in the name of emissions cap, known as 'cap and trade'. Here 'cap' refers to limiting or capping the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions. This is accomplished by issuing emission credits or carbon credits, where a certain amount of carbon dioxide is allowed to be emitted. According to Hansen, through this 'they are selling luxury'. Through this, developed countries are trying to absolve themselves of their responsibilities in exchange for giving small financial assistance to developing countries without reducing their own country's emissions. The issue is very much like 'killing a cow and donating shoes'. Hansen prefers and emphasizes the imposition of a 'carbon tax' rather than the 'cap and trade' of the Kyoto Protocol. Under his proposal, the tax would start at the equivalent of about $1 per gallon of gasoline, and the revenue collected would be returned directly to the public as a dividend against the carbon footprint. States signatories to the Kyoto Protocol have committed to reducing emissions but do not appear to be keeping them. For example, Japan's fossil fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions have increased despite their strong commitment to this. Their use of coal has increased and although they have used various pollution control materials (offsets) to meet their objectives, these do not significantly reduce pollution. Greenhouse gases are no longer confined to the region or country from which they are emitted; Rather, they circulate in the atmosphere and spread everywhere. Therefore, not only high-emitting countries, but all countries worldwide must work to reduce emissions. Otherwise, the desired result will not be possible. The agreement appears to be following a few charts like many other agreements without encouraging any innovation in greenhouse gas emissions to curb global warming. While the Kyoto Protocol emphasized carbon emissions, it did not mention any action on other serious air pollutants such as oxides of sulfur or oxides of nitrogen. Methane as a greenhouse gas causes various damages to the atmosphere, but the Kyoto Protocol does not provide any guidelines for its control. That's right, world leaders can meet once a year on the occasion of this protocol, as is the Conference of the Parties (COP), the 29th session of which is being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, November 11-22. There will be discussions for a few days; There will be some agreements and disagreements. There will be politics of blaming each other; Airplanes used to transport participants to the conference will emit huge amounts of environmentally damaging nitrogen oxide gas. Finally, there will be a lot of talk in the media; However, there will be little effect in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preventing global warming. It is only possible to get good results for all if any protocol is signed considering the global interest and not just the national interest based on the consensus of the states. If not, the climate change situation will become more dire due to global warming. Collective climate actions are urgent instead of empty promises.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfkd3ocFgFNXsBbxmj5gdmq	2024-11-12T08:36:08-08:00	
Believing Bald-Face Lies – OpEd	We just finished another presidential election year. Never have there been more lies told by so many candidates at the federal, state, and local levels. Not the usual lies—the ones that candidates tell about themselves and their opponent. There is nothing new about that. The bald-face lies, the kinds of falsehoods that every sentient person knows is an obvious lie. The most disturbing aspect of this phenomenon is that it works; importantly, it is not confined to the political world. How is it possible to believe something that is manifestly false? Similarly, what motivates inveterate liars? Recently, the Drudge Report, a once popular news aggregate website, ran a headline on the front page saying, 'Tucker Carlson Claims Abortion Causes Hurricanes?' After checking the story, which was published by Mediaite, a left-wing outlet that seeks to discredit conservative voices, and reading what Carlson actually said, it was clear as a bell that he was mocking those who say hurricanes are caused by global warming. He said, sarcastically, 'No, it’s probably abortion.' Anyone fair-minded person would conclude that what Carlson said was in jest, but that’s not what was reported. Throughout this past year, reporters, media commentators and politicians said over and over again that late-term abortions were not legal under Roe v. Wade, and that it was simply not true that in some states there is no legal requirement mandating that medical personnel attend to babies who survive a botched abortion. As we, and others, pointed out, this was utterly false. The pro-abortion side simply lied. In October, we had a chance to fact check a 'fact checker' at the New York Times and found that the reporter left out the second part of a sentence from a Minnesota bill that she quoted. She did so purposely so as to make her point. Had she included the entire sentence, her position would have been proven wrong. After we took Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to the cleaners for mocking the Eucharist, her press secretary said that the woman who feigned taking Communion (a Dorito was placed on her tongue by Whitmer) was not kneeling. That was a lie. She was not sitting on a couch, as they contended—she was kneeling. The picture proves it. After President Biden called Trump supporters 'garbage,' White House staff tried to alter his words. When the truth came out, the White House press secretary still said he never said such a thing, even though he was captured on tape saying exactly that. Why do these people lie when it is 100 percent certain that they have? Because they can get away with it. To be sure, when presented with the evidence, most people are instantly persuaded. But not all. There are those who, upon hearing prominent persons deny that what they said is a lie, are puzzled. They are no longer sure. That plays to the advantage of the liar because doubt has been instilled in their mind. In short, liars count on uncertainty—it mitigates the damage done. Why do people not trust their senses? Why are they unsure even when the facts are stacked against the liars? There have been plenty of psychological studies done on groupthink. Solomon Asch learned in the 1950s that group size has a significant impact on our tendency to conform. His experiments showed that approximately a third of the people are inclined to doubt their own conclusions if surrounded mostly by people who have reached a different conclusion. Conformity triumphs over truth. Daniel Kahneman found that groupthink occurs when people are presented with a perspective that is contrary to theirs and they buckle. Why don’t they standfast? They want to avoid conflict. Their desire for harmony overrides their willingness to express an independent thought. This is the psychological variant of the political reality found in Washington D.C. 'If you want to get along, go along.' The price that people pay for suppressing their conscience is evidently worth it. They reason that when in doubt, go with the flow. Unfortunately, this plays into the hands of those who intentionally seek to distort the truth—their goal is to escape the consequences of their lies. Regrettably, having succeeded in blunting the worst outcome, they are inspired to continue lying. They can always count on the doubters. The Communists in the last century liked to hold elections—even though they meant nothing—because they wanted to forge a sense of unity. They believed that if the people went through the motions and voted, it would convince them that they have a say in government. For some, it worked. Elite decision-makers in the democracies also want to get the masses onboard, so when their lies are challenged, they double-down with more lies. By planting the seeds of doubt, they can’t be held accountable. To lie is not to make a mistake. We mistakenly say something when we don’t have all the facts. To lie presumes we know the truth and choose not to acknowledge it. It’s even more diabolical when it is done to manipulate the public for self-serving purposes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWely30ZI1KAvZwYJfkpHXD_	2024-11-12T08:34:27-08:00	
Bangladesh’s New Path Toward Sovereignty – OpEd	In recent years, the political landscape of South Asia has been marked by significant changes, with Bangladesh emerging as a focal point of regional dynamics. The discontent within Bangladesh regarding its previous government's perceived alignment with Indian interests has catalyzed a shift in alliances, fostering a desire for greater autonomy and justice. Bangladesh's quest to redefine its regional standing and enhance cooperation with countries like Pakistan signifies a transformative period, where historical grievances and demands for political reform are coming to the forefront of national discourse. For over a decade, Sheikh Hasina Wajid's government maintained a close relationship with India, often criticized as compromising Bangladesh’s national sovereignty. Allegations of human rights violations, including accusations of genocide and extrajudicial killings, have plagued her administration. With around 170 FIRs filed against her, the legal challenges faced by Sheikh Hasina have become a symbol of the broader struggle for justice in Bangladesh. The arrest of several close associates, coupled with the freezing of her family's financial accounts by the interim government, highlights the growing public discontent over the extensive influence exerted by India during her tenure. Many Bangladeshis view these measures as necessary steps toward restoring national integrity and addressing corruption rooted in foreign manipulation. The invitation extended by the interim government of Bangladesh to a fact-finding team from the United Nations Commission for Human Rights (UNCHR) is a pivotal move, signaling a commitment to transparency and justice. The UNCHR's independent investigation into alleged human rights abuses under the Indian-backed regime of Sheikh Hasina has been widely welcomed by the Bangladeshi populace. For many citizens, this represents an opportunity to expose the authoritarian tendencies of the previous administration and to shed light on the extent of external influence that dictated domestic policies. The public’s endorsement of this investigation reflects a broader societal desire for justice and a clear departure from the previous government's oppressive tactics. In a bold legislative move, the interim government of Bangladesh has abolished laws that previously provided additional security to the Mujib family, a decision seen as a stride toward genuine political reform. These reforms have been applauded by the public, who criticize the prior administration’s reliance on Indian support to maintain power, often at the expense of addressing the real needs of the people. Additionally, calls for constitutional reforms, including a potential ban on political parties implicated in human rights violations, have gained traction, signaling a turning point in the country’s political landscape. A significant development in the quest for autonomy was marked by the inauguration of the Bangladesh Army Selection Board at Army Headquarters on October 6, 2024. The event, led by Chief Advisor Yunus, emphasized the increasing cooperation between the military and the interim government. It underscored the military’s renewed commitment to asserting its independence and distancing itself from previous external influences, particularly those of India. This shift reflects a growing sense of national pride and a determination to prioritize Bangladesh’s interests above foreign pressures. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, the son of Sheikh Hasina Wajid, has found himself embroiled in serious allegations, prompting him to seek the assistance of a U.S. lobbying firm, Stryk Global Diplomacy. His decision to engage such services indicates a strategic attempt to influence U.S. policymakers and mitigate the political fallout from his actions. This maneuver illustrates the lengths to which individuals from the former regime are willing to go to maintain a favorable image on the international stage, despite growing domestic discontent. The diplomatic strain between India and Bangladesh has become increasingly apparent. India’s unilateral approach was highlighted during the 79th United Nations General Assembly, where it expressed regret over Bangladesh’s request for a bilateral meeting between the Chief Advisor Yunus and Prime Minister Modi. This incident underscored India’s reluctance to engage collaboratively with its neighbors, raising concerns about the sustainability of its regional diplomacy. Bangladesh's decision to recall its envoy from New Delhi was a stark demonstration of its frustration with India’s perceived interference in its internal affairs, signifying a broader diplomatic rift. India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), heavily influenced by its Hindutva ideology, has been accused of attempting to manipulate Bangladesh’s political dynamics in favor of the Awami League. Such actions have further strained relations between the two nations, with Bangladesh voicing strong protests against inflammatory comments made by Indian officials regarding Bangladeshi nationals. This reaction from Bangladesh signals a growing commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty and resisting external pressures. Amid these tensions, Bangladesh and Pakistan have taken steps to rebuild their bilateral relationship, moving beyond past conflicts. During the 79th United Nations General Assembly, a meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief Advisor Yunus highlighted the potential for renewed cooperation, particularly in the context of reviving the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The mutual endorsement of SAARC’s revival by both nations, along with support from Nepal, reflects a shared vision for enhanced regional collaboration and economic integration. In a positive move to facilitate trade, Bangladesh’s National Board of Revenue has lifted the requirement for 100% physical inspection of goods imported from Pakistan. This decision is expected to streamline trade operations and strengthen economic ties between the two countries. Furthermore, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has actively encouraged its students to explore educational opportunities in Pakistan, reflecting a renewed emphasis on fostering people-to-people connections. Looking ahead, diplomatic engagements are set to continue, with a high-level visit by a Chinese delegate, WuZ, to Pakistan scheduled for the last week of November 2024. Additionally, a constructive meeting between the Pakistani High Commissioner and the Bangladesh Foreign Secretary has laid the groundwork for an early Foreign Secretary-level dialogue, anticipated to take place in late November. These efforts indicate a shared commitment to overcoming historical grievances and working toward a more cooperative future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWely30ZI1KAvfLJPAPE1F9h	2024-11-12T08:32:54-08:00	
Rethinking Pakistan’s 1973 Constitution: A Threat To Unity – OpEd	The Constitution of 1973 was conceived as a symbol of optimism for Pakistan, with the objective of guaranteeing the fulfillment of every citizen's needs and ensuring the impeccable governance of the state. Nevertheless, over the years, what was designed to be a resilient framework for governance has, regrettably, established a foundation for the infringement of citizens' rights and ensuing political turmoil. Pakistan continues to be ensnared in a difficulty from which it has found it exceedingly challenging to extricate itself. Should one endeavour to identify the deficiencies, it would be hard to discover a starting point. Nonetheless, several of the most pivotal concerns that have undermined the state's foundation encompass the Senate’s impotence, the problematic integration of the legislative and executive branches, and the persistent ambiguity regarding whether Pakistan constitutes a theocratic or secular state. A prominent concern regarding the 1973 Constitution is the Senate's lack of authority. In a heterogeneous nation such as Pakistan, the Senate ought to function as a vital institution that safeguards minority rights and mitigates feelings of 'us versus them.' Regrettably, the Senate of Pakistan is incapacitated. The indirect election of its members results in the Senate failing to genuinely reflect the popular will. Instead, the political consensus among these members frequently serves the interests of a select few rather than the broader electorate. This situation has significant ramifications, especially when agreements established with other nations are not ratified by the Senate, thereby effectively muting minority voices within their own territories. Compounding this issue, the practice of joint sittings in Parliament constitutes an obvious transgression of the rights of smaller factions, thereby exacerbating the dynamics of 'in-groups and out-groups.' This political disarray is further exacerbated by the executive’s disregard for Senate ratification in critical organizational appointments, culminating in bias and controversy, exemplified by the recent contention surrounding the PML (N)’s rejection of Justice Umar Ata Bandial’s adjudication. Further complicating the situation is the amalgamation of the legislative and executive branches, which has derailed Pakistan’s political framework. Despite being a multiethnic state, Pakistan has adopted a parliamentary system of governance that is inadequately suited for such diversity. The 'Contempt of Parliament Bill 2023' and modifications to the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) powers serve as salient examples of legislation aimed at consolidating control. This centralization of power within a singular political party also diminishes patriotism among minorities, who increasingly perceive themselves as marginalized from the political arena. Another crucial concern arising from the 1973 Constitution is the ambiguity regarding Pakistan's classification as either a theocratic or a secular state. This ambiguity has engendered extensive repercussions, particularly in the process of selecting members for the Islamic Advisory Council. The appointment of these members is executed by the President upon the counsel of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The representation of all sectarian factions within this council is not guaranteed, resulting in the marginalization of specific communities. This situation exerts a considerable impact on the legislative process, effectively denying certain groups their religious or civil rights. The 1973 Constitution, transcending its mere status as a document, was intended to serve as the bedrock upon which the state of Pakistan could thrive and prosper. However, a fragile foundation is inherently incapable of sustaining itself over time. As time progresses, it becomes increasingly imperative for Pakistan to confront the deficiencies inherent in its Constitution. The Senate must be endowed with the authority to authentically reflect the populace's will, the merger of the legislative and executive branches necessitates re-evaluation, and the ambiguity surrounding Pakistan's identity as either a theocratic or secular state must be elucidated. Only through these measures can Pakistan aspire to extricate itself from its current predicament and advance towards a more stable and prosperous future. References Khan, A. (2010).

Pakistan: A Blueprint For Gilgit-Baltistan’s Untapped Potential –...	The rugged beauty of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), often called the 'Crown of Pakistan,' has long captivated those fortunate enough to glimpse its stunning landscapes. But for decades, this scenic region has languished on the margins of national development. Now, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership, a decisive shift is underway—one that could chart a course for Gilgit-Baltistan’s transformation into a regional powerhouse of infrastructure, energy, education, and economic opportunity. Prime Minister Sharif’s recent visit to the region was more than a ceremonial gesture. It marked the launch of a new era for GB, as the federal government sets its sights on addressing the region’s chronic underdevelopment. In a series of high-profile announcements, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stones for a raft of large-scale projects that promise to reshape GB’s economic future—from energy and infrastructure to tourism and education. These initiatives represent a long-overdue effort to harness the region's immense potential, not just for its residents, but for the country as a whole. At the core of PM Sharif’s vision for Gilgit-Baltistan is a fundamental belief: infrastructure and energy capacity are the key to unlocking its full potential. For too long, the region has been hobbled by a lack of modern infrastructure, energy shortfalls, and limited access to education. But the government’s ambitious new investments aim to change that. Roads, bridges, and digital connectivity are now at the heart of a national development agenda that could propel GB into a new era of prosperity. One of the most significant aspects of the Prime Minister’s visit was the announcement of two major hydropower projects. These initiatives will add critical capacity to the region’s power grid, addressing the perennial energy shortages that have plagued the area for years. Additionally, the Prime Minister revealed plans for a 100-megawatt solar project, set to be completed within the year. These steps are not just about meeting local energy demands—they are investments in the long-term sustainability of the region’s growth, creating a robust energy infrastructure capable of supporting industrial and economic expansion for decades to come. Equally vital to GB’s future is its road and transport infrastructure. In a region as geographically challenging as GB, effective roads and highways are essential to connect communities, facilitate trade, and unlock the area’s tourism potential. During his visit, Sharif highlighted the critical role tourism will play in GB’s development, stressing that the region’s unmatched natural beauty and cultural richness must be leveraged to attract both domestic and international visitors. A seamless transport network will not only make tourism more accessible but will also stimulate broader economic activity by facilitating the movement of goods and services. Perhaps the most transformative aspect of Sharif’s visit was the announcement of a new Technical University in GB, aimed at giving the region’s youth the tools to succeed in a rapidly changing world. Alongside this, a Rs 1 billion endowment fund for students at Baltistan University and Karakorum University underscores the government’s commitment to higher education in the region. With education, particularly in technical fields, becoming an essential component of the global economy, this initiative promises to equip young people in GB with the skills they need to thrive. Education, of course, is not limited to the classroom. The federal government’s efforts to bring GB into the digital age are equally noteworthy. The ongoing SFiber Project, which will lay 950 kilometers of optical fiber cable across the region, is a game-changing initiative that will bring high-speed internet to more than 15,000 customers. This connectivity is crucial for expanding educational opportunities, fostering innovation, and enabling young people to engage in the growing global digital economy. Further enhancing this digital push, the government is establishing Software Technology Parks and Freelancing Hubs to help local youth tap into the booming online freelancing market. Beyond these concrete projects, Sharif’s visit was also a gesture of solidarity with the people of Gilgit-Baltistan, who have long endured both natural and man-made hardships. In Ghizer, where devastating floods displaced thousands in 2022, the Prime Minister personally oversaw recovery efforts, highlighting the government’s commitment to disaster management and humanitarian support. His visit to the area underscored a compassionate, people-centered approach to governance, with survivors like young Qandeel receiving both practical and financial assistance as part of the ongoing rehabilitation efforts. The government’s investment in Gilgit-Baltistan is not limited to infrastructure and education. Healthcare, too, is a priority, with new projects such as the 50-bed cardiac hospital, a 250-bed facility in Skardu, and the 16 MW Naltar Power Project all set to address pressing needs in the region. The approval of Rs 56 billion in new projects by the Gilgit-Baltistan Development Working Party reflects the scale of the federal government’s commitment to the region’s long-term growth and well-being. Perhaps most promising, however, is the emphasis on local empowerment and participation. By investing in key sectors like energy, education, and infrastructure, the government is not only fostering self-sufficiency but also ensuring that Gilgit-Baltistan is integrated into Pakistan’s broader economic framework. Whether through tourism, IT, or renewable energy, the region’s economy is being woven into the national fabric in ways that will enable sustainable growth for generations to come. In a geopolitical context, PM Sharif’s visit was also a firm statement of national unity. By focusing on development in this strategically sensitive region, Islamabad is reinforcing its commitment to the territorial integrity of Pakistan. It sends a clear message to those seeking to destabilize the region that the federal government is invested in its future—and will not allow outside forces to dictate the trajectory of its development. For too long, Gilgit-Baltistan has been held back by political marginalization and underinvestment. But the federal government’s recent initiatives offer a hopeful glimpse into the future. As PM Sharif remarked during his visit, the people of Gilgit-Baltistan have long displayed resilience, strength, and patriotism in the face of adversity. Now, with the full backing of the federal government, the region has the opportunity to realize its dreams of economic growth and prosperity. Gilgit-Baltistan stands at the precipice of a new era. With sustained investment and commitment from Islamabad, it could soon serve as a model of regional development—a beacon of hope not only for Pakistan but for the broader South Asian region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWely30ZI1KAvVSiVSsutqPh	2024-11-12T08:29:49-08:00	
Significance Of Mombasa Port For Chinese Outreach In Africa – Ana...	By Shreyansh Krishna and Sayantan Haldar Africa has emerged as a pivotal partner in China’s Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI), the maritime dimension of Beijing’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). One of the key footholds for Chinese inroads has been the Mombasa Port, located on Kenya’s south-eastern coast. Mombasa—the largest and busiest port in East Africa—serves as a gateway for landlocked countries in Africa and is central to regional trade. Thus, it is imperative to examine how the port serves as a crucial node in China’s engagement with Africa and reflect on China’s broader geopolitical ambitions in the Western Indian Ocean. Africa's strategic value to the Maritime Silk Road Initiative Africa’s strategic importance to the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) stems from its location along critical maritime routes and its wealth of resources. Ports on the Indian Ocean and East African coasts, such as those in Mombasa and Djibouti, provide China access to vital sea lanes, facilitating the movement of goods between Asia, Africa, and Europe. Africa's vast natural resources are crucial to China’s resource security, ensuring a stable supply of raw materials for its industries. Additionally, Africa’s growing consumer markets have emerged as critical for Chinese investment. According to estimates, African markets received 5.1 percent of China’s total exports in 2023. Geopolitically, China seeks to counterbalance Western influence by securing long-term infrastructure partnerships across Africa. These relationships strengthen the Chinese foothold in global trade while fostering economic dependencies that support its broader geopolitical ambitions. This ensures that China maintains its dominance in key supply chains and emerging markets across the continent​. Initially, China’s engagement in Africa was welcomed, symbolised by historic projects like the Tan-Zam Railway. However, modern relations have become more complicated. As Chinese companies expand their presence, friction has grown due to concerns about subpar projects, a lack of local economic benefits, and fears of neo-colonialism. This has resulted in rising anti-Chinese sentiment, particularly in democratic countries like Kenya and South Africa, where protests highlight dissatisfaction with Chinese labour practices and capital investment. Kenya-China relations: A strategic gateway to East Africa Kenya, a gateway to East Africa and one of the continent’s largest economies serves as an excellent platform for China to broaden its reach into the rest of Africa. The country’s engagement with China exemplifies Beijing's approach to economic diplomacy on the continent, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Since 2005, Kenya’s foreign policy has shifted towards a 'Look East' framework, emphasising the expansion of Chinese loans and Chinese-operated infrastructure projects as alternatives to Western investments. China has become Kenya’s largest trading partner, and although Kenya’s exports of tea, coffee, herbs, and avocados have gained increasing traction among Chinese consumers, the trade deficit was at US$ 9.39 billion in 2023, more than half of which is due to the significant investment, trade deals, and developmental assistance it receives from China. A key example of China’s influence in Kenya is the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), a flagship BRI project aimed at addressing Kenya’s infrastructure needs by connecting Mombasa to Nairobi. The Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of China financed 90 percent of the project, with the Kenyan Government contributing the remaining 10 percent, and the China Road and Bridge Corporation led the construction. The SGR created30,000 jobs for locals and transported 5.4 million passengers and 1.3 million TEUs of shipments in its first year. However, despite these accomplishments, the project has faced challenges, with many young Kenyans expressing dissatisfaction with low-paying, unskilled jobs. Moreover, the SGR has operated at a loss since its inception, accumulating over US$ 200 million in losses since May 2020. Mombasa port: A geopolitical anchor in East Africa Served by the naturally existing Kilindini Harbour, Mombasa is a vital gateway for trade in East Africa and the world at large, connecting landlocked nations in the region to international markets. It is a crucial driver of economic growth, revenue generation, and job creation. It fosters regional integration, promotes cooperation among neighbouring countries, and contributes to the stability of the region. As a result, Mombasa holds immense importance in the context of global power competition in Africa. Mombasa’s strategic location allows China to secure maritime routes and extend its naval reach, reinforcing its economic and military leverage in the region. The port enhances China’s influence in East Africa, enabling Beijing to strengthen its position in global maritime trade and logistics. China's heavy investment in the port, along with related infrastructure projects, like the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), ensures its long-term presence in the region. This presence helps solidify its geopolitical goals, including increasing its military access and economic leverage in the region, thus, positioning Mombasa as a cornerstone of China’s broader influence in Africa. Building multimodal connectivity across Africa The MSR is driving the development of multimodal connectivity across Africa, linking sea, rail, and road networks to create more efficient trade routes that connect African markets to global supply chains. A key example of this is the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor project, which aims to reduce the overdependence on Mombasa. Under this project, new infrastructure, like the Lamu Port, is being developed and linked to major East African nations. While an oil pipeline is planned, alternative routes through Tanzania or Ethiopia are considered more viable. These developments align with China’s goal of establishing efficient transport networks under the MSR to ensure a smoother movement of goods from African ports to inland markets. Figure 1: The Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport Corridor Project. Source: Wiley Online Library Security and strategy in China’s engagement with African ports China's engagement with African ports is strategically focused on key regions like East Africa, the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa, where ports such as Djibouti, Mombasa, and Dar es Salaam provide access to major maritime routes in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, vital for global trade and energy security. China's investments in African ports often have dual-use potential, serving both economic and military functions. While these ports are framed as commercial projects, many have additional functions, supporting not just economic activities but the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) as well, enhancing China’s naval reach and allowing it to project military power to secure its maritime interests. This is especially seen in Djibouti, the location of China’s first overseas military base, strategically located in a country that has proximity to major shipping lanes. Additionally, China often employs a debt-for-infrastructure model, providing large loans for port development. This model raises concerns about the risks of 'debt-trap diplomacy' in Africa, similar to what was seen in Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port. Projects like the LAPSSET align with China’s goal of establishing efficient trade routes across Africa. However, any country should be cautious while navigating the balance between economic growth and safeguarding their financial sovereignty, drawing lessons from Sri Lanka’s experience.

How Property Taxes Can Help Low-Income Countries To Develop – Ana...	The world’s governments must raise an additional $3 trillion to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth goals this decade. The cost in emerging markets equals 4 percent of gross domestic product—and 16 percent for low-income countries. How can countries finance such staggering price tags? Large cities such as Delhi and Lagos show a way forward: Taxing property more efficiently can play a meaningful role in raising revenue at the local level, allowing countries to invest more in their people, new IMF analysis shows. Previous IMF research has shown that countries have ample potential to raise more domestic tax revenue if they need it—up to 5 percentage points of GDP over two decades. Of course, the political challenges of such reforms are far from trivial, as recent events in several countries suggest that raising taxes can create social unrest. More efficient real estate taxes have an advantage in this regard: by being locally collected and spent, they may be politically less challenging than increases in broad-base national taxes. Recurrent taxes on immovable property could help local governments capture the wealth generated through construction-intensive urbanization. Generating such revenue fairly is especially important given the difficulty in developing countries of taxing income and wealth, which can be highly mobile. The appeal of property taxes is clear when we look at revenue raised in advanced economies: more than 1 percent of GDP on average in OECD countries, and nearly 3 percent in some advanced economies. By contrast, they raise only around 0.1 percent of GDP in emerging Asia and Africa. Achieving such a large growth requires improving property-tax coverage and addressing the capacity challenges in valuing real estate as ways to reverse the current revenue underperformance. New property identification technologies and simplified valuation methods have become widely available. With policy reforms and better technology, recurrent property tax revenues in developing countries should be at least 10 times higher than current levels. Local revenue and spending When well designed, property taxes become a reliable and progressive form of municipal financing. They enhance the accountability of local governments, since proceeds can be used to fund better local public services, and taxes the increase in wealth of those who own real estate that has appreciated due to urbanization and associated public-infrastructure development. The tight link at the local level between revenue and spending shields property taxes from national politics and imposes higher accountability standards on local councils for the effective use of the resources. National legislation should regulate how much property taxes can differ across a country, limiting divergences in the level of local public services funded by this source. Municipalities should limit exemptions to a narrow range of public organizations, and forgone revenues should be regularly reported. The impact on 'asset-rich but cash-poor' households such as pensioners can be softened by deferring taxes until the property is sold, at which point full payment is due. Satellites and drones It’s best to take a gradual approach to property-tax reform, using modern technology to broaden the coverage of area-based taxes (expressed as a fixed rate per square meter). The goal should be to transition to full value-based property taxes in coming years as countries gain experience in implementation and market price information is meticulously recorded for periodic property valuation. Modern mapping technology, such as satellite imagery and aerial photography by drones, can be used to fast-track the expansion and coverage of property taxes to all parcels that ought to be included in the fiscal register. Indian officials in Delhi and the greater Bangalore metropolitan area have started using satellite imagery to map properties in a geographic information system. In Africa, several municipalities have made impressive strides. Lagos increased tax collection fivefold to more than $1 billion in 2011 by broadening the base of its property tax, coupled with better enforcement. The increased precision of satellite images enables the accurate measuring of surface areas and the development of fiscal-register maps that depict buildings and their alterations. This allows the fast roll-out of an area-based property tax until valuation capacity has advanced to migrate toward a market value-based property-tax system that can raise more revenue. Demand for capacity development from the IMF in this area indicates that many countries are seeing the benefits from this combination of the right policies and technology enablers. It makes property-tax reform effective and politically appealing, especially when its objectives are communicated properly to the public.

China Slides Open Economic And Diplomatic Doors With Visa-Free Tr...	By Songshan (Sam) Huang Since the introduction of visa exemptions in late 2023, foreign tourist arrivals in China have surged. China’s visa-free policies include mutual exemptions, unilateral waivers to select nations and a 144-hour visa-free transit policy. These policies not only reduce time and financial costs for travellers, but also enhance the perceived value of a stopover in China. In the first seven months of 2024, 17.254 million foreign tourists visited the country, marking a staggering 129.9 per cent increase compared to 2023. While these numbers are a positive indicator of China’s reopening and attractiveness as a destination, they also point to broader implications for China and the global community. The spike in inbound tourism could enhance diplomatic relations and foster mutual understanding in an increasingly polarised world. Increased inbound tourism is a boon for China’s slowing economy. With the World Bank projecting China’s GDP growth at a modest 4.8 per cent for 2024, the country faces the need for structural reforms to sustain its economic trajectory. Attracting international tourist spending on accommodations, dining, transportation and attractions provides a much-needed stimulus. This influx represents a net input into China’s economy, triggering a multiplier effect across the tourism supply chain while generating jobs, particularly for Chinese youth facing high unemployment. Beyond immediate revenue generation, foreign tourists’ spending can stimulate broader economic dynamism, helping to offset domestic demand shortfalls. But relying on tourism as an economic solution comes with risks. As the global economy remains unpredictable, fluctuations in international travel, geopolitical tensions and potential health crises could all undermine this source of growth. China must approach its tourism strategy with a broader long-term economic vision. China’s visa-free policies could also be interpreted as a strategic diplomatic tool — what some might call ‘soft power’ or ‘smart diplomacy’. By easing travel barriers, China encourages more visitors to experience the country firsthand, countering negative narratives shaped by Western media. The growing trend of international bloggers and social media influencers showcasing China is invaluable. These influencers, often regarded as more credible and relatable than official marketing campaigns, may have been reshaping global perceptions of China, particularly among younger Western audiences. Western media often emphasises isolated incidents involving foreign tourists’ safety, such as the stabbing of four US teachers in Northeast China. Social media influencers provide a more authentic view of China’s social realities, sharing firsthand experiences of the country’s cultural heritage, modern lifestyle, impressive transport infrastructure and urban development. In an era of heightened global polarisation, the role of tourism in fostering people-to-people exchanges cannot be understated. China’s reaffirmation of its open-door policy at the third plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party’s 20th Central Committee in July 2024, highlights the country’s commitment to facilitating cultural diplomacy. Amid rising trade protectionism and geopolitical friction, visa-free travel becomes an extension of China’s broader foreign policy, aligning with initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative. The hope is that increased intercultural exposure will cultivate understanding, reduce misconceptions and ultimately contribute to global peace and cooperation. But the potential pitfalls of tourism must also be managed. Overtourism — when tourists overwhelm local infrastructure and resources — is a global concern, with cities like Barcelona offering cautionary tales. China could face similar issues, especially in popular tourist destinations where both inter-regional domestic and foreign tourists strain local resources. Some Chinese cities are already advising residents to stay home during peak tourism periods to accommodate the influx of visitors. In Chongqing, local residents are urged by the municipal tourism authority to avoid popular tourist attractions during public holidays. Such measures, though pragmatic, can foster resentment among locals who feel displaced in their own communities. Tourists also compete with residents for public services, transportation and access to amenities which may exacerbate social tensions if locals perceive their living standards are compromised. China must be proactive in balancing the needs of its residents with the benefits brought by foreign tourists. Failure to do so could lead to rising tensions and diminish the potential gains of its visa-free policies. Lessons from around the world indicate that careful urban planning, infrastructure development and equitable resource distribution are critical to avoiding the pitfalls of overtourism. China’s continuation of its visa-free policies is likely, given the economic and diplomatic advantages. But caution is essential. As the country navigates high unemployment and slower economic growth, the government must carefully manage the distribution of tourism benefits to ensure local communities are not left behind. Tourism should not exacerbate existing social inequalities but rather serve as a catalyst for mutual understanding and shared prosperity. To sustain the growth of inbound tourism, authorities and operators should continue enhancing travel convenience and quality for foreign tourists. It is also important to regularly review visa-free policies for certain countries, monitor visitor flows and make necessary adjustments. Overseas Chinese represent a significant market for China’s inbound tourism and policymakers could explore strategies beyond visa exemptions to encourage their visits. While China’s visa exemptions have undoubtedly spurred an influx of foreign tourists and bolstered its economic and diplomatic goals, managing this growth is essential to its sustainability. Balancing the benefits of tourism with the well-being of local residents will be key to maintaining both domestic harmony and China’s global image as a welcoming, open nation.

The Trump Tariff Fallacy: Bringing The Corporations Back To The U...	Donald Trump’s massive victory in the recent US presidential election has raised the possibility that tariffs will once again be used, only this time just not against goods from China. With trade deficits between many Asian countries and the United States, there are possibilities many countries may be targeted if Trump’s objectives are to reduce bilateral deficits. This could affect close allies of the US, including South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Trumps plan during the campaign was to increase tariffs on goods coming into the US by 10-20 percent. China maybe hit with a 60 percent tariff. This could flow onto global supply chains as globalism has connected world economies. Such tariffs are potentially inflationary and recessionary Many of the goods imported into the US are made by US corporations in China. Of the USD 551 billion from China to the United States in 2022, a substantial portion is from US companies shipping inputs for assembly in China. Another 20 percent are OEM products produced for US corporations. The tariffs are not paid by China. They are either absorbed by US corporations, which reduces profits, or passed onto consumers who pay higher prices for goods, which adds to inflation. According to estimates made by JP Morgan Chase, the tariffs will cost the American family around USD 1,000 per year, and dampen demand after they are implemented. Share prices of other US retailers could fall, like they did back in 2019, when Trump imposed tariffs on China. The only thing that will hurt China is a reduction in demand for goods bound for the US, which would add to slowing economic activity, thus reducing some employment. Trump’s tariffs may put pressure on companies exporting to the US from China to return to the US, or relocate to third countries. This is something that has been already happening due to rising Chinese labor rates. The consequence of continuing this action is more retaliation from China, a drop in worldwide aggregate demand and a recession which will hurt the United States, corporations and everyone else. The real problem is decades old Between 1990 and 2017 US corporations invested more than US$250 billion into China. Initial investments didn’t go that smoothly. Chinese authorities later eased the processes required for foreign investors, opened special economic zones and partly opened the domestic market, bringing US corporations in droves. US corporations moved to China for lower labor and operational costs and manufacture under less stringent regulatory regimes, increasing corporate profits immensely. There was also the expectation that US companies would be able to enter the quickly-growing Chinese domestic market, as demand in the US has already matured. As a result, manufacturing jobs dried up in the US. The promise of better jobs didn’t materialize. Only low-paid menial service, warehouse and retail jobs became available, which had absolutely no career paths. Those jobs were for the lucky ones, as many became unemployed. The middle class began to shrink, as did purchasing power and the tax base. Eventually a trade imbalance between China and the US occurred, partly brought about by US products, which now became imports. Corporations made higher profits for their shareholders at the cost of a loyal workforce that became redundant. A generation of manufacturing skills was just discarded, along with cities and towns that once housed the manufacturing facilities of these corporations. Many of these factories became warehouses and condominiums, ironically bought up by Chinese, which inflated the housing market. After more than 35 years of capital and production capacity flight, China is now a manufacturing economy and the US is not. US manufacturing has declined to around 11.5 percent of GDP against 40 percent post WWII. The general economic lull in the United States that existed before the last election, which helped give Trump the support base he needed to win the presidency, maybe exacerbated by any tariff hikes. This will hurt the people who had hope in Trump and elected him. The problem isn’t China. Trump didn’t cause it either. He inherited the problem from successive presidential administrations. The problem was caused by the corporations which abandoned US production, and workers who were also their customers, lured by the promise of lower costs, higher profits and entry into the Chinese market. Trump was elected to save and create jobs. To his constituency, ‘make America great again’ is about reacquiring traditional manufacturing jobs. However, corporations are blocked from returning from manufacturing offshore because of the high profits they are making and higher production costs they would incur if the company returned to US production. The levels of profits the corporations now enjoy can’t be made manufacturing in the United States. Bringing back the corporations Trump is calling on US corporations to leave China and comeback to the United States. He does have executive powers to force them, but this would be politically untenable. Working through a multi-layered constitutional democracy such as the United States would almost be impossible to garner strong and committed bi-partisan support to bring the corporations back. Tariffs appear as the easy alternative. Even if US corporations returned, the financial costs would be high. Companies would have to rebuild manufacturing facilities, recreate supply networks where local suppliers may no longer exist, and regenerate the community environments to house their workforce. This would be one of the most ambitious projects the United States has engaged in, something along the mammoth scale of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Extensive city re-planning would be necessary. Infrastructure built. Communities re-nurtured. The US Government would most certainly have to adopt a regime of incentives something akin to what South East Asian Governments are giving investors, something unprecedented in the US. This would most likely need to be accompanied with a tax scheme where companies manufacturing in the US would pay a lower tax than companies importing their products to factor in differential labor costs. Has the horse already bolted? This is the reality the United States must now live with. Now the US must learn how to accommodate China diplomatically and economically, completely outside the military paradigm. Unlike the Cold War, which was about military supremacy, this one is about trade. China and the US, economic relations with China must be based on the reality of mutual co-existence and avenues of cooperation. This would be a complete reversal in US policy thinking. A so-called trade war with a nation that the US have heavy investments in is nonsensical. There is the potential that US firms could be hurt in China. The interdependency between the Chinese and US economies needs to be recognized and reflected in policy. US foreign policy over the first 12 months of the upcoming Trump presidency looks like being trade based. An American envoy may be calling of Asian states in the new year, looking for trade concessions to rebalance what Trump sees is a problem.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4rVeiPtDcMc_	2024-11-11T16:55:34-08:00	
Shift In Boko Haram Tactics Requires Security Forces To Adapt – A...	Months of battlefield losses and hundreds of defections appeared to weaken Boko Haram, but it has not stopped the extremists from continuing to terrorize the Lake Chad Basin. Experts say that because the group has shown an alarming ability to reorganize and adapt its tactics, security forces must be just as flexible and resilient. Encompassing parts of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, the Lake Chad Basin has proved to be a troublesome theater with its many swamps and islands. All four countries contribute troops to the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) that recently concluded Operation Lake Sanity 2, which dismantled several terrorist hideouts. 'The [operation] resulted in the neutralization of numerous Boko Haram terrorist combatants, the successful rescue of several hostages, and the capture of arms and ammunition,' the MNJTF said in a statement on October 26, 2024. Remadji Hoinathy and Célestin Delanga, researchers with the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies, said that security forces must anticipate the terrorist group’s next pivot. 'Operation Lake Sanity has had some success against Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin, but the insurgents will soon adapt to the new military tactics,' they wrote in a September 16, 2024, article. 'To sustain the gains made, the Multinational Joint Task Force leading the operation must stay ahead of these dynamics.' After MNJTF operations, militants fled into peripheral areas, where they attacked civilians and increasingly used suicide bombers and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). 'The use of vehicle-borne IEDs and those buried in the ground poses a grave risk for security forces and calls for demining operations and technologies like mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles,' the researchers wrote. 'Boko Haram’s use of IEDs and suicide attacks propagates fear and disrupts both community cohesion and military efforts. These tactics must be tackled head-on to prevent a resurgence and return of the terrorist factions.' In its October 26, 2024, news release, the MNJTF said it 'is actively engaged in stabilizing the area, providing genuine protection to civilians, and creating conditions conducive to sustainable peace and development.' The next day, however, Boko Haram showed it still can muster the strength for large-scale attacks. On October 27, about 300 Boko Haram fighters stormed a Chadian military base on an island called Barkaram, 5 kilometers from the border with Nigeria. The militants killed at least 40 Soldiers and their commander, seized weapons, and burned vehicles equipped with heavy arms. Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Déby somberly assessed the damage the day after the attack and promised retribution. 'I have decided to launch Operation Haskanite to avenge our [Soldiers],' he said in a government video. 'I would like to reassure the Chadian people that we will hunt down these lunatics. We will track them down to their last base.' Found in the Lake Chad area and in surrounding deserts, Haskanite is a local plant known for its strength and resiliency. With another large military operation imminent in the Lake Chad region, Hoinathy and Delanga said Chad’s neighbors and the MNJTF should focus on the ways in which Boko Haram militants adapt their tactics and break into smaller groups. While acknowledging that large, coordinated military efforts can achieve many objectives, the researchers also called for security forces to improve their capacity for monitoring peripheral areas. 'This should include regular operations by combined forces from Lake Chad Basin countries to prevent Boko Haram from redeploying its fighters to these areas. This strategy would preserve the stability achieved in certain localities and avoid pressure from new waves of people who have been forcibly displaced,' the researchers wrote. Providing more police and government presence in the areas surrounding Lake Chad also would help to counter security threats and build trust with communities. Nonkinetic approaches are needed as well, including humanitarian and economic assistance for those affected by violence. 'Engaging with local communities in these areas will enable intelligence gathering and create a united front against the insurgents,' they wrote. 'Existing community development efforts as part of the Lake Chad Basin Commission’s regional stabilization strategy should be ramped up, including civil-military actions by the MNJTF.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4soUOrk3WyH_	2024-11-11T16:53:50-08:00	
Ron Paul: Make Money Free Again – OpEd	Two days after Donald Trump became the first American since Grover Cleveland to win nonconsecutive presidential elections, the Federal Reserve announced a quarter percent cut in interest rates. Following this announcement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a press conference where he said that he would not comply with any presidential request that he step down before his term ends in May of 2026. Powell claimed that the president lacks the legal authority to fire the Fed chairman. So, if President Trump tells Chairman Powell 'you’re fired,' Powell could bring suit asking a court to review Trump’s action. President Trump and Chairman Powell are at odds over President Trump’s desire to require the Federal Reserve to consult with the president before changing interest rates or taking other significant actions. Powell is likely to do all he can to convince Congress to reject any legislation giving the president any type of official role in setting monetary policy. After all, Chairman Powell is so protective of Fed autonomy that he opposes auditing the Fed on the grounds that it could threaten the Fed’s independence, even though there is nothing in the Audit the Fed legislation giving the president or Congress any new authority over the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy. Requiring the Fed to consult with the president regarding monetary policy would likely increase price inflation and dollar devaluation. Politicians usually like low interest rates because they associate low rates with economic growth. Politicians also want the Fed to keep rates low so the federal government can keep racking up huge amounts of debt. Without a central bank that is ready, willing, and able to monetize the federal debt, the welfare-warfare state would not exist. Despite the claims of Chairman Powell and other central bank apologists, the Fed has never been free of political pressure. Presidents were trying to influence the Federal Reserve long before Donald Trump began posting 'mean tweets' about Jerome Powell. Requiring the Fed to consult with the president would at least make the president’s efforts to influence monetary policy open and transparent. President Trump and other Fed critics such as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren think they are more capable of determining the 'correct' interest rate than the Fed. This ignores the fact that interest rates are the price of money and like all prices are shaped by a variety of constantly changing factors. When the Fed manipulates interest rates, it distorts the signals sent to investors. The result is the boom- bust business cycle. The fiat system is also responsible for rising income inequality and the decline of the dollar’s purchasing power, which has lowered most Americans’ standard of living. President Trump should work to eliminate the need for the Fed to keep interest rates low. He can do this by fighting for massive spending cuts, starting with the military-industrial complex. He should also push Congress to pass the Audit the Fed bill. Additionally, President Trump should support legalizing all competing currencies. The forthcoming tax bill should include a provision exempting precious metals and cryptocurrencies from capital gains taxes. The key to making America great again is to make money free again.

Pakistan: BLA Blowback In Baluchistan – Analysis	By Tushar Ranjan Mohanty On November 9, 2024, at least 31 persons, including 17 Security Forces (SFs) personnel, were killed and more than 60 persons, including 46 SF personnel sustained injuries, when a suicide bomber blew himself up near the ticket counter of the Quetta Railway Station in Balochistan. According to railway authorities, the Jaffar Express was scheduled to depart for Peshawar at 9 am. The train had not yet arrived at the platform when an explosion occurred near the station's ticket office. Balochistan Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mouzzam Jah Ansari, stated that the target was Army personnel from the Infantry School. The Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack. 'This morning, a Fidayee attack was carried out on a Pakistani army unit at Quetta Railway Station as they were returning via Jaffar Express after completing a course at the Infantry School,' the BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch said. Later in the day, BLA released a detailed statement on its official media Hakkal, claiming it killed at least 31 non-commissioned officers of the Army and injured over 60 others. The BLA identified the suicide bomber as Muhammad Rafiq Bizenjo alias Washen alias Faheem. Bizenjo, a cadres of BLA's 'elite' Majeed Brigade, carried out the attack in response to what the BLA described as Pakistan's 'occupation' of Balochistan. According to the BLA, Bizenjo targeted Army personnel from multiple regiments, including the Punjab Regiment, Northern Light Infantry, Sindh Regiment, Frontier Force, Baloch Regiment, and Azad Kashmir Regiment. The soldiers had recently completed training at the School of Infantry and Tactics in Quetta, the BLA added. The BLA credited its intelligence wing, ZIRAB (Zephyr Intelligence Research and Analysis Bureau), with planning the attack. The group claimed ZIRAB monitored the Army's movements closely and decided to delay the attack on November 8 to avoid civilian casualties. According to the BLA, November 9 was chosen because over 200 Army personnel were present, with minimal risk to civilians. In its statement, the BLA warned that if Pakistan's military presence in Balochistan continues, future attacks will escalate and could extend to major cities in Pakistan. On November 6, 2024, the BLA conducted an operation in station area of Nushki District in Balochistan, killing two 'state-backed death squad' members, Israr Muhammad Hassani and Yasir Jamaldini. In a statement, BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch claimed that 'Israr, from Badalkarez, and Yasir, from Killi Jamaldini, were on the payroll of the occupying forces.' Jeeyand Baloch added that the two were allegedly involved in military operations that included raids and enforced disappearances of Baloch youth. The group stated that they had been under surveillance prior to the attack and warned that others engaged in similar activities would 'face similar consequences.' On November 4, 2024, at least 10 soldiers were killed and another four sustained injuries, while two BLA cadres were also killed during a clash, after BLA ambushed a military convoy near the Qadirabad area of Nushki District. BLA claimed responsibility for the attack. BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch disclosed that two of the group's cadres, Adnan Baloch and Yasir Baloch, were killed in the prolonged confrontation. 'Despite his injuries, Martyr Adnan Baloch held his position for over an hour, covering his unit's retreat before sacrificing his life,' Jeeyand Baloch added. On October 28, 2024, the BLA killed five private security personnel deployed at a construction site in the Diz Paroom area of Panjgur District. BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch released a statement, claiming that the attack was carried out by BLA's Fatah Squad, based on intelligence from BLA's intelligence wing, Zirab. The attack targeted members of 'death squads' allegedly supported by Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies, whom the BLA claims were engaged in counterinsurgency operations against the Baloch independence movement. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), in 59 BLA-linked incidents recorded in 2024, at least 254 persons, including 83 civilians, 122 SF personnel and 49 militants, have been killed (data till November 10, 2024). During the corresponding period of 2023, 34 such incidents resulted in 69 fatalities, including 16 civilians, 45 SF personnel and eight militants. The whole of 2023 recorded 39 incidents in which 77 persons were killed, including 19 civilians, 50 SF personnel and eight militants. Since the Balochistan tryst with insurgency, year 2024 has so far been the most violent, with BLA leading from the front among all the Baloch insurgent groups, orchestrating most of the attacks. Since August 1, 2004, when the first BLA-linked incident, was recorded by SATP, at least 912 persons, including 277 civilians, 393 SF personnel, 222 militants, and 20 in the Not Specified category, have been killed (data till November 10, 2024). On August 1, 2004, five soldiers and a civilian were killed when BLA cadres targeted SF vehicles in the Khuzdar District. The long-term state policy of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings has led to a spiral of retaliatory attacks and violence by Baloch insurgents, targeting SFs and state establishments in the province. Civilians, especially members of state-backed 'death squad' have also been targeted. In this environment of chaos, Islamist terrorist groups have also thrived and even joined the Baloch groups. The major active Baloch insurgent groups include the Baloch National Army (BNA), BLA, Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), Balochistan Liberation Tigers (BLT) and United Baloch Army (UBA). Among all the Baloch groups, the BLA has proved the most lethal. Comprised mostly of Marri and Bugti tribe members, BLA was formed in response to the growing resentment in Balochistan over the continuous Government exploitation of the province's natural resources and the neglect of development and welfare in the province. The group has about 6,000 cadres spread across Balochistan and in the bordering areas of Afghanistan. Sardar Akbar Khan Bugti, former Chief Minister of Balochistan is considered one of the 'grandfathers' of the organization and was killed in an Army operation on August 26, 2006. After Akbar Khan Bugti's death, Balach Marri led the group, till his death in Afghanistan on 21 November 2007. After Balach's death, his brother, Hyrbyair Marri has led the group since 2007, from exile in London. Bashir Zeb Baloch is the 'commander-in-chief' of the outfit. Out of all Baloch insurgent groups, the BLA is the only one that has a dedicated suicide attack squad, the 'Majeed Brigade', named after two brothers, Majeed Langove Senior and Majeed Langove Junior, who carried out suicide attacks in August 1974 and March 2010, respectively. Majeed Senior tried to assassinate then Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto when he was on an official visit to Quetta. He wanted to kill the Prime Minister for his dismissal of the National Awami Party's government in Balochistan, but Majeed Senior lost his life during the operation. Majeed Junior 'sacrificed' himself to save his associates when SFs raided the house where they were staying in Quetta's Wahdat Colony. Majeed Junior held back the SF raiders to give his associates time to escape. Following Majeed Junior's death, a BLA leader, Aslam Achu, established the insurgent group's suicide squad, and named it the Majeed Brigade, currently led by Hammal Rehan Baloch. The Brigade carried out its first vehicle-borne suicide attack on December 30, 2011, when Baaz Khan Marri targeted tribal elder Shafiq Mengal, son of former acting Chief Minister and Federal Minister Naseer Mengal, on the Arbab Karam Khan Road in Quetta. Shafeeq, who had run a 'death squad' targeting Baloch insurgents in different parts of the province, escaped unhurt, but 14 persons, including women and children, were killed, and 35 were injured. Apart from Majeed Brigade, BLA have a has special forces, the Special Tactical Operations Squad (STOS), under the command of Bashir Zeb Baloch, which has been monitoring and eliminating Army officers and their local 'death squad' collaborators. STOS' main function is the tracking of and intelligence gathering on targets. BLA formed a new elite group, the 'Fateh Squad', whose cadres are known for their specialised skills. The Fateh Squad was formed in May 2021 after one of BLA's 'martyrs', Fateh Qambrani, was killed during an operation to capture a Pakistani Army camp in the Meshdari area of Shahrag in Harnai District in September 2018. His action enabled the full capture of the Army camp. Fateh Qambrani also played a prominent role in various other operations. The cadres of the Fateh Squad are selected on the basis of their exceptional skills and face-to-face battle experience. They lead their fighters directly into Pakistani Army and paramilitary camps, paving the way for other fighters to enter the camps. The growing strength and lethality of the BLA can be assessed by the August 25-26, 2024, coordinated and simultaneous attacks across seven Districts, 'Operation Hereof' (Operation Dark Storm). This was the largest act of retribution by any Baloch insurgent group. In the early morning of August 26, 2024, BLA cadres offloaded passengers from trucks and buses in the Rarasham area of Musakhail District and shot them after checking their identities. At least 23 Punjabi travellers were killed. The armed men also set fire to 10 vehicles. As the day progressed, Balochistan recorded multiple attacks across the province, which left at least 38 people dead, including the 23 in Musakhail. In response, SFs neutralised 21 terrorists and injured several others. BLA cadres then targeted Levies Forces and Police Stations in Mastung, Kalat, Pasni, and Suntsar, resulting in numerous casualties. Explosions and grenade attacks were reported in Sibi, Panjgur, Mastung, Turbat, Bela, and Quetta, with militants blowing up a railway track near Mastung. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued a statement later in the day, claiming that 21 terrorists had been killed, while 14 SF personnel, including four from law enforcement agencies, were killed during 'clearance operations'. However, in a statement released on its official media, Hakkal, BLA announced the successful completion of its Fidayeen Operation Hereof, claiming to have killed 130 military personnel during a series of coordinated attacks across Balochistan. BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch claimed that the group's elite fidayeen unit, the Majeed Brigade, had 'maintained control over the Bela Camp for 20 hours,' during which '68 military personnel were killed and dozens more injured.' The BLA also reported that its Fateh Squad and Special Tactical Operations Squad (STOS) had set up blockades on major highways across Balochistan, leading to the deaths of 62 military personnel. 'After achieving the objectives of Operation Herof, the roadblocks on all highways were lifted,' the statement read. Some of the other major attacks by the BLA in 2024 include: October 8: Eight soldiers were killed and three were injured in two consecutive attacks by BLA cadres in the Gonden Marao area of Ispelanji in Mastung District. In a statement to the media, BLA 'spokesperson' Jeeyand Baloch said the attack took place in the Gonden Marao area of Ispelanji, where BLA cadres ambushed a Security Force convoy using heavy and automatic weapons. June 24: At least 11 soldiers were killed and an unspecified number sustained injuries when BLA cadres attacked a military camp in the Iskalko area of Kalat District. April 29: At least ten soldiers were killed and their military vehicle was completely destroyed in an improvised explosive device (IED) attack by BLA cadres in the Peer Ismail Indus area of Bolan District. April 12: BLA cadres shot dead 11 passengers of Punjabi ethnicity on N-40 Regional Corporations Development (RCD) highway after checking their identities from a passenger bus in the Nushki. The victims were from Wazirabad, Mandi Bahauddin and Gujranwala Districts of Punjab. BLA claimed that they were Government employees. March 25: Majeed Brigade cadres attacked the PNS Siddique Naval Air Station in the Turbat town of Kech District and claimed that more than 30 soldiers were killed. The Army, however, stated it thwarted the attack and killed four BLA cadres, while one soldier was killed. March 20: Majeed Brigade cadres attacked the Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) Complex in Gwadar town (Gwadar District) and killed two soldiers. SFs, however, stated that they thwarted the attack and killed eight BLA cadres. January 29: Nine BLA cadres, four Railway Police personnel and two civilians were killed, while four others, including two SF personnel and one child, sustained injuries when the Majeed Brigade launched three coordinated attacks targeting the Frontier Corps Headquarters, the Railway Station and the District Jail in the Mach town of Kachhi District. BLA 'spokesperson', Jeeyand Baloch claimed the attack, stating that it was a joint attack in coordination with other factions, during which BLA insurgents controlled Mach city and surrounding areas for over 72 hours. Horrified with continuous and escalating BLA attacks, security personnel have started hesitating to serve in Balochistan. After the August 25-26 coordinated attacks, while chairing the Provincial Apex Committee in Quetta on August 30, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif emphasized the need for the deployment of capable and talented officers in Balochistan, acknowledging that, due to security concerns, some officers hesitate to serve in the province. However, under a new policy regarding officer deployment, officers from the 48th Common Training Program will be posted in Balochistan for one year, while officers from the 49th Common Training Program will be posted for one and a half years, after completing one year. Prime Minister Sharif also announced that special incentives would be provided to officers deployed in Balochistan, including four air tickets for their families every three months. Heightening tensions, the Balochistan Police issued a notification on October 28, warning officers that the BLA was planning abductions of Government officials in Panjgur, Kech and Awaran Districts. 'High-ranking officials such as DPOs, DCs, or ACs could be targeted in retaliation for the recent disappearance of BLA leader Basheer Zeb's brother, Zaheer Baloch,' the Police notification stated. Zaheer Baloch went 'missing' on June 27 en route from his office on Quetta's Zarghoon Road to his home on Sariab Road. Instead of dealing with the Baloch insurgency through constructive measures such as peace-talks, negotiations or economic and relief measures to improve the abysmal developmental profile of the province, the Pakistan establishments has been following a ruthless approach of suppression of the Baloch people. On August 22, 2024, the Government approved PKR 60 billion to carry out Operation Azm-e-Istehkam (Commitment for Stability) to fight militancy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In response, the BLA-led Baloch Raj Aajoi Sangar (BRAS), an umbrella organization of Baloch 'pro-independence' groups, issued a statement on July 8, 2024, against Pakistan's military campaign. In a media release, BRAS 'spokesperson' Baloch Khan condemned the operation as a blatant intensification of the ongoing 'genocide' against the Baloch people. He asserted that BRAS and its allied organizations were prepared to defend their land and people against any form of military action, promising to defeat the 'invading' forces. While the violence in the province has social and developmental grievances, the Federal Government's recent plan for the establishment of 'internment centres' for terrorism suspects in the province and the November 1 proposed amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act, granting the armed forces and paramilitary units the authority to detain individuals involved in serious crimes for up to three months, will further aggravate the issues of enforced disappearances in the province, likely provoking more BLA orchestrated attacks in the coming days.

Your Kids Are Already Communist, And College Will Make It Worse –...	By Mark Thorton Children in the US are raised to be communists. Most of the parents are too and don’t even know it. It doesn’t matter if you send them to public or private schools as all the education degree-granting schools bias the learning process against the competitive capitalist 'liberal' or open-minded society. Instead, the curriculum is less about learning about reality and is heavy on propagandizing children against capitalism and towards communism. American society teaches hatred and distrust of everything capitalist, even though its benefits are all around us—helping to feed, cloth, house, and protect us. In contrast, the government screws up virtually everything it lays its hands on and charges us double to do so. I remember when I was a child that my mother would retrieve the morning milk, just outside the back door, from the 'milk box.' I don’t remember how old I was when I finally asked how the milk got there, and my mother told me that the milkman put it there. I think I had previously chalked it up to something akin to Santa Claus or the tooth fairy, and when I realized how dark and cold—even snowy—it could be outside early in the morning, I was amazed! Today, on the drive to work, I heard an otherwise-intelligent retired athlete say the following: If you are a billionaire sports team owner you obviously have screwed a lot of people over, but in the case of building sports stadiums, taxpayer subsidies are needed because they create jobs. Everything about that statement is wrong and ignorant. People become billionaires because they serve their customers well. They outcompete others in serving customers. They normally create tons of high-paying jobs too, including for our retired athlete. The exception to this rule is when billions are made from special privileges from the government, like taxpayer subsidies! Taxpayer-funded stadiums are the classic case of a losing proposition for the local economy and taxpayers as study after study has demonstrated. Only a few benefit from the subsidies, including the billionaire team owners! With a brainwashed upbringing, is it any wonder then that more young adults have a positive view of socialism than have a positive view of capitalism? The positive beliefs in socialism only increase with more college education. Those beliefs should decline with more education if college was about learning, instead of indoctrination. The only silver lining—and I will link to my journal article on the subject in the show notes—is that the rise of socialist sympathies has driven many others to try and learn more about Austrian economics. One clear sign of socialist bias in higher education is that college professors that register Democrat outnumber those that register Republican 10-to-1. Of course, Democrat professors are much more likely to favor extreme forms of socialism than the average American Democrats and Republican professors are more likely to stay in the closet or face the mean and career-ending dangers from Marxist professors who often control the campus agenda. The Republicans are also much more likely to teach in good career departments, like engineering, where their views would not come into play in the classroom. Mitch Daniels was a pharmaceutical executive who came into the Bush administration to run the Office of Management and Budget. He went on to become a successful two-term governor of Indiana and then president of the prestigious Purdue University. At each stage, he tried and succeeded in trimming the worst excesses of public sector waste and abuse of the taxpayer. He has spoken favorably of both F.A. Hayek and limited government. At Purdue, the business school is now named the 'Mitch Daniels School of Business' and, at his beckoning, they have set up a mini curriculum called the 'Cornerstone for Business' that proposes to expose students to 'transformative texts with deep insights on the history, philosophy, and economic theory of market capitalism.' This is a well-intentioned attempt to 'offset the influence of a culture that increasingly doubts the value that profitable businesses offer society.' This effort should be commended. It recognizes the anti-capitalist influence in American culture and education, and it attempts to balance that by exposing the students to some 'transformative texts.' Of course, that is what a liberal education and a liberal arts degree should be—was meant to be—in the first place! Unfortunately, this is only an elective curriculum—students get a certificate for completing the three-course sequence: 1. 'Money, Trade, & Power: The History of Capitalism,' 2. 'History of Economic Thought,' and, 3. 'International Organization.' I was a little surprised it did not include a course in 'Comparative Economic Systems.' That was a standard course that was taught every semester, open to any student, when I was an undergraduate student. The course compared various versions of capitalism and socialism. My teacher tried to convince us that the Soviet Union would soon dominate the West. It’s not taught much anymore, anywhere. I don’t think it’s been taught at Auburn University for at least four decades, except when I volunteered to teach it, basically on a charitable basis. They haven’t even asked me to teach it in almost a decade. The titles of courses, however, are just a surface issue and are just subterfuge in the long run. The titles of professors also don’t matter. I’m afraid that if every economics, history, and philosophy department in the country had a Murray Rothbard named endowed professorship that it would not change a thing. The University of Missouri was given millions of dollars for six chaired professorships in Austrian economics, and they just handed them out to seemingly random business professors with no connection to Austrian economics. In an extremely unusual outcome, the University was successfully sued for their egregious actions against the donors’ wishes and had to return the money. Most donors are not so lucky. Here is the crux of the matter: Current professors don’t know what they are talking about concerning the relevant issues, they only mimic the political propaganda that their professor gave to them. The story suits the agenda, so it gets retold as if it is a real theory, or real history. In reality, these stories often simply fly in the face of logic, but because professors and students are not taught true critical thinking or exposed to competing approaches, they never think about questioning it. The only critical thinking in modern academia that stands out are criticisms of capitalism—real and imagined. Case in point: it is widely taught that unions caused wages to go up, improved working conditions, reduced hours of work, eliminated women and child labor, etc.; issues that are bound to come up in various history and economics classes. The problem with this story is that increased wages and benefits, etc., require free market capitalism and private property rights in the first place to generate the necessary savings and capital investment in worthwhile production. Capitalism and capitalist accumulation occurred prior to the labor guilds. The Industrial Revolution preceded labor unions. Capitalism proliferated the higher-skilled labor and higher-paying jobs on which unions are based! All the good benefits that labor enjoys first appeared in the marketplace without government or union intervention. Henry Ford started the $5 per workday because he wanted a dependable, highly-skilled workforce and workers loved it! Unions do benefit their members, but they hurt the employers and customers. They also can only sustain their higher pay by excluding others from skilled positions, so many people in the workforce are hurt by unionism. The net result is that 'labor' in general is not better off and unionized economies go into decline. The US is one of the least unionized and most dynamic advanced economies in the world. Listen to professors and their students and you would think only children would work in factories and that no one would ever have a day off from work if not for unions and the government. The capitalist process is responsible for higher wages and higher standards of living in society. As a system, governmental action and violent union activity can only drag down its beneficial social effects. This is just one example of what passes for higher education. Don’t expect government bureaucrats and politicians to solve this problem. They helped to create it.

The West’s Very Fundamental Accumulating Contradictions – OpEd	The election has occurred; Trump will take office in January; many of the existing Party Nomenklatura will be replaced; different policies will be announced – but actually taking power (rather than just sitting in the White House) will be more complex. The U.S. has devolved into many disparate fiefdoms – almost princedoms – from the CIA to the Justice Department. And regulatory ‘agencies’ too, have been implanted to preserve Nomenklatura hold on the System’s lifeblood. Pulling these ideological adversaries into new thinking will not proceed entirely smoothly. However, the U.S. election also, has been a referendum on the prevalent western intellectual mainstream. And that likely will be more decisive than the U.S. domestic vote – important though that is. The U.S. has shifted strategically away from the managerial techno-oligarchy that took its grip in the 1970s. Today’s shift is reflected across the U.S. Back in 1970, Zbig Brzezinski (who was to become National Security Adviser to President Carter) wrote a book foreseeing the new era: What he then called ‘The Technetronic Era’, 'involved the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society … dominated by an élite, unrestrained by traditional values … [and practicing] continuous surveillance over every citizen … [together with] manipulation of the behaviour and intellectual functioning of all people … [would become the new norm].' Elsewhere, Brzezinski argued that 'the nation-state … has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state'. Brzezinski was plain wrong about the benefits of tech cosmopolitan governance. And he was decisively, and disastrously, wrong in the policy prescriptions that he adduced from the implosion of the Soviet Union in 1991 – that no country or group of countries would ever dare to stand up to U.S. power. Brzezinski argued in The Grand Chessboard that Russia would have no choice but to submit to the expansion of NATO, and to the geopolitical dictates of the U.S. But Russia did not succumb. And as a result of the élites’ 1991 ‘End of History’ euphoria, the West launched war in Ukraine to prove its point – that no single country could hope to stand against the combined weight of all NATO. They said that because they believed it. They believed in the western Manifest Destiny. They did not understand the other options Russia had. Today, the Ukraine war is lost. Hundreds of thousands have died unnecessarily – for a conceit. The ‘other war’ in the Middle East fares no differently. The Israeli-U.S. war on Iran will be lost, and tens of thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese will have died pointlessly. And the ‘forever wars’ too, that were expected by the Supreme Commander of NATO in the wake of 9/11 to topple an array of states (first Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran), not only did they not result in consolidating U.S. hegemony, but they have led instead to Kazan and to BRICS, with its long tail of aspirant members, ready to face down foreign colonialism. The Kazan summit was cautious. It didn’t project a flush of solutions; some BRICS states were hesitant (the U.S. election was scheduled for the following week). Putin’s comments to these latter states were carefully calibrated: Look at what the U.S. can do to you, should you fall foul of it, at any point. Protect yourselves. All that the BRICS President (Putin) could say, at this juncture, was: Here are the problems that [we have to solve]. It is premature to set up a full alternative Bretton Woods structure at this time. But we can set up the core to a prudent alternative for working in the dollar sphere: a settlement and clearing system, BRICS Clear; a reference unit of account; a re-insurance structure and the BRICS Card – a retail payment card system similar to AliPay. Perhaps a Reserve Currency and the full Bretton Woods paraphernalia will prove unnecessary. Financial technology is evolving fast – and providing that the BRICS clearance system is functional, a multitude of fin-tech separate trade channels may ultimately be what results. But a ‘week is a long time in politics’. And one week later, the western intellectual paradigm was upended. The Shibboleths of the last fifty years were rejected across the board in the U.S. by voters. The ideology of ‘undoing’ the cultural past; the casting aside the lessons of history (for, it is claimed, ‘wrongful’ perspectives) and the rejection of systems of ethics reflected in the myths and stories of a community, have themselves been rejected! It is ok again to be a ‘civilisational state'. The radical doubting and cynicism of the Anglo-sphere is reduced to one perspective amongst many. And no longer can be the universal narrative. Well, post the U.S. election, BRICS sentiment must be turbo-charged. Notions that were not thinkable last week, just became possible and thinkable a week later. Historians may look back, and observe that the future architecture of modern global finance, modern global economy may have struggled to be born at Kazan, but is now a healthy infant. Will it all happen smoothly? Of course not. Differences between BRICS member and ‘partner’ states will remain, but this week a window has opened, fresh air has entered, and many will breathe more easily. If there is one thing that should be clear, a second Trump Administration is unlikely to feel the need to launch a ‘war on the world’ to maintain its global hegemony (as the 2022 National Defence Strategy insist it should). For the U.S. today faces its own internal structural contradictions to which Trump regularly alluded when he talked about the evaporated American real economy owing to the off-shored manufacturing base. A recent report by the RAND Organisation states starkly however, that the U.S. defence industrial base is unable to meet the equipment, technology, and munitions needs of the U.S. and its allies and partners. A protracted conflict, especially in multiple theatres, would require much greater capacity [– and a radically increased defence budget]. Trump’s industrial recuperation plan, however, of painfully high tariffs ringing American manufacturing; an end to Federal profligacy and lower taxes suggests however, a reversal into fiscal rectitude – after decades of fiscal laxity and uncontrolled borrowing. Not big military spending! (Defence spending, by the way, during the Cold War relied on top marginal income tax rates above 70 percent and corporate tax rates averaging 50 percent – which does not seem to accord with what Trump has in mind). Professor Richard Wolff comments in a recent interview that the West as a whole is in deep trouble financially, precisely as a result of such unrestrained government expenditures: 'For the first time, a couple of years ago, bondholders were unwilling to continue to fund the deficits of Great Britain, and [the UK government was thrown out]. Mr. Macron is now heading right down that same path. Bondholders have told the French that they are not going to continue to fund their national debt. Here’s how it works. Bondholders are telling the French, you have to rein in spending … The bondholders are saying, you have to stop running deficits. And, as every undergraduate knows, the way you would rein in deficits could be to cut spending. But there is an alternative: It’s called taxing. And it’s called taxing corporations and the rich because the others don’t have any more for you to tax – you’ve done all you can [do with taxes on ordinary French citizens]. [However] taxing corporations and the rich … somehow, is not only ‘not doable’, but not debatable. It can’t be put on the table: Nothing. (or, something so minuscule that will never deal with the deficit). We now have too much debt. And it turns out that the government, like the American government, is facing the next few years where it will have to spend as much on servicing its debt as it is on defence. And that doesn’t leave very much for everybody else. And everybody else is saying: no, no, no, no, no, no. And now the bondholder gets worried, because one way to resolve this would be to stop paying the bond holders and that, of course, must never be. So you’ve got two absurdities. You can’t stop paying the bondholders (when, of course, you can, but with dire consequences). And you can’t tax corporations and the rich. And, of course you can. I think we are reaching a point in which these contradictions have accumulated. You don’t have to be a Hegelian or a Marxist to understand that these accumulating contradictions are very profound, very large, and very fundamental'. They tell us that on the one hand that the world does not accept the western vision as being of universal application – and on the other hand, the West doesn’t have the financial clout to pursue global primacy – if it ever did: Zugzwang.

Trump’s Victory Has Sharpened Conflicts In Bangladesh – Analysis	The Muhammad Yunus regime in Bangladesh is unsettled by Trump's remarks on the communal situation in Bangladesh. But the ousted Awami League sees in them the seeds of covert American support for any effort it might make to come back to power with US and Indian support. It is generally accepted that the stunning victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump against his Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the November 5 US Presidential election, will have a significant impact on various countries of the world. It is already having a significant impact on Bangladeshi politics at least. This is because the Trump, the President-elect, has spoken his mind on the troubled situation in Bangladesh, clearly indicating which side he is on in the fractious politics of that country. Trump's utterance on Bangladesh has deeply disturbed the Interim Government led by Dr.Muhammad Yunus. At the same time, it has kindled hopes of a return to power in the Awami League which was ousted from power by a mass movement in early August. And given the undisguised bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bangladeshis assume that any moves by Trump against Yunus in favour of Sheikh Hasina will have Modi's tacit support. This equation would make Trump a very formidable foe for Yunus and a very power ally for Hasina. What triggered the fear in the Yunus camp, was Trump's message on X to the Hindus in America on the occasion of Deepavali on October 31. 'I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos,' he said. 'It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America,' he said. Supporting Hindutva, Trump added: 'We will also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left. We will fight for your freedom. Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi.' Trump's statement was a shot in the arm for the Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh, who were already complaining of attacks on them during the student agitation against Sheikh Hasina's government. Hindus become Active On October 26, before Trump's Deepavali remarks, Hindus under the banner 'Sanatan Jagaran Manch' organised a massive rally in Chittagong, demanding protection. A meeting was held at the historic Lal Dighi Ground, where minority Hindus presented eight major demands. Some of the demands were: Establish a tribunal to prosecute individuals involved in crimes against the minorities; compensate victims and provide for their rehabilitation; legislate a Minority Protection Act immediately; form a Ministry of Minority Affairs; construct places of worship for minorities in every educational institution and allot prayer rooms in every hostel; upgrade Hindu, Buddhist and Christian Welfare Trusts to Hindu Foundations; and modernise Sanskrit and Pali education. More recently, following Trump's pro-Hindu speech, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), was accused of indulging in attacks on the police and the army. Suspicions were sowed about ISKCON's motives and promoters, both domestically and internationally. Dhaka Tribune said that that ISKCON's behaviour was meant to provoke communal rioting in the country which would be an excuse for foreign intervention. The write-up added that ISKCON's rallies were attended by pro-Awami League Muslims also. In this way, the writer drew a link between Hindus, India and the Awami League, with Trump giving moral support. Dhaka Tribune pointed out that Bangladesh was desperately trying to restore order and peace and that it was inconsiderate on the part of Trump to say that there was 'barbaric violence' in Bangladesh, and that the nation was in 'a total state of chaos'. Not only was his statement not factual, but showed an utter disregard for niceties expected from a man about to be President of the United States. Dhaka Tribune said in an editorial: 'Indeed, at a time when the rest of the world is showing solidarity with the interim government under the leadership of Muhammad Yunus, Trump's unfortunate words are nothing but a disservice to the efforts being made to correct the wrongs that are undoubtedly present. While there is no denying that there remain untoward incidents of violence and lawlessness, something that this newspaper has reported on exhaustively and routinely editorializes on, to speak of these isolated incidents as the norm and condemning the entire nation as being gripped in chaos tells us that the former US president is either misinformed of the reality at present in Bangladesh, or worse.' In defence of the Interim Government, Chief Advisor, Yunus told the German TV Deutsche Welle that the attacks on the Hindus had taken place in the initial days of the violent mass movement when all suspected supporters of Sheikh Hasina were attacked. But these attacks stopped when police took action. He denied that his government was anti-Hindu. On Friday, the Army chief Gen.Waker-uz-Zaman attending a Buddhist function in Dhaka and assured the audience that Bangladesh was for all - Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians - and that Bangladesh had been the home of all these religions. He pointed out, that this year, the government saw to it that the Durga Puja went off 'beautifully'. Hasina's Message to Trump However, a more recent development caused great apprehension, if not consternation, in Bangladesh. It was Sheikh Hasina's message to Donal Trump congratulating him on his electoral victory. She had signed off her message designating herself as the 'Prime Minister of Bangladesh.' Having sent this message from exile in Delhi and to the pro-Modi Donald Trump, Hasina gave the impression in Bangladesh that she had done it with Delhi's nod. Hasina's being still 'Prime Minister of Bangladesh' was an issue earlier too. The President of Bangladesh, Mohammad Shahabuddin (her appointee), had told a Dhaka newspaper that Hasina had quit Bangladesh without submitting her resignation to him. This simple statement of fact was interpreted by student agitators as Shahabuddin's way of questioning the legitimacy of the Yunus government. Students stormed his residence and tried to force him to resign. But the Yunus government did not want a constitutional crisis as there would be no constitutional functionary left to maintain continuity if the President had resigned. Parliament had been dissolved earlier. Awami League Activated With Sheikh Hasina indicating that she is still Prime Minister, her party Awami League, got activated in Bangladesh. They tried to hold public meetings on November 10 to mark the death anniversary of Noor Hosain, a hero of the 1987 pro-democracy movement against President Gen.H.M. Ershad. It was stated that the Awami Leaguers were doing this at the instance of Sheikh Hasina who had also asked them to carry portraits of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Donald Trump. The anti-Awami League students and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters rushed to the venue of the Awami League meeting in Dhaka and beat up the Awami Leaguers. The police ended up arresting 50 Awami Leaguers. not the attackers. On November 11, students of Anti-Discrimination Student Movement organized a protest rally in Rangpur, demanding a ban on the Awami League. They also demanded that the accomplices of Hasina's authoritarianism hiding within the administration be identified and brought to trial. The Awami League's students' wing, the Chhatra League had already been banned. Bangkadesh Nationalist Party (BNP) cadres gathered outside Awami League's central office in Gulistan Dhaka, and chanted slogans against the Awami League. But over 100 AL leaders and activists brought out a procession in front of the BRTC bus terminal under the banner of the Dhaka South Awami League. Another procession was held in front of the South City Corporation, where leaders and activists from the Dhaka Metropolitan Awami League, Jubo League and other affiliated organizations took part. Meanwhile, some leaders and activists from the central AL and its affiliated organizations gathered in front of the Bangladesh Bank near Motijheel and marched toward Zero Point. But all of them were chased and attacked by BNP activists and the supporters of the Anti-Discriminatory Student Movement. Meanwhile, the Students of Jahangirnagar University demonstrated demanding that Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's name be removed from one of the faculties.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4rna3sLS5IiZ	2024-11-11T16:39:38-08:00	
Internationalization Of The Rupee: India’s Significant Geo-Econom...	Internationalization of the rupee indicates that it may be freely exchanged between residents and non-residents and that it can be used as a reserve currency in international trade. It entails encouraging the use of the rupee for capital account transactions, other current account operations, and import and export trade. International Trade Settlement in Indian Rupees (INR) To promote the growth of global trade with an emphasis on exports from India and to support the increasing interest of the global trading community in Indian currency (INR), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a new mechanism for international trade settlement in Indian rupees (INR). To encourage the use of theIndian currency in cross-border trade is one of the major goals of the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023 of India which comes into effect from April 1, 2023. The RBI has also updated from time to time about the broad framework for exporting goods and services from India according to the Master Direction of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA). The approved dealer banks will need prior clearance from the RBI's foreign currency department before implementing this method. All exports and imports made in accordance with this arrangement may be priced in rupees. Market forces may decide the rate of exchange between the currencies of the two trade partners. The authorised dealer banks (DB) have been allowed to open rupee Vostro accounts (an account that a correspondent bank holds on behalf of another bank). The rupee payment system also allows Indian exporters to collect advance payments in Indian rupees from foreign importers against shipments. The surplus rupee balance in the Vostro accounts may be used for advanced flow management of export-import transactions, investments in government securities, and payments for projects and investments. According to the RBI, the authorised dealer bank maintaining the special Vostro account will have to ensure that the correspondent bank is not from a country or jurisdiction in the updated public statement of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions on which FATF has called for countermeasures. Driving factor In a move to counter Russia’s war over Ukraine, the US and the European Commission issued a joint statement to exclude seven Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messaging system, which was the trigger point for all countries. This payment arrangement assumed greater importance in 2022–23 as India increased its dependence on discounted Russian oil, making it the second largest source of crude oil. Russia's exports to India in 2021 stood at $6.9 billion, mainly consisting of mineral oils, fertilisers, and rough diamonds, while India exported goods worth $3.33 billion to Russia in 2021, mainly comprising pharmaceutical products, tea, and coffee. In December 2022, India did its first settlement of foreign trade in rupees with Russia as part of the 'International Settlement of Trade in Indian Rupee' mechanism initiated by the RBI. As per the Bureau for International (BIS) Settlements 'Triennial Central Bank Survey 2022', as of April 2022, USD accounts for about 88% of global foreign exchange market turnover, followed by the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling. The Indian rupee accounts for a mere 1.6%. In March 2023, the RBI allowed the opening of Special Rupee Vostro Accounts (SRVAs) to put in place the mechanism forrupee trade settlement with as many as eighteen countries.It includes Botswana, Fiji, Germany, Guyana, Israel, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, New Zealand, Oman, Russia, the Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. In April 2023, India and Malaysia agreed to settle trade in Indian rupees. Amid talks towards finalising a free trade agreement with India, Bangladesh is also considering the settlement of bilateral trade in Indian rupees. Significance The most important advantage of internationalising the rupee is to reduce dependency on the USD for foreign trade. It would further increase the bargaining power of India in international business. Expanding the use of the rupee for international trade will reduce currency risk for Indian businesses by eliminating their exposure to currency volatility. This can reduce the cost of doing business and, hence, make exports more competitive in the global market. Additionally, the need to maintain forex reserves can be drastically reduced if a sizable share of India’s trade can be settled in terms of the domestic currency. What are the major roadblocks to the internationalization of the rupee? Rupee-trade arrangements are not easy to implement, which is why India and Russia have suspended efforts to settle bilateral trade in rupees after months of negotiations failed to convince the latter to keep rupees in their coffers. The rupee is not fully convertible; India's share of global exports of goods is just about 2%, and these factors reduce the necessity for other countries to hold rupees. India accounts for less than 4% of global services trade, 2.5% of global merchandise trade, and an even lower percentage of global financial activities. Consequently, Russia wanted the trade to be done in Chinese Yuan, UAE Dirham, or other currencies. India has a trade deficit with its major trading partners, including China, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. In fact, India’s large trade deficit vis-à-vis Russia, which implies that the latter would be saddled with large rupee balances, is also why it has been reluctant to engage in rupee-rubble trade. Balancing exchange rate stability and domestic monetary policy is one of the major obstacles to the internationalization of the rupee. As the rupee becomes more internationalised, it is likely to become more vulnerable to external economic shocks, such as changes in global interest rates or fluctuations in commodity prices. This could make it more difficult for the central bank (RBI) to maintain both exchange rate stability and a domestically oriented monetary policy. When a currency is internationalised, both residents and non-residents can buy and sell domestic currency-denominated financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and other securities. This means that the demand and supply of the country's currency can be influenced not just by domestic but also external factors (outside the country). If this happens in the case of the rupee, the RBI will have limited control over the money supply within its own borders, which could make it difficult to maintain stable interest rates that are in line with the requirements of the domestic economy. For the rupee to be effectively internationalised, the government will have to remove restrictions on any entity (domestic or foreign) from buying or selling rupee; this implies no restrictions on the flow of capital in and out of the country, which would require full convertibility on the capital account. However, successive Indian governments have avoided full convertibility on the capital account to prevent the Indian economy from being exposed to the risks of external financial shocks. What Measures Can Be Taken to Facilitate Rupee Internationalization? Among the emerging economies, China is the only country that has been able to steadily internationalise its currency while maintaining controls on its capital account. It has done so by finalising currency swap agreements between the central banks of China and 43 other countries, which assure the markets that there will not be an oversupply of the renminbi. Creating an offshore market for its domestic currency that allows foreign entities to sell renminbi for dollars However, it must not be forgotten that China also has a trade surplus with most of the other countries. India needs better planning It would require India to have considerable thinking and planning to make rupee-internationalization function in a manner that does not adversely affect the economy’s fundamentals. The government must carefully balance the benefits with the potential risks and respond appropriately to ensure the stability of the economy. It also requires India to have a large and deep domestic financial market to be better equipped to handle external shocks and make it easier for the RBI to manage its monetary policy. India has made a modest attempt at facilitating rupee trade; the idea will take time to gain acceptance. For the time being, the rupee’s acceptance will potentially be limited to countries that have a deficit with India. India will need to enrol other trade partners that will be able to use their rupees to buy goods from India. The US and European Union are the major export destinations for India, and the others would be oil-exporting nations. Getting the latter into our fold sounds plausible. Removal of restrictions on buying and selling of domestic currency in both the spot and forward markets. Domestic firms can invoice exports and imports in their own currency. Foreign firms, financial institutions, government institutions, and individuals can hold the country’s currency and financial instruments.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4su88VfW9QRY	2024-11-11T16:37:45-08:00	
Securing Bangladesh’s Energy Future: World Bank Offers Payment Gu...	In a move to stabilize energy supplies in Bangladesh, the World Bank (WB) has announced its commitment to supporting the country's access to affordable global energy resources. Abdoulaye Seck, the World Bank's Country Director for Bangladesh and Bhutan, recently reassured global suppliers about the WB's backing, offering payment guarantees to ease the procurement of gas. 'We tell suppliers: Global suppliers, don't worry, you can ship your gas to Bangladesh. We will back Bangladesh. You will not have any concerns about being paid,' Seck noted during a discussion held by the Association of Former Ambassadors at Bangladesh's Foreign Service Academy on November 6. This assurance comes as Bangladesh grapples with a growing energy demand amidst limited domestic resources and a foreign currency reserve crunch. The WB's guarantee could significantly lower Bangladesh's import costs, reducing risks for international suppliers and fostering an environment for more affordable gas imports. This initiative is part of the World Bank's broader support to Bangladesh's economy, with Seck emphasizing that securing gas at manageable costs remains the primary focus. Addressing Energy Supply Challenges Bangladesh has long been concerned with energy issues, which are expected to increase as industrial and residential demand rises. The current energy supply does not yet fully meet the growing demand, forcing Bangladesh to seek alternative energy sources to meet its immediate and long-term needs. Abdoulaye Seck highlighted the World Bank's intention to support Bangladesh through financial and advisory means. He also acknowledged the country's challenges in meeting its financial obligations, specifically in the energy sector, which impact energy import agreements with suppliers, including the Indian Adani Group. The WB's assurance of guaranteed payments to global suppliers is strategic in addressing these issues, particularly by enhancing supplier confidence. This guarantee could be a game-changer for Bangladesh as it seeks to lower energy costs. 'It means that the import price of Bangladesh will really go down,' Seck emphasized, underscoring the expected reduction in energy import costs if suppliers feel secure in receiving timely payments. Navigating Economic Pressures In the discussion, Seck pointed to Bangladesh's financial hurdles, noting the strain on the government's ability to meet payment obligations across multiple sectors, a reality evident in its energy import bills. He acknowledged the government's difficulties in balancing import costs with currency reserve management, which remains a pressing issue. The Bangladesh government has taken steps to negotiate support from the World Bank, especially as Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank, faces dwindling foreign reserves, which have reportedly dropped from over $40 billion to a much lower figure in recent years. This decline has been attributed to Bangladesh Bank's policy of supporting the exchange rate, which, according to Seck, has led to unsustainable outcomes. Recognizing the need for reform, Seck reiterated that the WB is poised to offer budgetary support focused on green growth, environmental sustainability, and economic resilience. Pivotal Budget Support and Long-term Growth Bangladesh's economic resilience depends heavily on maintaining strong foreign reserves and controlling inflation. Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), expressed optimism over the World Bank's decision to offer budget support rather than project-specific aid. He believes that budgetary support will strengthen Bangladesh's reserves and stabilize remittance flows. With remittances projected to exceed $2 billion, they play a crucial role in bolstering the country's foreign exchange reserves, which in turn stabilizes the local currency, the taka. In an economy heavily affected by inflation, the general public's quality of life is intricately linked to purchasing power. As Rahman observed, the interim government's performance will ultimately be judged based on citizens' standards of living and purchasing power. Addressing the inflationary pressures affecting Bangladeshi citizens is a key priority, and, as Rahman suggested, the WB's support is pivotal in sustaining economic stability. Driving Structural Reforms With the economic challenges mounting, the government has formed six reform committees focused on long-term improvements in financial governance, resource mobilization, and administrative reforms. Rahman highlighted that while these committees provide a foundation for reform, their success will largely depend on the technical, analytical, and financial support available to them. One of the most pressing areas for reform lies in domestic resource mobilization. Developing a digitalized, efficient domestic revenue system could help Bangladesh reduce its reliance on foreign aid and shore up its budget. As Rahman noted, such structural changes will require bold decision-making and sustained support from international partners like the World Bank. The WB's involvement is expected to go beyond immediate financial assistance, extending to a comprehensive assessment of the country's economy to identify areas needing reform. Rahman reiterated that, with the right support, these changes could set Bangladesh on a sustainable path, reducing dependency on international aid and strengthening its fiscal position. World Bank's Focus on Energy Security and Economic Resilience The World Bank's support for Bangladesh is not limited to budgetary allocations; it encompasses a vision for a more resilient and self-reliant economy. The WB's immediate focus on energy security is closely linked to Bangladesh's economic resilience, as energy shortages and high import costs have a cascading effect on productivity, inflation, and overall economic growth. Seck indicated that the WB is committed to providing extensive support across multiple sectors, including health and flood management, highlighting the organization's holistic approach to Bangladesh's growth. This support is timely as Bangladesh's economy faces challenges from global market volatility, climate change, and evolving social needs. Seck remains optimistic, asserting that Bangladesh, with the right policy adjustments and strong economic fundamentals, can return to a growth path that is both sustainable and robust. Ensuring Sustainable Economic Growth The WB's payment guarantee for energy imports is a critical step toward alleviating Bangladesh's energy challenges, but it is also part of a broader strategy to ensure sustainable growth. In the wake of these developments, Bangladesh is encouraged to prioritize economic reform, green growth, and social resilience. This focus on sustainability aligns with the WB's commitment to fostering long-term growth rather than merely addressing short-term concerns. The World Bank's ongoing budgetary support, slated for release by December, is intended to provide immediate financial relief while creating opportunities for Bangladesh to stabilize its economy. This support also aligns with the WB's green growth initiatives, which seek to integrate environmental sustainability with economic progress. As Seck noted, a comprehensive focus on policy reforms and green development can steer Bangladesh toward a sustainable future. Public Sentiment and Future Prospects For Bangladesh's citizens, inflation remains one of the most pressing concerns. The World Bank's support is expected to have a ripple effect across sectors, helping to alleviate inflationary pressures and improve living standards. However, much of the public's confidence in the government will depend on tangible improvements in their everyday lives, particularly in terms of purchasing power and economic stability. As Bangladesh moves forward with reforms and economic adjustments, the WB's involvement provides an essential safety net, ensuring that energy supplies remain secure and affordable. This partnership also underscores the importance of international cooperation in addressing global economic challenges, as Bangladesh's stability is crucial not only for its own citizens but also for the broader region. Conclusion The World Bank's payment guarantee for global gas suppliers is a bold step in addressing Bangladesh's energy and economic challenges. This initiative, combined with budgetary support focused on green growth, represents a holistic approach to Bangladesh's development. The WB's partnership aims to stabilize Bangladesh's energy imports, control inflation, and promote long-term growth through structural reforms. With international backing, Bangladesh is positioned to implement the necessary reforms to achieve sustainable economic growth and resilience, signaling a promising future for its citizens and the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4thWPNnBKx9F	2024-11-11T16:36:29-08:00	
Will Unrestricted Arms Supplies To Israel Continue Under Trump? –...	After US presidential elections on November 5, a question floating around the US and Middle Eastern capitals relates to Gaza, which has been devastated largely by US-supplied weapons, including fighter planes, air-to-ground missiles, battle tanks, armored personnel carriers (APCs) and 2,000-pound unguided bombs. Will the incoming Trump administration restrict weapons deliveries to Israel or continue the outgoing Biden administration’s policy of unrestrained arms supplies to the Netanyahu government causing more deaths and destruction? The guessing game continues. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the casualties so far include 43,391 plus killed, and at least 102,347 wounded in the Gaza Strip, including 59% women, children, and elderly, as of October 21, 2024. The issues before American voters at the presidential elections last week, where the Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris lost to Republican candidate Donald Trump, included the rising cost of living, the unrestricted flow of thousands of asylum seekers across the border into the US and Biden’s refusal to restrict arms sales to Israel despite country-wide protests. Democrats ignored Gaza The headline in an op-ed piece in the New York Times November 10 by Peter Beinart, a contributing Opinion writer and an editor-at-large of 'Jewish Currents', was on target: DEMOCRATS IGNORED GAZA, AND IT BROUGHT DOWN THEIR PARTY. 'Over the past year, Israel’s slaughter and starvation of Palestinians – funded by US taxpayers and live-streamed on social media—has triggered one of the greatest surges in progressive activism in a generation,' he wrote. Many Americans roused to action by their government’s complicity in Gaza’s destruction have no personal connection to Palestine or Israel, Beinart pointed out. Like many Americans who protested South African apartheid or the Vietnam war, their motive is not ethnic or religious. It is moral, he declared. Dr. Natalie Goldring, who represents the Acronym Institute at the United Nations, on conventional weapons and arms trade issues, told IDN the US government has been a stalwart supporter and defender of the Israeli government, and has been its most significant weapons supplier for several decades. 'But the reality is that US weapons supplies give Israel the capacity to continue prosecuting wars on multiple fronts. The Israeli government has defined its actions as self-defense in the aftermath of the horrendous Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Instead of acting in self-defense, the Israelis have carried out widespread indiscriminate attacks that have disproportionately affected civilians,' she said. $23 billion in US military aid to Israel The Watson Institute recently documented nearly $23 billion in US military aid to Israel and what it describes as related US operations from the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023 through the end of September 2024. These weapons included 2000-pound bombs, artillery shells, and precision-guided munitions. [See 'If the US government were willing to halt transfers of US weapons and ammunition to the Israeli government, that would cover the vast majority of weapons Israel receives. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) for example, from 2019-2023, the United States was responsible for nearly 70 percent of the dollar value of Israeli arms imports.' 'It’s also important to remember that US weapons manufacturers have a profit motive in continuing providing massive supplies of weapons to Israel. Weapons manufacturers aren’t neutral participants in these processes.' 'Unfortunately, the prospects for change weren’t good before the US presidential election, and are probably worse now. It seems quite unlikely that President Biden would finally stand up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and halt US arms transfers, for example.' 'And Prime Minister Netanyahu has little incentive to negotiate with President Biden, probably anticipating a friendlier reception from Donald Trump after his inauguration in January,' Dr Goldring declared. Zain Hussain, a Researcher at SIPRI told IDN the US is the most important supplier of major conventional arms to Israel. In 2019-2023, the US supplied 69% of Israel’s imports of major arms. This was comprised of aircraft, armored vehicles and missiles, among other things. The US, he said, sees Israel as a key strategic ally in the Middle East and a strong means of supporting US interests in the region. Enshrined in US law in 2008, it is committed to preserving Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region, which is Israel’s ability to counter and defeat any credible conventional military threat from states or from non-state actors, while sustaining minimal damages and casualties. 'As part of this consideration is the perceived need for Israel to have superior military means compared to other individual or possible coalition of states or non-state actors that could pose a credible conventional military threat to Israel.' The US has committed to providing $3.8 billion a year in financial military aid to Israel between 2019 and 2028. The Israeli and US arms industries engage in deep cooperation in different fields, including missile defence. This can be seen in Israel’s three-tiered air defence system: the Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Arrow, Hussain said. Israel has been dependent on the US for key military capabilities. All active combat aircraft of the Israeli air force are of US origin. Israel has also relied on the US for the supply of certain missiles and munitions, and one of the most important aspects of Israel’s defence, its air defence systems, also involves cooperation with the US. In times of conflict, US supplied arms have been crucial for Israel’s operations. In case of the current war in Gaza, US supplied aircraft, bombs and missiles have been indispensable for Israel’s operation, said Hussain. Dr Goldring pointed out that at the beginning of November, the government of Türkiye submitted a letter to the UN Security Council calling for an arms embargo against Israel, including both weapons and ammunition. The letter was signed by more than 50 states as well as the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It cited the Israeli government’s violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and argued that any country that sold weapons to Israel was complicit in genocide. 'Given that the US has a veto in the Security Council, the call for an international arms embargo on Israel is unlikely to be successful. Even so, the letter to the Security Council is an important statement about the international community’s growing concern about the nature and extent of Israeli attacks,' declared Dr Goldring. Meanwhile, in a statement released November 10, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, welcomed the reported freeze on the delivery of bulldozers to Israel as an 'implicit admission' by the Biden administration that the far-right Netanyahu government is using that equipment in the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. CAIR said the freeze on the bulldozers used in ethnic cleansing must be followed with an end to weapons deliveries to Israel. [NOTE: An editorial in the Israeli media outlet Haaretz today admitted that the 'Israeli military is conducting an ethnic cleansing operation in the northern Gaza Strip.'] According to Israeli media, the delivery of 130 D9 bulldozers to Israel was reportedly frozen because of use of the bulldozers to demolish homes in Gaza and Lebanon. According to the Watson report, U.S. arms deliveries to Israel, October 7, 2023 to September 2024 included the following: 4,127,000 kilograms JP-8 jet fuel; 57,000 155mm artillery shells; 36,000 rounds of 30mm cannon ammunition; 20,000 M4A1 rifles; 13,981 anti-tank missiles; 8,700 (Mk82) 500-pound bombs; 3,500 night vision devices; 3,000 Joint Direct Attack Munitions; 14,100 (Mk84) 2,000 pound unguided bombs; 3,000 laser-guided Hellfire missiles; 1,800 (M141) bunker buster bombs; 2,600 250-pound small diameter bombs; 200 Switch Blade (Series 600) drones; more than 100 Skydio X series drones and 75 Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4ot1sus-mdLf	2024-11-11T16:34:30-08:00	
Sino-US Relations May Face Intensified Strains Under Trump 2.0 – ...	The arrival of a second Trump administration is expected to drastically impact the complex fabric of Sino-American relations. Apparently, Beijing is acutely aware of what that could mean: heightened tensions and renewed confrontations on multiple fronts. Sino-American relations, already frayed, may face an era marked by intensified scrutiny, as Trump's rhetoric and policies often frame China as a strategic adversary rather than a partner in global stability. This trajectory is not without grave implications. The stakes here are monumental, touching every corner of the global economy and the daily lives of billions. Good relations between the U.S. and China mean shared prosperity, peace, and predictability. Yet the current bipartisan unity in Washington - to approach China with an hawkish angle - suggests otherwise. This unified American approach, rare in such polarized times, reflects the deepening shift in U.S. policy, a signal to Beijing that the trump administration may intensify this hardened stance, complicating any pathway toward constructive engagement. During the recent presidential campaign, there was an intense rivalry between Democrats and Republicans to be seen as 'tough' on China. For many politicians on both sides of teh divided, a 'soft' stance on China meant nearly a career-ending label. China was often mentioned in the recent bruising election season. For China, this campaign spotlight hints at potential for strategic adjustments in U.S. policy, despite the Americans' obvious trend toward toughness. Trump's stance on China has been strikingly consistent in its bluntness: he casts China as the villain behind America's economic woes, blaming U.S. 'weakness' for a perceived loss of manufacturing and blue-collar livelihoods. In a renewed Trump era, Beijing could expect a focus on trade balances, economic rivalry, and security cooperation - areas where Trump believes his brand of deal-making shines. He'd likely avoid contentious topics like human rights, which don't fit his transactional priorities. Instead, it's a style of diplomacy laser-focused on interests that directly impact the U.S. From China's perspective, this values-free pragmatism may offer clarity but little in the way of partnership or nuanced understanding - another reminder of the narrow lens through which he views the world. Following Trump's return to the world stage, President Xi Jinping extended a measured yet hopeful gesture, urging for a revival of diplomacy that recognizes the delicate but essential link between the U.S. and China. In his congratulatory message, Xi struck a careful balance, acknowledging the stakes of Sino-U.S. relations and advocating for a practical collaboration. 'History has shown,' he remarked, 'that a stable, sustainable China-U.S. relationship aligns not only with our mutual interests but with those of the global community.' Xi's words reflected Beijing's ongoing drive to rebuild the trade bridge with Washington through a framework of mutual benefit - a win-win approach that has served as the foundation of past U.S.-China economic ties. Amid heightened tensions, particularly with the recent U.S. and European tariff hikes on Chinese electric vehicles, Xi's message was clear: China remains open to dialogue and cooperation, even as Washington adopts a more protectionist stance. By extending this olive branch, Xi signals a willingness to work with the Trump administration, to find common ground, and to ease the strains of an escalating trade war—a nod to the potential for a pragmatic coexistence despite the challenges ahead. In his message to Donald Trump, President Xi Jinping offered a pragmatic framework to steer Sino-U.S. relations forward, proposing three guiding principles grounded in the notion that cooperation yields far greater benefits than confrontation for the world's two largest economies. Xi's proposal underscores the need for understanding each other's strategic motivations, addressing sensitive issues - such as Taiwan and the South China Sea - responsibly, and leveraging shared strengths to drive economic growth. With U.S.-China relations at a historic low, Xi's approach signals a pivot from the 'show of strength' rhetoric that has dominated recent years, urging Washington to prioritize common interests over zero-sum strategies. Beijing appears committed to dialogue, viewing it as essential for sustaining any productive relationship. Notably, bilateral working groups between China and the U.S. have continued, a testament to the resilience of diplomatic channels even amid strained ties. Through consistent, open communication, Xi suggests, both nations could recognize that their roles as global stakeholders demand collaboration on issues such as climate change, technological innovation, and global trade - areas where partnership could yield mutual gains rather than exacerbating rivalry. But as Xi's outreach underscores, the future of this relationship rests heavily on how Trump, a leader with a history of unpredictable foreign policy moves, will handle this delicate balancing act. The global dynamics have shifted significantly since his first presidency, and his approach this time could either alleviate or intensify global tensions. If Trump can embrace Xi's call for mutual respect and strategic cooperation, the outcome could foster not just bilateral stability but a positive ripple effect on global economic and political landscapes. The opportunity for progress is there, but it hinges on a recalibration toward a partnership that transcends narrow national interests for the broader, shared goal of global stability. Confrontation, as recent years have shown, yields no winners—only mutual setbacks. The U.S.-China trade war, launched in 2018, inflicted palpable damage on the American economy without truly addressing its underlying concerns. Instead of yielding breakthroughs, tariffs have strained industries on both sides, denoting the limitations of a high-tariff, protectionist approach. From Beijing's perspective, the way forward for a new administration is a pragmatic pivot toward expanded trade ties. If the U.S. genuinely seeks economic revitalization, it would be wiser to pursue cooperation over zero-sum tactics that deepen divisions. President Trump, a self-described pragmatist, might consider that mutual economic growth and stability are more feasible than continued escalation. While U.S. and Chinese interests diverge on some fronts, these differences need not preclude a workable arrangement that serves both sides. Beijing has consistently conveyed that it has no intention of displacing Washington's role on the global stage; rather, it seeks a 'peaceful coexistence' that acknowledges shared interests. After years of volatility, a recalibration that emphasizes coexistence could move the U.S.-China relationship forward in a constructive direction - one that benefits not just both nations, but the global community.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4vIGg4NdYvKo	2024-11-11T16:32:06-08:00	
India: Delays Homecoming In Chhattisgarh – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak On November 7, 2024, Padam Some (29), a top-ranking female Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) cadre, carrying a reward of INR 100,000 on her head, surrendered to the Police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Sukma District. Padam, a resident of Chhote Kedwal under the Chintalnar Police Station limits in Sukma District, was involved in Naxalite [Left Wing Extremism, LWE] activities in Thana Golapalli, Maraiguda, Kistaram, and the Chintagufa area. She was the 'president' of the Singhanamdagu Revolutionary People's Committee (RPC)'s 'Janatana Sarkar' (people's government of the Maoists) and used to be very active in the organization. On October 29, 2024, five CPI-Maoist cadres, including a female Maoist on whom a reward of INR 500,000 had been announced, surrendered in Bijapur District. Those who surrendered include Sushila aka Bujji aka Vimala Hemla, who served as an 'area committee member (ACM)' and had joined the organisation in 2009, in the children's wing of Maoists, and then worked as a 'militia' ('base force' a secondary force of the Maoists' people's army) member in 2013. She was mainly involved in firing on the Police party and Security Force (SF) personnel in January 2018 in Mutvendi village and in gun battles with Police in Pidmel, Jingaon, and Simepalli between 2018 and 2019. She was active till 2023. The other four were Sukhram Modiyam, Suddu Korsa, Lakku Farsa, and Sannu Madvi, who have been involved in serious criminal activities, including murder, attacking the Police, planting spike holes, digging roads, and using lethal weapons such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), for a long time. The surrendered Maoists were associated with the Aheri 'Area Committee' of Gadchiroli Division and the 'West Bastar Division Party', and included 'section commanders' of the Bandepara RPC 'militia' as well as the Bodlapusanar Grama Rakshaka Dalam (GRD) 'commander'. On October 25, 2024, six CPI-Maoist cadres carrying a combined reward of INR 2.4 million on their heads surrendered before SFs in Sukma District. The surrendered Maoists, who had been active in the district, were identified as Pawan aka Kamalu Hemla, Bandu aka Bandi Sodi, Kunjam Roshan akaMahadev, Dashru aka Kotesh Sodi, and the two women Maoist cadres Kamala aka Bandi Dudhi and Madvi aka Nagul Sushila. These recent incidents of surrender are among many more by the CPI-Maoist cadres, who have surrendered citing that they have been troubled by the discrimination, neglect and atrocities on tribals in the Maoist organization. They have also stated that they were influenced by the surrender and rehabilitation policy of the government and decided to leave the path of violence and return to the mainstream to live a peaceful life. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), at least 304 Naxalites have surrendered in Chhattisgarh in the current year, thus far (data till November 10, 2024). During the corresponding period of 2023, 159 Naxalites had surrendered in the state. Another, 28 Naxalitessurrendered in the remaining part of the year, taking the total to 187 through 2023. 182 Naxalites had surrendered in 2022 and 328 in 2021. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on Left Wing Extremism (LWE) across the country, at least 4,435 Naxalites have surrendered in the state. An analysis of the surrender data since March 6, 2000, suggests that around 96.39 per cent have taken place in the troubled Bastar Division Bastar Division, which is still considered a significant threat and the 'Final Maoist Bastion,' accounting for 4,275 surrenders, as compared to a total of 4,435 in Chhattisgarh. Such surrenders across the country stood at 17,180. The Bastar Division, spread over a geographical area of over 40,000 square kilometres, comprises seven of Chhattisgarh's 33 districts: Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, and Sukma. To facilitate the surrender of the Naxalites, some districts in the state launched specific initiatives to encourage insurgents to abandon their fight and to join the mainstream. Significantly, the Lon Varratu (a local Gondi dialect expression, meaning return to your home/village) Scheme was launched by Dantewada District Police on June 12, 2020, and it offered a range of incentives to encourage Naxalites to abandon their fight against the state and clear their names from Police records. So far 204 rewarded Naxalites have surrendered under this campaign, out of a total of 880 Naxalites who have joined the mainstream of society under this campaign (till October 21, 2024). Likewise, the Poona Narkom (a local Gondi dialect expression, meaning New Dawn) Scheme was launched by the Sukma District Police on August 9, 2021, and it offered medical facilities that were organised through medical camps in different places of the district, including the district headquarters, for the tribal villagers of rural areas, in collaboration with the district health department. Though the specific number of surrenders under the campaign have not been released, according to the SATP database, at least 436 surrenders have taken place Sukma district since then. Moreover, on February 15, 2024, Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai disclosed that the Chhattisgarh government had decided to launch amenities and welfare schemes for villages in Maoist-affected regions of the state. Sai announced the Niyad Nellanar, scheme which emulates the Centre's Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha AbhiyaN (PM-JANMAN)scheme, catering to the socio-economic welfare of particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs). The initiative, which has been taken from the local Dandami term meaning 'Your Good Village', extends essential services and welfare benefits through security camps in Bastar. The ambit of these benefits is to extend to the villages situated within a five-kilometres radius of security camps. Chief Minister Sai stated, 'These security camps will act as not only the police camps, but also as multi-faceted development camps wherein the government will ensure the availability of over 25 basic amenities besides extending the benefits of 32 individual-focused government schemes in the Maoist-affected villages… The government has provisioned an additional Rs.20 crore for this scheme and, if needed, more funds will be provided by both central and state governments.' In recent times, Bastar has seen the establishment of at least 14 new security camps, and these have been opened near the villages so that the people living within a radius of 5 kilometers will be provided the same facilities as the beneficiaries of the PM JANMAN Yojana implemented for special backward tribes. In these villages, all the families are provided housing facilities under the Prime Minister's Housing Scheme, ration cards to all, free rice, gram-salt, jaggery and sugar to all, 4 free gas cylinders under the Ujjwala scheme, Anganwadi (rural child care centre) and community hall, similar to the special backward tribes, Sub Health Centre, Primary School, Irrigation pumps including bore wells for irrigation of farms, hand pumps, solar pumps, sports ground in every village, free electricity, bank Sakhi (women trained to facilitate banking operations), ATM, skill development, forest rights lease, mobile tower, DTH and TV. Facilities including helipads and bus facility till block the headquarters are also to be provided. In the interim, on October 7, 2024, as a final offer for Maoists to shun violence and join the mainstream, Chief Minister Sai announced that his government would soon come up with a surrender policy incorporating the best practices implemented by different states. In the proposed policy, the surrendered Maoists would be housed together in a colony under central schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Sai disclosed, further, 'All surrendered Maoists could be housed together in such a colony, which could be in the district headquarters. They will be provided security in that place. It is still in a policy stage. Our deputy CM is visiting different states to study their surrender policy and incorporate the best practices. He has already been to Assam. They (surrendered Maoists) will be given jobs and training once the policy is introduced. We urge Maoists to join mainstream otherwise our forces from both Centre and state are fully prepared on the ground.' Meanwhile, on September 20, 2024, Union Home Minister (UHM) and Minister of Cooperation Amit Shah, while appealing to the Maoists to give up violence, lay down arms and surrender, set March 31, 2026, as the date to end Naxalism in the country. UHM Shah appealed to LWEs to abjure the path of violence and join the mainstream of society. Addressing 55 victims of Naxal violence 55 victims of Naxal violence , from Chhattisgarh under the aegis of Bastar Peace Committee at his residence in New Delhi on the same day, UHM Shah declared, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided that Naxal violence and ideology will be wiped out from the country. March 31, 2026, has been fixed as the last day of Naxalism in this country and I ensure that we will finish Naxalism before that… I want to appeal to those who have picked up guns to surrender. In the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir, many have surrendered and joined the mainstream. But if it does not happen, we will initiate operations and will ensure it is successful. Meanwhile, as many as 3,752 Naxalites have been arrested and 1,608 have been killed in the state in the current year, thus far (data till November 10, 2024). The number of surrenders of disillusioned Maoists are increasing gradually from the troubled Bastar division and erstwhile stronghold areas of the rebels in the state. With both the governments - state and union -comprehensively implementing the proposed surrender and rehabilitation policies, along with aggressive developmental initiatives, particularly in roads, infrastructure and communications, there is increasing likelihood that the remaining Naxalitesmay join the mainstream and lead a peaceful life in the state and across the country.

Myanmar’s Civil War And Its Implication For Regional Security – O...	The Myanmar civil war is the longest ongoing civil war in the world. The civil war dates back to the country's independence from British colonial rule in 1948. Armed conflict between various ethnic minority groups and the central government began soon after the country’s independence. In subsequent decades the war has been raging on. The civil war gained more momentum, especially in the late 20th century and early 21st century. The main reason for Myanmar's civil war can be attributed to the demand for autonomy or independence of different provinces by ethnic armed groups. The civil war intensified in response to the 2021 military coup toppling the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Analyzing the historical, ethnic, and political background, it becomes clear to us why the Myanmar civil war has been going on for so long. Wilson Center in their report cited several factors as the main reasons for this protracted war in Myanmar: a. Military coup, b. Hybrid regime, c. Failure of civil government, and d. ethnic history However, in this article we will discuss the current situation of the civil war in Myanmar. On 1 February 2021, Myanmar's military known as Tatmadaw overthrew the NLD government of Aung San Suu Kyi, elected in 2020, in a military coup and established a military junta. The elected government arrested President U Myint and state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. General Min Aung Hlaing, chief of the Tatmadaw forces, moved to the center of power. In response to the coup, on 16 April 2021, pro-democracy politician Min Ko Naing announced the formation of a National Unity Government (NUG). The NUG declared the People's Defense Force (PDF) as its armed wing. More than 30 armed rebel groups from various states in Myanmar expressed solidarity with the PDF. In September 2021, the National Unity Government declared a state of emergency across the country. They call the situation a 'defensive war of the people' against the military junta. After the declaration of war, clashes broke out across the country between PDF militias, various armed groups, and the military junta. Thus, after a temporary democracy, the country was once again embroiled in a devastating civil war. In October 2023, the civil war took a new turn when three ethnic minority armed groups joined forces to ally. The Arakan Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army formed the 'Three Brotherhood Alliance'. Currently, the Three Brotherhood Alliance is operating under the umbrella of the NUG and providing them with support on various fronts. On October 27, 2023, the Alliance launched an attack on the Tatmadaw. This attack was the beginning of Operation 1027. The main objective of this operation is to overthrow the military rulers from power. A regional security crisis is emerging as a result of Myanmar's civil war. The refugee crisis, drug and human trafficking, arms smuggling, etc. have created a very uncomfortable situation for Myanmar's neighboring states. As for China, some Myanmar scams center on China's border, which poses a threat to China's national and social security. According to a 2024 report by Crisis Group, these scam centers kidnap educated young women from different countries and force them at gunpoint to scam foreign nationals. These include Bitcoin scams, wildlife sales, drugs, etc. But the most common fraud is through embezzlement. Abductees are subjected to unspeakable torture in these scam centers, akin to modern-day slavery. These centers are largely controlled by the Chinese mafia, according to a 2023 report by the Associated Press. The newspaper claims that since Myanmar's military government receives a share of the income of these fraud centers, they do not take any strong action to suppress these illegal activities. The Chinese government has long been putting diplomatic pressure on the Myanmar junta to take action on the issue. However, the military did not take any visible action. The situation changed in October 2023 when ethnic armed groups went to war against the junta. The groups destroyed numerous scam centers near the Chinese border and freed kidnapped citizens as they seized towns and military posts in northern Shan State. On the one hand, the insurgents hope to destroy the relationships of these mafia groups with the military government and on the other hand, to get the support of China. The rebels handed the arrested criminals to Chinese custody to gain more support from China. Currently, they are imprisoned in various Chinese prisons. Also, there are several projects underway in Myanmar under China's Belt and Road Initiative, among which is the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor that stretches from Kunming in China to Mandalay in Myanmar. The corridor extends through central Myanmar, east to Yangon, and west to the Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone, which China helped build. By extracting gas from the Bay of Bengal, the Myanmar government transports it to Kunming, China through a 1,060 km long gas and oil pipeline from the deep-sea port established at Kyaukpyu. However, this economic corridor is supposed to be connected to China by highways and railways, but it has not yet happened. China signed a $7.3 billion deal with Myanmar to build the Kyaukpyu deep-sea port. According to the agreement, China will operate the port for the next 50 years with an option to extend it by another 25 years. According to experts, if China can complete the road and railway project, the Kyaukpyu Port will give China access to the Indian Ocean through the Bay of Bengal. China has long pressured Myanmar's junta government to reduce conflict in the region in consideration of these projects, which has created some tension between the Chinese and the Junta. India's role in Myanmar is different from that of China. India has two projects in Myanmar. These are the Kaladan Multi-Modal Project (KMMP) and the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Project (IMTTP). India is trying to establish regional connectivity with Myanmar through projects. The objective of KMMP is to develop connectivity with the Northeast region of India through Bangladesh and Myanmar. Also connects Kolkata Port in India with Sittwe Port in Myanmar and extends to Mizoram via the Myanmar Highway. The IMTTP aims to connect India's border town of Moreh with Thailand's Mae Sot via Myanmar. This will establish a land route for uninterrupted trade, business, education, and tourism between the three countries. As a result of Operation 1027, which started in October 2023, the projects are facing many delays. Besides, China's relationship with Myanmar has increased the strategic importance of Myanmar to India. China's growing political and economic influence within Myanmar, and its efforts to secure access to the Bay of Bengal through Myanmar, have become a cause for concern for India. China's establishment of the Sino-Myanmar Economic Corridor and the recent establishment of a surveillance facility on Myanmar's Coco Island in the Bay of Bengal have made India uneasy. China's emergence as a major source of foreign direct investment and China's position as Myanmar's largest trading partner has caused considerable concern for the Indians. Also, as a result of this war, there is an ongoing conflict between the Myanmar military and rebel forces on the border with Thailand. The two groups clashed in the strategically important Myawaddy on the Thai border, where the rebel Karen forces have withdrawn their troops. The war is having a 'spillover effect' on Thailand. A large number of people are fleeing to Thailand, both legally and illegally, to escape the military's persecution and conscription law in the war. There are currently 91,337 Myanmar refugees in Thailand. This has created many problems for Thailand's internal security. Thailand is trying to deal with the problem. Therefore, they together with the ASEAN member countries are searching for a solution. Historically, Bangladesh's relationship with Myanmar can be said to be complicated, especially on the Rohingya issue. Bangladesh has been providing shelter to Myanmar refugees for a long time. Currently, according to UNHCR data, 972,904 Rohingya refugees are staying in Bangladesh, which is affecting Bangladesh in various dimensions. Also, the recent infiltration of the Bangladesh border by the armed forces is a threat to the internal security of Bangladesh. Myanmar's civil war is currently quite uncertain. The military is losing ground very quickly. Only a handful of cities in the country are under military control which is unprecedented. We can imagine that the long period of misrule has motivated the people to stand up against the military. Apart from this, the other armed groups also found some degree of unity among themselves for the first time. However, the durability of this unity is questionable, as unity among so many groups has not lasted long in Myanmar's long history. But whatever the outcome of Myanmar's civil war, Bangladesh will have to work on strengthening its internal security, especially in dealing with the refugee crisis. Because even if the war ends which is highly improbable, sending back so many refugees is quite a challenge. In this regard, Bangladesh has to work together with the international community. Myanmar has been violating international law for several years. They have also done anti-humanities like genocide, especially on Rohingyas. Apart from this, they have often carried out mortar attacks inside Bangladesh, resulting in the casualties of many Bangladeshi citizens. This civil war is affecting Bangladesh as well as other neighboring countries of Myanmar. In this regard, Bangladesh should put diplomatic pressure on Myanmar by coordinating with these countries. Another notable point is that the Arakan Army is in a strong position in the Arakan state bordering Bangladesh. But, according to some news outlets like Al Jazeera, the Arakan Army itself does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens of Myanmar. The Arakan Army has also been accused of burning Rohingya houses and conducting genocide. However, the Arakan Army denied the allegations. If the Arakan Army takes full control of Arakan in the civil war or if the military forces collapse, then Bangladesh should negotiate with the Arakan Army for the rehabilitation of Rohingyas. Besides NUG can also sit in discussions with the interim government. However, doing so would make Bangladesh’s relations with Myanmar's junta government difficult. Bangladesh should monitor the war situation and maintain apparent neutrality. No matter which side wins the war, measures should be taken by keeping an eye on all sides for the sake of Bangladesh's national security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4jfWpNJh9WLg	2024-11-11T16:27:54-08:00	
India’s Path To Becoming A Global Manufacturing Hub: A Long Journ...	The setting up of Tata-Airbus plant in Vadodara (Gujarat), is the first private project in India for the manufacture of aircraft in India. The aircraft manufacturing facility set up by Tata Advance Systems Limited in collaboration with Airbus Defence and Space, Spain is part of India's attempt to become self–reliant in the manufacture and assembly of C-295 medium-lift tactical transport aircraft and to reduce foreign dependence. While inaugurating the plant, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, 'We are already working to make India an aviation hub. This ecosystem will pave the way for Made-in-India civil aircraft in the future.' India's quest to become a global manufacturing hub continues to face hurdles because of inadequate physical infrastructure, land acquisition challenges, complex regulatory procedures and supply chain bottlenecks. India continues to assemble products like mobile phones, as it has not created a manufacturing ecosystem like China. India continues to rely on China in many core sectors like electronics, solar and mobile manufacturing and its imports from China constitutes over 60 per cent of its requirements. India's Manufacturing Landscape: Achievements and Challenges Although India's manufacturing sector has made significant strides in recent years, however, it most of the plants set up in India in collaboration with Japan, South Korea and China stays heavily reliant on assembling components imported from countries like China, Taiwan, and the USA. This dependence on foreign components poses a challenge, particularly as international companies are often reluctant to share the technical know-how needed to produce high-end, sensitive equipment within India. As a result, India's efforts to close the gap with China are complicated. Estimates suggest it may take India 15 to 20 years to catch up with China, influenced by factors like economic policies, infrastructure, workforce skills, and geopolitical dynamics. For instance, in mobile phone production, India struggles with high defect rates with estimates suggesting a defect rate of around 50%, far higher compared to Chinese factories. India can become world's smartphone making hub, only when it starts manufacturing the parts in India. Unfortunately, India continues to rely on imported parts from China for the assembly because as it lacks an ecosystem of component manufacturers in the country. China remains the world's largest manufacturing nation, accounting for 28.7% of global manufacturing output. Even in the field of solar manufacturing, where India continues to make great strides, India depends on China for around 60% of its solar equipment. This reliance is largely due to China's dominance in the global solar supply chain, controlling 97% of polysilicon production and 80% of solar module manufacturing China's manufacturing process is built on decades of investment in infrastructure, skilled labour, and technological innovation. The country boasts a well-established supply chain, efficient coordination, and competitive costs, making it an attractive destination for global manufacturers. In contrast, India is still working on strengthening its logistics network, which remains less efficient than China's. Technological Gaps and Innovation While India has made progress in manufacturing, its role remains largely limited to assembly rather than the development of technologies. This is partly due to reluctance from international companies like Samsung and Apple, which have raised concerns about the quality of India's skilled workforce. Today, China leads in advanced technologies such as avionics, semiconductors, and high-end electronics. Significant investments in research and development (R&D) have fostered a thriving innovation ecosystem, with companies like Huawei and DJI leading the way. In contrast, India's focus has largely been on assembly, and a strategic shift toward R&D and innovation is crucial if India aims to catch up. Policy and Infrastructure Challenges China has received help from business-friendly policies, including tax incentives, subsidies, and relaxed regulations that encourage both domestic and foreign investment. India has introduced initiatives likeMake in India and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, but the implementation of these programs often faces challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, slow execution, and complex bureaucratic processes. China's infrastructure is a key driver of its manufacturing success. The country has invested heavily in its transportation network—roads, ports, and airports—ensuring smooth coordination and the efficient movement of goods. In contrast, India continues to grapple with significant infrastructural bottlenecks, including inadequate transportation networks, unreliable power supply, and inefficient ports. Addressing these issues will require substantial time and investment. Labor Force and Skill Development China's labor force is highly skilled, thanks to decades of investment in education and vocational training. The country has transitioned from being a low-cost labour market to one that supports sophisticated manufacturing processes. India must follow suit by investing significantly in upskilling its workforce to compete in high-tech sectors. In terms of R&D investment, China distributes a large part of its GDP to foster technological innovation. In 2022, China's R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 2.41%, compared to India's just 0.64%. This disparity reflects a wider gap in innovation ability. Additionally, India's private sector contributes only 36.4% of the country's gross expenditure on R&D (GERD), compared to 77% in China and the US. Geopolitical and Trade Considerations China's geopolitical strategies have bolstered its global trade relationships, positioning it as a dominant player in the global supply chain. While India's geopolitical position is improving, particularly through its growing trade partnerships and strategic alliances, it must navigate complex international relations and trade agreements to enhance its manufacturing prospects. As global manufacturing increasingly shifts toward sustainability, China has integrated green technologies into its processes. India must prioritize sustainable manufacturing practices to meet international environmental standards and improve its competitiveness in the global market. Defense Sector Disparities The defence sector gives another example of the gap between India and China. According to the Global Firepower Index, China spends $229 billion on defence, compared to India's $74 billion. China's naval fleet is also significantly larger, with 49 destroyers and 730 vessels, including 61 submarines and 3 aircraft carriers, while India's fleet consists of just 12 destroyers and 294 vessels, including only 18 submarines. This defence disparity underscores the broader difference in strategic development between the two countries, including in areas like research, innovation, and industrial capacity. India's air defence capabilities are also a concern, particularly with the growing threat of Chinese military advances. The Indian Air Force has struggled to meet its target of 42 squadrons, with delays in the supply of critical components like F-404 engines for its Tejas planes. This issue mirrors the challenges faced by China in securing advanced military technology from foreign suppliers, although China has responded by developing domestically produced jet engines, such as the WS-15, which now power its fifth-generation fighter aircraft. The Way Forward for India India must adopt a long-term vision supported by strategic investments and actionable plans to catch up with China and become a global manufacturing hub. This includes improving infrastructure, enhancing workforce skills, fostering technological innovation, and strengthening policy implementation. Addressing these issues systematically and sustainably will be essential for India to establish itself as a major player in global manufacturing over the next 15 to 20 years. Conclusion In conclusion, while India is making progress toward becoming a global manufacturing hub, it has a long way to go before matching the scale, sophistication, and technological capabilities of China. To close this gap, India needs to invest in infrastructure, R&D, labour development, and efficient policy implementation. Only with sustained efforts and strategic reforms will India be able to realize its vision of becoming a global manufacturing leader in the decades to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4h2qPcrdcRbS	2024-11-11T16:21:59-08:00	
Why Trump Has Always Been The Clear Choice – OpEd	Trump did not steal the 2024 elections; he won them with the resounding and thumping voice of the American people's victory in a powerful message of truth and will. He performed better than in 2016 and 2020 and completed a swing-state sweep, winning all the swing states of Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. Democrats warned that Trump and MAGA are hijacking democracy. Now, they must acknowledge the truth: the Trump movement, no matter how much it has been panned by many, is a powerful expression of democracy. The red wave and Donald J. Trump's victory marked the greatest political comeback in history, symbolizing the advent of the prospects of a new world peace and an end to global conflicts. It shows that despite billions of dollars of ads by the Democrats and top celebrity endorsements for Kamala, and the character assassination of Trump, the endless political witch hunt stretching back nine years, the two assassination attempts, two impeachments, and the 91 contested charges brought against him, Trump stands tall in staying true to his natural conviction and unyielding spirit to create a new wave of change for the American people and the world. Ordinary Americans are wise enough to see through these systemic barriers put in place to hold Trump and Trumpism back. He won more votes with key demographic groups compared to last time, including Hispanic Americans and younger voters, compared to Harris, who did poorer than Biden with women, urban voters, younger voters, and Hispanics. Kamala's overtures to the young and Gen Z voters never produced the intended outpouring of support she has hoped, despite the student loans move. The presidential result was brutal for Harris, also because she failed to bury Biden's ghost, and never had the ability to sell voters on the idea that she was the turn-the-page candidate, refusing to make a clean break from the last four years whereas the voters have long indicated that is what they wanted. She also failed to draw any distinction between herself and Biden, in identifying any specific ways her presidency would be different from him. By focusing on non-relating issues, including the state of the democracy and predominantly on abortion, she failed to connect with the resentments of the people and the real plight and sentiments dominating now even among the Democratic-leaning voters, which are on safety and economy. Considering that this election can be the platform to voice dissatisfaction against the Roe v Wade overturning by siding with Harris, women voters prefer the core issues of economic and personal safety, and they resonate with Trump's call for border security and fixing the economy. As Bernie Sanders put it, the Democratic Party has abandoned the working class. First, it was the working class, and now, the Hispanics and Black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, further worsened by the soaring inflation. Trump is now seen as the champion of the working class. The victory in retaking the Senate and Trump claiming the popular votes, the first Republican in two decades to do so, also point to the fact that pollsters and all the polls claiming this race to be a dead heat, and one where Des Moines Register/Mediacom put Harris as ahead in Iowa, a traditional Republican base: as yet again fast losing their credibility and relevance, just like in 2016. Exit polls show that the 'threats to democracy' were a top issue, and the mainstream media (MSM), which is traditionally left-leaning and Democrat-friendly, thought that meant votes for Kamala. It turns out that the opposite happened: voters are rejecting censorship, dishonesty, and bias in America. America fought and won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and established the rules-based order that preserved global stability. The US has maintained world peace for over 70 years since WWII and has paid the highest amount to secure world trade, maritime routes, and deterrence. This long peace comes at a cost, with the portrayal of the great American obligation for the spirit of freedom and democracy for the world. All Trump wants is for others to pay their equal burden and fair share for world peace. Harris argued for Trump to stop with the tired old playbook of hyping up the immigrant issue and running a dark and divisive campaign, but the rising migrant crime and millions of undocumented people let in by the Biden administration remain a sad reality. A nation is built on two common-sense factors: a clear border wall and direct control of people and dangerous goods coming in, and a common-sense election and voting norms of having voter ID. These are the principles of sovereignty and control at their most basic for any nation, and America paid the price for its inability to uphold the simplest facets of national security and territorial integrity due to the Democrats' misplaced belief that an open border is what made America great. A fractured voting system where illegal votes have been rampant threaten the fabric of a country and American democracy. More than 20 million illegal immigrants poured in from more than 180 countries,with more than 13,000 convicted criminals estimated to be already in America, with deaths and destruction from fentanyl, crime, and lost economic opportunities for the local everyday struggling Americans already suffering from the worst inflation in decades. The Democrats cast Trump's alleged assault on America's democracy as the greatest threat to America but disregard for voter ID and the ousting of Biden in an internal move are instead seen as the threats to America's democratic foundation. Why Trump Has Always Been the Clear Choice Let's remember his legacies and track record during his first term, when these facts and feats were often drowned in the anti-Trump rhetoric that had been played out for years. Trump's economic record remains the strongest justification for him, resonating with the plight suffered by the people under Biden. When he handed over power to Biden in 2021, he predicted that inflation and high energy prices would hurt the people and weaken America, and he was right. The economy was booming under the first Trump administration with his low tax and low regulations mantra, and a second Trump administration will see bigger tax cuts that will boost domestic production and create more high paying jobs. In his first four years, stock markets and 401(k) were high. Businesses were easier to form, and jobs were returning. Inflation was almost at its lowest, and the sense of economic optimism and unity from both sides of the aisle was at its highest. Trump saved tens of millions of lives worldwide with Operation Warp Speed, in getting the vaccines ready in record time. Trump helped America build its strongest economy in history. Median household incomes rose to their highest level ever in 2019, while the poverty rate hit an all-time low. Under the Trump Administration, more Americans were employed than ever before, numbered at 160 million, and the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Americans without a high-school diploma all hit record lows, while the Trump 'Blue-Collar Boom' saw wages grow faster for workers than for managers or supervisors. Trump signed the largest relief package in American history to protect workers and families from economic devastation during Covid. The American economy surged back to life within months, seeing record growth and job gains. Trump returned law and order to the American people, and would be tough on crime in the new term. He brought the abortion decision back to the states and overturned Roe v Wade, the first in more than five decades. The pro-life stance started a new opening to save the lives of the unborn. Energy independence was achieved, where reliance is no longer on oil-rich countries in the Middle East, and America is now the biggest energy producer in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. Under the new term, America will soon be an energy dominant country, with common sense utilisation of the vast black gold under the feet of Americans and with the 'drill, baby drill' mantra. In Trump 2.0, the fundamental economic problem plaguing the country will be addressed, starting by cutting energy prices in half within his first year. The appointment of three Supreme Court justices, and hundreds of federal judges, that have been confirmed during his tenure further sealed his legacy. He also oversaw the greatest transformation in the criminal justice reform, a feat where even Obama failed to pass. Border security was among the best in a very long time, and the greatest tax cut since Reagan has enabled manufacturing jobs to return. The military has been rebuilt, and veterans' welfare and support capacity have been prioritized. The Space Force has been created, providing the US with new space dominance for decades to come. When Biden-Harris took over the leadership, the economy got worse. Trump was right when he predicted, way before the 2020 Elections, that if Biden-Harris were to get elected, energy prices and inflation would be through the roof. 65% of Americans cannot afford to own a home, and 800,000 Americans lost their jobs last year. Instead, 1.2 million non-citizens took those jobs. Energy prices and crime were also through the roof. More than ten thousand manufacturing jobs were lost last month alone. Businesses are leaving because of high tax and high regulations, and with the tariff in place under Trump 2.0, they will be coming back to America and new manufacturing bases will sprout in America. Americans are struggling in their daily life with spiking inflation and cost of living and houses, and thousands are dying monthly from fentanyl, but yet the Biden-Harris administration has failed to address these effectively. Trump is being seen as a resonating and honest personality in doing what is right for the country. Under Trump, the stock market and the economy were better off than before Covid era when he left office. Instead, Biden took credit for bounced back jobs. Harris focused on short-term political returns with her left-leaning economic policies, which were enticing, but Trump focused on the larger picture of long-term economic returns based on low taxes and regulations. More money is given to Ukraine to defend democracy, but America's own border crisis is ignored. Ukraine received 250billion dollars, but Europe paid 150billion less. Trump forced NATO to pay more, saving billions of dollars of American taxpayers' money. He also reviewed and withdrew from global memberships including Paris Climate Accords that are weakening America and putting it at a disadvantage, mostly in constraining America's economic potential through green and carbon obligations. In contrast, other countries are allowed to have bigger leeway. For years,America was ripped off by foreign powers. While their cars dominate the American market, other countries are not accepting American cars. Trump's tariff is the saviour of the American economy long held hostage by other countries. This tariff will protect American businesses, get other countries to stop their dumping and market distortion that have obliterated American workers' interests, encourage more companies to shift and start their operations in America, and give new tax cuts to American enterprises. All these will create new jobs and confidence, fix the American coffer bleed, and negate the dependence on China. This will stop overexposure to globalist movements and greater vulnerabilities to Beijing and Europe's new trade maneuvers in choking America. The left focused on the low-hanging fruits in the causes of abortion, student loans, and other free entitlements and pointed out MAGA as the threat to these issues. Trump could have chosen the easier populist route by altering the positions on these causes, but instead remained steadfast in real issues that affect everyday Americans: crime, economy, safety, border security, family and religion, and individual freedom from fear. Trump will fix the ballooning federal government size and bureaucracy, trim it down, and save billions of dollars through common-sense restructuring and tackling wastages, incompetencies, and corruption. He would also dismiss bureaucrats and politicians whose woke influence has stifled the country's true growth, and he would return education and school choice policies to the states. Trump takes a tough stance on crime for the safety of Americans and to empower the police to carry out their responsibilities, while the Biden administration has caused crime to skyrocket and left the police weakened by defunding the police movement and sanctuary cities. Incompetent, typical politicians who have been in the system and establishment for years would be replaced by merit-based experts who know the ground best. Elon Musk remains a case in point, with a potential new role in trimming the federal government and reducing expenses. Trump took the beating for pointing out the truth affecting America and its people. He took a bullet and faced persistent years-long attacks on his credibility and character, from a fake Russia investigation to the endless political witch hunt and character degradation. Peace Through Strength and New Advent of Global Peace Trump's America First agenda has been panned by the Democrats and the world over, but it brought unconventional approaches and returns to both America and the world through relative peace and stability. The world is safe because of Trump. His peace through strength mantra has kept the world peaceful and deterred aggression from even the harshest enemies. Under his watch, no major conflicts or wars happened, and he stopped war-mongering neocons. Biden-Harris' weak administration saw the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal with the loss of 13 American soldiers and 85 billion dollars of military equipment left behind. This weakness led to the mushrooming of new alliances and actions that threatened and violated international law and the rules-based order. The Afghanistan withdrawal weakened America's standing and resolve and led to renewed power flexing, as shown by Putin, Kim, and Xi. The Ukraine war and the various instabilities across the world that are now happening would have been prevented. Despite the casting of Trump as weakening America's global standing via his treatment of allies and withdrawal from multilateralism and globalism, Trump fixed the cancerous plague that has held America back with smart and common sense foreign policy that has benefitted everyday Americans through fixing the manipulations by other powers and rebuilding the military with Space Force, taking care of the veterans and regaining America's military strength. Clear deterrence was established, and aggression by other powers was deterred. For 18 months, no American was killed by the Taliban under Trump. Trump never left a vacuum in global dominance, he strengthened the US position through military and economic rebuilding at home. During the initial period of his presidency, when he took over from Obama, the predominant threat at that time was the growing belligerence and nuclear danger from Pyongyang, which Trump inherited. He managed to settle the mess with his unconventional approach. In other words, Trump has indeed Made America Great Again and the world safe again, and will do it again with this greatest political comeback in the history of the world. Hopes are highest that he will end the Ukraine war and the conflicts in Gaza and West Asia once and for all and bring peace to the regions, as he has proclaimed to do. Trump has always focused on the core issues that matter to the American people at large: a sense of economic and personal safety and security and the sense of appreciation and role in taking America back and securing its future while also safeguarding America's role in keeping the world safe and preventing World War III. The choice for the 47th President of the United States has always been clear, and he has proven it on a historic day for the country and the world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4imLmjAsogzc	2024-11-11T16:19:17-08:00	
Anti-Haitianism: A Hemispheric Rejection Of Revolutionary Blackne...	From the United States to the Dominican Republic to the Bahamas, the collective scapegoating and mass deportation of Haitians for political gain lays bare a particular kind of anti-Blackness. On September 25, 2024, Democratic representative Steven Horsford introduced House Resolution 1500 on the floor of Congress. The intent of the resolution was to censure Republican Congressman Glen Clay Higgins of Louisiana over a social media post that amplified false claims made by former president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance that Haitian immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. In a post on X responding to an Associated Press article about Haitians in Springfield filing charges against Trump and Vance, Higgins wrote: 'Lol. These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters... but damned if they don't feel all sophisticated now, filing charges against our President and VP.' He continued: 'All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th.' Higgins later deleted the tweet but the damage was done. Condemnations flooded in, followed by the resolution to censure the congressman. Such comments and lies reflect the worst white supremacist stereotypes about Haiti and Haitians. Broadly, anti-Haitianism consists of actions, beliefs, outcomes, policies, political strategies, and practices that reify the negative connotations associated with Blackness and Haitian identity. Trump and Vance both used the admittedly false anti-Haitian rumor as a form of anti-Black, anti-immigrant fear mongering to garner political support. Examples of such strategies abound. In September 2021, for instance, U.S. Border Patrol agents appeared to whip Haitians in Del Rio, Texas amid a crackdown at the border that resulted in the largest mass expulsion of asylum seekers in recent U.S. history. Between January 2021 and February 2022, the United States expelled or deported over 20,000 Haitians. During the same period, more than 5,000 Haitians were deported from other countries, about half of them from the Bahamas. Anti-Haitianism, of course, is not limited to the United States. It is a regional and hemispheric phenomenon. Within scholarly and informed circles, the best known example of this form of political domination, marginalization, racism, and anti-Blackness is in the Dominican Republic. In his study of race and politics, Ernesto Sagás analyzes how Dominican political elites use race and antihaitianismo to 'construct national myths and then use these myths to stymie challenges to their hegemony.' As Sagás explores, the national myth undergirding Dominican statehood was that the Dominican Republic was the most Spanish colony in the so-called New World. After Haiti's occupation of Santo Domingo from 1822 to 1844—which liberated enslaved people, guaranteed Haitian freedom and independence, and culminated in Dominican independence—the Dominican Republic solidified its distance from Blackness and Haitian identity. Antihaitianismo then developed as an ideology based on anti-Black prejudices, stereotypes, and myths about Haitians and people of Haitian descent. Antihaitianismo, Sagás writes, scapegoats Haitians for problems within Dominican society and considers Haitians to be culturally and racially inferior Black sub-humans. Antihaitianismo was violently on display in Dominican society in the 1937 genocidal massacre of tens of thousands of Haitians at the orders of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo. More recently, in 2013, the country's highest court issued a ruling, locally known simply as la sentencia, that not only upheld a constitutional amendment that abolished birthright citizenship but also retroactively stripped the citizenship of more than 200,000 Black Dominicans of Haitian descent, rendering them stateless. Beginning in 2015, tens of thousands were forced out of the country. Now, Dominican President Luis Abinader has announced plans for a new round of mass deportations. 'A Certain Kind of Black' In my book project, Anti-Haitianism in Paradise: Marginalization, Stigma, and Anti-Blackness in the Bahamas, part of the 'Black Lives and Liberation' series from Vanderbilt University Press, I build on Sagás's work and use anti-Haitianism to articulate the unique form of oppression Haiti and people of Haitian descent experience. In other words, I am wresting the idea and reality of anti-Haitianism in the Dominican Republic, applying it to varying social contexts, and broadening the theory to explain what anthropologist Gina Athena Ulysse—in reference to the racist treatment and degradation of Haitians in other parts of the world—refers to as 'the rejection of a certain kind of Black.' The Bahamas, a small, predominantly Black Caribbean archipelago nation, has a history of anti-Haitian actions. Haitians have migrated to the Bahamas since the era of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1803). Yet on November 9, 2019, members of a Bahamian nationalist group called Operation Sovereign Bahamas protested outside a gymnasium housing hundreds of victims of Hurricane Dorian. The devastating Category 5 hurricane hovered over Grand Bahama for 24 hours starting on September 1, 2019, flooded much of the island, and mostly submerged the Abaco Islands, rendering these areas uninhabitable. Haitians who had been living in informal settlements in Abaco were displaced. Two months later, the Operation Sovereign Bahamas demonstrators called on the Bahamian government to evict the displaced people taking shelter at the gymnasium. 'The Bahamas is for Bahamians,' the group's founder, Adrian Francis said, according to Bahamian news service Eyewitness News Bahamas. Other members of the group held Bahamian flags and shouted at evacuees, presumably of Haitian descent, 'Go home!' 'Repatriation!,' and 'We want you out of our country!' This scene came after the same civic group had held a well-attended town hall meeting on October 4, 2019 in New Providence, Bahamas titled 'Eradicating Illegal Immigrants in the Bahamas, Shanty Towns Down.' Cyclical White Supremacy Anti-Haitianism operates as an ideology rooted in anti-Blackness, nationalism, political domination, and marginalization. We can also see anti-Haitianism expressed as a set of practices. But what is the relationship between antihaitianismo in the Dominican Republic and anti-Haitianism in the Bahamas? As in the United States, political elites in both nations use anti-Haitianism as a strategy, suggesting that both African-descended nations are structurally anti-Haitian. When Black Dominicans of Haitian descent were forced to leave the Dominican Republic in 2015 due to la sentencia, it was partly done by the party in power as a move to garner political capital. Another dimension of anti-Haitianism is that these nations express and exert their sovereignty through anti-Blackness. In the wake of Hurricane Dorian, the Bahamas repatriated 228 Haitian migrants, 153 of whom had lived in hurricane-ravaged Abaco. Many Haitian residents of Abaco lived in informal settlements, locally called shanty towns, and had unexpired work permits that granted them legal status in the country. When majority Black nations assert their sovereignty through anti-Haitianism, they extend the spirit of white supremacy and anti-Blackness, traditions previously exerted on the ancestors of Bahamians and Dominicans through slavery. These cycles also expose the cyclical nature of white supremacy and the durability of anti-Blackness. Anti-Haitianism in Hemispheric Perspective Reflecting its hemispheric dimensions, anti-Haitianism has also developed into an important type of anti-Blackness informing other types of Blackness within nations in North America, the Caribbean, and South America. Regine O. Jackson's 2011 Geographies of the Haitian Diaspora discusses how Haitian migrants and their progeny have served in the past and present as repugnant cultural 'others' in relation to the citizens of Jamaica, Guadeloupe, and Cuba. In Haiti, in the wake of the 2010 earthquake, a United Nations-introduced cholera outbreak claimed nearly 10,000 lives and adversely affected more than 820,000 people. The United Nations remains unaccountable and unpunished for this human rights catastrophe. In addition, much earthquake aid did not go to Haitians but to donors' own civilian and military entities, UN agencies, international NGOs, and private contractors, suggesting that humanitarian aid can be wielded as an anti-Haitian weapon. And in Brazil, scholars Denise Cogo and Terezinha Silva have observed the racist treatment of Haitians who were encouraged to migrate the country in the post-earthquake period to work as laborers ahead of the 2016 Olympics. The adverse experiences of Haitians in Brazil—home to the largest Black population in the Americas—expose the linkages between labor extraction, anti-Blackness, and anti-Haitianism. Anti-Haitianism also serves other purposes within these examples, such as identity construction. The peoples of the Bahamas, Brazil, the Dominican Republic and other countries construct their identities as superior in relation to Haitian identities, producing anti-Haitian outcomes. The fact that Haitians have still not been compensated by the United Nations for cholera-related illness and death, and that the people who caused the epidemic have not been punished through Haitian or international law, reflects how Haitian lives are not only considered expendable but also unworthy of justice. While we must consider differences in the local histories, socioeconomic conditions, and political situations of the Bahamas, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and elsewhere, a clear anti-Haitian pattern emerges in the wake of the 2010 earthquake. This pattern, on display in the news and scholarly publications, includes alienation, death, expulsion, elimination, humiliation, marginalization, and stigmatization. Also, while these majority Black nations are subject to anti-Blackness, all these countries promote a unique form of anti-Blackness that specifically adversely affects Haitians. This should remind us that all that is Black is not the same type of Black, reflecting hierarchical and differentiated Blackness. Anti-Haitianism is, in other words, an expression of a rejection of the Blackest of the Black—a revolutionary Blackness that demands freedom, equality, and dignity, but remains collectively punished and stigmatized.

Mind Meets Market: The Psychological Foundations Of Political Eco...	Political psychology and political economy, though distinct fields, are deeply interconnected. Political psychology explores cognitive biases, social influences, and motivations shaping individual political behavior, while political economy examines how economic frameworks impact political power, governance, and societal welfare. Together, these fields reveal how psychological factors influence economic policies and how economic conditions impact political attitudes and actions. Historical Context and Foundational Theories The relationship between economics and politics dates back to early thinkers like Adam Smith and Karl Marx. Smith, in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and The Wealth of Nations (1776), explored how personal interests and social influences shape economic behavior and, consequently, political structures. Marx's materialist conception in Das Kapital (1867) posited that economic conditions—defined by class relations—are foundational to political authority and societal change. These early frameworks laid the groundwork for understanding the psychological motivations driving economic behavior and political outcomes. In the 20th century, the rise of behavioral and cognitive psychology reshaped political psychology, with thinkers like Herbert Simon and Amos Tversky pioneering studies in bounded rationality and cognitive biases. Simon's concept of 'bounded rationality' highlighted that decision-makers often operate with limited information and cognitive constraints, which affect economic and political choices. Tversky and his collaborator Daniel Kahneman further examined how heuristics influence risk assessment, anchoring, and loss aversion—key aspects that often shape political and economic decision-making processes. Behavioral Insights into Political Economy Behavioral economics, grounded in insights from political psychology, investigates how biases and heuristics affect economic policy decisions. For example, the concept of prospect theory developed by Kahneman and Tversky suggests that people assess gains and losses asymmetrically, often preferring to avoid losses rather than achieve equivalent gains. This loss aversion can influence policy choices, as policymakers may prioritize short-term economic stability over long-term growth to avoid the political repercussions of economic downturns. Additionally, Robert Jervis's work on misperception and security dilemmas in international relations shows how cognitive biases affect economic diplomacy and international trade. Misperceptions can lead to an overestimation of threats, shaping protectionist policies and impacting global economic cooperation. Social Identity and Economic Inequality Social identity theory, introduced by Henri Tajfel, emphasizes the psychological need for individuals to affiliate with social groups, impacting political attitudes and preferences. Economic inequality exacerbates social divisions, often fostering in-group and out-group dynamics that manifest in political preferences and party affiliations. Economic conditions thus interact with social identities to influence voting behavior, as demonstrated by the work of Shanto Iyengar and Donald Kinder on how racial and economic identity shapes political attitudes. The relationship between economic inequality and political psychology becomes particularly evident during periods of economic crisis. Economic hardship often triggers a psychological sense of threat, increasing support for populist and nationalist movements. This trend, as highlighted by Thomas Piketty in Capital in the Twenty-First Century, underscores how perceptions of inequality influence political movements, as economically disenfranchised groups seek representation through populist leaders who promise economic redistribution. Political Beliefs and Economic Systems Political psychology helps explain how personal values and cognitive biases shape preferences for different economic systems. The work of Milton Friedman on free-market economics and John Maynard Keynes on interventionist policies show that personal ideologies and psychological leanings—such as tolerance for risk, openness to innovation, or aversion to uncertainty—play a role in shaping economic beliefs. Studies on authoritarian and democratic personalities by Theodor Adorno and Erich Fromm further illustrate that individual psychological profiles correlate with preferences for centralized versus market-based economies. For instance, those with authoritarian-leaning personalities may favor a regulated, hierarchical economic system, seeing it as more predictable and orderly. Conversely, individuals high in openness and tolerance for ambiguity may be more inclined to support market-driven economies, seeing them as fostering innovation and diversity. Policy Implications: Understanding Decision-Making In practical terms, the intersection of political psychology and political economy has important implications for policy-making. Policymakers' cognitive biases can lead to flawed economic judgments, especially when they rely on intuitive rather than analytical thinking. Jonathan Haidt's research on moral foundations, for example, shows how deeply held moral beliefs impact policy preferences and economic legislation, with implications for policies on welfare, taxation, and social services. Recognizing these biases can help policymakers implement strategies that counteract overly risk-averse or ideologically rigid decisions. Economic policies also shape psychological well-being and societal stability. The concept of 'relative deprivation,' developed by Samuel Stouffer, explains how perceived economic inequality, rather than absolute wealth, influences satisfaction and political stability. This notion is central to understanding political unrest, as economic policies that fail to address perceived injustices can exacerbate social tensions and lead to political instability. Conclusion The intricate relationship between political psychology and political economy underscores the importance of integrating psychological insights into economic policy and vice versa. As economic conditions influence political attitudes and identity, psychological factors shape preferences for different economic systems. This interplay highlights the need for policymakers to consider both economic structures and psychological motivations in order to foster more resilient and inclusive societies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfG63oAAbpB4hTLGxm2h2nz	2024-11-11T16:12:18-08:00	
Ideological Agenda Of Russian Information Influence In Africa – A...	By Olena Snigyr (FPRI) -- Russian information operations in Africa are multidimensional, malleable, and opportunistic. It is hard to find a sphere of social life where Russians are not present—from daily life of small villages to cooperation in the nuclear sphere and space industry. The content of Russian communication is designed to be efficient in all dimensions of information environments of the target countries, and it is presented by three groups of actors: Russian top government officials, the Russian Orthodox Church, and representatives of Russian public diplomacy including Rossotrudnichestvo, Russkiy Mir Foundation, and other organizations. While the content of communication and its style differs depending on the group of communicators and the target audience, a general frame of a grand narrative, and even ideological framework, exists particularly for the African countries. Decolonization. Dewesternization. Modernization. Russian official communication carried out by top diplomats and by President Putin himself is built on the basic Russian strategic narrative. This narrative focuses on the necessity to tear down the existing, Western-led system of international law and institutions to create a new multipolar world order. Russia presents this narrative to African countries as the idea of fighting against Western neocolonialism and finishing the process of decolonization. This is a grand and multilayered framework that covers narratives in a broad number of spheres: from international politics and economics to historical memory and the ideational part of Russian information operations. First and foremost, Russian authorities, using the existing decolonial discourse, insist that the economic success of Western countries is not due to the competitive advantages of liberal democratic systems but to Western neocolonialism. In other words, the West, through spreading Western governance models, created a world order that allows it to continue exploiting its former colonies and other countries. Thus decolonization means dewesternization, which according to Russian expectations presumes political rapprochement with Russia and recognition of Russia’s 'discourse power' or 'right to speak.' In official interstate communication with African countries, the Russian authorities adhere to a black-and-white approach, pitting Russia against the West, and declare that partnership with Russia will provide the benefits of modernization and protection. The goal of Russian information influence in Africa is to widen the area of shared knowledge and values. Therefore, educational and scientific cooperation, Russian language and culture training programs, and training for journalists are an important part of Russian information operations through which Russia expands its circle of sympathizers and disseminators of Russian narratives and ideas. The narrative about 'modernization with Russia' rests on a fruitful ground of persistent African poverty despite resource wealth. Russia declares that its approach to partnership with African countries differs from the Western one due to the intention to share knowledge to help in modernization. Published data of such cooperation looks quite modest. For instance, only about 35,000 African students are studying in Russian universities, and the Russian-African Network University, created in 2021, engages 75 Russian and 27 African participants (11 of which are from Zimbabwe). However, Russia effectively promotes itself—even with such modest initiatives—and expands cooperation in areas of interest to African countries. An example is the establishment of the public professional association of technical universities of Africa Consortium of Universities 'Subsoil of Africa' at St. Petersburg Mining University in 2023. The collaboration involves over 130 organizations from 42 African countries. Participation is presented by African voices as an opportunity to cooperate with partners 'whose philosophy is different from that one of the West' (Tjekero Tweya) and as an initiative that will help 'to develop the full value chain of the mineral sector in Africa without being slavishly dependent on the West' (Paul Omojo Omaji). The narrative about 'Russia as a protector and stabilizing force' embraces three main messages: 1) Russia is a protector of African countries’ interests by advocating for fairer representation in the UN and protecting political regimes from foreign interference; 2) Russia supports traditional values in African societies by countering liberal influences; 3) Russia will support allied political regimes by all necessary means (including military assistance). The UN possesses an important role in Russian international communication in general and with African countries in particular. Referring to the principle of sovereign equality, written in Article 2 of the UN Charter of 1945, the Russian leadership promotes the concept of 'democratization of international relations,' which—in the Russian interpretation—means the inviolability of authoritarian regimes and impunity for their leaders regardless of human rights and international law violations. It is worth noting that although Russian leadership, including Putin himself, declares the invalidity of international humanitarian law, Lavrov in his communication with the African countries persistently mentions international humanitarian law as an important instrument of international relations. However, he notes that the US themselves do not recognize the authority of International Criminal Court by obstructing investigations into 'Washington’s possible war crimes in Afghanistan.' Combining the concept of 'democratization of international relations,' or literally the inviolability of political regimes, with the idea of protection of traditional values, Russia undermines the idea of the universal character of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Russian strategic narrative about the 'conflict of values' adds ideational features to Russian information influence in general. As to African countries, it may be suggested that Russia is testing its ideological influence there, spreading two main narratives: Messianic role of Russia as a liberator, decolonizer, and protector. Thus Russia’s foreign policy goal of preserving the status of a world power is interpreted ideologically through the idea of ​​the existence of Russia as a civilization that has a mission to save humanity; therefore, any Russian actions become legitimate and whitewashed in the eyes of supporters of this idea. Contradistinction of liberal values to traditional values. The modern Russian ideology is based on the concept that liberal values ​​are the main evil for humanity; therefore, Russia has a mission to protect traditional values. Russkiy Mir Exploring the content of Russian communication directly in the information space of African countries, it is safe to say that one of its goals is the spread and popularization of elements of the revamped Russian ideology. There are three main Russian institutions, responsible for the dissemination of Russian ideas among citizens of African countries: the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), Rossotrudnichestvo, and the Russkiy Mir Foundation (RMF). The declared mission of the ROC, Rossotrudnichestvo, and the RMF is to strengthen Russia’s influence in the world, to promote the Russian language, and to spread the idea of the Russian World (Russkiy Mir). On December 29, 2021, the ROC decided to establish its own exarchate in Africa, encompassing all African countries. Today, it reports the presence of communities and parishes in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, South Africa, Tanzania, the Central African Republic, Namibia, Kenya, Uganda, Togo, Malawi, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar, South Sudan, Cameroon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Ghana, Gabon, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, and Côte d’Ivoire. The ROC is optimisticabout expanding its presence on the African continent, viewing Africa as an undeveloped territory receptive to Russian influence. Rossotrudnichestvo and the RMF have significantly increased and expanded their presence in Africa over the past four years too. Just this year, Rossotrudnichestvo officially formalized its operations by signing agreements to establish partner 'Russian Houses' in seven African countries: Nigeria, Guinea, Somalia, Sierra Leone, the Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, and Equatorial Guinea. Additionally, Rossotrudnichestvo has expressed intentions to sign similar agreements with organizations in Cameroon, Angola, Namibia, South Africa, and Mozambique. Such agreements represent only the visible part of Russia’s presence in these countries, often serving as the formalization of an already well-established network of influence. For example, the Russian House in CAR is widely regarded as a humanitarian front for the activities of the former Wagner Group. Similarly, the yet unofficial Russian House in South Africa reflects Russia’s long-standing and traditionally strong presence in the region. The declared activity of RMF is focused primarily on the popularization of the Russian language. Though Africa has never been a target region for the RMF, today the Foundation is present in ten countries—Egypt, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Madagascar, Congo, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, and Uganda. Promoting the idea of the Russkiy Mir in African countries may seem like an overly ambitious goal. However, it is important to consider how the Russians themselves understand and advance this concept. The RMF website defines Russkiy Mir as follows: '[It] is not only Russians, not only our compatriots in the countries of the near and far abroad, emigrants, people from Russia and their descendants. It is also foreign citizens who speak Russian, study or teach it, all those who are sincerely interested in Russia, who care about its future.' The concept of Russkiy Mir has undergone significant evolution since its inception in the late 1990s, and it now serves as a framework for legitimizing Russian interference in regions deemed to be within Russia’s sphere of interest, under the pretext of 'protecting' members of the Russkiy Mir community. Notably, it now includes 'compatriots,' who are effectively denied the option of renouncing this status and also those currently subject to Russian informational influence.[1] The most clear definition of the concept of Russkiy Mir was proposed at the cathedral congress held on March 27, 2024, under the leadership of Patriarch Kirill, the head of the ROC. This definition fully encapsulates the meaning and scope of the Russkiy Mir ideology: Russia is the creator, supporter, and protector of the Russian world. The borders of the Russkiy Mir as a spiritual and cultural-civilizational phenomenon are significantly wider than the state borders of both the current Russian Federation and the greater historical Russia. Along with representatives of the Russian ecumene scattered throughout the world, the Russkiy Mir includes all those for whom the Russian tradition, the shrines of Russian civilization, and the great Russian culture are the highest value and meaning of life. The highest meaning of the existence of Russia and the Russkiy Mir it created—their spiritual mission—is to be the world 'Restrainer,' protecting the world from evil. The historical mission is to repeatedly defeat attempts to establish universal hegemony in the world—attempts to subordinate humanity to a single evil principle. This ideological definition of Russkiy Mir, presented by ROC and Russian far-right ideologues Malofeev and Dugin, encompasses all the official Russian narratives discussed in this text and is promoted by ROC among its African flock. 'True Faith' While a set of narratives, disseminated by Rossotrudnichestvo and RMF are similar to the rhetoric of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the composition of the ROC’s informational influence deserves a closer look due to its religious character. The actions of the ROC in Africa highlight its ambition to spread not just Orthodoxy, but specifically Russian Orthodoxy, which is now intertwined with the ideology of the Russian state. A narrative built around the global mission of the Apostolic Canonical Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate claims to have preserved the 'true faith' contrary to Western Rite churches influenced by modernization and to other Orthodox churches that supported granting autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The ROC’s activities in Africa are part of a broader strategy to leverage historical narratives and contemporary grievances to extend Russia’s geopolitical reach. This includes presenting Russia as a non-colonial power, a defender against Western neocolonialism, and a moral authority against liberal values that are portrayed as contrary to biblical teachings. The ROC asserts that Russia was never a colonial power, enriching its 'rescue mission' narrative with themes of liberation from the influence of other churches that 'tainted themselves by participating in the slave trade, supporting colonizers, as well as inter-tribal conflicts…' even encouraging genocide in Rwanda, and in recent years 'caused the disappointment of Africans due to the course taken to reject the biblical moral teaching in favor of homosexuality, transgenderism, of feminism, etc.' The Russian leadership perceives Africa as an important ally in promoting 'traditional values' within the larger struggle between two value systems. Representatives of the ROC believe that African societies favor so-called traditional values—patriarchal and patrimonial in nature—contributing to the favorable attitude of African peoples toward Russia. In their rhetoric aimed at African audiences, the Russians emphasize family values, contrasting these with Western concepts of gender equality and the right to self-expression. Last but not least among narratives in the Russian communication with African countries is that 'Russia is the victim of the West.' This explains the Russia-Ukraine war as a demonstration and a result of the Western neocolonial policy toward Russia and Russian-speaking people. This argument extends even further to statements about the Nazi and fascist nature of the Ukrainian political regime and blunt assumptions about the similarities between modern, liberal, Western democracies and the Nazi regime in Germany during WWII. In this manner, Russia draws a connection between the African peoples’ memory of decolonization and one of the central myths of Russian propaganda—the idea of the Russian people as liberators of Europe from fascism. This narrative is further developed to suggest that Russia’s contemporary struggle against Western hegemony is merely a continuation of its historical mission to liberate oppressed peoples everywhere in general, and in Africa in particular. However, in this updated version, the role of global evil is attributed to liberalism and to the ideas of human rights and freedoms. In conclusion, the effectiveness of Russian information influence in African countries is largely determined by Russia’s ability to draw upon the legacy of Soviet-African relations and to adapt to the unique information environment of each nation, leveraging its sentiments and weaknesses. Russia’s information influence in Africa serves its long-term foreign policy objectives, aiming to integrate African societies into a shared perspective on global order and history. These operations not only spread disinformation but also introduce elements of a renewed Russian ideology that stands in opposition to Western democracies.

How The MCMC Has Become The Most Powerful Government Agency In Ma...	The Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) is arguably becoming the most powerful government agency under the Anwar Ibrahim administration. The MCMC power, responsibilities, and influence spans many areas that affect citizens on a daily basis. The MCMC was very much in the background until the ‘unity government’, as it is called, started its term in December 2022. The commission, under the chairmanship of UMNO political stalwart Salim Fateh Din, and his minister Fahmi Fadzil have been in the news, almost on a weekly basis. Minister Fahmi’s recent admission over the controversial tender decision to appoint U Mobile as Malaysia’s second 5G network operator, that such an important national decision was made solely by the MCMC, indicates the ‘unchecked’ power the commission has. In the light of heavy and widespread criticisms that the MCMC has favoured political cronies in awarding tenders, as well as being overly heavy handed and politically biased in the governance of the internet and media, its important to examine the structure, function, and abuses of the organization. The MCMC was created in 1998 under the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, under former prime minister Mahathir Mohemad, who promised the internet in Malaysia would never be censored. The MCMC is under the purview of the Communications Ministry, with Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil as minister. The MCMC budget is unknown, as funding within all ministries are itemised as programs, rather than what particular agencies and departments receive. The total budget allocation to the Ministry of Communications is RM 2.55 billion. Looking at program allocation, the MCMC would be expected to receive a major chuck of these allocations, somewhere near to the size of the Malaysian Religious Development Department (JAKIM). The 2022 annual report shows the MCMC holds RM 4.783 billion in assets, indicating a massive organization size. The powers and responsibilities of the MCMC have grown since 1998. In 2010 under the Postal Services Act (PSA 2012), the MCMC took over responsibility for overseeing and regulating postal and courier services in Malaysia. This includes the issuance of postage stamps and licencing of couriers. The MCMC is totally responsible for implementing government broadband objectives and strategies. The MCMC regulates the framework by which telecommunications, broadcasting, and on-line activities are conducted. This includes the responsibility for the licensing of Network facilities Providers, network service providers, application service providers, and content applications service providers. The MCMC grants licenses to companies exporting digital equipment. The MCMC licenses training providers in the area of digital communications, and conducts its own set of courses. According to the MCMC Annual report, the MCMC received an income of RM 1.37 billion from all of the above activities. The MCMC has offices in each state. The MCMC conducts its own research, hosts events to promote research, and provides digital research grants to research institutions and corporations to develop policies and programs to promote digital inclusion. Controversies involving the MCMC since 2022 Since the appointment of the Anwar administration in December 2022, the MCMC has been involved in a number of controversies. These include the recent awarding of the second 5G network, surveillance and monitoring of citizens, media control, social media censorship, and politically appointed leadership. The award of the second 5G service network license The recent awarding to the second 5G license to U Mobile has received wide criticism. U Mobile was the smallest bidder for the license in the restricted tender, which has raised claims of cronyism. This is especially the case when the Yang Di-Petuan Agong or king was a major shareholder in U Mobile, owning 22.3 percent of the company. The MCMC press statement awarding the network to U Mobile, specifically mentioned that U Mobile could collaborate with other companies leading to claims this was an ‘ali-baba’ deal, which may be sub-contracted to other parties. This led to an attempt by the MCMC to explain the reasons for their decision, which is very unusual for the commission to do. The minister of communication Fahmi personally stepped back from the issue by stating he had no involvement in the decision. Malaysians have not been informed about how much U Mobile will pay the MCMC for the license, due to the opaque nature of selection of the network provider. Other bidders for the license have publicly complained and requested the MCMC account for the criteria used in awarding the contract to U Mobile. The only way citizens will ever have any idea of how much was paid will be by making an estimate of the MCMC’s revenue, based upon previous years income in the 2024 annual report, which is not expected to be released until well after 2026. Use of Israeli Pegasus ease-dropping software The MCMC is finalising the process of building a ‘fake news’ verifier for the social media app WhatsApp. The MCMC is collaborating with Meta, a foreign owned company, which undertakes work for the US intelligence community. Within part of the new CHATBOT system the MCMC is creating, powerful AI software that uses metadata to be able to ‘zero in’ on ‘persons of interest’ is incorporated. The system will be able to find the political views of any individual it desires, and then alert police to arrest these people. This new system will complement the Israeli Pegasus ease-dropping software currently in use by law enforcement agencies in Malaysia. This is an illegal and massive breath of privacy, beyond any public scrutiny. Control and censorship of social media The MCMC has recently published a code of conduct for internet messaging providers service providers and social media service providers. It is in the process of discussing the code of conduct with service providers and the public. This is in conjunction with the proposal to license social media platforms in 2025. This is being resisted by companies such as Google, Meta, and X (formally Twitter), which wrote an open letter to prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. The letter claims the licensing may ‘stifle innovation and competition’, leaving platforms under great uncertainty. At the individual user level, MCMC officers (sometimes in collaboration with the police) call in individual users for interview concerning comments users make, over what the MCMC defines as infringements of the 3R (race, religion, and royalty). This is not just restricted to the public at large, members of parliament are also being summoned for interviews. During these interviews mobile phones and other communication equipment are confiscated in raids on premises. In addition pictures of interviews are published on the MCMC website, amounting to what could be seen as ‘guilt by accusation’. Such practices have been common over the last 12 months. Critics as labelled this practice as intimidation, as only few occasions have these interviews led to any prosecution. In addition, the MCMC has been issuing ‘take down’ notices to social media platforms over what it defines as defamatory, false, or obscene. According to Tik Tok, the MCMC has submitted the highest takedown request in the world during 2023, which led to 1,862 content takedowns in the second half of 2023. The MCMC and the Malaysian Islamic Development Department (JAKIM) have a special collaborative unit in the MCMC that monitors insults against Islam and the spending of deviant Islam, as defined by JAKIM. Online new portals The MCMC has put pressure on online news portals to takedown any posts that it defines as infringing the 3R ban. There are reports the MCMC has also directed news portals as to which columnists and author’s of ‘letters to the editor’ should not be carried by the portals. In general, news portals are struggling financially, where the government, possibily through the MCMC has offered some portals financial assistance. In the Reporters without Borders (RSF) Press Freedom Index 2024, Malaysia fell 34 places from 73 to 109, indicating a loss of freedom of speech in Malaysia. The RSF specifically mentioned the Communications and Multimedia Act (administrated by the MCMC), as often being used to curb what authorities call ‘fake news’. Political leadership Political appointments to GLCs and government agencies has been a contentious issue in Malaysia. The MCMC is no different and the current chairman was appointed by the former UMNO led government and reappointed in March 2023 by the current government. To have partisan leadership in an agency that regulates ‘freedom of speech and political ideas’ is flaunt with conflict of interest. This is a danger to any healthy democracy that is reflected in the fall of Malaysia in the RSF Freedom of Speech Index last year. There needs to be an ombudsman appointed to oversee complaints about the MCMC, particularly due to the pseudo-judiciary role it is carving out for itself, and unchecked power to define what constitutes an offense under the Communications and Multi-media Act.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbSaz5XMZaNjV	2024-11-10T17:27:58-08:00	
Look Before We Leap: Peace, Security And The Second Quantum Revol...	By Dr Alexander Blanchard We are on the cusp of a second quantum revolution. The first saw the advent of world-changing technologies like nuclear fission, lasers and semiconductors. The second, which exploits the behaviour of individual quantum systems, promises to transform technologies for sensing, imaging, navigation, computing, information science, communications and many other applications. Some of these advances will soon be mature enough to be adopted at scale. This has profound implications for a wide range of fields, including global peace and security. The second quantum revolution could have many benefits for peace and security. For instance, advances in quantum sensing could provide better detection of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear hazards and threats. Moreover, quantum computing could bring about advances in climate modelling and monitoring, allowing us to better forecast the long-term effects of climate change. But this coming revolution could also introduce substantial risks. Advances in quantum computing could, for example, undermine current encryption methods on which digital information security depends, including for communications and financial transactions. New quantum technologies could bring advances to several critical industries tied closely to global peace and security, such as semiconductor research and development, thereby instigating a race to securitize these technologies. These risks—many of which we barely understand and some, undoubtedly, that we cannot anticipate—require governance responses, including at the multilateral level. It is high time to set this in motion. New capabilities, new risks As my colleagues and I argued in a recent comment article in Nature, many of the peace and security risks posed by quantum technologies are likely to derive from their use in a national security context, particularly by the military. Quantum technologies offer significant opportunities to enhance existing and future capabilities, including in data collection, intelligence analysis, secure communications and the development of weapons and materials. For example, quantum sensors may be able to detect objects underground and underwater (such as submarines, missile siloes and underground research facilities) that would be invisible to conventional satellite sensors. Quantum sensors could also be used to enhance navigation; field testing has already begun on so-called quantum compasses, which use a quantum accelerometer to measure the velocity of super-cooled atoms. Quantum compasses could enable accurate navigation, something particularly valuable for conducting military operations in environments where the global positioning system (GPS) cannot be used, whether due to poor weather or enemy action. Quantum technologies for military applications are attracting substantial interest and investment. This year, NATO developed a Quantum Technologies Strategy calling on the alliance to be ‘quantum-ready’. In 2023, the United States Department of Defense launched a $45 million initiative to integrate quantum components into weapons systems in order to enhance targeting precision. US lawmakers are currently pushing for the creation of a centre of excellence on quantum computing, focused on developing military applications and building the US military’s capabilities in this field. The British Ministry of Defence acquired a quantum computer in 2022. It has also invested in quantum sensors and clocks. India’s Ministry of Defence is investing in quantum key distribution (QKD), which would greatly enhance the security of its encrypted communications. China, meanwhile, is making advances on a range of military quantum capabilities, including QKD, and a quantum radar system designed to detect objects that are hidden from conventional radar by stealth technology. The deployment of such applications has some troubling implications. For example, using quantum technologies to enhance the lethality of weapons systems could have implications for states’ obligations under international humanitarian law if they lead to greater risk of harm to civilians. Or the use of quantum sensors to detect and track nuclear-armed submarines could weaken nuclear deterrence regimes and thus affecting strategic stability. There is also an ever-present risk that quantum technologies developed and deployed in the national security domain will have unintended consequences for wider society. For example, quantum computing could be used to break existing encryption standards, undermining information security protocols that global digital communications and transactions depend on. Moreover, the interaction of quantum technologies with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), could intensify the risks already associated with them. A coordinated governance response cannot wait Growing recognition of the transformative impact of quantum technologies has led a small number of states and international organizations to publish quantum strategies. These include growing calls for governance frameworks and international norms to anticipate the challenges of quantum technologies and to direct their development and applications to globally beneficial ends. For example, Australia’s National Quantum Strategy, published in 2023, highlights the need to develop principles to guide the responsible and inclusive development and use of quantum technologies. The United Kingdom’s National Quantum Strategy, also published in 2023, highlights the urgent need to establish technical standards to aid global efforts to address the risks of quantum technologies. There are some practical initiatives underway to forestall some of the types of risk posed by quantum technologies. These have predominantly been focused on cybersecurity. For example, governmental organizations, like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), have been working on so-called post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for digital information and communications, which are designed to be more secure against quantum-enabled attacks. Several businesses, including Apple, have been doing the same. However, so far there has been very little international policy discussion on the peace and security implications of quantum technologies, including what multilateral responses could and should look like. Indeed, given the pace at which these technologies are developing, and the potential risks they present once they are scaled up, we are already far behind where we need to be. To begin responding to the peace and security risks, and to develop frameworks and norms for responding to quantum technologies, the international policy community needs to overcome three initial challenges. The first is the daunting complexity of the topic. The science is arcane, even for experts; theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman is often quoted as saying: ‘If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum mechanics.’ There is also the sheer range of potential applications of new quantum technologies, which is far wider than could be captured in this essay. But these need not, and should not, be impediments to understanding the practical implications of quantum technologies and their applications for national security and military purposes. Researchers have an important role to play in translating and unpacking the key issues in ways that policymakers find accessible and actionable. This might include research on the current feasibility and maturity of different quantum technologies that could generate peace and security risks, as well as tracking progress in standards and certification for quantum technologies to gauge their maturity in different domains. The second, related, challenge is that the peace and security implications of the second quantum revolution are far from fully understood, even by those who study it closely. If and how risks materialize will depend on many factors, including how quantum technologies are applied; where and how quantum technologies are developed; challenges and limitations to their development; and strategic drivers for their development and deployment. Efforts to drive the development of quantum technologies for globally beneficial uses will be premature if they are not underpinned by an evidence-based understanding of current developments, as well as frameworks for interpreting those developments. There is a pressing need to step up research to these ends. Whether quantum technologies can be developed and applied for the greater good without increasing peace and security risks will also depend on a timely response from the international community. A third major challenge is that there are currently no dedicated multilateral policy forums for states to discuss the responsible development, adoption and use of quantum technologies. Where states can have these conversations, and what form they take, is an open question—but one that needs answering soon. The dizzyingly rapid development and adoption of AI provides´ a cautionary tale about the dangers of failing to anticipate the challenges associated with emerging technologies. Policymakers were too slow to identify and respond to the challenges related to AI. At best this has resulted in a situation where international and multilateral initiatives are playing catch-up with developments in the technology and its deployment. At worst, opportunities for globally concerted action on governing AI may have been lost forever. While the timescales for the maturation and adoption of quantum technologies may not be clear, the magnitude of the peace and security challenges they pose are. With quantum technologies, policymakers still have the opportunity to get ahead of the challenges presented by an emerging technology. This opportunity will not last long. ‘Consider the ethical impacts of quantum technologies in defence—before it’s too late’ by Mariarosaria Taddeo, Alexander Blanchard and Kate Pundyk was published in Nature on 22 October 2024.

Trump-Proofing The East Asia Economy Through Elusion – Analysis	By Adam S. Posen US President-elect Trump will put tariffs up across the board, even if only initially as a negotiating tactic. He will increase bilateral tariffs on China and Mexico. The US Congress is likely to withdraw ‘Permanent Normal Trading Relations’ — that is, Most Favoured Nation treatment — from China, which would be even more aggressive, with even worse consequences. All else being equal, Trump’s tariff increases could yield an economic gain for East Asia in the short term. US exports are likely to become increasingly uncompetitive, while offshoring would continue to flow into the region from China, Europe and the United States — especially if US–Mexico tensions escalate. But the longer-term damage his policy tactics will do in undermining the open world economy — and the likely political pressures from both China and the United States to choose sides — will quickly overwhelm any benefits. This will increase uncertainty for businesses and governments in the region and right around the world. East Asia needs to band together and resist the temptation to play the game that Trump instigates with Xi. The region has advantages in creating its own open markets tied to the rest of the world, both inherently and as an attractive alternative to China and the United States, that it would be well-advised to pursue. This strategy would emphasise institutional processes and openness, as opposed to doggedly pursuing outcomes in specific industries or trying to cut deals with one or the other of the big powers. In contrast to the self-sufficiency driving both Chinese and US industrial policy, this approach would take the agency and markets of third nations seriously, in the region’s enlightened self-interest. There are both low-hanging fruits and perennial crops to be harvested from East Asia differentiating its approach from that of the two big powers. In the short term, allowing foreign direct investment in from all comers (with extremely narrow national security restrictions) and encouraging cross-border investment in developing economies would rapidly grant a competitive advantage over rivals who restrict technology transfer. East Asia’s supply chains would stand out for their efficiency and resilience. If the region foregoes the race to high tariffs or rapidly negotiates them into cross-border investment and integration of production, it would increase the purchasing power of both its households and businesses, while the United States and China would lose price competitiveness in the industries they wish to dominate. Longer-term, the returns to East Asian economies are even larger from separate, more open strategies than those of the United States and China. Those two economies are already on the way to destroying their own competitiveness by reducing economies of scale; by limiting their competition around protected champions; by supporting ‘critical industries’ chosen by backward-looking bureaucrats blinded by national security concerns; and by hobbling their ability to invest in research and other public goods by massive escalation of subsidies to production. An ASEAN coalition around or with the full membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) that sustains a policy of strategic openness would exert a greater influence over the standards and networks that are essential to today’s technology-based trade and consumption. The vast majority of third nation governments would prefer to play a part in the standards they accept rather than being forced into one or another rival camp. More collaboratively developed standards and functionally interoperable networks can emerge by reaching out to Europe and India or working through plurilateral processes at the World Trade Organization. Of course, there are other goals that matter for foreign and industrial policy beyond exports or manufacturing employment. On all these scores though, the alternative approach to that of China and the United States is clearly superior. More open sourcing of green tech components as well as final products would accelerate the green transition and make it far more accessible to the rest of the world. The United States and China could end up repeating the self-defeating economic arms race of only paying attention to third nations when the other rival does. This neglect presents not only an opportunity for East Asian foreign policy, but a need for the region’s governments to work with like-minded counterparts on supplying public goods, such as rapid transition to a carbon neutral economy, that are increasingly under-supplied. Sometimes, one cannot beat another at their own game. A better strategy is to choose to do something different. East Asian economies cannot win, either in the narrow sense of achieving industrial parity or in the more meaningful sense of shaping the world’s relationship with new technologies, by emulating current US and Chinese trade and industrial policies. The region simply does not have the fiscal resources, military capacity or ability to make enemies that the United States and China have. Thankfully, there is an alternative strategy, as the bastions of open trade and investment strategies, that will benefit the East Asian region and the globe. About the author: Adam S.

Mexico’s New President Claudia Sheinbaum Must Overcome Political ...	By Bernardo Sainz Martínez Mexico is experiencing a profound shift in its political landscape. The first weeks of Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo’s administration are marked by concerns of democratic backsliding, power centralization, a potential constitutional crisis, and rampant violence. The legitimacy of the June 2 election results is not in question. The concern lies in the exceptional concentration of power in the presidential position as well as the instability that will arise from such unchecked authority. The inability to address root causes of violence and the disregard for institutional checks and balances raises questions about the government’s commitment to democratic processes. Rampant violence shows cracks in public security Observers’ previous expectations of a moderate administration are slowly fading. Violence remains rampant across Mexico. Over a thousand killings have been recorded in Sheinbaum’s first 13 days in office alone. Among the most significant incidents were the beheading of Alejandro Arcos Catalán, the mayor of Chilpancingo, and the recent killing of Marcelo Pérez, a priest and social activist in Chiapas. Additionally, military personnel were accused of negligence after six migrants and a nurse were killed in the crossfire of a shootout between the National Guard and suspected drug cartel vehicles. While Sheinbaum has proposed a new security plan, it does not diverge significantly from her predecessor Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s strategy. Obrador’s approach, which was to create the National Guard, a nationwide police force, resulted in the most violent presidential term in Mexico’s modern history. Furthermore, the Mexican Congress passed a controversial reform that places the National Guard under the Ministry of Defense. Sheinbaum supports both of these decisions and vows to strengthen the National Guard even more. Critics argue this will only further militarize public security and fail to address the root causes of violence. Judicial overhaul has consolidated executive power even further This failure to address the rampant violence isn’t the only concern Mexican citizens have regarding Sheinbaum’s administration. There has also been a blatant disregard for checks and balances within the institution as a result of her administration. The recent judicial reformis the clearest example. This reform mandates a complete overhaul of the judicial system, replacing all the judges in the country, at all levels, with new ones elected by popular vote. However, more than half of the appointees will be filtered by Morena, the governing party, through 'expert committees.' The reform also reduces the requirements to become a judge, which used to involve examinations and a long technical career. This has raised serious concerns about the politicization of the judiciary and the potential loss of judicial autonomy. Critics warn that this reform could threaten core democratic principles, including the separation of powers and adherence to the rule of law. The judicial reform has also the potential to spark a constitutional crisis. Numerous judges have already filed amparos (legal injunctions) challenging the reform’s constitutionality. They argue, among other things, that the legislative procedure to pass the reform was deeply flawed. However, Sheinbaum’s government has largely disregardedthe rulings and doubled down by proposing a new constitutional reform that shields any constitutional changes, even retroactively, from judicial oversight. The main argument used by the president and the governing party is that 'a few judges' cannot overturn 'the will of the people.' This move has alarmed many human rights advocates and legal experts. They view it as a regressive step in the defense of human rights and a violation of Mexico’s civil commitments. Mexico’s future remains unclear Despite the uncertainty surrounding the political situation, the day-to-day operations of Mexico have not been significantly disrupted. Much of this is due to the anticipation surrounding the new political context. Both the business community and political observers are closely watching how Sheinbaum will address internal challenges within Morena and its coalition. In addition, Mexico’s global economic and political ties, such as the USMCA trade agreement, serve as external constraints on the government’s ability to implement drastic changes. The country’s diversified economy also limits the scope for dramatic policy shifts. External factors such as trade, debt obligations, and international relations stabilize Mexico’s economy during this period of political transition. While it is true that internal political dynamics and violence present serious challenges, these external influences may help curb some of the more drastic reforms that threaten democratic checks and balances. It is clear that Mexico faces significant challenges and uncertainties. Strengthening democratic institutions, maintaining checks and balances, and protecting the electoral system’s capacity for power alternation are essential for ensuring stability and upholding the rule of law. Equally important is the need to respect institutional democratic processes, even when they produce outcomes that may not align with all preferences.

What Trump’s Reelection Means For Russia – OpEd	As the world braces for Trump 2.0, this time with broad immunity and a tight inner circle of true believers and China hawks, the effect of Trump’s victory on Russia is coming into view. From ideological to geopolitical shifts, here’s how a second Trump term might impact the Kremlin’s calculations. Following the post-Cold War era of liberal triumphalism celebrated most iconically in Francis Fukuyama’s 'end of history' pronouncement, the 2008 financial crisis cast serious doubt on the shibboleths of globalization. Skepticism grew across the globe about the capacity of the liberal economic, political, and social order to continue delivering either prosperity or peace. Now, 'postliberalism' or illiberalism is on the march throughout the developed world, a trend that Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed years ago. Pointing to the refugee crisis in Germany in the wake of the Syrian civil war, the Russian president told the Financial Times in 2019 that the liberal system 'has become obsolete.' The popular will, according to Putin, longs for nationalist states protected by impregnable borders. America reelecting Trump, whose right-wing populist platform embraces isolationism, protectionism, and nationalism while excoriating immigrants, open trade, and independent institutions, is the most conclusive natural experiment Moscow could have wished for. In his ideological battle against the West, Putin has long predicted the 'decline' of the U.S.-led liberal world order. In this narrative, Trump’s resurgence confirms Putin’s suspicion that liberal democracy is an unworkable failure, destroyed by the very democratic processes that made it possible in the first place. Instead, Trump’s win legitimizes the illiberal politics of countries like Hungary and (formerly) Poland, led by strongmen who represent populist nationalism triumphing over liberal pluralism. Disruption and Provocation Despite the ideological boost of Trump’s victory, the Kremlin is not entirely eager for the former president to return to the White House. Better equipped to haggle over hunks of real estate than master the subtle strategy of international bargaining, Trump approaches foreign policymaking as 'naked transactionalism.' His first-term National Security Council advisors worked in an atmosphere of constant chaos as the former president lurched from one foreign policy bungle to another, harming everyone from U.S. allies to American consumers. Bitterest of all, Trump never delivered on his 2016 promise to lift sanctions on Russia, instead adding on new, broader sanctions. For the ever-suspicious Putin, who prefers order and predictability, Trump’s erratic mode of governing makes him an unreliable and untrustworthy partner. On the other hand, Russia pursues what historian Mark Galeotti identifies as a 'strategy of inconveniences,' involving cyberattacks, sabotage, and other forms of political warfare that result in minor but irritating disruptions to everyday life in European countries. From delayed train lines to slow Internet speeds, the goal is simple: weaken and destabilize Western societies. A second Trump term, with its promise of mass deportations, new import tariffs, a greater risk of inflation, brinksmanship with North Korea, and a panicked EU, is precisely the sort of Western 'inconvenience' that Moscow delights to see. Ceasefire in Ukraine As the Russian army continues making slow battlefield gains, adding more pressure on Ukraine with thousands of North Korean combat troops, European leaders brace for the impact of a Trump presidency on EU security. Trump pledged, after meeting with Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, to end the war in Ukraine 'in 24 hours.' For his part, Trump’s running mate J.D. Vance has expressed his desire to pursue 'some sort of negotiation' with Ukraine, Russia, and Europe. The proposed negotiated settlement would likely concede a fifth of Ukrainian territory to Russia, freezing the current battle lines, and force Ukraine into a position of perpetual neutrality, barred from joining NATO. Although this would be music to Putin’s ears, Trump’s new administration has yet to reckon with a timeworn international relations concept: the dreaded commitment problem. The problem goes like this: when negotiating, say, the terms of a peace treaty, states have a difficult time making credible promises not to use force in the future because the state whose power is ascendant will have a powerful incentive to renege on the treaty and grab more land later on. Consider the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed to give up the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the United States, and the UK. A weak post-Soviet Russia, swept up in the friendly mood of the 1990s, gave security assurances to Ukraine. Two decades later, a resurgent Russia annexed the strategically valuable Crimean peninsula. Eight years later, it launched a full-scale attack on a country whose sovereignty and territorial integrity it had once promised to respect. The lesson for Ukraine is bitterly clear: Russian security guarantees cannot be trusted. This time around, it is not clear who would guarantee Kyiv’s security following a possible peace deal, especially if Moscow continues to find NATO troops on Ukrainian soil to be unacceptable. A Stronger Europe Trump is convinced that NATO, instead of being a military alliance that protects American strategic interests in Europe while deterring the world’s biggest nuclear power, is little more than a protection racket in which humble small fry gratefully pay the big boss. He has thus threatened to withdraw financial support from NATO. However, Trump’s critics tend to overlook that this position is not exclusive to Trump who, after all, maintained American military support for Europe throughout his first term. There is widespread bipartisan, public support for fairer burdensharingamong NATO members, with Mark Rutte remarking immediately after the election that '[Trump] is right' about the need for European countries to spend more on their defense. Moreover, as Washington and Beijing are increasingly locked into what political scientist Graham Allison terms the 'Thucydides Trap', the U.S. defense community prepares budgets and resources to meet the growing threat of military confrontation with China. This makes the redirection of Pentagon dollars away from Europe inevitable regardless of who occupies the role of commander-in-chief. What a revitalized Europe will mean for Russia is not yet entirely clear, but a couple of observations can be made. First, Russian designs on Europe tend to be overblown, with most analysts arguing that the NATO deterrent is strong and that Russia is unlikely to be contemplating using force against an alliance member. While Putin has imperial ambitions in Ukraine, which I wrote aboutlast year, they are unlikely to extend to other European countries. Second, Russia is paying dearly for its war of attrition, suffering enormous losses of experienced officers and soldiers as well as military equipment. Even as the country rearms and rebuilds its forces, the Kremlin’s postwar efforts at recruitment, industrialization, and modernization will be slow and expensive. This process does not promise to create a more efficient military—and certainly not one capable of taking on the substantially superior NATO forces.

Nixon Versus McGovern 2.0? Not So Fast – OpEd	In early August, I wrote an essay posted in Brownstone Journal entitled, 'Nixon vs. McGovern 2.0.' I sought to demonstrate that the most useful way of looking at the just-ended 2024 election cycle was to compare Trump vs. Harris with Nixon vs. McGovern in 1972. Back then, progressive leftists, having recently taken over the colleges and universities in this country, succeeded in choosing the Democrat Party’s presidential candidate, George McGovern. The result was the greatest landslide victory for Republicans at the presidential level that had ever been seen up until that time. In comparing 2024 with the 1972 election cycles, the question I raised was whether the left’s grip on colleges and universities (and the Democrat Party) for more than 50 years had changed the electorate to the point where an extremely progressive candidate could finally be chosen President of the United States, and permanently end our Constitutional Republic. Note that I use the word chosen deliberately, given the selection process that unfolded. Personally, I believed that the chances of a Democrat victory were greater than 50%, so I left things in the LORD’s very capable hands. Looking back at that previous post, my description of the likely chain of events leading up to Election Day 2024 tracked very closely with 1972. More importantly, the result of the election has been described using similar terms, such as landslide or blowout. Based on that election outcome, many Republicans (and a few dinosaur centrist Democrats) are already writing the obituary for the current, very progressive iteration of the Democrat Party. In effect, they’re saying that the 50+ year effort to remake America has imploded…to which I say: Not so fast! In order to demonstrate that the purported similarities between the outcomes of the 1972 and 2024 election cycles are barely skin deep I will examine, in a more granular way, the election results from a couple of different perspectives. First, while both elections have been described as a landslide or a blowout, a look at the data shows significant differences. In 1972, Nixon won 49 states and received 61% of the popular vote. In 2024, Trump won all seven battleground states by an average of just over 2%, and his overall popular vote percentage will be approximately 10% lower than Nixon. Had Harris increased her popular vote by a mere 2% in each of the battleground states, she would have won the Electoral College. In sum; Nixon’s margin of victory was an order of magnitude greater than Trump’s. Second, we need to look at the respective Democrat Party candidates in 1972 and 2024; McGovern and Harris. George McGovern, as I’ve previously described, was a well-respected Senator with a very distinguished World War II service record, who went back to the Senate for another decade after his defeat. His landslide loss was entirely a repudiation of his message, not a repudiation of him. On the other hand, Kamala Harris was the poster child for what is known as a DEI (diversity/equity/inclusion) candidate, as demonstrated by the criteria by which she was chosen to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020, and the fact that she had rarely gone through the fire of seeking competitive elective office. She was ill-equipped, both temperamentally, and in her work ethic for the positions she sought. To me, she was barely qualified to run for Senior Class President at a poorly performing high school. How can someone like this make a case for her party’s message when she couldn’t make a case for herself? As a result, the VP’s political career is now over, and she will not be heard from again at the national level. Should she try to remain relevant by inserting herself into the political fray, the real power players within the Democrat Party will quickly cancel her. Speaking of Joe Biden, he was nothing but a corrupt, decrepit, and increasingly demented old man that history will describe as an accidental President at best, and a fraudulently elected President, if the truth about the 2020 election shenanigans is finally revealed, at worst. Given this set of circumstances, it is obvious to me that the electorate rejected the Democrat messenger(s) in 2024, rather than the message. As such, I firmly believe that Dylan Mulvaney (of Bud Lite fame) would probably not have fared much worse than VP Harris in the Electoral College, had she been the candidate. Be assured that the Democrats will not be engaging in any sort of self-reflection. Once the political recriminations and shooting within the tent by the various factions is complete, which won’t take very long at all, they will use all of their energy to obstruct the Trump agenda, and, more importantly, find Obama 2.0 to run for President in 2028. To repeat, don’t let the noise and invectives fool anyone into thinking that 50+ years of educational indoctrination will be reversed by one election. Make no mistake: the far-left progressive message is alive and well. Those who oppose them better be ready for the onslaught. While time is short for our side, the progressives can bide their time, since their armies have been in place for a long time, and are well entrenched in the administrative state. Those of us at Brownstone, whose prime objective is to expose the atrocities committed by the public health Gestapo during the so-called Covid response, need to be very strategic in approaching this matter, since a substantial majority of the public will be incredibly resistant to hearing the truth. This means that when it comes to the 3-letter healthcare agencies (CDC, FDA, NIH, etc.), trying to amputate them will not be received positively. My experience tells me that if the professionals chosen to lead these agencies are solid, the corrupt, the incompetent, and the stragglers will fall away rather quickly, while telling themselves that they are indispensable. Good riddance! This will create an atmosphere where the competent professionals within these agencies will feel supported enough to rise to the occasion. If I may be allowed to wax theologically, I believe that the 2024 election cycle, rather than being compared to 1972, is best compared to the Book of Esther. A unique feature of that Book is that the LORD is never mentioned, yet HIS impact is evident throughout. Other than when the LORD deflected an assassin’s bullet with HIS finger on July 13th, HIS actions during this election cycle were subliminal but totally determinative of the outcome. It’s now up to seekers of truth to seize the opportunities that have been given in order to restore the nation’s founding covenant, consisting of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.

The Hamas-Hezbollah-Iran-UN Axis Of Evil – OpEd	Incredibly few Palestinian civilian casualties in Israel's war of survival – yet only Israel is condemned On October 7, 2023, Hamas butchered 1,200 innocent people, maimed 5,400, kidnapped 250, and drove tens of thousands out of southern Israeli towns. The next day, to show solidarity with Hamas, Hezbollah began launching rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel, driving 80,000 from their homes. Israel's war rages on, against Hamas and Hezbollah, ISIS, Houthis and their Iranian theocracy puppet masters. It is a conflict that Israel did not start and did not want, a war for the Jewish state's very survival. It was preceded by suicide bombings and other deadly attacks by Palestinians going back many decades. Hamas leader Sinwar is now dead. So are Hezbollah leader Nasrallah, his successor, the successor's replacement, his successor and dozens of other top terrorists. But Hezbollah still demands 'appropriate and suitable' terms for ending the conflict. A Lebanon ceasefire might happen, if a new American proposal is accepted, under which US, EU and UN 'partners' would (finally) enforce 2006 UN Security Council Resolution 1701, requiring that Hezbollah disarm, withdraw north of the Litani River, and let the Lebanese government govern. President Biden wants to 'move on' to other matters. VP Harris says 'de-escalation' is essential. They want a ceasefire, and Palestinian statehood that may be less likely than ever, because Israeli trust is gone. However, Donald Trump's resounding reelection is already making Iran less relevant. It may make Hamas and Hezbollah more open to a cessation of hostilities, release of still-living hostages, and even a long-term, wide-ranging peace agreement ... though at this point largely on Israel's terms. Meanwhile, Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis and Iran continue to target any Israelis unlucky enough to be in blast zones – with few condemnations or repercussions from the UN, US or anyone else. The Hamas war is the most dangerous and complex urban warfare imaginable. It's horrific for anyone caught in target zones or crossfires. And yet Israel is condemned for crimes against humanity for attacking Hamas and Hezbollah ambush sites, weapon and missile storage depots, terror tunnels and strongholds that were deliberately built in and under homes, schools and hospitals to deter attacks or maximize civilian casualties. Even Israel's brilliant booby-trapping of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies – probably the most precise targeting in military history – was labeled a war crime. Meanwhile, Russia continues targeting Ukrainian schools, apartment buildings and hospitals, maiming and killing civilians – with few or no condemnations or repercussions. In reality, civilian death tolls in Gaza and Lebanon are a fraction of noncombatant casualties in other recent wars – Afghanistan, Africa and Ukraine, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, for example. US, UN and allied forces often killed nine civilians for each combatant. In Gaza and Lebanon, fewer than two civilians died per combatant, because Israeli Defense Forces take 'more measures to avoid civilian harm than virtually any other nation that's fought an urban war.' Israel was also condemned for kicking the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinians out of Israel, because UNRWA employed terrorists who participated in the 10/7 massacres and helped kidnap Israelis; indoctrinated children to be terrorists; aided and sheltered Hamas; funneled food, water, concrete and other resources to the terrorists; and concealed weapons and explosives in UNWRA facilities. President Biden and the US State Department are 'deeply concerned' that this decision could prevent humanitarian aid from reaching people, even though the IDF and other aid agencies are more than capable, and pictures and videos prove UNRWA employees committed multiple crimes. Norway has asked the UN General Assembly to request an International Court of Justice 'advisory opinion' outlining Israel's supposed 'obligations as an occupying power to facilitate humanitarian assistance' to Palestinians. The US says it 'categorically rejects' any Israeli actions that could lead to the 'forced relocation' of Palestinians from Gaza Why haven't Norway, the US, UN or pro-Hamas mobs sought similar legal opinions regarding Russia's obligations toward Ukrainians – or regarding other horrific international conflicts? Years-long war in Sudan has killed well over 60,000 people, forced millions to leave their homes, added another 135,000 to the refugee stream just since late October, and created the 'world's worst current hunger crisis.' And yet these 'human rights advocates' have said virtually nothing. Similar stony silence reigns regarding butchery in Nigeria, where Islamist 'jihad and genocide' have slaughtered 150,000 Christians since 2009 and driven millions of refugees into neighboring countries. Some bizarrely blame resource scarcity, eco-violence and climate change for the slaughter. During Israel's 1948 War of Independence, some 750,00 Arab people fled or were forced to flee the new nation. Their six million descendants now live Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and other places, largely assisted by UNRWA. They are still considered 'refugees,' with a 'right of return' to what is now Israel – the only people in history with such status. Most Holocaust survivors (perhaps 3,000,000 of 9,000,000 pre-WWII Jews) had no desire to remain in Europe; they emigrated to Israel and other countries and started new lives and families. Most who tried to enforce their 'right of return' to their pre-war homes were murdered or driven away. On November 8, Islamist mobs hunted and attacked Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam. Israel's creation also resulted in 850,000 Jews being forced to leave their centuries-long homes in Muslim countries across North Africa, through the Middle East to Iran and beyond. They received no UN help. This October, Israel finally responded to Hezbollah's ongoing attacks – and its preparations for Hamas copycat massacres via tunnels similar to those in Gaza. IDF targeting of Hezbollah headquarters, war rooms, and stockpiles of weapons and explosives, rockets and missiles in populated areas damaged parts of Beirut and southern Lebanon, displaced more families, and killed terrorists and civilians. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other finance ministers sent a letter to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, warning that the West Bank's economy could collapse if Israel doesn't extend a waiver allowing Israeli and Palestinian banks to continue cooperating in disbursing international financial support. The Palestinian economy faces 'systemic collapse' if action isn't taken immediately, they claim. Israel's economy has also been battered, but the ministers said nothing about that. The US, UN and EU are further outraged that Israel wants the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to move out of its forts, to safeguard its 'observers' from air and ground actions in active combat zones. UNIFIL rejected the demands. UNIFIL has been deployed in Lebanon since 1978, supposedly to prevent Hezbollah having an armed presence south of the Litani River. However, it studiously saw nothing, said nothing, reported nothing and did nothing to prevent Hezbollah from building terror tunnels, sniper positions, missile launch pads, munitions depots and more within a hundred yards of UNIFIL positions along the Israeli border. These travesties, threats and hypocrisies must end. The wars on Israel must be brought to a close and the hostages returned – but only with the dismantling of Hezbollah and Hamas forces that still promise to wipe Israel off the map. Thankfully, the election of Trump 47 may make all that more likely than ever.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbS8uCzcBC_y3	2024-11-10T17:11:07-08:00	
All States Are Empires Of Lies – OpEd	By Thomas J. DiLorenzo 'Most economists are political apologists masquerading as economists,' wrote Doug Casey in one of his columns. 'They prescribe the way they would like the world to work and tailor theories to help politicians demonstrate the virtue and necessity of their quest for power.' Moreover, wrote Casey, 'The field of economics has been turned into the handmaiden of government in order to give a scientific justification for things the government wants to do.' This of course is not a new development. Ludwig von Mises was calling the universities of his day 'nurseries of socialism' but, thankfully, there is always a remnant of students who resist the statist brainwashing. The above quote about concocted 'scientific' justifications for interventionism and socialism, by the way, sounds like a precise definition of Keynes’s General Theory. Casey’s sound advice is that to be a good citizen one needs to 'become your own economist.' Don’t rely on the state’s mouthpieces in the 'media' or even academe for your economic knowledge. Educate yourself to some degree; it doesn’t take a university degree. Indeed, everything we do at the Mises Institute is geared toward helping anyone anywhere to become their own economist (preferably Austrian School and not Keynesian or Post Keynesian!) and avoid being bamboozled by the state and its court historian economists. Mises never joined the American Economic Association, the association of academic economists founded in the 1880s. The association’s founding document provides a clue as to why. 'The state is an educational and ethical agency whose positive aid is an indispensable condition of human progress,' the document purred. 'The doctrine of laissez faire,' on the other hand, 'is unsafe in politics and unsound in morals,' said the statist moral scolds who founded the American Economic Association. There are exceptions, the Austrian School economists being the most prominent, but the majority of academic economists view themselves as advisors or potential advisors to the state. They are Rothbard’s 'court historians' with degrees in economics instead of history. The role that they serve is the same as all 'intellectuals' in our almost 100 percent state-funded universities. As Rothbard put it: 'The majority [of the electorate] must be persuaded by ideology that their government is good, wise, and at least inevitable. Promoting this ideology . . . is the vital task of the ‘intellectuals.’' In return, the 'intellectuals' are given government jobs, grants, placement at prestigious universities, book deals, and myriad other political payoffs. (Mises wrote that history, law, and economics are the disciplines most widely used to bamboozle the public about the supposedly good, wise, and inevitable state). Take the Fed – please (as Rodney Dangerfield would say). Economist Larry White published a journal article several years ago that revealed that about 75 percent of all articles published in academic economic journals on the subject of monetary policy are published by economists who are in some way associated with the Fed. As Milton Friedman once said, 'If you want a career as a monetary economist it is best not to criticize the major employer in your field.' And so they do not. If there is ever any criticism it is always constructive criticism about how to supposedly become even better at central planning. Most Americans are rationally ignorant of the Fed, and what little they do know about it is overwhelmingly shaped by the Fed’s 'court historians,' especially the ones who teach economics at colleges and universities. The Austrian economists (but not all of them) are the only ones to challenge the existence of the Fed and call for its abolition. In addition to being the federal government’s legalized counterfeiting arm, the Fed is also another appendage of the government’s massive propaganda apparatus. The laughingly labeled 'independent' Fed’s research, according to economist Emre Kuvvet writing in The Independent Review, increasingly focuses on 'climate change, gender, race, and inequality' – the 'woke' political agenda of the Democrat party. The one true statement that Joe Biden made as president was 'It’s not Milton Friedman’s Fed anymore.' The New York Fed has always been considered to be the most powerful and influential of all the Fed branches. Its homepage defines its mission as a 'desire to root out the intolerable inequities and injustice grounded in systemic racism . . . steadfast in our commitment to work for a more equitable economy and society.' A clearer definition of socialism would be hard to find. Kuvvet found that of all the employees of the Fed’s Board of Governors there are 97 Democrats and 2 Republicans. 'Leadership positions' on the Board consist of 45 Democrats and 1 Republican. As I said, it’s just another D.C. government propaganda mill. Some Examples of the Empire of Economic Lies A typical introductory economics textbook devotes most space to endless stories of 'market failure' (free-rider problems, externalities, monopoly and oligopoly, monopolistic competition, asymmetric information, and on and on), and almost nothing about entrepreneurship, the cornerstone of capitalism. It wasn’t always like that. When the first federal antitrust law was passed in 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act) the entire economics profession, which was very small at the time, opposed then new law as being inherently incompatible with competition, as Jack High and I proved by quoting all of them in a July 1988 Economic Inquiry article. They all viewed competition like the Austrian economists always have – as a dynamic, rivalrous process of discovery and entrepreneurship, and thought that antitrust law could only disrupt that process and distort markets. By the 1930s a new and more 'scientific-sounding' theory of 'perfect' competition had been invented, which asserted that competitive perfection required all homogenous products and prices in an industry, perfect information in the minds of buyers and sellers, costless entry into and exit from industry, an 'many' firms, whatever that might mean. For the next half century and more, economists would spin thousands o tall tales about how the real world fell short of this 'perfection,' defined as market failure, and prescribed regulation, control, nationalization, or regimentation by presumably wise and, well, perfect politicians and bureaucrats. UCLA economist Harold Demsetz labeled this dishonest method of analysis 'the Nirvana fallacy': Comparing the real world to an unachievable never never land of Nirvana. As F.A. Hayek once described it, 'In perfect competition there is no competition.' That is, there could not be product differentiation, price cutting, advertising, research and development, the rise to the top of a few superior-performing firms in an industry – all the ingredients of genuine competition. Generations of students have also been taught that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries large-scale production of electricity, water supply, telephone services and other similar products was producing 'natural' (i.e., free market) monopolies. Governments then stepped in and legally mandated public utility monopolies, supposedly to be regulated 'in the public interest.' I proved this to be yet another falsehood in my paper, 'They Myth of Natural Monopoly.' There was vigorous competition in all these industries. They were monopolized by the state, not the free market, with loot-sharing agreements whereby state and local governments would share in the monopoly profits created by their government-mandated monopolies. Then there’s the Big Lie of the Sherman Antitrust Act which was supposedly needed because of 'rampant monopolization' in the 1880s as the industrial revolution proceeded in America. In an article in The International Review of Law and Economics I showed that the industries being accused of monopolization at the time were by far the most competitive, dynamic, price-cutting, innovative, and production-expanding industries in America. The purpose of the Sherman Act was to stifle competition, not to 'protect' it. One of the most ridiculous things taught to generations of economics students was that because of the free-rider problem the U.S. would be spending far too little on 'national defense.' 'Efficiency' requires coercive taxation. There are economists who have defended Pentagon corruption and fraud on the basis that it expands defense spending, which is supposedly hindered by that nasty free rider problem. Who on earth would define Pentagon spending as 'efficient'? ! It was only in the past ten years that the 'mainstream' of the economics profession finally discovered that the massive interventions of the New Deal actually made the Great Depression more severe and longer lasting, something the Austrian economists have said all along. This Big Revelation was made in an article in the prestigious Journal of Political Economy by Professor Lee Ohanian of UCLA, an editor of the American Economic Review at the time. Better late than never. Nobel prizes in economics have been awarded for many theories of 'market failure' that subsequent research proved to be bogus. Janet Yellen’s husband, George Akerloff, was a co-recipient of the award for a paper that, in 1970, predicted that the used car market would soon disappear because of 'asymmetric information' between buyers and sellers. He apparently never heard of thirty-day warranties that allow car buyers to determine whether or not they had been sold a 'lemon.' David Card was awarded a Nobel prize for a paper claiming that minimum wage laws do not cause unemployment that was called 'deeply flawed' by a National Bureau of Economic Research redo of his study. There are many similar episodes. Economics students are taught that the root cause of pollution is profit seeking, which ignores the fact that the worst pollution in all the world over the past century, by far, was in the socialist countries of the world in the twentieth century that prohibited private profit seeking. A corollary to the profit-seeking-causes-pollution theory is that wise and benevolent government bureaucrats are needed to solve this problem. This not only ignores political reality, but also ignores how the absence of property rights causes many pollution problems in the first place, and also how entrepreneurs solve many 'externality' problems because it is profitable to do so. In public finance students are taught that tax 'loopholes' are inefficient because they supposedly create 'artificial' market distortions. It’s much more efficient, they are taught, to let government bureaucrats spend more of your money. Then there’s the cornerstone of Keynesian economics – the canard of 'the paradox of thrift' which asserts that savings reduces consumption, which in turn reduces GDP, which leads to lower savings. This theory has 'justified' confiscatory taxation of interest income on savings for decades. The intellectual godfather of mainstream economics will probably always be Paul Samuelson, whose Principles of Economics textbook dominated textbook sales for forty years, with almost all other textbooks during that time being imitations of his book. The statist bias that permeated that book and the others like it can be encapsulated by what Samuelson wrote in his 1988 edition – a prediction that by the year 2000 Soviet GDP would be larger than U.S. GDP. All of this demonstrates why Austrian economics is more important now than ever. The economics profession has not been immune from the cult of political correctness. In fact, it was politically incorrect before political correctness was cool, as Mises’ comment about how the universities of his day were 'nurseries of socialism' shows. Doug Casey was right when he wrote that most economists are political apologists masquerading as economists. Yours Truly recognized this as a college student decades ago, and was blown away by the discovery of Mises and the Austrian School, the writings of which very clearly showed that the Austrians were unique in that they were powerfully devoted to the intellectual search for the truth about how the economic world (and beyond) works, and how governments don’t work, and were not at all interested in being apologists for the plundering class.

Iran’s Rebellious Youth Target Regime Symbols Amid Rising Executi...	On Saturday, November 9, Iran’s rebellious youth attacked regime targets in Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, and Mashhad in response to the increasing executions and massacres in Iran’s prisons, including: – 94 executions from October 22 to November 8 – 441 executions during the tenure of regime president Masoud Pezeshkian – 17 executions on Wednesday, November 8 alone The rebellious youth also responded to the regime’s growing repressive measures against women and girls. The targets of the attacks included: Explosion at headquarters of the Khomeini Foundation in Shiraz, which is responsible for looting the wealth of the country to serve the regime’s nefarious purposes Setting fire to a center for suppressing women in Tehran Setting fire to three IRGC Basij bases in Tehran and Mashhad Setting fire to banners of regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini, supreme leader Ali Khamenei, and former IRGC Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani in Tehran Setting fire to banners of the regime’s terrorist proxies in Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz While Khamenei increases executions to intimidate the oppressed and impoverished masses who have been driven to despair, the rebellious youth rise to lead the way for the downtrodden to protest. On November 8, Resistance Units in Zahedan carried out anti-regime activities against the regime’s wave of repressive measures aimed at intimidating the public. The Resistance Units held banners and placards in public areas, reiterating their commitment to protect the rights of all Iranians and fighting for a free and democratic Iran. – 'For the freedom of the people and homeland, we only rely on ourselves' – 'The time has come to call for overthrowing the regime ' – 'The first and last word is overthrow, overthrow!' – 'Terrorism and trafficking plots don’t stick to our brothers who fight for justice and the minimum rights of the oppressed Baluch people' – 'The people of Sistan-Baluchistan and Sunni Iranians won’t be fooled by the appointment of a Sunni governor' (reference to the regime’s appointment of one if its loyalists as governor of the province) – 'The destruction of Chabahar residents’ homes is the accomplishment of the new Baluchistan governor' – 'The blood of the Baluch and their martyrs from Zahedan’s bloody Friday and Khash is still alive today' – 'The response to the execution of prisoners and killing of fuel carriers is uprising ' – 'The Sunni and Baluch governor whom Khamenei and Pezeshkian installed in Sistan-Baluchistan is theirs to keep' – 'The overthrow of this regime won’t come from the sky, so we must rise up' – 'Khamenei should know the response to executions is uprising' The rebellious youth also carried out activities on the fortieth day after the tragic disaster at the Tabas coal mine, where 53 miners lost their lives and dozens more were injured, targeting the regime’s centers of repression and plunder across various cities, including: – Explosion at a Basij base in Shiraz – Explosion at the HQ of the Khomeini Foundation in Golpayegan – Setting fire to three Basij bases in Tehran – Setting fire to two Basij bases in Mashhad – Setting fire to a poster of Qasem Soleimani in Shush – Setting fire to banners of the regime’s proxy forces in Tehran, Karaj, and Ahvaz In a situation where cries of protest from the oppressed, impoverished by poverty, rising prices, and empty tables, echo against the dark tyranny of the mullahs’ regime, and while the regime uses executions and terror to stop uprisings, the rebellious youth are sending the message that the only path to freedom is resistance and uprisings.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbXymKlMfHqOs	2024-11-10T17:03:56-08:00	
Strategic Choke Points: Why India’s Access To The Malacca And Hor...	In an era of strategic competition, India's geostrategic positioning and access to two of the world's most critical maritime chokepoints—the Malacca and Hormuz Straits—grant it significant leverage. Together, these straits see over 60% of the world's oil flow and a third of global trade, underscoring their strategic importance for energy security and economic continuity. This article delves into how these chokepoints have evolved from avenues of trade to arenas of strategic influence, further cementing India's status as a security provider in the Indo-Pacific. The heightened focus on the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and Indo-Pacific is driven by multiple factors, including China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a recalibrating U.S. presence in the region, and the growing importance of maintaining secure, unimpeded global trade. India's maritime strategy has evolved to meet these shifting dynamics, moving beyond a coastal defence approach to a sophisticated, multi-layered strategy to protect its interests and those of its allies. Historical and Strategic Context: India's Maritime Evolution India's maritime ambitions have deep roots, with its naval history tracing back to ancient trade routes that once flourished across the Indian Ocean. However, India's naval posture was initially limited post-independence, focusing on littoral defence. Only in the last few decades, spurred by economic liberalisation, regional competition, and strategic imperatives, India began asserting its presence across the IOR. India's gradual shift toward a blue-water navy capable of operating in open oceans aligns with Alfred Mahan's concept of 'sea power' as a defining force for national strength. Key elements reshaping India's strategy include: China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): China's investments in ports across South Asia, such as Gwadar and Hambantota, are components of a 'String of Pearls' strategy, creating a network of logistical hubs and potential military outposts that could encircle India. U.S.-China Rivalry: As tensions increase, India's alignment with democratic maritime powers like the U.S. has become essential. The convergence of Indo-Pacific interests now shapes India's partnerships. Energy and Economic Security: Since over 85% of India's oil is imported via the Strait of Hormuz and key trade routes pass through the Malacca Strait, secure access to these chokepoints is fundamental to India's economic and energy stability. By securing and monitoring these chokepoints, India amplifies its influence, not just regionally but across the broader Indo-Pacific, underpinning its ambitions to be a net security provider. The Role of the Indian Navy: Strategic Surveillance and Rapid Response As the primary instrument of India's maritime power, the Indian Navy plays a central role in safeguarding India's strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific. Several key assets and strategies support India's naval vigilance over the Malacca and Hormuz Straits: Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC): The ANC is India's first tri-service theatre command, enabling coordinated defence capabilities at a vantage point near the Malacca Strait. This location allows India to maintain a robust monitoring and rapid-response presence over a critical waterway that carries nearly half of the world's maritime trade. Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR): Established in 2018, IFC-IOR facilitates real-time information sharing on maritime traffic, enhancing situational awareness and coordination with regional partners. This collaboration supports surveillance and ensures quick mobilisation in case of suspicious or hostile activities. Mission-Based Deployments (MBDs): India's year-round mission-based deployments allow the Indian Navy to maintain continuous patrols and surveillance over critical chokepoints, ensuring freedom of navigation and deterring piracy, terrorism, and other regional threats. Notably, anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and patrols in the Straits of Malacca and Hormuz reinforce India's ability to act as a first responder in crises. Regional Exercises and Operational Engagements: India has participated in high-profile naval exercises such as Malabar (with Quad members) and bilateral exercises with ASEAN nations. These drills enhance operational readiness interoperability and allow for joint strategic planning and rapid response to emerging threats in the region. By combining surveillance, intelligence sharing, and rapid deployment, the Indian Navy projects power across the Indo-Pacific, showcasing its ability to maintain stability and counter threats in these critical waterways. Geopolitical Challenges and Regional Rivalries: Balancing China's Influence India's strategic aspirations are increasingly impacted by the competition posed by China's expanding influence across the Indian Ocean. The 'String of Pearls' network of ports and bases, extending from Gwadar to Hambantota, raises the stakes, as China's presence in these locations grants it proximity to vital Indian interests. Key Aspects of India's Response India's SAGAR Vision: Under the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy, India has focused on fostering stability, economic connectivity, and security in the Indian Ocean. Through SAGAR, India has strengthened ties with ASEAN, Gulf nations, and littoral states, encouraging collaboration in maritime security, economic investment, and infrastructure development. Counterbalancing through the Quad and Regional Alliances: India's strategic engagements within the Quad (U.S., Japan, Australia, and India) and with ASEAN partners counterbalance China's assertive posture. Joint exercises, increased port calls, and dialogues on Indo-Pacific security underscore India's commitment to countering Chinese influence in these waterways. Partnerships in Port Development and Military Access: India has enhanced its logistical and military presence by developing infrastructure in the Maldives, Mauritius, and Seychelles. These partnerships extend India's operational reach and foster economic development in partner countries, strengthening India's influence in response to Chinese port acquisitions. These efforts signal India's resolve to safeguard its sovereignty over the IOR, mitigate Chinese encirclement, and maintain a balance of power, favouring an open, rules-based order. International Legal Frameworks: India's Commitment to UNCLOS India's adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) bolsters its image as a responsible maritime power. Part III of UNCLOS guarantees freedom of passage through international straits such as the Malacca and Hormuz, essential for global trade. India's operations abide by these regulations, contrasting with China's assertive activities in the South China Sea, where Beijing's territorial claims have contested freedom of navigation. By championing the principles of UNCLOS, India promotes a legal framework that upholds maritime stability and security. This commitment to international law enhances India's legitimacy as a stabilising force in the region, reinforcing the importance of a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific. Partnerships and Naval Diplomacy: Building Strategic Depth India's strategic partnerships extend beyond traditional alliances, encompassing extensive naval diplomacy and logistical support arrangements across the Indo-Pacific. Key Partnerships and Exercises Quad Exercises (Malabar): These exercises showcase the collective capabilities of Quad nations and enhance interoperability, ensuring that partner navies are operationally prepared for joint crisis response, freedom of navigation operations, and disaster relief efforts. ASEAN and Gulf Collaboration: India's bilateral exercises with ASEAN nations and increasing defence ties with Gulf states foster maritime interoperability and coordination. These alliances are pivotal as they help counterbalance regional threats, ensuring a cooperative security environment in the Indo-Pacific. Dual-Use Facilities in Key Locations: India's dual-use logistics facilities in Mauritius, Seychelles, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands extend the Indian Navy's reach across the Indian Ocean. By combining military capabilities with developmental aid and infrastructure, India strengthens its influence over these critical chokepoints, ensuring a sustained presence. These alliances support India's ambition to be a net security provider, allowing it to extend influence across the Indo-Pacific and respond quickly to regional threats. A Vision for Stability in the Indo-Pacific The Malacca and Hormuz Straits are more than maritime corridors—they are strategic assets that shape India's vision for a secure Indo-Pacific. By leveraging its naval strength, establishing partnerships, and adhering to international norms, India plays a decisive role in maintaining regional stability. As regional rivalries intensify, India's resolve to safeguard these chokepoints aligns with its vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, underscoring its responsibilities as a regional security provider. With its evolving naval strategies, proactive diplomacy, and steadfast adherence to international law, India is well-positioned to lead as a regional net security provider. India's commitment to securing these straits serves its national interests and fosters stability and resilience in the Indo-Pacific, ensuring the security and prosperity of all regional stakeholders.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbbwVIRwe573-	2024-11-10T17:02:25-08:00	
The Russian Invasion Of Ukraine: An Uncertain Future – OpEd	The Russian invasion of Ukraine has reached the culminating point in an unanticipated way for Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is one of the most brutal wars seen in recent history, with exponential losses in terms of human lives and destruction of properties, as well as lingering psychological impacts in both nations. This war is seen as one of the strategically miscalculated wars immensely supported by the West, which continues to react to Russian strategies instead of being proactive. The West's reactive approach has proven time and time again that it paved this precarious situation in Ukraine. The West's unwavering support to Ukraine has undergone different phases of transition with changes of governments of staunch supporting nations. However, the impact was minimal as the United States was leading the supporting efforts in Ukraine. In this context, Ukraine still obtained all the support needed to prevail in this conflict. The West's unwavering support, to a greater extent, not only encouraged the ambitious plans of President Zelensky to liberate some areas under Russian occupation but also to challenge Russian military might. As one can see, there were many inconsistencies in Ukraine's strategic planning and preparations. Ukraine's response solely depended on external support on paper rather than the availability of resources in hand. This strategic miscalculation of President Zelensky took Ukraine towards an unreversible failed path, thus permanently changing international security dynamics affecting areas beyond Ukraine. One such example is creating a new military alliance between Russia and North Korea that ultimately augmented the Russian military might. It is evident that President Zelensky's plans were merely based on hypothetical situations rather than the availability of resources, thereby over-extending capabilities and making them vulnerable. One such example is the occupation of Russia's Kursk region with battle-hardened brigades with considerable resources, thus creating a vacuum in the frontlines in Ukraine. Without absolute control of the war mechanism under Ukrainian leadership, the success achieved so far with this move is questionable, and it is hard to understand the strategy behind it. Such moves are only effective for a specific battlefield achievement that could turn the tide in Ukraine's favor within a specified period. However, Russia maintained its strategic objectives unperturbed, effectively dividing Ukrainian concentration until it had enough combat power to retake areas in Kursk. The level of uncertainty is proved by Ukraine's top military commander, Colonel General Syrskii's recent statement that the situation on the front lines is 'very, very difficult' due to being outnumbered and outgunned by Russian forces. According to the latest intelligence reports, the Russian military has assembled a force of 50,000 troops, including North Koreans, to retake the territory seized by Ukraine. If this Russian operation goes as planned, Ukrainian troops in Kursk will face one of the biggest challenges for their survival: over 5:1 enemy superiority. This will undeniably thin the frontline combat readiness in Ukraine, likely resulting in an early culmination of the conflict. Nevertheless, as of now, the recently concluded elections in the United States won by former President Trump have sent a clear message to the rest of the world that the United States does not intend to drag wars to achieve indirect strategic advantage but aims to stop killings for a better world. As one can see, no supporting country to Ukraine has put forward any means to end the war or encouraged Ukraine to resort to negotiations. This attitude of the staunch supporters has given President Zelensky a free hand that led to this calamity in the international security landscape. Unrealistic planning, while dependent on external support with hope, is not a recipe for success but leading the way towards a strategic failure. So far, President Putin's gambit worked as he had envisaged, including incorporating North Korean troops to equate to the combined West. On all accounts, the combined West with Ukraine failed to telegraph a plan to halt Russian aggression and prevent weakening Ukraine's security posture. On the other hand, President Zelensky's unrealistic, ambitious plans further weakened Ukraine's security posture and made frontlines even more vulnerable. Yet, despite strategic miscalculations, President Zelensky seems not to realize the ground realities. He faced a significant setback in his latest plan, demanding regaining Crimea control. A senior advisor to President-elect Donald Trump has said Ukraine needs to be 'realistic' in its aim for the war, adding the Russian-occupied peninsula of Crimea was 'gone.' It is time to grapple with the reality that unwavering support does not mean being unrealistic. In such a scenario, 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.' It is time to take a prudent approach to end this brutal war meaningfully that promotes broader international security. It is evident that President Zelensky's 'Victory Plan' has fallen well short of achieving its intended goals. Many Western staunch supporters have expressed different opinions on the Victory Plan for practical reasons, such as to avoid escalation and dragging them toward direct conflict with Russia. It is time for President Zelensky to come to reality and devise an alternative plan to sustain its efforts realistically to garner international support to end the war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbcloRK3rhV9T	2024-11-10T16:56:08-08:00	
The Musings Of Shigeru Ishiba: Visions Of An Asian NATO – OpEd	Japan’s new prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, is stirring the pot – notably on regional security matters. He has proposed something that has done more than raise a few eyebrows in the foreign and defence ministries of several countries. An Asian version of NATO, he has suggested, was an idea worth considering, notably given China’s ambitions in the region. 'The creation of an Asian version of NATO is essential to deter China by its Western allies,' he revealed to the Washington-based Hudson Institute in September. During his campaign for office, Ishiba had mooted changes to the deployment arrangements of the Japan Self-Defence Forces and the need to move beyond the purely bilateral approach to regional security anchored by US agreements with various countries, be it with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and others. Ishiba’s suggested changes to Japan’s self-defence posture builds on a cabinet decision made during the Abe administration to reinterpret the country’s constitution to permit exercising the right of collective self-defence. It was a problematic move, given the pacifist nature of a text that renounces the use of force in the resolution of international disputes. In September 2015, then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convinced the Diet to pass a package of security bills known as the Legislation for Peace and Security, thereby allowing Japan to participate in limited forms of collective self-defence. Opponents warned, understandably, that the legislation paved the way for Japan to attack a country in concert with another on the premise of collective self-defence, despite not itself being directly attacked. They have every reason to be even more worried given Ishiba’s recent meditations. The intention to broaden the remit of how Japan’s armed forces are deployed is also a reminder to the United States that Tokyo is no longer interested in playing a subordinate role in its alliance with Washington. 'The current Japan-US security treaty,' complains Ishiba, 'is structured so that the US is obligated to ‘defend’ Japan, and Japan is obligated to ‘provide bases’ to the US.' He suggests 'expanding the scope of joint management of US bases in Japan', a move that would reduce Washington’s burden, and revising the Japan-US Security Treaty and Status of Forces Agreement to permit the stationing of Japanese forces on Guam. What makes his suggestions disconcerting is not merely the establishment of a power bloc bound by the glue of collective self-defence – an arrangement that has much to do with defence as a growling provocation. Ishiba is intent on being even more provocative in suggesting that any such 'Asian version of NATO must also specifically consider America’s sharing of nuclear weapons or the introduction of nuclear weapons into the region.' Were such a move taken, it would, at least from a Japanese perspective, fly in the face of a doctrine in place since December 1967, when Prime Minister Eisaku Sato articulated the three non-nuclear principles of 'not possessing, not producing and not permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons, in line with Japan’s Peace Constitution.' As with so many in the business of preaching about international security, false paradigms and analysis are offered from the pulpit. The Japanese PM, much like neoconservative hawks in Washington and Canberra, prove incapable of seeing conflict in generic, transferrable terms. 'Ukraine today is Asia tomorrow,' he falsely reasons. 'Replacing Russia with China and Ukraine and Taiwan, the absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense.' Ergo, he reasons, the need for an Asian version of NATO. Ishiba’s suggestions have yet to gather momentum. Daniel Kritenbrink, US assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, told a forum on Indo-Pacific security at the Stimson Center in September that he preferred the current 'latticework' approach to US regional alliances featuring, for instance, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue involving Japan, India and Australia, and AUKUS, featuring Australia and the UK. 'It’s too early to talk about collective security in that context, and [the creation of] more formal institutions'. It was far better to focus on 'investing in the region’s existing formal architecture and continuing to build this network of formal and information relationships.' Kritenbrink’s analysis hardly gets away from the suspicion that the 'latticework' theory of US security in the Indo-Pacific is but a form of NATO in embryo. As Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said with tartness in 2022, 'The real goal for the [US] Indo-Pacific strategy is to establish an Indo-Pacific version of NATO. These perverse actions run counter to common aspirations of the region and are doomed to fail.' From New Delhi, the view towards such an alliance is not a glowing one. On October 1, at an event held by Washington’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar proved dismissive of any NATO replication in Asia. 'We don’t have that kind of strategic architecture in mind.' India had 'a different history and different way of approaching' its security considerations. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House, the collective defence hawks so keen on adding kindling to conflict will have their teeth chattering. Ishiba’s ideas may well have to be put back into cold storage – at least in the interim. And as luck would have it, his own prime ministerial tenure already looks threatened.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbXH544SP64FE	2024-11-10T16:49:12-08:00	
The Role Of Political Psychology In US Energy Diplomacy: Strategi...	Political psychology—a field that examines how psychological processes influence political decision-making, behavior, and relations—plays a significant role in the energy diplomacy of the United States. As one of the world's largest energy producers and consumers, the U.S. has established sophisticated mechanisms in its energy diplomacy that extend beyond mere resources and policies. By using psychological principles to shape perception, build alliances, and influence international energy policy, the United States wields a unique diplomatic approach that ensures its interests are safeguarded and advanced globally. This article explores how the U.S. uses political psychology in its energy diplomacy, analyzing its application through strategic influence, perception management, and alliance building. Understanding Political Psychology and Energy Diplomacy Political psychology in energy diplomacy is centered around how beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions impact energy policy and international relations. The U.S. uses political psychology to assess the motivations, fears, and aspirations of global actors, crafting messages and policies that resonate with target audiences. Through a deep understanding of these psychological dynamics, the U.S. is able to influence foreign governments, energy markets, and public opinion in ways that align with its broader geopolitical objectives. Presenting Energy Independence and Security The U.S. presents energy independence and security as cornerstones of its national identity and strength. Domestically, this framing is designed to evoke a sense of self-reliance and resilience, instilling public support for policies that reduce dependence on foreign oil and promote domestic energy production. Internationally, this psychological framing positions the U.S. as a robust and reliable player in energy markets, reinforcing the perception of stability and control over energy resources. By highlighting energy independence, the U.S. promotes a message that it can be trusted as a partner who won't succumb to foreign energy pressures. In response to events like the 1973 oil crisis, the U.S. developed a narrative around the importance of energy security to prevent future vulnerabilities. This narrative continues to shape U.S. energy diplomacy, where it projects itself as an energy-secure nation capable of supporting allies in times of crisis, such as Europe during its recent energy challenges with Russia. This framing appeals to allies' psychological desire for stability and reassurance, positioning the U.S. as a dependable partner. Perception Management and Psychological Influence The United States excels at perception management, a strategy that manipulates how other nations perceive its energy policies, resources, and objectives. By using political psychology to understand the concerns and priorities of other countries, the U.S. tailors its diplomatic communications to foster favorable impressions. For instance, during the European energy crisis following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the U.S. presented itself as a stable provider of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe. This assurance was not only about supplying energy but also about projecting an image of the U.S. as a trustworthy, steady ally, reinforcing a sense of psychological security in an unpredictable energy landscape. Perception management extends to how the U.S. shapes narratives around environmental and climate policies. By emphasizing its role in clean energy development, the U.S. not only appeals to global environmental concerns but also differentiates itself from nations like Russia and China, which are often seen as less committed to climate action. This positions the U.S. as both a leader and moral authority on sustainability, a strategy that appeals to countries looking for partnerships that align with their own climate goals. Influence Tactics in Diplomatic Negotiations In energy negotiations, the U.S. employs a range of influence tactics grounded in political psychology to achieve its objectives. Techniques such as reciprocity, social proof, and authority are used to build consensus and secure commitments from other nations. Reciprocity: The U.S. often engages in reciprocal agreements, where it provides energy resources, technology, or financial aid in exchange for political or economic concessions. This tactic creates a sense of obligation and goodwill, fostering a reciprocal dynamic that strengthens alliances. Social Proof: By collaborating with influential multilateral organizations like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and promoting collective action on issues such as climate change, the U.S. taps into the principle of social proof. Countries are more likely to adopt U.S.-favored energy policies when they see other nations doing so, reinforcing a norm of alignment with U.S. standards. Authority: The U.S. uses its expertise in energy technology, regulatory frameworks, and climate science to assert authority in international energy discourse. By positioning itself as a knowledgeable and reliable leader, it influences other countries to follow its recommendations, especially in areas like nuclear energy safety and renewable energy investment. Soft Power and Cultural Messaging in Energy Diplomacy Soft power—the ability to attract and persuade rather than coerce—is a critical component of U.S. energy diplomacy. Through initiatives like the Clean Energy Ministerial and the U.S.-India Strategic Energy Partnership, the U.S. promotes energy policies that align with global values of sustainability and innovation. This messaging resonates particularly well with countries striving to improve their energy infrastructures while addressing climate goals. The U.S. also uses cultural diplomacy to promote clean energy values. Public diplomacy campaigns, academic exchanges, and international conferences all serve to promote an image of the U.S. as a pioneer in sustainable energy. These efforts subtly encourage other nations to align their energy policies with U.S. standards, fostering a psychological alignment that facilitates diplomatic cooperation. Building Psychological Resilience through Strategic Communication During energy crises or market disruptions, the U.S. employs strategic communication to maintain psychological resilience among its allies and prevent adversaries from exploiting vulnerabilities. By quickly addressing energy supply concerns, the U.S. reduces fear and uncertainty, preventing panic that could destabilize markets or compromise alliances. For example, during the 2022 European energy crisis, the U.S. communicated its commitment to support Europe with LNG supplies, helping to calm anxieties and maintain solidarity against Russia's use of energy as a geopolitical weapon. This communication reinforced a sense of unity and collective resilience, a psychological strategy that not only provided immediate relief but also strengthened long-term trust in U.S. energy partnerships. Psychological Tactics in Countering Energy Influence from Adversaries The U.S. actively counters the energy influence of adversaries like Russia and China through psychological tactics designed to diminish their appeal and expose vulnerabilities. By highlighting the environmental and security risks of relying on Russian energy or Chinese coal-based investments, the U.S. seeks to sway countries toward U.S.-backed energy options that are presented as cleaner, safer, and more transparent. Moreover, the U.S. often presents its energy exports, particularly LNG, as a means of freedom gas to promote the idea of energy as a tool for liberating countries from authoritarian influences. This framing creates a psychological association between U.S. energy and ideals of democracy and freedom, appealing to countries wary of over-reliance on energy from less democratic nations. Leveraging Identity and National Pride in Energy Diplomacy The U.S. taps into the identity and national pride of other nations as a psychological lever in energy diplomacy. Recognizing that countries often seek to bolster their own national image and self-sufficiency, the U.S. offers partnerships that empower other nations to build their own energy capabilities. For instance, the U.S.-Africa Clean Energy Finance Initiative encourages African countries to develop sustainable energy infrastructures, appealing to their aspirations for independence and modernization. In many cases, the U.S. also encourages the adoption of U.S.-backed technologies and standards, framing them as symbols of modernization and progress. This approach resonates with national pride and the desire for development, positioning the U.S. as a valuable partner in achieving these goals. Using Fear Appeals and Security Concerns In some aspects of its energy diplomacy, the U.S. employs fear appeals by emphasizing the risks of energy insecurity and reliance on unpredictable suppliers. By highlighting the potential for supply disruptions, economic downturns, or security vulnerabilities, the U.S. appeals to the fear of instability among its allies, reinforcing the desirability of a secure energy partnership with the U.S.For example, the U.S. response to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project was partially based on raising awareness of the security risks posed by dependence on Russian gas. This approach used fear appeals to sway European public opinion and political leaders toward alternative energy arrangements, including increased imports of U.S. LNG, framing it as a more stable and secure choice. Psychological Commitment to Environmental Stewardship The U.S. leverages global psychological commitment to environmental stewardship as part of its energy diplomacy. By positioning itself as a leader in climate action and green energy technology, the U.S. appeals to the growing environmental consciousness of countries worldwide. Through initiatives such as the Paris Agreement, where the U.S. is a prominent participant, it appeals to the psychological need for global unity in addressing environmental crises. In promoting clean energy, the U.S. also addresses the concept of cognitive consistency. Many countries have publicly committed to climate goals and renewable energy transitions, and by aligning with the U.S., they are able to maintain this consistency. The U.S. takes advantage of this psychological drive to align policy actions with public commitments, fostering partnerships that support its own clean energy goals. Conclusion The United States' approach to energy diplomacy is deeply infused with psychological strategies that shape global perceptions, alliances, and policy decisions. By using political psychology to understand and influence the motivations, fears, and aspirations of other nations, the U.S. creates an environment conducive to its energy interests and objectives. From framing energy independence to leveraging environmental commitments, the U.S. employs a range of psychological tactics that reinforce its role as a leader in global energy diplomacy. As energy markets become more complex and interdependent, the psychological dimension of energy diplomacy will only grow in importance. The U.S. continues to refine its psychological strategies, adapting them to new geopolitical realities and evolving environmental priorities.

At the Valdai Discussion Club's meeting held on 7th November 2024, President Vladimir Putin at the plenary session continued to build indepth discussions on Russian and African bilateral relations, Russia's passion to support Africa's attainment of economic sovereignty. It was explicitly noted, and this noticeably reflected in the declarations adopted after the first and second Russia-Africa summits, that Africa needs to liberate itself from the trapings of neo-colonialism of the United States and Europe. That was not the first time. Valdai's experts have been interested in Russia's policy in Africa, particularly in this contemporary era of evolving multipolar architecture and new world political order. Africa is an integral part of the focus in the Global South. Russia has already held two symbolic summits and outlined certain economic directions for Africa. In practical terms, Russia with its previous experience with Africa during the Soviet times, now has the potential to assert as an investment leader in Africa. African leaders have unreservedly expressed their preparedness for mutual economic cooperation and in other fields, voiced their support for building a new world order through the association BRICS+ (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). Given the proven fact that Russia certainly has both the financial and technological capability for investing in public infrastructure, in addition to to providing necessary security in conflicting regions in Africa. Conflicts in Africa are partially as a result of under-development, and persistent weak economic development and rising levels of unemployment in the society. It is abundantly clear that with its multivectoral foreign policy, Russia has presented itself as a reliable partner, and currently is leading African countries to confront western hegemony, political exceptionalism and dominating power. It has offered guarantees of being in position to support Africa to attain economic sovereignty but, for now, largely remained as a virtual investor. Russia's economic presence in Africa is still comparatively weak, even after the symbolic summits held in Sochi and St. Petersburg. Notwithstanding, African leaders consider efforts at reforming international institutions and Africa's incorporation into their structures would facilitate the process of attaining a better economic status, enable the expected transitions from the current trends of neo-colonialism and further move away from blames of state management inefficiency, development unsustainability and frustration of democracy. Across the continent, leaders and the elites have shown their inability to mitigate crises and to mobilise sufficient resources, including financing and human for promote their development goals. Undeniably, the Valdai Club represents a critical area of research for humanity, experts dive into useful details or debate the causes of ongoing developments now around the world. In his contribution at Valdai, an Indian expert Rasigan Maharajh, rightly explained that 'common security can only be enhanced by actively reducing these inequalities in world systems, actively promoting knowledge sharing, and ensuring equitable opportunities for the development of all and sundry.' And the global majority seems to obviously prefer multipolarity. As relations are developing, moving ahead with concrete policy decisions should be an ideal direction. Quite often, there has been a lot of positive momentum in developing remarkable cooperation, several bilateral agreements have been signed and yet little noticeable results. Russians get irritated by the statement indicating little impact after series of business meetings, conferences and summits. At the Valdai meeting, Professor Irina Abramova, Director of the Africa Studies Institute had the opportunity to ask Vladimir Putin a few questions relating to Africa. Specifically she wanted to know Putin's views over the impact of Russia's relations with Africa based on the fact that Putin has repeated his popular phrases, at the Kazan's BRICS press conference that Africa, together with Southeast Asia, are new centers of global growth. Today, at Valdai meeting, Putin repeated this same idea. Professor Abramova, in addition, stressed the fact that in the conditions of fierce competition – China, India, and old global players, and even Turkey, the (Persian) Gulf countries, and Iran are working seriously in the continent, – Russia needs to find its niche, where it would be the best for Africans. But, dozens of negotiations with African leaders have been held these several years, with some more than once. Was there any one promising direction in these negotiations that all African leaders would talk about? As expected, Putin reiterated all those popular Soviet-style rhetoric, ultimately reflecting the historical support for Africa to attain political independence from colonial rule, western exploitation and for sovereignty, for the creation of some basic conditions for economic development. Officials have indicated that colonial trends in the African system constitute impediments for Russia to effectively invest in Africa. Without mincing words, Putin stressed further at the Valdai meeting: 'these neo-colonial instruments have been preserved in the economy by Western countries, but also in the field of security. In general, we will work intensely, responsibly, systematically in all directions.' The first Russia-Africa ministerial conference was also held, on 9–10 November 2024, in southern coastal city of Sochi as per the decisions reached at the Second Russia–Africa Summit. The business programme included around 20 panel sessions and thematic events focusing on perspectives for Russia–Africa cooperation in the areas of security, economics, and humanitarian engagement. It aimed at building on the outcomes of the Second Russia–Africa Summit, bringing together more than 40 foreign ministers from Russia and Africa, the African Union Commission, and executive bodies of regional integration organizations. In attendance were approximately 1,500 representatives from financial institutions, Russian and African businesses, civil society, academia, and the media. There was, as always, those similar themes for dialogue between Russia and Africa. 'Cooperation with the countries of the African continent is now one of the common priorities, noting that there are existing wide prospects for cooperation as demonstrated by the large numbers of African partners to the conference,' stated Anton Kobyakov, Adviser to the President of the Russian Federation, Executive Secretary of the Organizing Committee for Russia–Africa at Roscongress Foundation. Available on the Kremlin website, Vladimir Putin greetings to the first ministerial conference participants read: 'African countries enjoy a growing prestige on the international stage. By pursuing a constructive and peace-loving foreign policy, they are playing an increasingly important role in addressing major international matters. For its part, Russia attaches particular importance to strengthening relations with its African partners. We are united by our aspiration to building a just multipolar world order based on genuine equality and the rule of law and any form of discrimination.' In absolute terms, Russia showed preparedness to facilitate the implementation of large infrastructure projects, without publicly mentioning financial allocation. It further pointed to issues of promoting the development of trade and economic relations between Russia and Africa, while emphasizing on the possibility of creating favourable environment and conditions. There is absolutely no need to repeat multi-dimensional contents from speeches of President Vladimir Putin and that of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov here. But an insight into all the previous official statements, there have already been layout steps for concrete areas of cooperation. What remains are valuable and thorough examination of Russia's potential focused directions in Africa policy. Many have indicated that Russian and African leaders really have to take off existing barriers for promoting economic development, and this could have positive implications for African countries, and particularly for Russia as one of the leaders of the emerging multipolar world. Aside setting priorities, Russian and African leaders working-style of state-to-state and government-to-government format, both have to broaden joint parameters to include the private sector operatives, the civil society, entrepreneurial diaspora, youth and women, to pave pathways for broader relationship between Russia and African countries. The questions arising from the historic first ministerial conference provided an additional strong basis, and one more step forward, especially coordinating the implementation of joint projects involving potential Russian operators in the spheres of trade, economic and investment partnership, and embrace new mechanisms and on suitable ways to bolster multifaceted relations between Russia and Africa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbeMa83tGKrNn	2024-11-10T16:42:46-08:00	
Second Trump Term A Threat To Rights In US, World, Says HRW	Donald Trump’s second term as United States president poses a grave threat to human rights in the United States and the world, Human Rights Watch said. These concerns reflect Trump’s rights-abusing record during his first term, his embrace of white supremacist supporters and ideology, the extreme antidemocratic and anti-rights policies proposed by think tanks led by former aides, and campaign promises, including to round up and deport millions of immigrants and retaliate against political opponents. 'Donald Trump has made no secret of his intent to violate the human rights of millions of people in the United States,' said Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch. 'Independent institutions and civil society groups, including Human Rights Watch, will need to do all we can to hold him and his administration accountable for abuses.' During Trump’s first term as president, from 2017 to 2021, Human Rights Watch documented his record of rights abuses. These included policies and efforts to expel asylum seekers and separate families at the US-Mexico border, advance racist tropes against Black communities and other people of color, adopt policiesthat punish low-income families and deprive them of health care, and to fuel a violent insurrection to overthrow the results of a democratic election. Trump’s pledges during his 2024 campaign raise greater cause for concern in a second term, both domestically and internationally. In 2023, he said he would not be a dictator 'except for day one' in office. Trump has repeatedly praised autocrats such as Viktor Orban, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un. He has proposed policies that would weaken democratic institutions that protect fundamental human rights and would lessen checks on presidential authority. The threat of abusing the executive office is of even greater concern because of a recent US Supreme Court decision that grants presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions taken in office. Project 2025, a governing plan written by Trump’s former advisers and political allies, details many other abusive, often racially discriminatory policies that the new administration may adopt. Although Trump has denied connections to Project 2025, many of his statements echo its premises. While the presidential campaign cycle featured rhetoric from both candidates that was hostile toward immigrants, Trump made scapegoating immigrants a central pillar of his campaign. He has called for extreme policies that include mass detention of migrants and mass deportations of millions of people, which would tear apart families with deep roots in the US. Such a program would invariably entail racial profiling, lead to heightened abuses by law enforcement during mass roundups, and instigate more xenophobic actions among the wider public. During the campaign, Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, spread racist lies about Haitian migrants in particular and fomented disinformation that immigration leads to increased crime in the United States. Abortion rights will be under increased threat during Trump’s second term. His insistence that states should have the power to block access to basic health care allows policies that violate rights, endanger health, lead to preventable deaths, and criminalize private health care decisions. Trump has vowed to retaliate against his political enemies. Throughout speeches and campaign interviews, he has used increasingly dangerous rhetoric, referring to his critics as 'the enemy from within.' Trump threatened to order the US Department of Justice to pursue prosecutions against President Joe Biden and others he claims oppose his agenda, including election officials and voters. Trump has also suggested he would invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy the US military and national guard against people in the US who might exercise their right to protest. With respect to foreign policy, during his first term Trump demonstrated little respect for treaties, multilateral institutions, or efforts to protect the human rights of people living under repressive governments. His administration consistently worked against women’s rights and environmental progress at the United Nations and tried to redefine and limit the definition of rights to be protected through the US Department of State. Trump has signaled opposition to funding for humanitarian aid and civilian protection efforts in major conflicts and crises. Likely partnerships with rights-abusing governments during a new Trump administration risk emboldening these governments to further harm people within their purview and perpetuate cycles of abuse and immunity from accountability around the world. 'Rights-respecting institutions and officials need to hold the line during the Trump administration,' Hassan said. 'World leaders, federal and state workers, activists, and ordinary citizens have a role to play in protecting human rights and keeping Trump from carrying out the abuses he has promised.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbRnsMDxGLWvH	2024-11-10T16:39:29-08:00	
Adapting Bangladesh’s Energy Strategy For A Surge In Global Renew...	As the world moves toward a renewable energy future, Bangladesh has an opportunity to integrate sustainable energy sources across its power, heat, and transport sectors. Between 2024 and 2030, global renewable energy consumption is projected to increase by nearly 60%, driven by technological advancements, falling costs, and supportive policies. For Bangladesh, aligning with this global trend is essential not only for enhancing energy security and meeting climate targets but also for reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels and fostering economic resilience. Here's a sector-by-sector analysis of how Bangladesh can adopt a proactive approach to leverage renewable energy within the context of global trends. 1. Power Sector: Scaling Up Renewable Electricity Global forecasts show renewable electricity, particularly from solar and wind, will be the primary driver of growth in renewable energy. By 2030, renewable electricity is expected to reach 46% of global electricity generation, with solar PV and wind becoming the largest contributors. For Bangladesh, where demand for electricity is rapidly rising, expanding renewable power sources is crucial for both energy security and carbon reduction. Steps Bangladesh Can Take: Expanding Solar and Wind Capacity: Bangladesh has already started investing in solar energy projects, but there is significant potential for further expansion. To support this, Bangladesh could incentivize utility-scale solar and wind farms, particularly in areas with high solar irradiance and wind potential. Decentralized Solar Power: Given the geography and challenges of grid expansion, solar home systems and mini-grids in rural areas could provide off-grid solutions, especially in regions where extending the main grid is cost-prohibitive. Policy and Financial Support: Bangladesh could benefit from policy reforms that attract foreign investment in renewables and provide financial incentives for local renewable energy developers. Leveraging international funding, such as the Green Climate Fund, would also be essential for scaling up investment. Grid Modernization: Variable renewables like solar and wind require an adaptive grid infrastructure. Strengthening the national grid and developing energy storage solutions, such as batteries, can ensure that renewable electricity is efficiently integrated and managed. 2. Industrial and Building Sectors: Embracing Renewable Heat Solutions Globally, the industrial and building sectors are projected to experience significant shifts toward renewable heat, with bioenergy, solar thermal, and geothermal sources expected to meet 20% of heating demand by 2030. In Bangladesh, transitioning to renewable heat sources can be vital for decarbonizing industries and reducing fossil fuel dependency, particularly in industries with high heat demand like textiles and ceramics. Steps Bangladesh Can Take Bioenergy and Biomass Utilization: With a substantial agricultural sector, Bangladesh has a readily available source of biomass. Developing bioenergy facilities to produce heat from agricultural residues, such as rice husks and sugarcane bagasse, could support rural industries and reduce waste. Solar Thermal Systems for Water Heating: Solar thermal installations for water heating in residential and industrial buildings offer a cost-effective renewable heat solution. Bangladesh could introduce incentive programs to encourage adoption in hotels, hospitals, and residential complexes, reducing demand on electricity used for heating. Geothermal Exploration: While geothermal energy is less developed in Bangladesh, exploring geothermal potential, especially in high-temperature regions, could support long-term renewable heating objectives. Investment in research and feasibility studies is necessary to assess the viability of geothermal projects. 3. Transport Sector: Transitioning to Renewable Fuels and Electrification The transport sector globally is set to achieve a 6% renewable energy share by 2030, with significant contributions from biofuels, renewable electricity, and emerging technologies like hydrogen. For Bangladesh, reducing emissions from transport is a critical goal, especially as urbanization and population growth increase the demand for mobility. Steps Bangladesh Can Take Promoting Electric Vehicles (EVs): Developing EV infrastructure, such as charging stations and incentives for EV purchases, is key to reducing transport emissions. Bangladesh could start with electric buses and three-wheelers, which are common in urban areas and well-suited for short commutes. Supporting Biofuel Production: Bangladesh could explore biofuels derived from local feedstocks, such as jute and waste oils, to power road and marine transport. Partnerships with local industries and international biofuel programs can help establish a domestic biofuel market. Hydrogen Pilot Projects: While hydrogen infrastructure is nascent, Bangladesh could initiate pilot projects in industrial transport applications. The introduction of hydrogen-powered buses or ferries could serve as a demonstration for future expansion and build awareness of hydrogen's potential. Reducing Traffic and Encouraging Public Transport: By improving public transit options and discouraging private vehicle use through urban planning and policy incentives, Bangladesh can minimize overall energy demand in transport. Transitioning public transport fleets to renewable energy sources can set an example for sustainable urban transport. 4. Developing Renewable Fuel Markets for Transport and Heating Renewable fuels, such as bioenergy and hydrogen, are essential for sectors that are difficult to electrify. Bangladesh can leverage these alternatives in both the transport and heating sectors to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Steps Bangladesh Can Take Supporting Local Biofuel Production: Bangladesh could establish partnerships with local farmers to supply biomass for biofuel production, creating an integrated approach that benefits both the agriculture and energy sectors. Policies to support biofuel blending mandates could further boost demand. Hydrogen Research and Development: Encouraging research institutions and private sector involvement in hydrogen technology can help Bangladesh build a foundational hydrogen economy. Pilot projects in industries or transport fleets would demonstrate hydrogen's feasibility and create momentum for broader adoption. Integrating Renewable Fuels in Policy Frameworks: Bangladesh's energy policy could establish goals for renewable fuel adoption in sectors such as aviation and marine, which are harder to electrify. Incentives for renewable fuel production, along with clear government targets, can help stimulate the domestic market. 5. Addressing Investment and Policy Challenges For Bangladesh to successfully increase renewable energy across sectors, addressing investment barriers and creating supportive policies are crucial steps. The global renewable heat market, for example, faces challenges due to high interest rates and inflation, and similar issues could impact Bangladesh. Steps Bangladesh Can Take Attracting Foreign Investment and Public-Private Partnerships: Given limited domestic funding, Bangladesh should actively seek international investment through public-private partnerships. Partnerships with foreign governments, multilateral organizations, and the private sector can supply the expertise and capital necessary for renewable projects. Implementing Favorable Tariffs and Subsidies: Subsidizing renewable technologies and adjusting tariffs to make renewables cost-competitive with fossil fuels would incentivize wider adoption. Policies to encourage low-interest loans or tax credits for renewable energy installations can alleviate the initial financial burden for businesses and consumers. Adopting Clear Renewable Energy Targets and Roadmaps: To guide sustainable energy transition, the government could establish a national roadmap with clear targets for renewable power, heat, and transport sectors. Aligning national policies with international climate goals, such as the IEA Net Zero by 2050 Scenario, will not only improve policy clarity but also make Bangladesh an attractive location for renewable investment. Conclusion The projected global surge in renewable energy consumption presents a valuable opportunity for Bangladesh to build a resilient, sustainable energy system. By adopting a multifaceted approach that includes expanding renewable electricity, adopting bioenergy and hydrogen, enhancing electric mobility, and investing in renewable heating, Bangladesh can align with global energy trends and address its own energy security and climate challenges. Bangladesh's renewable energy potential can be further unlocked through supportive policies, international partnerships, and a focus on building domestic expertise. As renewable energy markets transform worldwide, Bangladesh's proactive involvement in this shift can lead to a cleaner, more sustainable energy landscape—ensuring both environmental and economic benefits for the nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbbuofv7p8eIb	2024-11-10T16:34:42-08:00	
Firewall Gender Equality From Threats Like Anti-Rights Geneva Con...	Trump's earlier tenure as President of the United States was marred by the infamous jolt to abortion rights and broader sexual and reproductive health and rights. Within days after the 2024 election results point towards his imminent return as the President, anti-abortion and anti-rights agenda is menacingly on the rise once again, as per the recent news. We must remember that all governments have promised to deliver on gender equality and human rights by endorsing a range of declarations, agreements and other commitments, including the legally-binding treaty CEDAW in 1979 (the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women), ICPD in 1994 (International Conference on Population and Development and its Programme of Action), Beijing Declaration in 1995 and its platform for action, UN Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, among others. But anti-rights push of Geneva Consensus Declaration threatens to undo whatever-little progress has been made on gender equality and human rights. The Geneva Consensus Declaration takes an anti-rights stance against recognising abortion as a human right and aims to scuttle sexual and reproductive rights. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned us last year that 'on the current track, gender equality is projected to be 300 years away.' Governments have promised to deliver on gender equality by 2030 as part of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 'When the PACT for the future was adopted at the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September 2024, alarmingly over 30 countries have adopted it which are also signatories to the regressive and anti-rights Geneva Consensus Declaration,' said Menka Goundan, Programme Director, ARROW (Asian-Pacific Resource & Research Centre for Women). She was speaking at the 2nd session of SHE & Rights (Sexual Health with Equity and Rights) co-organised by ARROW, IPPF, WGNRR and CNS. Menka added: 'Whilst the bigger winds like the PACT of the future adopted at the UNGA might come in, and we would be like 'oh yeah! this is so progressive' but we often do not underscore it against threats like Geneva Consensus Declaration which will impede the progressive implementation of the PACT for the Future, and other commitments we are making for gender equality and human rights.' 'That is why we need to educate ourselves in terms of threats like Geneva Consensus Declaration. This Declaration is regressive and anti-abortion, and right winged (in terms of its framework) because it allows governments to hide under the principle of 'sovereignty' and to release these countries from their obligation to enact sexual and reproductive rights for women. So, it is a very slim move to regress when it comes to sexual and reproductive health and rights. We are failing to ensure that women have autonomy to make choices on their sexual and reproductive health' said Menka. Conflicting policies Kavutha Mutua, Advocate, High Court of Kenya and Founder-Director of The Legal Caravan said: 'Most African countries have signed on to international human rights instruments which include the CEDAW of 1979, ICPD of 1994, Beijing Declaration of 1995, and the SDGs in 2015. All of them provide critical aspects on gender equality and women empowerment with a focus on safe abortion, access to contraceptives and comprehensive sexuality education. But contradicting policies, like Geneva Consensus Declaration, go against what is provided in local laws. For example, Kenya (whose constitution provides for the right to access abortion services) has signed on to the regressive Geneva Consensus Declaration - and there has been a campaign in African countries led by our respected First Ladies who are encouraging signing on to such declaration which goes against the provisions of our local laws. As Africa we need to prioritize the removal of legal and policy barriers towards access to safe abortion services and access to contraceptives.' Safe abortion rights are critical to the progress of humankind Dr Suchitra Dalvie, Co-Founder and Coordinator, Asia Safe Abortion Partnership (ASAP) said: 'Safe abortion rights are critical to the progress of humankind because the inability to control fertility reduces womens' opportunities to access education, financial independence and overall well-being. It reduces capacity to exercise autonomy, agency and the ability to fulfil their highest potential. Criminalization does not reduce or stop abortions, rather it only reduces safe abortions.' 'The regressive Geneva Consensus Declaration is absolutely a conservative, authoritative and repressive attempt against the choice of women for their reproductive rights as it promotes no right to abortion. Ironically, Geneva Consensus Declaration is meant to be for the 'women's health and gender equality'. However, it neither promotes the health rights of women nor includes any issues of people from sexual minorities. Geneva Consensus Declaration pushes against the international efforts to make safe abortion a human right, and calls for global health policies to focus on improving maternal health without prioritizing abortion,' said Tushar Niroula, Executive Director, MSI (Marie Stopes International) Nepal. 'Nepal has got a very progressive safe abortion law in the country, but the consequences of Geneva consensus declaration can pose a threat and have a very negative impact, even though Nepal is not a signatory to the Geneva Consensus Declaration. However, there is a rise in anti-abortion groups promoting pro-life which may further fuel anti-abortion movements of conservative forces within Nepal, especially among the religious organizations or individuals,' added Niroula. Rise of global anti-rights movements is threatening SRHR Dr Rathnamala M Desai, Member, Board of Trustees, International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and President, Family Planning Association of India (FPA India) said that 'Now a transnational anti-rights movement is gaining further political, social and economic legitimacy- historically targeting abortion rights. Various coalitions of nationalist religious and ultra-conservative actors and organisations have become emboldened to attack gender equality and sexuality more broadly in pursuit of a regressive social and political agenda. The rise of a global anti-rights movement is threatening sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as liberal democracies and the civil liberties and human rights of all.' Tushar Niroula of MSI Nepal says: 'We cannot be complacent in countries where we have a progressive safe abortion law because attempts like Geneva Consensus Declaration will encourage anti-abortion movements and active opposition from religious groups, which may potentially lead to the rollback of safe abortion laws. 28 out of 36 countries within MSI Network have reported active opposition against sexual and reproductive health and rights in the last two years. 8 country programmes in MSI Network reported direct attack from anti-abortion pro-life groups and many more reported attacks from local organizations. Regressive activities like Geneva Consensus Declaration can create a barrier to access safe abortion services, which could lead to an increase in unsafe abortions resulting in high maternal morbidity and mortality.' Agrees Dr Dalvie of ASAP: 'We must be very involved in strategizing to mitigate the risks that could be posed by regressive Geneva Consensus Declaration to whatever progress has happened on gender equality and human rights. Even in countries where we have the abortion law there is still potential for it to be taken away as we have seen with the example of the United States.' Gender justice is vital cog-in-the-wheel for SDGs Gender justice remains the essential and critical cog-in-the-wheel to advance progress on all goals and targets enshrined in the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Health justice, economic justice, redistributive justice, social justice, climate justice, gender justice and accountability to peoples are essential and interdependent pillars of development justice. While on the larger level, political agendas have to be rooted in gender and development justice where 'no one is truly left behind' yet at an individual level too we have to dismantle harmful gender stereotypes and norms. Harmful narrative for gender inequality is regressive and so is the rise of anti-rights movements worldwide. The year 2025 will mark 30 years since Beijing Declaration and its Platform for Action were adopted in 1995. Beijing+30 intergovernmental review processes are being held in Africa (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) and later this month in Asia and the Pacific region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbR8w23QCkPP1	2024-11-10T16:32:25-08:00	
A New Era Of Hope: Trump’s Return And The Promise Of Stability – ...	By Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor The reelection of President Donald Trump heralds a new era of optimism and possibility for both the US and the global community. His impending return to office signals a steadfast commitment to revitalizing the US economy and prioritizing the well-being of the American people. As a businessman with a proven track record, Trump brings a practical approach to governance, focusing on economic prosperity and tangible results.During his previous term, Trump’s policies spurred economic growth, reduced unemployment and created a favorable environment for businesses. His emphasis on deregulation and tax reforms breathed new life into various sectors, fostering investment and job creation. The American people can expect a continuation of these strategies, aimed at further strengthening the nation’s economic foundation.Beyond the economy, Trump has consistently championed traditional family values and has made it clear he intends to protect the youth from harmful ideologies. His stance against the 'woke' movement demonstrates a commitment to safeguarding cultural values and shielding younger generations from agendas that threaten to erode societal foundations. This form of leadership is not only crucial for the US but also serves as an example for young people around the world.On the international front, Trump’s approach to foreign policy is characterized by a focus on peace and stability. His administration’s success in brokering agreements in the Middle East, such as the Abraham Accords, underscored his commitment to fostering dialogue and reducing tensions.As the conflict between Ukraine and Russia continues to claim lives and create global instability, I am confident that Trump will leverage his diplomatic acumen to facilitate negotiations that could bring an end to this crisis. Trump’s commitment to addressing the Middle East’s unique security challenges is clear. A renewed US-Gulf Cooperation Council partnership under his leadership would reinforce stability across the Gulf states. His strategic alliance with the GCC nations reflects a shared commitment to countering common threats and promoting regional security. UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan last week extended his congratulations to Trump and emphasized the importance of this collaboration by stating: 'The UAE and US are united by our enduring partnership based on shared ambitions for progress. The UAE looks forward to continuing to work with our partners in the US toward a future of opportunity, prosperity and stability for all.' In a Middle East where stability is paramount, Trump’s focus on strengthening alliances and curbing extremist forces offers a path forward. His leadership is an encouraging sign for all those invested in a secure and prosperous future for the region.Trump’s foreign policy extends beyond the Middle East, reaching key players in Asia. His diplomatic engagements with North Korea and China signaled a shift from military confrontations toward economic cooperation. His landmark meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, though met with skepticism by some, opened channels of communication that had long been dormant, while his firm stance on trade imbalances with China sought to establish a more equitable economic relationship.As Trump once said, 'sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.' This sentiment captures the resilience and adaptability that characterize his approach to leadership — qualities that will undoubtedly serve him well in navigating both domestic and global complexities.World leaders have expressed optimism regarding their renewed collaboration with Trump. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer praised Trump’s 'historic victory,' highlighting the enduring UK-US alliance, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed the 'true partnership' between the EU and the US, emphasizing a strong transatlantic agenda to address shared challenges during Trump’s presidency.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, recognizing the significance of Trump’s reelection, expressed hope for 'strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.' His message reflects the optimism felt by nations worldwide that Trump’s leadership will contribute to a more peaceful and balanced international order. Reflecting on my endorsement of Trump during his first campaign, I believed that his background as a businessman would bring a refreshing change to American politics. While some people, including celebrities, opposed him, it was crucial to set aside personal biases and offer him the chance to implement his vision. His subsequent achievements demonstrated the effectiveness of a pragmatic, business-oriented approach.Today, with his reelection, we are presented with an opportunity for a brighter future. I urge all stakeholders to put personal differences aside and engage constructively, listening to the voices of the American people who have chosen this path.As we look ahead, the alliance between Trump’s incoming administration and the Gulf nations will be instrumental in countering the threats posed by those who seek to destabilize our region. With a renewed focus on economic and security cooperation, we can achieve a prosperous future that reflects the values we hold dear.In conclusion, Trump’s reelection is not just a victory for the US but a beacon of hope for the world. His leadership, grounded in practical experience and a results-oriented mindset, is poised to address both domestic and international challenges. As we move forward, let us seize this moment to build a future of stability, security and growth for all. • Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor is a prominent UAE businessman and chairman of the Al-Habtoor Group and Dubai National Insurance and Reinsurance Company.

The Sad Case Of Momin Khawaja In Canada – OpEd	In the late 1970s, I came to Canada for higher studies in chemical engineering. I had the rare opportunity there of being taught by some of the professors whose former student included my own teacher – professor Nooruddin Ahmed who would later become the vice chancellor at BUET, Dhaka. In my short stay, I found the Canadian people very warmhearted and friendly. Perhaps, it is that national character, which has earned Canada much respect in the international front for its commitment to peace and human rights. However, something has gone drastically wrong since 9/11 when the country joined Bush and Blair’s perennial ‘War on Terror’. Much of the Muslim world was transformed into a test lab to try the efficacy of the newer killing machines and armaments. Israel’s latest genocidal campaigns inside Gaza and Lebanon are just footnotes in that long crusade. Hatred of Islam and Muslims became the norms rather than the exceptions. Following Bush’s declaration of ‘you are either with us or against us’, global entente was forged amongst many Islamophobic nation states to cripple and destroy one Muslim nation state after another. Equally problematic has been the treatment of Muslims residing in non-Muslim countries – from India, Myanmar and Australia down south to Europe, Canada and the United States of America up north. Muslims were demonized and dehumanized. By default, they were considered a national threat: either suicide bombers in waiting or members of the ‘sleeper cells’. In that calculus, ignored there were the established international laws and regulations of human rights and even the local customary laws were violated. Canada, sadly, remains an example of that abuse of human rights. Many legal and human rights experts have criticized Canada’s justice system, particularly concerning the treatment of prisoners in solitary confinement. American journalist and lawyer Glenn Greenwald criticized the post-9/11 justice system, arguing that it unfairly targets Muslims with a separate set of rules designed to ensure harsh sentences. As I have noted in the past, the case of Momin Khawaja shows a blatant disregard for human rights, dignity and decency. The Case of Momin Khawaja - Background: Mohammad Momin Khawaja, a Canadian with no prior criminal record, was sentenced under anti-terrorism laws to 10.5 years in prison by a trial judge, which was later increased to life plus 24 years by the Supreme Court of Canada. - Academic Achievements: Khawaja is a sociology graduate, journalist, and author of academic books on various subjects, including women in the ancient world and North American colonization. - Incarceration: Despite being acquitted of involvement in a London case, Khawaja has spent over 21 years in prison, with his time in solitary confinement amounting to 1400 days, raising questions about the fairness of his treatment. Legal Challenges and the Canadian Justice System - Class Action Lawsuit: A class action lawsuit (Brazeau v Canada, Reddock v Canada, Gallone v Canada) highlighted the questionable policies regarding solitary confinement, with the government found guilty of violating inmates' rights in Ontario and Quebec. - International Law and Human Rights: The prolonged solitary confinement of Khawaja, particularly after an assault by another inmate, has been criticized for violating Canadian Bills of Rights and International Law. Comparisons and International Perspectives - Maher Arar Case: Similar to Khawaja, Maher Arar, a Syrian-Canadian engineer, was wrongfully arrested and tortured with the alleged complicity of Canadian authorities, leading to a formal apology from Prime Minister Stephen Harper after a commission of inquiry. The Fallacy of 'Momin Khawaja - a Mechanism of Radicalization' - Criticism of the Canadian Intelligence Project: The project, which was not part of the legal proceedings, has been accused of fabricating evidence and promoting a narrative of fear without factual support, contributing to a perceived bias against Muslims in the justice system. - Impact on Public Perception: The narrative surrounding Khawaja has been challenged for undermining the integrity of academics and for perpetuating fear and hatred based on religious identity. In summary, the case of Momin Khawaja and the broader issues of solitary confinement in Canada raise significant concerns about the application of justice and the treatment of prisoners, particularly those from Muslim communities. It challenges the nation to live up to its ideals and to ensure that its justice system is fair, equitable, and respectful of human rights. Recommendations - Human Cost: The irreparable damage caused by solitary confinement and torture cannot be compensated with monetary settlements alone. - Need for Systemic Change: I call upon Prime Minister Trudeau and the Minister of Justice and Security to take immediate action to release Momin Khawaja and other victims of 9/11 tragedy who have no bloods in their hands and to reform the justice system to uphold the principles of law and justice for all Canadians.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdDANInp0oTbcYXCeLP6-Fg	2024-11-10T16:25:10-08:00	
The Man In The Iron Musk: Billionaire Behind Trump Comeback – Ana...	When Donald Trump announced his 'great victory' as the results of the US presidential election started coming in, he specifically thanked one person who had played a key role in helping him return to presidency. In a speech at West Palm Beach, Florida, he praised Elon Musk, calling him his strongest supporter in the presidential race. He referred to Musk as 'a star', highlighting the impact of the billionaire behind Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly known as Twitter). Musk has been a major force in Trump's return—not only by investing millions into his campaign, but also by advising on policy and promoting his ideas. He has even used his X social media platform as a strong supporter of the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) movement. Elon Musk shared on X that the future would be 'amazing' as it became clear that Donald Trump would be back in the White House. This statement hints at Musk's optimistic view on the direction America may take with Trump's return, signalling his belief in positive changes ahead. The billionaire's influence could grow significantly with Trump in office again, as Trump once hinted that his supporter may take on a role like 'secretary of cost-cutting' in his Cabinet. This shows Trump's confidence in the billionaire's skills to help reduce government spending. Experts caution that Musk, whose company, SpaceX, already holds significant influence as a key defence contractor for the government, could potentially gain the power to 'oversee those who typically set the rules'. This suggests he may have an unusual level of control over the authorities who usually regulate businesses. Now that the election dust has settled, here is a simple lowdown on how the world's wealthiest person played a key role in creating one of the most unexpected political comebacks in history. How did Musk use his wealth and influence to help Trump regain his position and what motivated him to do so? Musk's Contribution to Trump's Campaign It is clear that billionaires had more influence than ever in both the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Microsoft's Bill Gates and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg supported Vice-President Kamala Harris. However, it was Musk's broad support for Trump that truly made an impact. Musk's influence and resources played a significant role in shaping Trump's comeback. According to the Federal Election Commission's ((FEC's) final disclosures last month before election day, Musk contributed around $132 million to Trump and other Republicans leading up to the 2024 election. The FEC is a government agency that oversees, and enforces, rules on campaign funding in US elections, ensuring donations and spending are transparent and legal. Two major donations—$43.6 million and $75 million—were channelled directly into Trump's campaign efforts, particularly benefiting the America Political Action Committee (PAC) founded by Musk. The America PAC is a fundraising group that supports political campaigns, such as Trump's, by collecting donations. PACs help gather, and spend, money to promote specific candidates and political causes. In a controversial move, Musk started a cash giveaway in important swing states. Registered voters who signed a petition in support of the First and Second Amendments—which protect free speech and the right to own firearms—were given a chance to win $1 million each day. Musk announced at a campaign event on October 19, 'Every day from now until the election, we'll randomly award $1 million to people who have signed the petition.' The action faced a legal challenge in Pennsylvania after the US Justice Department cautioned that the group may be violating election laws, which prohibit offering payments to encourage people to register to vote. On Monday, November 4, judges allowed Musk's cash giveaway to continue after his lawyers clarified how winners were chosen. Instead of being picked randomly, the winners were selected as 'vetted spokespeople', meaning they were carefully chosen based on specific criteria. This approach, possibly, ensured they would promote the campaign in a controlled and positive way, rather than just handing money to anyone who signed the petition. The court accepted this method, giving Musk the green light to keep the giveaway running. Musk is now facing a class-action lawsuit—a legal case filed by a group of people with similar complaints—from voters who say he misled them into signing the petition by making them believe they had a real chance of winning the $1 million. According to Al-Jazeera, the lawsuit was filed on Tuesday by Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty, who also claimed that Musk used the giveaway to gather personal data and boost traffic to X. This was possible because people who signed up for the giveaway possibly had to provide personal details, such as their contact information or social media profiles. By collecting this data, Musk's team could build a list of contacts and use it to reach more people on X, increasing the platform's traffic and visibility. This strategy could help promote X, while also gaining valuable information about the participants. FEC records revealed that Musk had donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee (PAC) focused on 'protecting and expanding the Republican Senate Majority'. This support could potentially help Republicans regain control of the Senate in this election. FEC filings are official records that track donations to political campaigns and committees, showing who is funding political activities and how much they are giving. Musk is said to have made additional donations to Republican candidates that have not been reported. Ways X Was Used to Promote MAGA Views It may seem unusual now, but Elon Musk was once seen as a liberal and a supporter of renewable energy. He even said he had voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Since taking over Twitter in 2022, which has since been renamed X, this image has changed. After promising to make Twitter a 'politically neutral' platform, Musk let go of the employees who were in charge of checking for false information. He also reinstated over 62,000 accounts that had been suspended, including those linked to white nationalists and neo-Nazis—groups that promote hatred and racism, often targeting people of colour, Jews and other minorities—known for spreading hate speech and conspiracy theories. Importantly, he also lifted the ban on Trump's account, which had been suspended by the platform following the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol—a situation many believe Trump influenced. As the election approached, critics argued that X had essentially turned into an unofficial platform promoting the MAGA side of the Republican Party. The owner himself faced accusations of openly supporting Trump and sharing misleading information with his 200 million followers, with X's algorithm boosting his influence even further. One example involved a fake video of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, edited with a false voiceover saying, 'I was selected because I am the ultimate diversity hire' (meaning choosing someone for a job partly to increase variety in backgrounds, such as race or gender). Musk shared this video in July, commenting 'this is amazing' with a laughing emoji. This re-post added 136 million more views to the video. False information about 'illegal immigrants' voting in the election spread across X. This claim was shared widely, although, in the US, only citizens can vote in federal elections. Non-citizens, regardless of their immigration status, are not allowed to participate in these elections. Studies from both conservative and liberal groups show this offence is very rare. While breaking this law can lead to serious consequences, such as up to a year in jail, fines, or even deportation, the research suggests that very few people actually commit this offence. A conspiracy theory spread on X, with Musk, himself, promoting it, claimed that Democrats were bringing in undocumented immigrants and planning to grant them amnesty to increase their voter base in future elections. After Trump's debate with Harris in September, where he falsely claimed that Haitian immigrants in an Ohio town were eating cats and dogs, Musk shared a meme featuring a cat holding a sign that said, 'Kamala hates me', followed by a laughing emoji. Although Musk claims to support free speech, he has blocked some news stories, including one by journalist Ken Klippenstein, as reported by Al-Jazeera. This article discussed the weaknesses of Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, reportedly based on leaked documents. Although the journalist's account was eventually restored, access to the article's links remained blocked. A survey by the Pew Research Center in March showed the platform's rising popularity with Republican supporters. About 53% felt it was 'good for democracy', nearly three times the 17% who had said the same in 2021. Musk's Reasons for Aligning with Trump The combined support from their fan bases strengthened the Trump-Musk alliance. Not too long ago, Trump and Musk did not use to get along. In 2022, Trump called Musk a 'bulls**t artist', accusing him of lying about supporting him in the 2016 election. Musk replied on Twitter that it was 'time for Trump to retire and ride off into the sunset'. Two years later, the tech mogul stood alongside Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wearing a black MAGA hat. Musk's shift towards more conservative views is often linked to the forced shutdown of his Tesla factories during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, he defied orders by reopening a plant in Fremont, California, saying he was prepared to face arrest. This move was seen as a stance against what he viewed as excessive government control and red tape. Musk's move towards conservative views is evident in his connections with leaders who also oppose regulations, such as Argentina's President, Javier Milei. Musk has also formed connections with conservative leaders around the world, including Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. This shows his growing alignment with Right-wing viewpoints on the global stage. Several American media outlets, including Vanity Fair and the Washington Post, have suggested that a significant reason behind this situation may be connected to one of Musk's children coming out as transgender in 2022. This child decided to distance from Musk and changed the last name to Wilson. In an interview with Jordan Peterson—a Canadian psychologist, professor and author known for his views on culture, politics and personal responsibility who gained attention for his opposition to certain gender identity policies in Canada, arguing they infringed on free speech—Musk shared that he felt 'tricked' into agreeing to his child's medical treatment. Following this, he announced a mission against what he called the 'woke mind virus', a term used to describe what some people see as strict or extreme ideas about social issues, which they feel spread like a 'virus' and may limit free speech or push certain beliefs too strongly. The medical treatment Musk mentioned, possibly, relates to gender-affirming care—support that helps a person's physical characteristics align with their gender identity—for his transgender child. This type of care can include counselling, hormone therapy, or other steps to support their gender identity. Musk's statement about feeling 'tricked' suggests he felt pressured or misled into agreeing to this care without fully understanding it or feeling comfortable with the decision. In 2021, Musk moved Tesla's headquarters from Palo Alto, California, located in Silicon Valley, to Austin, Texas. At the same time, he also relocated his own residence from California to Texas. In July, Musk announced plans to move his companies, SpaceX and X, from California to Texas. This move is linked to a recent California law that stops schools from requiring teachers to inform parents if a student changes their gender identity. Musk's decision highlights his disagreement with this policy, as he believes that parents should be kept informed of such changes. By relocating, Musk is signalling his stance on the importance of parental involvement in these sensitive matters. Helping Trump Connect with Young Men Some people believe that Musk and Donald Trump, who act bold and different from others, have connected with many American men who feel left out or misunderstood. Movements like #MeToo, which highlight harassment issues and talk about 'toxic masculinity', have left some men feeling judged or ignored. Musk and Trump's strong, rule-breaking personalities appeal to these men, who see them as leaders speaking to their concerns and frustrations. Last month, in The New York Times, John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard's Institute of Politics, described Trump's efforts to attract young male voters as a 'master class in connecting with men'. Trump's strategy to win over young male voters seems to be working. A recent Harvard Youth Poll showed that 35% of men aged 18-24 expressed support for Trump, an increase of 5% over a survey in 2020. This attitude is often reflected in popular 'bro' podcasts, such as the 'Joe Rogan Experience'. Joe Rogan is a popular podcast host, comedian and former TV personality known for his above-mentioned show. On his podcast, he talks with a wide range of guests, including celebrities, scientists and political figures, discussing topics from current events to science, health and culture. Known for his casual, conversational style, he is popular among young men. After interviewing Musk, Rogan gave his support to Trump on Monday (November 4). Rogan shared on X, praising Musk, saying, 'Elon Musk is truly incredible. Without him, we'd be in trouble. He presents what I believe is the strongest argument for supporting Trump, and I agree with him completely.' This message struck a chord with many people. Just two days later, Trump was elected as the 47th President of the United States.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTbmi2KhiYMmk	2024-11-09T17:57:24-08:00	
The Influence Of Political Psychology On Energy Diplomacy: Unpack...	In an increasingly interdependent world, energy resources have become essential bargaining chips in international relations. Countries engage in energy diplomacy to secure access to these vital resources, balancing national interests with global alliances. While economic factors traditionally dominate discussions on energy diplomacy, political psychology offers a unique lens to understand the motivations and strategies driving these complex negotiations. Political psychology examines how cognitive biases, perceptions of threat, social identity, and leadership psychology influence decisions. This perspective is essential for understanding how psychological factors shape the strategies and outcomes of energy diplomacy worldwide. Defining Political Psychology in the Context of Energy Diplomacy Political psychology combines insights from psychology and political science to understand how leaders and nations make decisions under uncertainty, stress, and competitive pressure. In energy diplomacy, psychological factors such as risk perception, threat assessment, and identity politics play a crucial role in shaping diplomatic behavior. Political psychology addresses questions like: How do leaders perceive energy security risks? How do cognitive biases impact the negotiation strategies of different nations? By exploring these questions, political psychology can provide deeper insight into the drivers of energy diplomacy. 1. Cognitive Biases and Decision-Making in Energy Diplomacy Cognitive biases are systematic errors in thinking that influence how individuals interpret and act on information. In energy diplomacy, common biases can significantly shape decision-making. a. Status Quo Bias Status quo bias can cause countries to favor familiar energy sources and partners, even when alternative strategies may offer long-term benefits. This reluctance to change existing energy arrangements often stems from the psychological comfort of maintaining predictable alliances. Example: European Union countries' historical reliance on Russian gas can be partially attributed to status quo bias. Despite growing concerns over energy security, these countries were initially hesitant to diversify energy sources due to the perceived risks of changing an established supply relationship. b. Anchoring Bias Anchoring bias can lead negotiators to focus on specific numbers or initial conditions in a negotiation, potentially overlooking other relevant factors. This bias can be particularly influential in energy pricing negotiations, where early price offers may set a psychological anchor, making it challenging to reach more flexible or advantageous agreements. Example: In negotiations on oil prices, initial figures proposed by a supplier may anchor the perceptions of buyers, making it difficult for them to negotiate significantly lower prices even if market conditions change. c. Availability Heuristic The availability heuristic leads individuals to base judgments on recent or easily recalled events rather than on comprehensive data. In energy diplomacy, leaders might overemphasize recent energy crises, leading to heightened perceptions of energy security risks. Example: Following disruptions in oil supply chains, policymakers may over-prioritize securing stable oil sources at the expense of exploring renewable options, influenced by the availability of recent disruptions. 2. Threat Perception and National Identity in Energy Diplomacy Threat perception plays a central role in how countries approach energy diplomacy, influencing both defensive and offensive strategies. The psychological dimensions of national identity and perceived threats often shape a country's approach to securing energy resources. a. Energy Security as a National Identity Component In many countries, energy self-sufficiency is closely tied to national identity and pride. Countries with limited energy resources may perceive their dependence on foreign energy as a threat to sovereignty. This perception can lead to aggressive efforts to secure diversified energy sources, often through high-stakes diplomacy or even militarization of energy corridors. Example: China's Belt and Road Initiative, which includes strategic investments in energy infrastructure across Asia and Africa, is partly driven by a perceived need to secure energy independence, which is viewed as essential to national identity and long-term security. b. Social Identity Theory in Regional Energy Alliances Social identity theory suggests that people derive a sense of self from group memberships, leading to in-group favoritism and out-group hostility. In energy diplomacy, this manifests in regional alliances where countries with shared identity markers (such as cultural or ideological commonalities) collaborate on energy projects to counter perceived threats from opposing blocs. Example: The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries often collaborate on oil and gas projects based on shared cultural, religious, and geopolitical identities. This alliance serves as a counterbalance to perceived threats from neighboring regions, particularly in maintaining influence in global energy markets. 3. The Role of Leadership Psychology in Energy Diplomacy Political psychology also focuses on how leaders' personal characteristics, cognitive styles, and stress tolerance influence energy diplomacy. Leaders bring their unique psychological profiles to the table, impacting decisions and shaping diplomatic relationships. a. Cognitive Complexity in Diplomatic Negotiations Cognitive complexity refers to an individual's ability to understand and integrate multiple perspectives. Leaders with high cognitive complexity are often better equipped to navigate the intricacies of energy diplomacy, finding compromises that benefit both parties. In contrast, leaders with low cognitive complexity may approach negotiations with rigid, black-and-white thinking. Example: The contrasting styles of U.S. presidents regarding Middle East energy policies show the impact of cognitive complexity. Presidents with higher cognitive complexity, such as Barack Obama, have tended to pursue nuanced, multilateral strategies, whereas those with more straightforward views have favored aggressive, unilateral approaches. b. Risk Tolerance and Crisis Response Energy diplomacy often involves high-stakes negotiations under significant pressure, where leaders' tolerance for risk plays a critical role. Leaders with high risk tolerance may be more willing to explore new energy partnerships or take bold steps toward energy independence, while those with low risk tolerance may prefer stability over innovation. Example: Leaders in countries with volatile energy supplies, such as Venezuela, often exhibit high-risk tolerance in seeking alternative energy alliances, reflecting a willingness to experiment with unconventional partnerships to secure national energy needs. 4. Public Opinion and Domestic Psychological Pressures Domestic public opinion and the collective psychological state of a nation significantly influence energy diplomacy. Politicians may adopt strategies that align with public attitudes toward energy security and national sovereignty, especially when energy diplomacy affects employment, the cost of living, or environmental sustainability. a. Nationalism and Energy Independence In many countries, energy independence is seen as a source of national pride. Politicians may respond to nationalist sentiments by pursuing energy policies that prioritize self-sufficiency, even at the expense of cost-effectiveness or environmental impact. Nationalism can push leaders toward aggressive energy policies that emphasize independence over international collaboration. Example: The 'America First' policy during Donald Trump's presidency saw increased investment in U.S. fossil fuel industries, with the goal of reducing dependency on foreign oil—a strategy driven by nationalist appeals to energy independence. b. Environmental Psychology and Public Support for Green Energy Diplomacy As climate change awareness grows, public support for renewable energy has increased. Environmental psychology shows that when people feel directly impacted by environmental degradation, they are more likely to support sustainable energy policies. This shift in public opinion influences political leaders to adopt energy diplomacy strategies that favor renewable energy partnerships. Example: In Europe, where public concern for climate change is high, governments are more inclined to form alliances for renewable energy projects, aligning diplomatic efforts with public demand for sustainability. 5. Psychological Impact of Historical Events on Energy Diplomacy Historical events, particularly energy crises, can have long-lasting psychological impacts on a nation's energy policy. Collective memory of energy shortages or price spikes can lead to heightened vigilance and preventive diplomacy aimed at mitigating future risks. a. The Legacy of the 1970s Oil Crisis The oil crisis of the 1970s left a psychological imprint on many countries, particularly in the West, leading to a collective desire for energy independence. This historical memory influences current energy diplomacy, motivating countries to avoid over-reliance on single suppliers. Example: Japan's energy policies are heavily influenced by the 1970s oil crisis, with efforts to secure diversified energy sources and pursue diplomatic ties with various energy-exporting nations to avoid dependency on any single country. b. Psychological Trauma of Energy Disruptions in Developing Nations In developing nations that have experienced energy shortages, psychological trauma from these events can drive policies aimed at securing stable and affordable energy sources. This may involve alliances with energy-rich countries, even if these relationships are politically complicated. Example: Bangladesh's efforts to secure steady natural gas supplies through diplomatic negotiations with neighboring countries are partially driven by the collective memory of frequent power outages that disrupted daily life and economic growth. Conclusion Political psychology offers invaluable insights into the underlying motivations and strategic decisions that drive energy diplomacy. By analyzing cognitive biases, national identity, leadership psychology, and public opinion, political psychology provides a nuanced understanding of how countries navigate the complex landscape of global energy relations. For policymakers, incorporating psychological insights into diplomatic strategy can lead to more effective, resilient, and adaptive approaches to securing energy resources. As nations continue to grapple with the challenges of energy security in a rapidly changing world, the psychological dimensions of diplomacy will play an increasingly central role in shaping the future of international energy relations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTf_rEVaPdTk9	2024-11-09T17:55:16-08:00	
Education Under Siege: Examining Taliban’s Restrictions On Female...	The return of the Taliban in August 2021 marked a critical turning point for Afghanistan, especially in the realm of women’s rights and education. Historically, women’s education in Afghanistan has been a contested domain, marked by ideological conflicts and restrictive measures, with significant progress achieved during the last two decades under international support (UNICEF, 2015). The Taliban’s rapid imposition of bans on secondary education for girls and university access for women not only signals a severe policy regression but also intensifies a cultural shift that reinforces gender-based segregation (Amnesty International, 2022). These restrictions, justified by the Taliban as aligned with Islamic values, have faced widespread criticism from scholars who argue that Islamic teachings support education for all genders, revealing inconsistencies in the Taliban’s rationale (Quraishi-Landes, 2021). The socio-cultural implications of these restrictions are profound, as education is globally recognized as vital for individual and societal development. The World Bank (2018) and UNESCO (2020) emphasize that access to education correlates with economic stability, lower poverty, and better health outcomes, all of which become increasingly inaccessible for Afghan society under the Taliban's restrictive policies. The Taliban’s limitations on female employment in the education and public sectors further exacerbate economic insecurity, disempowering educated women and limiting household economic contributions. This has resulted in broader social consequences, as educated Afghan women have historically contributed significantly to essential fields like healthcare and civil services (Human Rights Watch, 2021). At the community level, restricting female education is linked to increased rates of early marriage and domestic violence, as economic dependence and constrained options heighten vulnerability (UN Women, 2022). Psychologically, the loss of educational opportunities has been linked to increased anxiety, depression, and identity crises among young Afghan girls, undermining their sense of autonomy and purpose (Medica Mondiale, 2023). In denying women education, the Taliban constrains not only individual development but also community progress, as research indicates educated women enhance community well-being and civic engagement (World Bank, 2018). The theoretical framework of this analysis draws from feminist and human rights perspectives. Feminist theory reveals the Taliban’s restrictions as reflective of systemic patriarchy, imposing limitations on women’s public roles while confining them to traditional domestic spheres (hooks, 2000). In parallel, a human rights perspective frames education as a fundamental right, essential for autonomy and societal participation, and emphasizes that the Taliban’s policies infringe upon international human rights standards (CEDAW, 1979; OHCHR, 2021). This analysis integrates both quantitative data and qualitative accounts, using a mixed-methods approach. By combining primary sources, such as Afghan government and international organization reports, with secondary research, the study provides a comprehensive examination of both policy impacts and societal responses (Amnesty International, 2023). While the Taliban contends that these educational restrictions reflect cultural values, critics argue this defense misrepresents both Islamic and Afghan values, suggesting instead that these policies serve as mechanisms of control rather than religious adherence (Abu-Lughod, 2002; Aslan, 2005). The ramifications of these policies extend beyond the education sector, with adverse effects on Afghanistan’s socio-economic stability and gender equality. For these reasons, international advocacy is essential to restore educational access for Afghan girls, bolstering societal resilience against gender oppression and reversing regressive policies. In conclusion, the Taliban’s restrictions on female education represent an infringement on basic human rights and a hindrance to Afghanistan’s societal progress, underscoring the need for sustained global intervention and support for Afghan women’s right to education. Taliban’s Restrictions on Female Education The Taliban’s restrictive policies on female education in Afghanistan are profoundly impactful, with wide-ranging consequences on Afghan society. Their policies, enforced by the Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, prohibit girls from attending secondary school and restrict women's participation in higher education. These bans are unprecedented in scale, severely limiting the educational aspirations and career potential of Afghan girls and women. Historically, the Taliban's ideology has opposed Western-style education, and since 2021, they have systematically dismantled educational access for females, contrary to the significant strides made toward gender equality in Afghanistan over the previous two decades (Human Rights Watch, 2022). According to Amnesty International (2023), these bans have impacted over one million Afghan girls, denying them the fundamental right to education. As noted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 2023), these restrictions significantly set back Afghanistan’s educational and economic progress, with potential generational consequences for the well-being and socio-economic standing of Afghan families and communities. The Taliban’s Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice enforces these policies through various mechanisms, including surveillance, fear tactics, and public shaming. The Ministry’s role is crucial in ensuring compliance with Taliban decrees, as officials patrol schools and universities, often imposing fines or punitive measures on educators or families who attempt to bypass restrictions (UN Women, 2022). This institutionalized surveillance and control over female education have cultivated an environment of fear and uncertainty. Female students and educators report feeling constantly watched and intimidated, leading many to self-censor or withdraw from education out of concern for personal and family safety (Medica Mondiale, 2023). This intimidation strategy has been particularly effective, as families often choose to keep girls at home, prioritizing security over educational opportunities. In assessing the impacts of these policies, specific cases reveal both the persistence of Afghan girls and women and the oppressive reactions they face. For example, small, covert networks of teachers in Afghanistan have been reported to organize secret schooling initiatives for girls barred from formal education. Such efforts demonstrate resilience, yet they are met with repression. Reports document cases where teachers and students involved in clandestine education initiatives face threats, physical violence, or detention, underscoring the severe limitations on educational resistance (BBC, 2023). Moreover, testimonies from affected women highlight the deep psychological toll of these restrictions. One Afghan girl, Fatima, explained, 'I feel like my future has been stolen from me… I cannot dream of becoming a doctor or a teacher now because I am not allowed to study' (Amnesty International, 2023). Such narratives exemplify the intense psychological distress and sense of hopelessness experienced by many Afghan girls, who, deprived of education, see few paths to personal or economic independence. From a feminist theoretical perspective, the Taliban’s policies on female education can be viewed as a means of enforcing patriarchal control, aiming to maintain traditional gender hierarchies by confining women to domestic roles. This approach aligns with feminist critiques of institutionalized patriarchy, which argue that restricting women’s access to education perpetuates social structures that keep them economically and socially dependent on men (hooks, 2000). In parallel, a human rights framework further emphasizes that the right to education is protected under international conventions such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW, 1979). By denying education to girls and women, the Taliban’s policies constitute a clear violation of this fundamental right. The broader societal consequences of these policies are grave: without education, Afghan girls are more susceptible to forced marriages, health complications, and economic dependency, perpetuating cycles of poverty and social inequality (World Bank, 2018). So, the Taliban’s policies on female education not only infringe upon individual rights but also erode the social and economic fabric of Afghan society. By analyzing these restrictions through feminist and human rights lenses, it is clear that education for Afghan girls is not merely about schooling but about the broader societal empowerment and progress of Afghan communities. These policies, therefore, represent a profound setback, both in terms of Afghanistan’s development and in the global fight for gender equality. Given the dire implications, continued international advocacy and support for Afghan girls' right to education are essential to challenge and ultimately reverse these regressive policies. Socio-Cultural Implications of Restricted Female Education in Afghanistan The Taliban’s policies restricting female education have far-reaching socio-cultural consequences that extend beyond the classroom, impacting women’s empowerment, family dynamics, and community structures in Afghanistan. First, the long-term restriction of education significantly diminishes women's roles in society, perpetuating a cycle of dependence and limiting opportunities for individual and collective empowerment. Without access to education, women lack the skills needed for economic independence, perpetuating a reliance on male family members. According to UNESCO (2023), limiting female education directly impacts women's employment rates and constrains their participation in the workforce, exacerbating poverty and widening gender inequalities. This impact is particularly concerning when considered through feminist theoretical perspectives that highlight education as a fundamental pathway to self-empowerment and social mobility (hooks, 2000). Denying Afghan girls this pathway restricts not only their potential but also their capacity to contribute meaningfully to Afghanistan’s economic and social development. Broader societal consequences include profound shifts in family dynamics and the structure of community relationships. In Afghan society, women’s traditional roles are already constrained by conservative interpretations of gender roles, but the Taliban’s policies deepen this marginalization. Research has shown that educated women tend to make more informed choices regarding family planning and health, leading to healthier families and higher child survival rates (World Bank, 2018). Restricting education undermines this potential, leading to communities with limited access to health and wellness knowledge, which can perpetuate cycles of poor health and high dependency rates. In areas where female education was previously more accessible, families now struggle to adjust to restrictions that limit young women’s futures, which has led to increases in early and forced marriages as parents seek security for their daughters in the absence of education (Amnesty International, 2023). This shift reflects an alteration in cultural norms, reinforcing gender-specific expectations and lowering aspirations for young girls, who come to see these marriages as their only feasible path. The psychological impact on female students deprived of education is severe. Studies indicate that educational deprivation contributes to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and a diminished sense of self-worth, particularly in societies where education is a primary avenue for personal growth and social integration (Medica Mondiale, 2023). Many Afghan girls and young women express feelings of hopelessness and frustration, as described by UN Women (2022), which captures testimonies of Afghan girls who fear a future of 'enforced ignorance' and lost potential. Psychological theories on self-determination suggest that autonomy, competence, and relatedness are essential for psychological health, all of which are compromised when education is restricted (Ryan & Deci, 2000). In Afghanistan, where these educational restrictions are tied to policies of control rather than individual choice, the resultant impact on mental health is particularly profound. A generation of girls deprived of education may be at risk of internalizing low self-esteem and diminished agency, further entrenching the cultural narrative that women’s roles should be confined to the domestic sphere. This enforced ignorance has implications for future generations as well. Restricted access to education limits not only women’s immediate prospects but also their ability to educate their own children, passing down cycles of restricted knowledge and opportunity. According to UNICEF (2023), educated mothers are more likely to invest in their children's education, thereby raising future generations that value and pursue knowledge. By denying women the chance to learn, the Taliban’s policies disrupt these positive generational cycles, perpetuating poverty and dependency. Consequently, the broader societal effects of these restrictions hinder Afghanistan’s progress toward an equitable society and sustainable development, reinforcing patterns of economic underperformance and social stagnation. The Taliban’s restrictions on female education, therefore, carry implications that reverberate through individual lives, families, and society, ultimately setting Afghanistan on a path that undermines both its human capital and potential for inclusive growth. Thus, the socio-cultural implications of restricted female education in Afghanistan are deeply interconnected, affecting women's empowerment, family structures, and psychological well-being, as well as the future cultural and economic trajectory of Afghan society. The denial of education to Afghan girls not only infringes upon individual rights but also reinforces structural gender inequalities, with implications that threaten the well-being of entire communities and hinder the nation’s development. Addressing these educational restrictions is critical not only for the rights of Afghan girls but also for the broader goal of achieving sustainable, inclusive progress in Afghanistan. Resistance and Resilience amid Educational Restrictions in Afghanistan The resilience of Afghan women in the face of the Taliban’s educational restrictions underscores their commitment to self-determination and societal contribution, despite severe limitations on their autonomy. Afghan women have adopted various strategies of resistance, leveraging both visible and underground forms of activism to challenge these oppressive policies. Notably, protests organized by Afghan women and girls, though often met with violent repression, exemplify a defiant stance against the Taliban’s restrictions. For example, in Kabul, groups of women have gathered to demand access to education, often carrying banners with slogans like 'Education is our right,' despite facing significant personal risks (Human Rights Watch, 2023). These public protests highlight the ongoing agency of Afghan women, who continue to advocate for their rights, thereby underscoring the relevance of human agency within the broader feminist framework that sees such acts as essential to fostering social change (hooks, 2000). Another prominent strategy of resistance is the establishment of underground educational initiatives, where Afghan women educators clandestinely gather students in private homes or safe spaces to continue their studies. These informal networks provide educational resources, instruction, and support, maintaining an educational lifeline for Afghan girls. According to Medica Mondiale (2023), these underground classes, though small and limited, serve as a critical tool for resilience, preserving a semblance of intellectual engagement and community solidarity. In these settings, women are defying not only the Taliban’s mandates but also cultural constraints by fostering environments where girls can learn and interact, albeit discreetly. This form of resistance aligns with feminist theory's emphasis on collective resilience and adaptability as women utilize available resources to protect their rights within restrictive environments (UN Women, 2022). The international community has responded with varied strategies of support, ranging from direct advocacy to funding underground initiatives and providing psychological and educational resources. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights groups such as Amnesty International and the United Nations have issued strong statements condemning the Taliban’s restrictions, labeling them as violations of international human rights standards, particularly concerning the right to education for girls and women (Amnesty International, 2023). These organizations have also actively lobbied for international pressure on the Taliban, urging governments to tie foreign aid and diplomatic recognition to the restoration of women’s rights, including access to education. Such advocacy is rooted in global gender equality principles outlined in documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which highlights education as fundamental to personal and societal development (United Nations, 1948). In addition to advocacy, certain NGOs and international entities have provided material support for underground education efforts within Afghanistan. Organizations like UNICEF and UN Women have contributed educational materials, supplies, and financial support to groups operating discreetly in Taliban-controlled regions. These efforts emphasize the broader socio-political consensus that educational access is integral to human rights, bolstering feminist perspectives that prioritize equal educational opportunities as a foundation for gender parity and self-empowerment (hooks, 2000). However, despite these efforts, challenges remain, as international support is often constrained by political concerns, security risks, and limited access to Taliban-controlled regions, thus complicating the delivery and sustainability of these resources (Crisis Group, 2023). Nevertheless, criticism exists regarding the efficacy of the international response, with some arguing that diplomatic pressure has been inadequate and insufficiently coordinated. Opponents of current approaches argue that without stronger measures—such as economic sanctions or concerted multilateral action—the Taliban is unlikely to modify its policies. This counterpoint suggests that the international community’s responses lack the intensity needed to achieve meaningful change, reflecting a gap in political will rather than a lack of resources (International Crisis Group, 2023). Yet, advocates maintain that consistent international pressure and support, however limited, still offer crucial reinforcement to Afghan women’s resistance, providing psychological and moral support that signals global solidarity with their struggle. Hence, Afghan women’s resistance to educational restrictions, expressed through both public protests and underground schooling, reflects their resilience and unyielding demand for autonomy and equality. The international community’s support, while crucial, remains a complex and challenging endeavor, often falling short of the robust response many activists argue is necessary. Together, these acts of resilience underscore the determination of Afghan women to assert their right to education, despite facing one of the world’s most repressive regimes for women’s rights. Thus, the collective efforts of Afghan women, bolstered by international support, highlight the enduring power of human agency and solidarity in the struggle for gender equity. Future Prospects for Female Education in Afghanistan: Pathways for Change and Action The future of female education in Afghanistan rests on a complex interplay of international policy, grassroots resistance, and sustained advocacy. Despite the severe restrictions imposed by the Taliban, the potential for change remains viable through strategic international shifts and strengthened support for Afghan activists. Analyzing these dimensions in light of feminist theory and international human rights principles reveals the importance of multifaceted, globally coordinated efforts to address the systemic denial of education to Afghan girls and women. Potential for Change through International Policy Shifts and Grassroots Activism International policy shifts carry significant implications for the future of women’s rights and educational access in Afghanistan. The international community's stance towards the Taliban has so far been a mixture of condemnation and selective engagement, with countries balancing humanitarian assistance against political pressure (Crisis Group, 2023). Recent recommendations from organizations like the United Nations and Amnesty International have emphasized leveraging foreign aid as a bargaining tool, with several governments proposing that the restoration of educational rights should be a prerequisite for any diplomatic recognition or developmental aid (UN Women, 2023). Such approaches align with political consensus-based frameworks within feminist theory, where global cooperation is critical to enforcing gender equality norms, particularly when local systems systematically violate women’s rights (hooks, 2000). If implemented consistently, these policies have the potential to pressure the Taliban into reconsidering its stance on female education, especially if they are supported by comprehensive sanctions and clear accountability mechanisms for human rights abuses. Meanwhile, grassroots movements and community-based activism within Afghanistan serve as crucial avenues for sustaining women’s educational aspirations in the immediate term. Despite the Taliban’s attempts to stifle dissent, Afghan women have organized small-scale, localized movements, often in the form of underground educational programs that cater to girls who have been excluded from formal schooling (Human Rights Watch, 2023). These initiatives highlight the agency and resilience of Afghan women in reclaiming their rights, even under stringent societal constraints, and resonate with feminist perspectives on empowerment and human agency, where local activism provides a foundation for broader societal change (hooks, 2000). While these movements face enormous risks, their persistence has garnered international attention, demonstrating that grassroots activism can serve as both a form of resistance and a powerful symbol for global solidarity with Afghan women. Recommendations for Action: Supporting Female Education and Global Solidarity To secure lasting change, actionable strategies must be developed and sustained by both local and international actors. Key recommendations for supporting female education in Afghanistan include increasing financial and logistical support for underground education initiatives, improving mental health resources for affected women and girls, and enhancing secure channels for local activists to communicate with international supporters. Organizations such as Medica Mondiale (2023) have already begun funding programs aimed at providing educational materials and psychological support to Afghan women, ensuring that even informal educational spaces can deliver critical resources. Further, the development of secure communication platforms and community networks could enable Afghan activists to coordinate more effectively with international allies, allowing for real-time collaboration and access to information on global legal and human rights developments (UNICEF, 2022). Such efforts reinforce the necessity of collective support mechanisms within the feminist framework, emphasizing the role of institutional design in fostering inclusive education and gender parity even under adverse political conditions. Global solidarity and advocacy are equally essential for advancing Afghan women’s rights. Ongoing campaigns led by NGOs, international legal bodies, and academic institutions emphasize the need for unified international condemnation of Taliban policies, coupled with diplomatic efforts that explicitly prioritize female education (Amnesty International, 2023). These strategies include lobbying for special provisions within international human rights law that recognize gender apartheid as a prosecutable crime, as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, thereby establishing a legal precedent for intervening in countries where women are systematically oppressed (UN, 1948). By framing the issue within global gender equality norms, such advocacy amplifies Afghan women’s voices, ensuring that their plight remains prominent in international forums. As a result, the future of female education in Afghanistan depends on the successful convergence of international pressure, grassroots resilience, and sustained advocacy. A comprehensive approach that includes strict international policies, targeted support for local activists, and unwavering global solidarity offers the most promising pathway to restore and protect Afghan women’s educational rights. Although significant challenges persist, the combined strength of these efforts represents a robust foundation for eventual change. Such a multifaceted response underscores the enduring relevance of feminist theories that advocate for global cooperation, human agency, and collective resilience, demonstrating that even in the face of extreme repression, the fight for gender equality and education can continue. Conclusion The resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan since August 2021 has led to one of the most profound and alarming crises regarding women's rights and gender equality in recent history. This article has examined the multifaceted impacts of Taliban policies on female education and the broader implications for Afghan society. The systematic erosion of hard-won educational gains has not only restricted access to learning for girls and women but has also entrenched a culture of gender apartheid that perpetuates inequality and marginalization. The findings highlight that the Taliban's restrictions extend far beyond education; they encompass significant mental health implications for Afghan women, a deterioration of family dynamics, and a chilling effect on community structures. The psychological burden of enforced ignorance and oppression is profound, contributing to a cycle of despair that threatens the very fabric of Afghan society. Despite these overwhelming challenges, the resilience and agency of Afghan women shine through. Grassroots movements, underground educational initiatives, and acts of defiance reflect a commitment to reclaiming rights and freedoms. However, the international community's response has often been criticized as inadequate, with calls for more robust and coordinated advocacy to hold the Taliban accountable for human rights violations and to support Afghan women's rights activists. The urgency of addressing female education and empowerment in Afghanistan cannot be overstated. Restoring access to education and ensuring the fundamental rights of Afghan women is not only a moral imperative but also critical for the country’s socio-economic development and stability. As Afghanistan faces a precarious future, the role of global solidarity and action becomes essential in advocating for the rights of women and fostering an environment where gender equality can thrive. Therefore, the situation demands immediate and sustained international attention to dismantle the barriers imposed by the Taliban and to support the ongoing struggles of Afghan women. Without concerted efforts, the potential for progress remains bleak, and the aspirations of a generation of Afghan girls may be irrevocably thwarted. It is through this collective commitment to justice and equity that a more hopeful future for Afghanistan can be forged. References Abu-Lughod, L. (2002). Do Muslim Women Need Saving?

Defunding NPR – OpEd	Elon Musk has talked about eliminating at least two trillion dollars of United States government yearly spending. While it would contribute a small portion toward this grand goal, a spending cut that jumps out as among the most obvious for Musk and the incoming Donald Trump administration to pursue is eliminating all US government support for National Public Radio (NPR) and its affiliated programing and radio stations. The most convincing argument for US government funding of NPR has faded away over the decades since the media organization’s creation in the pre-internet and even quite limited cable television age. Nowadays, there is easy access to news and entertainment sources aplenty at the click of the mouse or remote control. There is no arguable need for Uncle Sam to provide a helping hand to a select media organization. Fundamentally, though, the US government supporting NPR has been wrong from the beginning. Providing news and entertainment to Americans is an activity many steps removed from the few powers the US Constitution sets forward as delegated to the US government. Further, it is inconsistent with the tenor of the First Amendment for the US government that is prohibited from making any law abridging the freedom of the press to be selectively providing funding for one media organization, thus giving it a leg up on the competition. Relevant for the Trump administration and Republicans in the US House of Representatives and Senate as well would be that NPR, since the 2016 presidential election, has placed a target on Trump’s back. Attacking Trump relentlessly has been pursued across NPR programs for the past eight years. How is it acceptable for the US government to be funding a media organization that has as part of its editorial policy the belittling and demonizing of this man who for most of this time period was either serving as president or running for president? Election interference anyone? Hopefully, some Democratic Congress members would join in condemning the unfairness of the situation even though their presidential candidates were the beneficiaries. On April 9, longtime NPR employee Uri Berliner went public with his insights on how 'an open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR' and how instead there is a 'distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population.' He also discussed how NPR engaged in 'efforts to damage or topple Trump’s presidency.' If, like most Americans, you listen little or not at all to NPR, Berliner’s article, which you can read here, is a good introduction to some of the intense bias you have missed out on hearing. To reach two trillion in savings, Musk and Trump would certainly find some spending cuts difficult. Eliminating US government support for NPR, in contrast, seems like something that should be an easy choice.

The Complex Legacy Of George Orwell – OpEd	By Allen Gindler George Orwell, one of the most influential political writers of the 20th century, is widely recognized for his searing critiques of totalitarian regimes in his novels Animal Farm and 1984. Orwell’s portrayal of state control, propaganda, and the manipulation of truth has resonated with readers across the political spectrum. However, Orwell’s personal political ideology and his critiques of totalitarianism are far more complex than is often acknowledged. Rather than being a passive observer or simply an opponent of dictatorship, Orwell was deeply involved in the socialist movements of his time, aligning himself—whether accidentally or intentionally—with Trotskyist circles. Orwell was a powerful voice of the left, despite being a target in the war among socialist factions. Orwell’s Political Ideology and Alignment with Trotskyism While Orwell is best remembered for his criticism of authoritarianism and totalitarianism, it is essential to understand that he was, first and foremost, a committed socialist. Despite never formally joining a political party, Orwell was an active and vocal participant in the socialist movement. This may surprise those who associate Orwell solely with his critiques of state tyranny. Indeed, Orwell’s disdain for the left dictatorship did not extend to all forms of socialism, and his political writings often reflect an internal critique of socialist regimes rather than a wholesale rejection of socialist principles. Orwell’s critique of Stalinist totalitarianism is best understood as part of a broader ideological struggle within the socialist movement itself. Specifically, Orwell’s critiques echo the views of Leon Trotsky, a key figure in early Soviet history and one of Stalin’s most prominent critics. Trotsky was a revolutionary Marxist who played a crucial role in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent civil war. He was instrumental in founding the Red Army, which secured the Bolshevik victory over the anti-communist White Army during the Russian Civil War. However, Trotsky’s theory of 'permanent revolution' set him at odds with Stalin, who favored the consolidation of socialism in one country—namely, the Soviet Union—before pursuing global revolution. Trotsky’s insistence that socialism must be spread worldwide made him a figure of suspicion within the Soviet hierarchy. In the early 1920s, Stalin consolidated power, leading to Trotsky’s exile in 1929. Despite this, Trotsky continued to oppose Stalin’s policies from abroad, particularly through his writings. Trotsky’s critique of Stalinism included accusations that Stalin had betrayed the original goals of the Russian Revolution. According to Trotsky, Stalin had established a bureaucratic dictatorship rather than a dictatorship of the proletariat, as envisioned by Marxist theory. He argued that Stalin’s regime represented, not the rule of the working class, but the rise of a privileged bureaucratic elite, a 'nomenklatura,' that dominated Soviet society. In addition, Trotsky accused Stalin of fostering a cult of personality, suppressing political opposition, and betraying the internationalist principles of socialism. Orwell and the Spanish Civil War In 1936, when the Spanish Civil War broke out, Orwell made the fateful decision to join the Republican side, fighting against Francisco Franco’s Nationalista forces. What makes Orwell’s involvement particularly significant is his choice of faction. Rather than aligning himself with the International Brigades, Orwell joined the Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a Marxist faction heavily influenced by Trotskyist ideas. Orwell’s decision to fight with the POUM speaks volumes about his political leanings during this period. The Spanish Civil War was not simply a battle between Republicans and Nationalistas; it was also an ideological battleground for various factions of the international left. The Republican side was a coalition of various socialist, communist, and anarchist groups. The POUM, with which Orwell fought, was aligned with Trotskyist and anti-Stalinist factions, while the Communist Party of Spain, supported by Stalin, took a hard line against any left-wing groups that did not adhere to Moscow’s policies. As Orwell would later write in Homage to Catalonia, his firsthand experience in Spain profoundly influenced his understanding of the brutal dynamics of power within the left. This dynamic reflects what biologists refer to as 'intraspecific struggle,' where members of the same species (or political movement, in this case) compete most aggressively with each other for dominance. While Orwell fought against Franco’s Nationalistas at the front, Stalin’s agents were conducting a purge of Trotskyist and anarchist factions behind the lines. The NKVD, Stalin’s secret police, were sent to Spain to suppress all non-Bolshevik leftist elements within the Republican forces. This included the POUM, which was eventually outlawed by the Stalinist-backed Republican leadership. NKVD agents kidnapped and killed the head of POUM, Andreu Nin. Orwell himself narrowly escaped assassination by the NKVD and covertly fled to England. These experiences deepened his disillusionment with Stalinism and reinforced his belief that the Soviet regime had betrayed the original ideals of socialism. Orwell’s Literary Response: Animal Farm and 1984 Orwell’s experiences in Spain and his understanding of the internal conflicts within socialism found their most potent expression in his literary works. Animal Farm, published in 1945, is widely understood as an allegory of the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism. Because of this, he struggled to find a publisher willing to take on the book, as many feared the political consequences of criticizing Stalin at the time of WWII. In the novella, Orwell portrays the betrayal of revolutionary ideals through the story of a group of farm animals who overthrow their human owner, only to see their new leaders—the pigs—become as oppressive as the humans they replaced. The pig Napoleon, who represents Stalin, manipulates the other animals, gradually consolidating power and rewriting the revolution’s history to justify his dictatorship. What is often overlooked in discussions of Animal Farm is the role of Trotsky’s ideas in shaping Orwell’s narrative. The character of Snowball—who is expelled from the farm by Napoleon—represents Trotsky. Snowball, like Trotsky, is portrayed as an idealistic, but ultimately powerless figure, who is demonized by the regime in power. Orwell’s depiction of Snowball’s exile and the subsequent demonization of his legacy mirrors Trotsky’s real-life expulsion and assassination by Stalin’s agents in 1940. In this sense, Animal Farm can be read as an artistic rendering of Trotsky’s The Revolution Betrayed (a critique of Stalinism from the left), with Orwell using the fable to illustrate the broader betrayal of socialist ideals by Stalin’s regime. Yet, Orwell could not grasp that if Trotsky had been the head of the Soviet Union, his regime might have been even more ruthless than the one Stalin built. Proletarian dictatorship is no better than party dictatorship. Orwell’s final novel, 1984, extends his critique of totalitarianism beyond Stalinism to address the broader implications of state control, surveillance, and the manipulation of truth. Although 1984 is not explicitly focused on socialist ideology, its portrayal of a dystopian world ruled by a single party—where dissent is brutally suppressed and history is constantly rewritten—draws heavily on Orwell’s understanding of the Stalinist regime. The famous phrase 'Big Brother is watching you' has since become synonymous with state surveillance and authoritarianism, but in the context of Orwell’s political trajectory, it also serves as a broader warning about the dangers of unchecked power, regardless of ideological orientation. Orwell’s Dilemma: The Limits of Socialist Critique Despite his damning critique of Stalinism, Orwell remained a socialist until the end of his life. His disillusionment with the Soviet Union did not extend to socialism as a whole. In fact, Orwell believed that socialism could still provide the solution to the social and economic problems facing the world, provided it did not fall into the traps of authoritarianism and bureaucracy. This presents a fundamental paradox in Orwell’s thought: while he was acutely aware of the dangers of totalitarianism produced by different currents of socialism, he continued to advocate for a general utopia that, in practice, often led to the very abuses of power he critiqued. Orwell could not comprehend that, regardless of the specific flavor of socialism —whether Trotskyist, Stalinist, or otherwise—given enough time, it would inevitably lead to the same outcome: economic stagnation, moral decadence, and repression. His deep belief in the potential of socialism, particularly in its democratic form, blinded him to the inherent authoritarian tendencies within socialist movements. Orwell’s Legacy George Orwell’s legacy as a writer and political thinker is marked by his commitment to socialist ideals and his fierce opposition to totalitarianism. His engagement with Trotskyist ideas, his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, and his literary responses to Stalinism reveal a nuanced understanding of the complexities within the socialist movement. While Orwell’s critiques of political tyranny remain profoundly relevant today, his continued belief in socialism—even after witnessing its failures—underscores the intricacies of his thought. Therefore, it feels somewhat awkward to rely on a socialist’s critique of the very regimes that socialism consistently produces.

Ukrainian And North Korean Forces Clash In Russian Region Of Kurs...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Ukraine’s First Encounter with North Korean Troops Marks a Pivotal Moment In the Russian region of Kursk, North Korean combat formations reportedly exchanged fire with Ukrainian servicemen for the first time since Pyongyang deployed its forces to Russia. The limited availability of open-source intelligence makes it difficult to assess this skirmish in detail. But press sources have noted that North Korea’s troops were equipped with assault rifles, 60mm mortars, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), sniper weaponry, night-vision equipment, and hand grenades. This reinforces previous assessments that special forces light infantry units are the backbone of the forward-deployed North Korean presence for now. According to Ukrainian defense intelligence sources, three North Korean generals and up to 500 officers have already made it to Russia to oversee the units deployed there. The US Defense Intelligence Agency has concluded that many of these brigades are from Pyongyang’s 11th Corps special forces unit. This corps is considered a strategic force and is trained to open a second front in a conventional conflict or attack an enemy’s rear area. The United States Department of Defense reported that Pyongyang has already fielded around 10,000 troops in Kursk for combat operations. South Korean intelligence services foresaw a total contingent of around 12,000arriving in the region. But force-generation patterns suggest that North Korea’s deployment there may eventually be even more substantial than this estimate. Two questions loom large at this juncture. First, will the North Korean troops’ mandate extend beyond Kursk to fighting in occupied Ukraine? Second, will Pyongyang reinforce its initial deployments with additional troops? Our forecast suggests the answer to both questions is yes, underscoring the potential for a significant escalation of the conflict. 2. Ukraine Conducts Strikes in Geopolitically Crucial Caspian Sea Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) reportedly struck two Gepard-class frigates in the Caspian Sea, showcasing the increasing reach and strength of Ukraine’s drone warfare capabilities. Equipped with Kalibr naval cruise missiles, these frigates play a vital role in the Russian Navy’s long-range strike deterrent. Russia’s Caspian flotilla has previously launched Kalibr missiles to hammer Ukrainian population centers. The Caspian Sea has also become important for strategic transactions between the Russian military and its Iranian partners. The extension of Ukraine’s long-range drone threat to the Caspian marks a meaningful shift in the war—particularly should Kyiv repeat this success and continue to pressure Russian naval warfare capabilities in the basin. 3. Shahed Drone Strikes on Ukraine Have Increased Tenfold from 2023 to 2024 Last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sounded the alarm about the worrying rise in Shahed drone salvos, stating that Russian forces have employed the loitering munitions 10 times as often as they did in 2023. According to the Ukrainian high command, the most recent three-month data-collection period featured 4,300 Shahed launches. October was particularly grim, as it saw over 2,000 of the drones rain down on Ukrainian population centers. Russia used 790 Shahed drones in August of this year, and 1,300 in September. This boost in attacks carries implications well beyond Ukraine. Iranian drones are being produced at astronomical levels. When Iran and Russia initially launched their joint drone production plant in the Russian region of Tatarstan in 2023, initial estimates pegged its annual production rate at around 2,500 drones. By exploiting the indigenous Tatar population—and even using child labor—the Kremlin believes it can produce 6,000 Shaheds annually by 2025. Worryingly, current drone warfare trends in Ukraine suggest that Russia and Iran may have already met this production goal. Previous editions of this report have observed that the Islamic Republic and the Kremlin are now capable of producing massive amounts of low-cost loitering munitions on the doorstep of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The two allies can now sustain a high operational tempo of more than 2,000 drones per month. Even if Ukraine intercepts 90 percent of these munitions, it would be allowing 200 hits a month on civilian and military targets. With evolutions including thermobaric and high-explosive-incendiary warhead configurations, Shahed drones have become more destructive than ever. 4. Battlefield Assessment Russian forces have managed to gain territory on multiple fronts. Facing problematic manpower disadvantages, Ukraine has issued a social media summons to personnel who have deserted or are considered absent without leave (AWOL). Ukraine is also bracing for another mobilization. Last week Russia captured the Ukrainian village of Kurakhiva, further boosting its push into Kurakhove. Kurakhove, situated between the Vovcha River and the N-15 Highway, lies south of the strategically important city of Pokrovsk. Another critical flashpoint on the eastern front is Illinka, where the Ukrainian 79th Air Assault Brigade has been trying to hold the line against Russia’s formidable 20th Motor Rifle Division. Available writings suggest that Russian formations have a favorable five-to-one force-on-force ratio here. The Russian offensive has also advanced on other fronts. In Siversk, heightened combat activity and growing material losses have characterized the fighting. In southern Ukraine, Russia has intensified its tactical efforts without tangible success. Finally, in the Russian region of Kursk, the powerful Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade’s Abrams main battle tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles have been engaging Russian heavy armor. North Korean troops face considerable odds as they enter the fray.

The Role Of Data Science In Shaping Bangladesh’s Energy Diplomacy...	As the world transitions to a low-carbon future, energy diplomacy has become a key pillar of international relations, especially for nations like Bangladesh, where energy security and sustainable development are national priorities. Bangladesh, a nation with limited indigenous energy resources, has been strategically engaging with other countries to secure energy resources, including oil, gas, and renewable energy investments. Data science, with its vast potential to gather, analyze, and interpret large volumes of information, can offer Bangladesh powerful insights into global energy markets, demand forecasts, and international relations, enabling more effective and nuanced energy diplomacy. Bangladesh's Energy Diplomacy Landscape Energy diplomacy for Bangladesh primarily involves balancing national energy demands with sustainable and reliable access to energy sources. This requires partnerships, investment strategies, and policy alignments with countries in the region, including the USA, Russia, Qatar, Indonesia, India, China, and so on. Through collaborations, Bangladesh seeks not only to meet its energy requirements but also to position itself as a regional player in the energy market, particularly in the context of renewable energy and climate change initiatives. How Data Science Contributes to Energy Diplomacy Data science can enhance Bangladesh's energy diplomacy by supporting decision-making processes, enabling predictive modeling, and facilitating data-driven engagements with energy stakeholders. Here are some specific areas where data science can make a significant impact. 1. Energy Demand Forecasting and Management Data science can help Bangladesh model its future energy demand, considering variables like population growth, industrialization, urbanization, and technological advancement. By utilizing predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms, data scientists can create robust models to estimate the country's future energy needs. This insight is crucial for diplomatic negotiations as it allows Bangladesh to approach potential energy suppliers with well-defined demand estimates, improving the bargaining position and making the case for stable, long-term energy agreements. Example: Through machine learning, data scientists can analyze historical consumption patterns, economic trends, and policy impacts to predict future energy needs, informing negotiations with suppliers on a reliable basis. 2. Resource Optimization and Renewable Energy Integration Bangladesh aims to diversify its energy sources, and renewable energy is a cornerstone of this strategy. Data science can optimize the deployment of renewable resources by determining the ideal mix of solar, wind, and hydropower based on geographic and meteorological data. Additionally, data-driven resource optimization can support Bangladesh in its diplomatic engagements with countries that have advanced renewable technology. Example: Using geospatial analysis, Bangladesh can identify the most suitable locations for solar and wind farms, supporting its push for investments from foreign nations that specialize in renewable technology. 3. Understanding Global Energy Market Trends Data science can process and analyze vast amounts of market data, providing insights into global trends, price fluctuations, and geopolitical events that impact the energy sector. For Bangladesh, understanding these dynamics is essential for forming effective energy alliances and negotiating favorable terms in international energy agreements. By analyzing real-time and historical data, Bangladeshi diplomats can stay ahead of market trends and tailor their strategies accordingly. Example: Data-driven insights into oil price volatility and supply chain shifts help Bangladesh make informed choices about when to buy or negotiate long-term contracts, potentially reducing energy costs. 4. Risk Assessment in Energy Investments Foreign investments in Bangladesh's energy sector often come with risks, including political instability, market volatility, and policy changes. Data science tools, particularly those focused on risk analysis and financial modeling, can help identify and mitigate these risks. By understanding these risks, Bangladesh can present a clear, data-backed assessment to potential investors, ensuring more secure and stable energy investments. Example: Predictive models assessing political and economic risks can give international investors a clear picture of the energy landscape in Bangladesh, thereby enhancing the country's credibility as a reliable energy partner. 5. Mapping Diplomatic Networks and Trade Relationships Data science, through network analysis and social graphing, can map Bangladesh's current diplomatic and trade relationships in the energy sector, identifying key partners and potential allies. This analysis helps in understanding where Bangladesh's energy diplomacy can expand or deepen and also provides insights into competitive and cooperative dynamics with neighboring countries. Example: Social network analysis tools can visualize Bangladesh's existing energy ties with regional players, showing where diplomatic efforts may yield more collaborative or competitive outcomes. 6. Environmental Impact Assessment and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Data science can help Bangladesh in monitoring and reducing the environmental impacts of energy projects, aligning with its commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Environmental data analysis provides insights that support responsible energy extraction, carbon reduction, and compliance with international environmental standards—key considerations in forming alliances with countries committed to sustainability. Example: Data-driven environmental monitoring tools can track emissions and environmental degradation from energy projects, helping Bangladesh showcase its commitment to green energy diplomacy on the international stage. 7. Strategic Use of Artificial Intelligence in Energy Negotiations Artificial intelligence (AI) can simulate various negotiation scenarios, helping Bangladeshi diplomats refine strategies for energy talks. AI-driven decision support systems can analyze historical negotiation data, identify patterns, and suggest effective approaches for future engagements. Example: AI models can recommend the most favorable negotiation strategies by analyzing previous energy agreements, benefiting Bangladesh's negotiation efforts with other energy-producing nations. 8. Monitoring Geopolitical Factors Impacting Energy Diplomacy Geopolitical stability is crucial to secure energy resources, and data science enables Bangladesh to monitor factors that could affect energy security, such as conflicts, sanctions, and diplomatic tensions. Using text mining and natural language processing (NLP), data scientists can analyze news reports, social media, and government publications to anticipate potential disruptions in energy supplies. Example: A real-time analysis of diplomatic stances or conflicts in oil-producing regions can help Bangladesh adapt its import strategies quickly, ensuring stable energy supplies. 9. Enhancing Energy Supply Chain Management Data science applications in supply chain management can help Bangladesh streamline its import and export processes, reducing costs and improving energy security. By analyzing logistics data, weather patterns, and international shipping trends, data science can help optimize Bangladesh's energy supply chain, minimizing risks of disruptions. Example: Predictive analytics in supply chain management can forecast potential disruptions, allowing for proactive solutions and ensuring that energy imports reach Bangladesh on time and at optimal costs. 10. Promoting Transparency and Accountability in Energy Deals Transparency is key to building trust in international partnerships, and data science tools, including blockchain technology, can ensure greater transparency in energy transactions. By enabling secure and traceable transactions, data science can reassure international investors about the integrity of Bangladesh's energy deals. Example: Blockchain-based systems for tracking transactions and contracts in the energy sector can provide clear and tamper-proof records, increasing trust among Bangladesh's foreign energy partners. Conclusion The application of data science to energy diplomacy offers Bangladesh transformative opportunities to strengthen its position on the global energy stage. By leveraging predictive models, optimizing resource management, and fostering transparent transactions, Bangladesh can engage in more effective energy diplomacy, achieving long-term energy security and sustainable growth. Through a strategic alignment of data science and energy diplomacy, Bangladesh can ensure that its national interests align with global energy trends, securing a resilient and prosperous energy future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTbdgM6TlnK19	2024-11-09T17:44:26-08:00	
Trump Act II Spells The End Of The American Empire – OpEd	By Susan Thornton Many around the world may joke that they should be allowed to vote in American elections because the results have as big an effect on them as they do on those who live in the United States. The actions of a unipolar superpower reverberate around the world and other countries are forced to respond. But American voters almost never vote based on events happening in the world, on foreign policy issues or even on things that might affect future generations at home. Voting is an emotional, last-minute impulse. During times when there was consensus around the United States’ global roles and responsibilities, the vagaries of elections did not much alter the US approach to the world. But times have changed. The election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term affirms a fundamental shift in America’s relationship with the world. In contrast to other empires, which tended to fall apart slowly over an extended period, Americans themselves have decided they no longer want to bear the burdens and distractions of global hegemony. Americans are no longer confident in the promise and effectiveness of their institutional system, they reject the obligation of answering the world’s fire alarms, they are weary of bearing the cost of global security and they see clearly that other states are free-riding on US largesse. The US electorate has been consistently ahead of its politicians in its rejection of the role of ‘world policeman’. The Biden administration’s claim that costs borne by the United States in these endeavours is more than returned by having global friends and keeping the wars ‘over there’ was not sufficient to overcome nagging doubts and grievances. Political gamesmanship over support for Ukraine and other conflicts contributed to the impression that American commitments were optional or, more problematically, ‘scams’ perpetrated by out-of-touch elites. Those living in other countries, and many living in the United States, might see these issues differently, but they do not vote or they do not vote enough. Trump, and certainly his national security team, does not appreciate that he was put in power to dismantle US global hegemony. But Trump’s bullying transactionalism, his aversion to commitment, his penchant for tariffs and complete indifference to the potential impact that the United States has on other countries can have no other outcome. It is obvious that permanent damage will be done to the United Nations, international economic institutions, multilateral organisations in which the United States is a member and any international effort to combat transnational challenges. The dissolution began during his first term and will be irreversible after the coming four years. The Americans who elected Trump as their standard bearer will cheer their demise. But, more worryingly, Trump’s national security appointees will not accept the message the Trump electorate has sent them. They will cling to American primacy through ever-escalating military deployments under the rubric of ‘deterrence’. Asian partners should steer clear of whiplash from the collision between Trump’s transactionalism and his national security team’s fever dreams. This means allies, especially those in the Pacific, can likely continue to count on US security backing, as long as they can demonstrate that they are not free riding. This has implications for Japan’s financing of its defence budget increase, for Taiwan’s defence reforms and for other partners stepping up their contributions to their own defence (including purchases of US weapons systems through deals like AUKUS). Despite Trump’s claim that he ‘doesn’t start wars, he stops them’, his re-ascension likely portends more turmoil in the world. It is true that Trump’s political invulnerability may allow him to make big moves in foreign policy — cultivating personal diplomacy with North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin or expanding Israel’s diplomatic space. But Trump relishes provoking others. His confidence in being able to avert wars by sowing fear is misplaced and likely to backfire. Biden’s modest stabilisation of US–China ties is unlikely to hold and Taiwan is a particularly hot potato in Trump’s hands. The economic implications of the Trump term will of course be significant, especially for Asia — the most globalised part of the international trading system. The playbook here is familiar, and it revolves around tariffs and bilateral negotiations to increase US exports. It is not clear how much room this strategy has to run in Trump II, but a Trump administration may be more welcoming of foreign investment into the United States, which could alleviate pressure on trade for some countries or sectors. There will be a further sharp disconnect of the US and Chinese economies. Trump and the Republican Congress are likely to invoke more tariffs, export controls and sanctions leading to global fragmentation, rising costs and slower growth. Businesses will face an ever more complicated picture and are already strategising how to adjust. Many countries in Asia are devising economic hedging strategies and will try to walk a middle line amid deteriorating US–China relations. Whether and how a Trump administration might impose costs for such an approach remains an open question. We have already entered the transition to a post-Pax Americana world — Trump is an accelerant. This does not mean that the United States will disappear. It will remain the most powerful and wealthy country in the world. But it does leave a vacuum in the international arena and US partners will hopefully step in to provide leadership and public goods. In this more fragmented, disordered world, US partners in Asia should also pursue more networked security cooperation and regional integration to safeguard peace and mitigate the negative effects of deglobalisation for their economies. Such measures are useful on their own merits, no matter who is in the White House, as the world is set to become a more difficult and dangerous place.

Armenia: Government Efforts To Enhance Surveillance Infrastructur...	By Ani Avetisyan (Eurasianet) -- The Armenian government is proceeding cautiously on a security bill that would build up surveillance infrastructure in the capital Yerevan, allowing more time for public discussion of the pros and cons of giving authorities expanded powers to potentially track individuals’ movements. Introduced in the spring, and already approved by parliament in a preliminary reading, the Interior Ministry-drafted bill would grant law enforcement agencies 24/7 access to live feeds and recordings from video cameras installed across the city, providing expansive coverage of all public space in the center of Yerevan. Private businesses, educational institutions, and other entities would be required to install cameras covering all building entrances and surrounding areas, with footage retained for 15 days. Armenia’s deputy interior minister also hinted at plans to use artificial intelligence to analyze footage, something that many privacy experts fear could facilitate the use of biometric and facial recognition technologies in video surveillance. The potential use of widespread surveillance has political ramifications, as opponents of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan have mounted protests against his government in recent months. The bill’s provisions, if enacted, could potentially be used to identify opposition supporters for politically motivated retribution. Officials cast the bill as an anti-crime measure designed to strengthen 'public security.' But it has sparked spirited public debate over privacy concerns and potential rights abuses. Human Rights Watch has urged officials to reconsider their approach, and, at the very least, create guardrails that 'mitigate any human rights risks,' as well as create comprehensive 'plans for oversight and accountability.' 'Widespread, indiscriminate video surveillance would inevitably lead to unjustified intrusions on privacy,' a HRW statement quoted Giorgi Gogia, the organization’s associate director for Europe and Central Asia, as saying. 'Mass surveillance in public spaces would have a chilling effect on fundamental civil and political rights.' Armenian law enforcement authorities have faced increasing public pressure to reduce crime rates, particularly amid a spike in drug trafficking. Proponents of the bill argue that enhanced surveillance could serve as a deterrent and facilitate the more efficient solving of crimes. But the country’s Data Protection Agency has echoed HRW’s concerns, issuing a statement that, in its current form, the bill would cause 'disproportionate interference' with citizens’ privacy rights by enabling 'unlimited and continuous processing of personal data' by authorities. Information Security expert Artur Papyan warned that a rapid expansion in the numbers of CCTV cameras could potentially increase the risks of them being hacked and used for malicious surveillance purposes by third parties. He cited the example of Russian hackers breaking into the database of security cameras in Kyiv prior to an attack earlier this year. The government, which is striving to steer the country away from Russia and enhance tieswith the West, is taking heed of the criticism. Final parliamentary consideration of the bill, originally scheduled for September, has been postponed. Parliament is now expected to consider adoption before the end of the year. The Armenian government’s cautious approach on the surveillance bill contrasts with the behavior of the Georgian Dream leadership in neighboring Georgia, where the ruling party rammed restrictive legislation, known as the 'foreign agents' law, through parliament without public input or legislative debate, sparking mass protests. Unlike Armenia which is aligning itself closer to the West, Georgian Dream has moved in recent years away from the European Union and United States and closer to Russia. Armenian leaders have voiced interest in seeking EU membership. The country’s legal obligations as a signatory to various international treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the European Convention on Human Rights, require it to uphold strict privacy protection standards, yet some of the country’s existing laws, as well as pending bills, fall short of meeting EU benchmarks. For example, Armenia’s Electoral Commission has made public the database of all eligible voters in Armenia, including personal information about individuals and the people registered with them at the same address. In 2020, the current government sought to pass a law that would make it easier for the police to access residents’ bank details without a court order, as required by current legislation. The bill, which the government tried to present as a means of combating money laundering, was declared unconstitutional by the country’s Constitutional Court.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTV4dzcu4cO3A	2024-11-09T17:37:47-08:00	
35 Years After Fall Of Berlin Wall, Germany Is In A Funk That Mig...	By Andrew Hammond Ordinarily, Saturday’s 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall might have been expected to be a cause for much joy in Germany. However, celebrations of the milestone will for many people be subdued given the nation’s deep economic and political funk. This was most recently illustrated by the collapse on Wednesday of the three-way governing coalition that included the left-of-center Social Democratic Party (the SPD), the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party. Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leader of the FDP, declaring that there was no longer any 'basis of trust' between them. Scholz, who is leader of the SPD, said he would seek a vote of confidence by Jan. 15 so that MPs 'can decide whether to clear the way for early elections.' These could take place as soon as March, six months earlier than scheduled. Beneath this governmental instability there lies a deeper issue: the breakdown of the traditional duopoly of power between the SPD and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. These parties have been the twin pillars of German politics since the end of the Second World War. But with the SPD now very unpopular and the direction of the CDU/CSU still uncertain since the end of Angela Merkel’s long chancellorship between 2005 and 2021, Germany appears to be moving from de facto two-party politics to a multiparty system. This is illustrated by the growing number of smaller parties that previously functioned as subsidiaries of either the SPD or the CDU/CSU. One of the drivers of this unraveling of traditional German politics and the fracturing of the political landscape has been the fact that the nation’s post-war consensus is eroding on multiple issues, including history, geopolitics, the economy and ethics. These political fractures might mean politics is becoming more generally unstable and less predictable, with significant challenges each election cycle in establishing a governing coalition. So there might be more rotation of ruling coalitions, with all the problems this can bring including, potentially, the prospect of the role of the chancellorship becoming weaker in patchwork governments. For much of the 35 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, many Germans have been mostly content with their post-Cold War lot, seeing themselves in general as beneficiaries of globalization. This might be changing, as evidenced by the rise of smaller parties. The far right Alternative for Deutschland is currently running second in the polls, for instance. It was the first far-right group to gain seats in the Bundestag, the German federal parliament, for six decades. Moreover, in September the party won its first state election, in Thuringia. The AfD campaigns extensively on immigration, an issue that has grown significantly in salience in Germany in recent years. This is in part because of the integration of more than 1 million Ukrainian refugees since the Russian invasion in 2022, and the arrival of about 1 million migrants, largely from the Middle East, in 2015 and 2016. This political malaise is mirrored on the economic front. The fall of the Berlin Wall hastened the end of Soviet Communism and led to the reunification of Germany, but the nation has more recently been given the moniker of the 'sick man of Europe.' Certainly, Germany has long had the largest economy in the region and is the most powerful nation in the EU, yet it is flatlining. The country has been in a state of ferment now for many years, exacerbated by the pandemic and the energy shocks that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Economically, the latest data shows that Germany very narrowly avoided a recession in the third quarter of this year but is still struggling after shrinking last year, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting zero growth in 2024. The challenges the country faces are exemplified by Volkswagen, which has experienced a sharp fall in profits and might decide to close several factories for the first time in its almost 90-year history. Operating profits for the nine months to the end of September fell by more than a fifth compared with the same period a year ago to just under 13 billion euro ($14 billion), the causes of which included weaker demand from China. The company’s problems reflect a wider malaise in the automotive industry, which is Germany’s single largest business sector. With economic confidence weak, there has also been the biggest reduction in employment for about half a decade, according to an S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank index. In addition, the Federation of German Industries has warned that a fifth of the country’s industrial output might be at risk between now and 2030. This is not only because of weaker export markets for German goods (exports account for nearly half of the nation’s gross domestic product, a higher proportion than many other major economies) but also high energy costs. One worrying sign of the declining economic confidence might be German birth rates, which have gone into decline after rising before the pandemic. Between 2011 and 2016, the birth rate rose from 1.38 to 1.59 children per woman. However, it had fallen to only 1.35 in 2023. To rub salt into the wounds, the nation’s troubled public finances could soon become much worse as a result of a Federal Constitutional Court decision that might reduce tax income by up to 75 billion euro. The court case concerns the legality of a so-called 'solidarity surcharge' that was introduced to tackle the burden of German reunification. Reportedly at risk is about &euro;66 billion collected since 2020, and approximately &euro;9 billion in interest. If the court rules against the government on this, it will blow a huge hole in public finances. All of this explains why the nation might now be at a historic crossroads. The danger is that it might result in a significantly weaker Germany, and wider EU, at a time of growing global geopolitical flux and economic uncertainty. • Andrew Hammond is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTQl-xxpaIgOH	2024-11-09T17:36:06-08:00	
Trump Is Expected To Secure US Rights Through Tough But Fair Tran...	US President-elect Donald Trump is feared by some and extolled by others. On the one hand, those who fear him say he will make the US aggressive, impulsive and selfish, driven by the battle cry 'America First' and 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA). On the other hand, those who laud him say he will make the US concentrate on pressing domestic issues and not waste resources on saving other countries from authoritarian hegemons in a pretentious colonial-era 'civilizing mission'. While there is a grain of truth in both assessments, overall, Trump has shown through his performance in his previous stint in the White House between 2017 and 2021, that he could be both tough and benign, waging war to assert America's rights on the one hand, and bringing peace if that was the way forward, on the other. Trump is a pragmatic politician, but not an unprincipled one. He has no 'Trump Doctrine' to expound, as he has no fixed notions. He goes mostly by his instinct and assessment of the ground reality. His decisions are 'his' in the true sense of the word. According to Robert C. O'Brien, US National Security Adviser from 2019 to 2021, Trump may replicate President Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) who used US power with panache, but judiciously, to achieve a number of diplomatic triumphs. Like Trump, Jackson believed in give and take. He showed the fist when necessary, and struck a compromise when called for, as he did in the case of disputes with France, Denmark, Portugal, and Spain. Jackson signed trade agreements with Russia, Spain, Turkey, Britain, and Siam. The treaty with Britain reopened American trade with the British West Indies. Overall, US trade boomed in Jackson's time- exports increased by more than 75% and imports by 250%. By the time Jackson retired from the White House in 1837, he had significantly altered the office of the President, expanding its veto power, basing its authority on the will of the people. He dramatically enhanced the chief executive's political and legislative powers, O'Brien recalled. But Jackson was not foolhardy. He would leave some issues to the Congress even if he had strong views on them as he did in the case of the integration of Texas State into the USA. Likewise, Trump would be an aggressive President but would leave some sensitive issues to the legislature. Presently, he has now left the decision on the critical issue of abortion to the States. Indeed, Trump was an aggressive 'Make America Great' proponent. But he was also a peacemaker when he was in office from 2017 to 2021. Listing his achievements, O'Brien says that he facilitated the Abraham Accords, bringing peace to Israel and three of its neighbours and Sudan. He brought about economic normalization between Serbia and Kosovo; pushed Egypt and the Gulf states to settle their rift with Qatar and end their blockade of Qatar. More importantly, the US entered into an agreement with the Taliban to being about an American withdrawal. This prevented any American combat deaths there for nearly the entire final year of the Trump administration. Trump ended one war- against the ISIS as an organized military force. He eliminated its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Trump was determined to avoid new wars and endless counterinsurgency operations. According to O'Brien the Trump Presidency was the first since that of Jimmy Carter in which the US did not enter a new war or expand an existing one. O'Brien notes that when Trump was in office, Russia did not press further forward after its 2014 invasion of Ukraine and Iran did not attack Israel, and North Korea stopped testing nuclear weapons after a combination of diplomatic outreach and a U.S. military show of force. But Trump ordered a limited but effective air attack on Syria in 2017, after Bashar al-Assad's regime used chemical weapons against its own people. Trump's critics say that his 'America first' is 'America alone'. But this is debunked by O'Brien. Yes, Trump is critical of NATO and thinks expenditure on it is unwarranted but this is because the European members are not contributing enough for its upkeep. He says that Ukraine's Zelensky is a 'salesman' because every time he came to the US he successfully made a case for billions of dollars. Trump would insist the Taiwan which spends only 3% of its GDP on defence should spend more and not burden the US so much. Trump is all for free international trade but not when some countries raise tariffs and erect other protective barriers, and expect the US not to respond. There is a message here for China and also India. Trump is strongly against making a song and dance about climate change but his views deserve a careful examination and not outright rejection. Perhaps climate change programs could be reassessed taking all views into consideration. For example, the developing countries feel that the developed countries are the major polluters and should do more and also contribute more to the climate change mitigation kitty. Trump was shown to be a man of the White ruling class or the White majority, but the recent election result has shown that his support base spans various ethnicities. Even the Latinos (Mexicans and South Americans) he is trying to bar from entering the US illegally, supported him because everybody wanted America to be free from illegal migration as it was affecting the prospects of locals in the shrinking job markets. Talking of employment, by raising tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump hopes to encourage local American industries that will give Americans job and not Chinese thousands of miles away. All in all, Trump's supporters at home and others abroad can expect the US under Trump to veer from the existing policies of Left–Liberal America to be a more traditional inward-looking America with a calibrated approach to the world to maintain its position as the numero uno.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTXTBZNnWOJV6	2024-11-09T17:22:56-08:00	
Interventionism, Sanctions, And Conflict: The Hallmarks Of US For...	Many countries around the world harbor unwarranted fears about the re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024. However, a review of the history of U.S. foreign relations suggests that Trump’s foreign policy may not differ dramatically from that of his predecessors, including the incumbent President Biden. In fact, there are clear continuities in the way U.S. presidents—whether Republican or Democrat—engage with military intervention and the use of force. Take, for example, the military interventions under Republican George W. Bush. Bush invaded Afghanistan in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, occupying the country for nearly 20 years. The U.S.-backed government of Ashraf Ghani collapsed in 2021, leading to a negotiated return to power for the Taliban. Similarly, Bush’s invasion of Iraq in 2003 led to the deaths of approximately 4.6 million people and inflicted trillions in costs over two decades, consequences that continue to shape the region today. Democrat Barack Obama also authorized military action in Libya in 2011, which further destabilized North Africa and contributed to the growth of extremist groups in the region. Trump, during his first term, explicitly violated international law when he ordered the assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, an action that heightened tensions with Tehran. Biden’s administration, meanwhile, has largely continued this trajectory, ignoring Moscow’s security concerns and pushing forward with NATO expansion, which played a significant role in triggering the war in Ukraine. Biden's tough stance toward China—continuing Trump’s aggressive approach—has included military posturing around Taiwan and the expansion of U.S. military bases in the Asia-Pacific region. Biden also continued to engage in proxy conflicts, such as his administration’s ongoing military operations in Yemen alongside the UK. The U.S. has also maintained its unwavering support for Israel, including its controversial actions in Gaza, leading critics to accuse Washington of complicity in war crimes and violations of international law. Life, war, and nothing else: this observation by the renowned Italian historian Oriana Fallaci, in her famous work of the same title, captures a grim reality of U.S. foreign policy, where the instruments of war and military intervention have dominated since the early 21st century. For the U.S., ensuring the loyalty of countries to Washington has long taken precedence over other concerns, driving U.S. presidents to repeatedly engage in military action and intervention around the world. The history of American interventionism is longer and more extensive than that of any other aggressor nation. Washington has frequently disregarded the sovereignty of other countries under the guise of promoting human rights and democracy. In 1953, the U.S. orchestrated a coup in Iran against its democratically elected government, sowing resentment that would culminate in the 1979 hostage crisis. In Vietnam, American forces fought a bloody war for two decades, only to suffer defeat and leave the region in chaos. In the 1980s, the U.S. funded and armed Islamic extremists to counter the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, contributing to the rise of the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The 'color revolutions' in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, from 2003 to 2005, highlighted U.S. efforts to intervene in the politics of former Soviet states, often with the aim of establishing governments more aligned with Washington. Moreover, U.S. economic coercion, including secondary sanctions and export controls, continues to undermine the sovereignty of even Washington’s closest allies, leaving many nations vulnerable to American economic power. Given this history, it is clear that whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden is in office, the primary objective of the United States remains the maintenance of global dominance and the subordination of other nations to U.S. geopolitical interests. The differences between these leaders often lie more in rhetoric and style than in substance. Whether under Trump or Biden, the U.S. will continue to pursue aggressive policies toward China, offer unflinching support to Israel, keep Europe under its strategic thumb, and resist demands for more equitable engagement with the 'Global South.' In this sense, the fears surrounding Trump's return to the presidency are often exaggerated. Biden's administration has not been a radical departure from Trump’s foreign policy in many areas, particularly with regard to Russia, China, and the Middle East. Biden’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021—a failure that Trump had similarly prepared for—demonstrated the inability of either party to manage the consequences of two decades of militarism in the region. Biden also escalated Trump’s confrontations with China, while pursuing policies that continue to inflame tensions in the Middle East, including his administration’s role in the normalization of relations between Arab states and Israel, sidelining the Palestinian issue in the process. Trump’s return to power would likely see a continuation of these policies, if not a further escalation. Trump, like Biden, remains committed to NATO expansion, confrontation with Russia, and the use of military force to maintain global hegemony. The U.S. commitment to military intervention and coercion will remain unchanged, and Washington’s role as the global policeman will continue—regardless of who occupies the Oval Office. Ultimately, whether under Biden, Trump, or any other future U.S. president, one principle of U.S. foreign policy remains certain: the reliance on coercive tools—military intervention, economic sanctions, and diplomatic pressure—will continue to dominate U.S. foreign relations. This strategy has been ingrained in the American political culture for decades, making war, violence, and intervention central tenets of U.S. diplomacy. The instability and crises afflicting the world today are the result of this unrelenting pursuit of dominance, a legacy that seems destined to continue for the foreseeable future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTZspKZPAPln9	2024-11-09T17:14:48-08:00	
Robert Reich: The Lesson – OpEd	A political disaster such as what occurred Tuesday gains significance not simply by virtue of who won or lost, but through how the election is interpreted. This is known as The Lesson of the election. The Lesson explains what happened and why. It deciphers the public’s mood, values, and thoughts. It attributes credit and blame. And therein lies its power. When The Lesson of the election becomes accepted wisdom — when most of the politicians, pundits, and journalists come to believe it — it shapes the future. It determines how parties, candidates, political operatives, and journalists approach future elections. There are many reasons for what occurred on Tuesday and for what the outcome should teach America — about where the nation is and about what Democrats should do in the future. Yet inevitably, one Lesson predominates. Today, I want to share with you six conventional 'lessons' you will hear for Tuesday’s outcome. None is or should be considered The Lesson of the 2024 election. Then I’ll give you what I consider the real Lesson of the election. None of these are The Lesson of the 2024 election: 1. It was a total repudiation of the Democratic Party, a major realignment. Rubbish. Harris would have won had there been a small, less than 1 percent vote shift in the three main battleground states. The biggest shift from 2020 and 2016 was among Latino men. We don’t know yet whether Latino men will return to the Democrats; if they don’t, they will contribute to a small realignment. But the fact is America elected Trump in 2016, almost reelected him in 2020, and elected him again in 2024. We haven't changed much, at least in terms of whom we vote for. 2. If the Dems want to win in the future, they have to move to the right. They should stop talking about 'democracy,' forget 'multiculturalism,' and end their focus on women’s rights, transgender rights, immigrants’ rights, voting rights, civil rights, and America’s shameful history of racism and genocide. Instead, push to strengthen families, cut taxes, allow school choice and prayer in public schools, reduce immigration, minimize our obligations abroad, and put America and Americans first. Wrong. Democrats shouldn’t move to the right if that means giving up on democracy, social justice, civil rights, and equal voting rights. While Democrats might reconsider their use of 'identity' politics (in which people are viewed primarily through the lenses of race, ethnicity, or gender), Democrats must not lose the moral ideals at the heart of the Party and at the core of America. 3. Republicans won because of misinformation and right-wing propaganda. They won over young men because of a vicious alliance between Trump and a vast network of online influencers and podcasts appealing to them. The answer is for Democrats to cultivate an equivalent media ecosystem that rivals what the right has built.Partly true. Misinformation and right-wing propaganda did play a role, particularly in reaching young men. But this hardly means progressives and Democrats should fill the information ecosystem with misinformation or left-wing propaganda. Better messaging, yes. Lies and bigotry, no. We should use our power as consumers to boycott X and all advertisers on X and on Fox News, mount defamation and other lawsuits against platforms that foment hate, and push for regulations (at least at the state level for now) requiring that all platforms achieve minimum standards of moderation and decency. 4. Republicans cheated. Trump, Putin, and election deniers at county and precinct levels engaged in a vast conspiracy to suppress votes. I doubt it. Putin tried, but so far there’s no sign that the Kremlin affected any voting process. There is little or no evidence of widespread cheating by Republicans. Dems should not feed further conspiracy theories about fraudulent voting or tallying. For the most part, the system worked smoothly, and we owe a huge debt of gratitude to election workers and state officials in charge of the process. 5. Harris ran a lousy campaign. She wasn’t a good communicator. She fudged and shifted her positions on issues. She was weighed down by Biden and didn’t sufficiently separate herself from him. Untrue. Harris ran an excellent campaign, but she had only a little over three months to do it. She had to introduce herself to the nation (typically a vice president is almost invisible within an administration) at the same time Trump’s antics sucked most of the oxygen out of the political air. She could have been clearer about her proposals and policies and embraced economic populism (see below on the real lesson), but her debate with Trump was the best debate performance I’ve ever witnessed, and her speeches were pitch perfect. Biden may have weighed her down a bit, but his decision to step down was gracious and selfless. 6. Racism and misogyny. Voters were simply not prepared to elect a Black female president. Partly true. Surely racism and misogyny played a role, but bigotry can’t offer a full explanation. Here’s the real Lesson of the 2024 election: On Tuesday, according to exit polls, Americans voted mainly on the economy — and their votes reflected their class and level of education. While the economy has improved over the last two years according to standard economic measures, most Americans without college degrees — that’s the majority — have not felt it. In fact, most Americans without college degrees have not felt much economic improvement for four decades, and their jobs have grown less secure. The real median wage of the bottom 90 percent is stuck nearly where it was in the early 1990s, even though the economy is more than twice as large. Most of the economy’s gains have gone to the top. This has caused many Americans to feel frustrated and angry. Trump gave voice to that anger. Harris did not. The real lesson of the 2024 election is that Democrats must not just give voice to the anger but also explain how record inequality has corrupted our system, and pledge to limit the political power of big corporations and the super-rich. The basic bargain used to be that if you worked hard and played by the rules, you’d do better and your children would do even better than you. But since 1980, that bargain has become a sham. The middle class has shrunk. Why? While Republicans steadily cut taxes on the wealthy, Democrats abandoned the working class. Democrats embraced NAFTA and lowered tariffs on Chinese goods. They deregulated finance and allowed Wall Street to become a high-stakes gambling casino. They let big corporations gain enough market power to keep prices (and profit margins) high. They let corporations bust unions (with negligible penalties) and slash payrolls. They bailed out Wall Street when its gambling addiction threatened to blow up the entire economy but never bailed out homeowners who lost everything. They welcomed big money into their campaigns — and delivered quid pro quos that rigged the market in favor of big corporations and the wealthy. Joe Biden redirected the Democratic Party back toward its working-class roots, but many of the changes he catalyzed — more vigorous antitrust enforcement, stronger enforcement of labor laws, and major investments in manufacturing, infrastructure, semiconductors, and non-fossil fuels — wouldn’t be evident for years, and he could not communicate effectively about them. The Republican Party says it’s on the side of working people, but its policies will hurt ordinary workers even more. Trump’s tariffs will drive up prices. His expected retreat from vigorous antitrust enforcement will allow giant corporations to drive up prices further. If Republicans gain control over the House as well as the Senate, as looks likely, they will extend Trump’s 2017 tax law and add additional tax cuts. As in 2017, these lower taxes will benefit mainly the wealthy and enlarge the national debt, which will give Republicans an excuse to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid — their objectives for decades. Democrats must no longer do the bidding of big corporations and the wealthy. They must instead focus on winning back the working class. They should demand paid family leave, Medicare for all, free public higher education, stronger unions, higher taxes on great wealth, and housing credits that will generate the biggest boom in residential home construction since World War II. They should also demand that corporations share their profits with their workers. They should call for limits on CEO pay, eliminate all stock buybacks (as was the SEC rule before 1982), and reject corporate welfare (subsidies and tax credit to particular companies and industries unrelated to the common good). Democrats need to tell Americans why their pay has been lousy for decades and their jobs less secure: not because of immigrants, liberals, people of color, the 'deep state,' or any other Trump Republican bogeyman, but because of the power of large corporations and the rich to rig the market and siphon off most of the economy’s gains. In doing this, Democrats need not turn their backs on democracy. Democracy goes hand-in-hand with a fair economy. Only by reducing the power of big money in our politics can America grow the middle class, reward hard work, and reaffirm the basic bargain at the heart of our system. If the Trump Republicans gain control of the House, as seems likely, they will have complete control of the federal government. That means they will own whatever happens to the economy and will be responsible for whatever happens to America. Notwithstanding all their anti-establishment populist rhetoric, they will become the establishment. The Democratic Party should use this inflection point to shift ground — from being the party of well-off college graduates, big corporations, 'never-Tumpers' like Dick Cheney, and vacuous 'centrism' — to an anti-establishment party ready to shake up the system on behalf of the vast majority of Americans. This is and should be The Lesson of the 2024 election. What do you think?

Sri Lanka’s Parliamentary Election – OpEd	Sri Lanka's President Dissanayake made a smart decision to dissolve parliament after winning the presidential election on September 21. The national legislature was dissolved on September 24, and the election has been scheduled for November 14, 2024. Parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka are increasingly becoming predictable regarding winners and losers. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) wanted a two-thirds majority in 2020, and the SLPP-led coalition won a two-thirds majority. One of the reasons why the general elections lack excitement and unpredictability is that winning presidential candidates opt to dissolve parliament and go for fresh elections in the hope of capitalizing on the euphoria created by the presidential election results. It is the same logic that prompted President Dissanayake to dissolve parliament. This time, there are hardly any doubts about the victory of the JVP/NPP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna/National People’s Power). It will emerge as the single largest party in the national legislature. However, the question is, would the JVP/NPP win a clear majority on November 14? The JVP/NPP presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake presented himself as the 'change' candidate in the presidential election. However, after winning the presidential election, the Dassanayake administration has not demonstrated a keen interest in any substantial changes to the system. Not even policy changes have been announced as they continue with the key policies and practices of the previous governments, especially the government of Ranil Wickremesinghe. Many examples could be cited. The primary examples include the decision to continue with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) bailout deal, the decision to seek membership in BRICS, an emerging group of powerful states including China, India, and Russia, and the decision to continue with the fuel price formula system. There could be three reasons why the present government has not introduced any significant changes. First, the government is inexperienced. The cabinet of ministers has only three ministers, including the president. This was not by choice because the party had only three members in the previous parliament, and the Sri Lankan constitution does not allow ministers to be appointed from outside parliament. The JVP/NPP was not inclined to partner with like-minded parties in parliament to form a reasonable-sized cabinet because the party believed that all others in parliament were corrupt or unclean except for the JVP members. This is precisely why the party has urged the voters to 'clean' the parliament through their votes on November 14. Nevertheless, the government's inexperience may be preventing it from contemplating structural changes Dissanayake’s voters wanted. The present administration operates like a government with an opposition mentality. More resources and energy have been spent on criticizing the opposition parties rather than addressing administrative issues. Second, the government may be hesitant to introduce any structural changes because it fears that any immediate alterations could create an economic crisis like the one instigated by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022. Returning to the era of queues was a slogan Dissanayake’s critics used against him during the presidential election. They argued that voting Dissanayake to power would push the country back to long queues for essential commodities. Third, the government may be waiting until the parliamentary elections are over to initiate structural change. For the moment, the government seems to have considerable support, which could be translated into votes essential to win the election on November 14. The idea is not to rock the boat before the election. In other words, the government may be playing it safe until the parliamentary election. If this is the case, the election results would shed more light on the government's system change plans. Failure to introduce substantial changes immediately could disappoint the JVP/NPP supporters, who expected revolutionary reforms during the presidential election. Would this disappointment damage the JVP/NPP votes in the parliamentary election? It is unlikely because they understand the need to win the parliamentary election. However, continuing Wickremesinghe policies without substantial change, even after the election, could set off resistance from JVP’s grassroots supporters and aragalaya proponents. Therefore, the JVP/NPP government could be under pressure after the parliamentary election. Does this mean the JVP/NPP is entirely safe in the parliamentary election? It is important to note that the government encountered several issues that have the potential to reduce its votes in the parliamentary election. For example, the increasing Israeli presence in Sri Lanka has the potential to dent the Muslim votes of the JVP/NPP slightly. In November 2024, The United States and a small number of Western states publicly warned about an impending attack on Israeli tourist facilities in Sri Lanka, which, on the other hand, exposed the sudden increase of Israeli visitors and Israeli interest in Sri Lanka. The government immediately took action to protect these facilities with enhanced security arrangements to the dissatisfaction of the local Muslim population. In the 2024 presidential election, compared to other minority communities, Muslim voters favored Dissanayake. They vehemently defended and promoted Dissanayake. For example, Dissanayake won Beruwala, a Muslim region, with about 42 percent of the votes. Therefore, one cannot underestimate the Muslim support of the JVP/NPP. The Israeli issue could discourage some Muslim voters from voting for the JVP/NPP on November 14. Another issue that could potentially take some votes from the JVP/NPP column is the government’s inability to control the prices of essential commodities. Reports indicate that rice and coconut prices have skyrocketed. The government also could not reduce fuel (petrol and diesel) prices. These issues can potentially limit the JVP/NPP votes in the parliamentary election. These issues, however, are unlikely to prevent the JVP/NPP from winning the election. Many voters in Sri Lanka currently seem to have a special relationship (based on expectations rather than satisfaction) with the JVP/NPP government. If they believe the government will eventually address their needs, they will continue voting for the JVP/NPP. On the other hand, if one translates Dissanayake’s presidential election votes to parliamentary votes, the JVP/NPP will win about 110 seats, three short of a clear majority. There is no evidence to suggest that the party has substantially increased its support base in the last month and a half. Therefore, the party is highly unlikely to win a two-thirds majority. Last week, a JVP/NPP leader declared that the party is not seeking a two-thirds majority. Perhaps the signals are clear. However, many JVP/NPP supporters and sympathizers strongly believe that the party will easily win the majority in parliament. They argue that no strong opposition exists to challenge the JVP/NPP supremacy. What is important to note is that the opposition votes could be scattered. A striking reality that many JVP/NPP supporters fail to consider is that the party won two elections (the presidential election and the Elpitiya pradeshiya sabha election) in the recent past. The JVP/NPP failed to get 50 percent of the votes in both polls. I believe that a warning shot has already been fired in the Elpitiya election because, compared to the presidential election, the JVP/NPP lost some votes in Elpitiya, and the SLPP managed to increase its share of the votes. Since the Gotabaya Rajapaksa votes transformed into Dissanayake votes in the presidential election, the Elpitiya results should worry the JVP/NPP supporters. Moreover, Elpitiya is a heavily Sinhala region. The parliamentary election includes Tamil voters, who did not prefer Dissanayake in the presidential election. The Tamils in the Northern and Eastern provinces would mostly vote for Tamil political parties. Therefore, theoretically, Sri Lanka could end up with a hung parliament on November 14.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTTsIqpsIDcPn	2024-11-09T17:07:33-08:00	
Tawhid, Torah And Three Unique Abrahamic Religions – OpEd	There are hundreds of millions of people today who have two or three self-identities. This was also true 3,500 years ago; although to a much lesser extent than today. For example, Prophet Abraham is called a Muslim in the Arabic Qur'an; and in the Hebrew Bible he is called a Hebrew [speaker] and a Babylonian immigrant who crossed the Jordan River. The term ivri (the Hebrew) first appears in the Torah, when Prophet Abraham is called 'the Hebrew: 'And it was told to Abram the Hebrew' (Genesis 14:13) Prophet Joseph uses the name Hebrew as both a geographical and an socio-ethnic term: 'I was kidnapped from the land of the ivrim' (Genesis 40:15), and 'The Egyptians would not eat with the ivrim, since that would be an abomination' (Genesis 43:32) The word Muslim is a religious identity term that refers to all faithful monotheistic believers who submit to the one and only God who created the universe. The word Hebrew is a linguistic, geographical and ethnic identity term like German [a language], Germany{a country] and Germans [a people]. The word descendent is a biological inherited birth identity term like nobility or tribe. Islam is a religion designed by God to overcome all other self-identities: 'O mankind, We created you from male and female, and made you (into) peoples and tribes, that you may know (respect) one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.' (Quran 49:13) 'Once all humans were but a single community; then they disagreed (formulating different beliefs and rites). Had it not been that your Lord had already so ordained, a decisive judgement would have been made regarding (the truth of) their disagreements.' (Qur'an 10:19) In those generations all human communities created different religions of their own with different creeds and ways. Now, if you desire that Allah Himself should uncover the truth and present it to you to enable you to decide which religion is the true one, you should know that this will not be done in this lifetime, because God now requires you to decide this yourself by using your own intelligence and your moral kindness. This worldly life is a trial to see whether or not you yourselves recognize truth by competing in doing acts of kindness, toleration and welcoming others who are different into your lands. This is why the Qur'an declares: 'Let there be no compulsion in Religion: truth stands out clear from error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah (one God) has grasped the most trustworthy unbreakable hand hold: Allah hears, and knows all things.' (2:256) The three Abrahamic religions; Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, are closer to each other than each of them is to any non-Abrahamic religion. Yet each of the three religions is very unique; and each relates to the other two in its own unique way. 'And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good; and follows the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth? And Allah took Abraham as an intimate friend.' (4:125) There could be no Christians before the birth of Jesus; and although there have been many hanif muslim monotheists, they could not be members of the Muslim Umma prior to the revelation of the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad. Judaism is unique because the Jewish People actually proceeded the Jewish religion. Thus Qur'an 3.67 states: Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian; but he was one pure of faith and a muslim (submitting to the one God). He was never of those who associate partners with God.' Abraham could not be a Jew or a Christian, because both the Torah and Gospel were revealed centuries after Abraham. Historically, Judaism and Christianity are the names given to the religions revealed to Prophet Moses and Prophet Jesus, respectively by their faithful followers. The diversity among mankind mentioned in Qur'an 49:13 is mentioned with a comprehensive affirmation that its purpose is that different groups and individuals were enabled to learn to know each other. This point is underlined in several verses teaching that diversity in ethnicity, colour, faith and culture was intended by the Creator: 'If God had so willed, He would have made you one community, but He wanted to test you through that which He has given you. (5:48) 'If your Lord had pleased, He would have made all people a single community, but they continue to have their differences. (11:118–19) And 'Had your Lord willed, all the people on earth would have believed. So can you [Prophet Muhammad] compel people to believe? (10:99) Among attributes most American Jews consider essential to being Jewish, 82% say caring about Israel, with 58% saying that they feel attached to the nation of Israel; 76% say remembering the Holocaust; 72% say leading an ethical life; and 59% say working for justice and equality. Jews do have many names to self-identify because they have been immigrants for a little more than half of their 36-7 centuries of Jewish history. Even more important, by God's design Prophet Abraham's biological descendants through Isaac and Jacob became the first ongoing monotheistic community to last to this very day. 'And remember Our servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob – those of strength and [religious] vision. Indeed, We chose them for an exclusive quality: remembrance of the home [the 'safe haven' Land of Israel]. And indeed they are to Us among the chosen and outstanding.' (Qur'an 38:45-7) The Christian community and the Muslim Umma were formed by those individuals who became faithful believers in the Gospel or the Qur'an. But the Banu Israel-the Jewish People only received the Torah after several generations of oppression in Egypt, when the Jewish People escaped and stood at Mount Sinai and received the Torah from Prophets Moses and Aaron. This is why the history of the People of Israel Hebrews makes up such a large place in the Hebrew Bible. Indeed, the name 'Israel' is mentioned 2,319 individual times in the Hebrew Bible because the historical experiences of the nation of Israel (the descendants of Jacob/Israel) is the central focus of most of the books in the Hebrew Scriptures. As the Qur'an states: 'And We certainty settled the Children of Israel in an agreeable settlement [Israel] and provided them with good things. And they did not differ until [after] knowledge had come to them. So your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ. So if you [Muhammad] are in doubt, about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.' (Qur'an 10:93-4) Judaism, as the abstract term is understood today, did not exist. There was not even a word for 'religion' in any traditional Jewish language. Rather, what we call 'Judaism' today was generally understood as a complex amalgam of religious belief, practice, and national/ethnic identification. That view prevailed in many Jewish circles until modern times and is best exemplified in the Biblical Book of Ruth. Ruth clearly states that she identifies first with the people of her mother-in-law Naomi, and only after that with Naomi's God (1:16). In other words, Ruth was adopted into the Jewish people first because of her identification with the Jewish people, followed by her attachment to the God of Israel. Ruth's oath is still stated by converts today: Ruth replied, 'Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.' (Ruth 1:16-17) Although most Jews share a common gene pool, they are not a race because any non-Jew who converts to Judaism will be recognized as being Jewish by all those rabbis who share a commitment to the same denomination of Judaism as the rabbi who did the conversion. But what about the Jewish law that defines a Jew as anyone who is born of a Jewish mother. Isn't this evidence of Jewish racial thought? For Christians, who believe that only adult baptism as a result of personal belief (Protestant), or infant/child baptism by an authorized church sacrament (Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox) makes one a Christian, it seems strange that children of any Jewish mother, religious or not, are Jewish; even if the father was not Jewish and the children know little or nothing about Jewish beliefs. But Muslim law says the same thing for the male gender: children of any Muslim father are Muslim, even if the mother was not Muslim; and Muslims are clearly not racist. In truth, Christianity is an unusually disembodied religion compared to Judaism, Islam and many eastern religions, and there is no reason other religions should be equally disconnected from the ethnic body of their original believers. When it comes to Jews who are non-religious or even anti-religious, they are considered secular or cultural Jews, unless they as adults convert to another religion. Like most nations, Jews have a national language, a shared history, which is much longer than most nations, and a style of cooking and thinking that is as distinctive as that of many other nations. But the Jewish People is a very unusual kind of nation: a transnational mobile nation; what Russian Communists used to call 'unrooted cosmopolitans'. From the very beginning. when Abraham and Sarah left their families and homeland to immigrate to the Land of Israel, the majority of the Jewish People has been subject to major geographic relocations. What the Jewish People have lacked for most of their 3,500 year history was an independent Jewish State located in one geographical area. However, states come and go (Yugoslavia) and go and come (Poland and Israel) so having a state, and a stable territorial location, is not in the Jewish experience, the most important aspect of being a nation. Being a faithful part of the Jewish community in terms of group connection and religious action is more central to being Jewish than adhering to credal statements. That is why the majority of Jews do not view 'Jews for Jesus' or Messianic Jews as belonging to the Jewish community. The answer to the question of what are Jews is that Judaism and the Jewish People are so deeply intertwined they cannot and should not be separated. Individuals Jews act in all kinds of ways, but the historical community of Jews is a blend of Jews by birth (genes) and Jews by belief, behavior and belonging. As anyone who has visited present day Israel knows, Jews come in many shades and looks. This is because even in the diaspora, and even against the will of the ruling religious authorities, Jews have almost always, when they were free to do so, proselytized their neighbors, and quietly welcomed converts into the Jewish community, even against the formal rules of medieval rabbis. That is why most Jews in different geographical locations tend to look similar to the local majority after a few centuries. This could not happen without significant marriage with converts to Judaism. The rabbinical rule that one should not refer to any Jew's convert status is evidence of the desire of Jewish leaders to keep Jewish proselytizing activities hidden from the ruling non-Jewish religious authorities. Yet from the very beginning converts to Judaism and their genes, have entered the Jewish gene pool. In the west today many converts are descendants of ex-Jews from previous generations who are now returning to the Jewish People, and bringing home some lost Jewish genes; as well as some non-Jewish genes with them. This is how it has always been to a greater or lesser extant. Thus it is clear that Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people because non-Jews can always enter the Jewish community, and become a part of the inter-national Jewish community.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTfw6FR-a0AHP	2024-11-09T17:01:35-08:00	
TTP And ISKP: Two Sides Of The Same Coin – OpEd	For over two decades, Pakistan has been embroiled in a battle against groups that cloak their violent actions in religious rhetoric. Among the most notorious of these are TTP and ISKP. Though these groups present themselves as distinct entities, they are two sides of the same coin—both driven by a Khawariji ideology that has been declared un-Islamic by religious scholars. The relationship between TTP and ISKP goes beyond ideological alignment. While each group may superficially claim a unique identity, their origins and leadership have substantial overlap. The first leader of ISKP, Hafiz Saeed Khan, was previously a well-known TTP commander from Pakistan’s Orakzai agency. This connection extends beyond individual members; TTP and ISKP share personnel, tactics, targets, and objectives, leading experts to believe that they are, in essence, two fronts of the same battle against Pakistan. The nexus between these groups extends to their operations and resources. Both TTP and ISKP have found refuge in Afghanistan, where they enjoy safe havens free from conflict with one another, despite their alleged rivalry. While ISKP openly criticizes the Afghan Taliban and has clashed with them physically, it maintains a strangely neutral or even supportive stance toward TTP. This relationship suggests that ISKP and TTP are cooperating at some level, creating a perception that TTP may be using ISKP to deceive and divide Pakistani authorities and the public. The ideological foundation of both TTP and ISKP can be traced back to Khawarijism, a sect that emerged in early Islamic history and was known for its extreme and uncompromising views. The Khawariji ideology advocates the use of violence against Muslims who do not adhere to their narrow interpretation of Islam, labeling them as infidels. This ideology has been denounced by Islamic scholars around the world, including those in Pakistan, who have deemed it un-Islamic and 'haram' (forbidden). The Paigham-e-Pakistan fatwa, endorsed by Pakistani scholars from various sects, specifically condemns the actions of groups like TTP and ISKP as haram, asserting that armed struggle within Pakistan is fundamentally against Islamic principles. Yet, TTP and ISKP continue to exploit religion to radicalize young, impressionable minds. They employ twisted interpretations of Islamic teachings to justify heinous acts of terrorism, targeting civilians, religious scholars, mosques, and schools. While these groups claim to fight in the name of Islam, their actions reveal the opposite. They engage in acts of brutality that Islam explicitly condemns, including suicide bombings, which are forbidden in Islamic jurisprudence. Their manipulation of youth into carrying out suicide missions further highlights the hypocrisy and moral bankruptcy of their cause; while young recruits are encouraged to sacrifice their lives, the leaders of these groups rarely, if ever, take such risks themselves. Another factor that binds TTP and ISKP is their role as foreign proxies. Their operational activities and financial resources are largely derived from external sources that have vested interests in destabilizing Pakistan. These foreign backers use these groups to further their own agendas, effectively making TTP and ISKP puppets in a larger geopolitical game. This aspect of their existence further distances them from any legitimate claim to Islamic principles, revealing their true motivations: serving foreign powers rather than pursuing any genuine religious or nationalistic cause. Both TTP and ISKP have been linked to foreign intelligence agencies, which use them to create unrest and destabilize Pakistan. By attacking both civilian and military targets within Pakistan, they attempt to sow fear, undermine public morale, and create an environment of instability. Their continuous efforts to destabilize Pakistan serve only to benefit their foreign handlers, further highlighting the role of these groups as pawns in a broader regional struggle. While TTP and ISKP may appear to target different groups, this distinction is strategic rather than genuine. TTP focuses on security forces, claiming its attacks as part of a 'legitimate' struggle, while ISKP has been known to attack religious gatherings, mosques, and scholars. This tactic serves to deflect public anger from TTP by allowing ISKP to take the blame for civilian-targeted violence. In this way, the TTP presents itself as a group focused solely on attacking state security apparatuses, while ISKP assumes the role of attacking 'soft' targets like religious institutions. This tactic of 'good cop, bad cop' allows them to maintain public confusion, diminishing a unified response against their terrorism. Furthermore, the TTP’s use of ISKP as a proxy allows them to deflect blame and manage public backlash in Pakistan. Whenever a particularly heinous act of terrorism occurs, ISKP often claims responsibility, distancing TTP from the outrage and condemnation that follows. This tactical divide is evidence of their strategic collaboration, and it underscores their shared goal of destabilizing Pakistan through different methods of terror. In sum, TTP and ISKP are two sides of the same coin, sharing a common Khawariji ideology and serving foreign interests in their campaign of terror against Pakistan. Their superficial distinctions are a tactical ploy to deceive the public and divert attention from their unified goal: the destabilization of Pakistan through un-Islamic acts of violence. The only way forward is a combined effort from Pakistan’s government, military, and religious scholars to expose these groups for what they are—agents of destruction who have no legitimate claim to Islam or its teachings. By building on the Paigham-e-Pakistan fatwa and fostering public awareness, Pakistan can work towards eradicating these threats and securing a peaceful future for all its citizens.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTXOOsbhUF-0y	2024-11-09T16:41:14-08:00	
Bangladesh: The Evil That Was The Behemoth Hasina And Her Gargant...	Shakespeare’s King Lear which, critics think, begins with a climax with the old and frail Lear already falling as he divides his kingdom among his three daughters in the very first scene. Similarly, horrible Hasina’s bloody regime already began to crumble with a climax early on (BDR massacre on 25-26 February 2009), only to end with another climax, the massacre of July-August 2024. This is not to speak of her countless other beastly atrocities and brutal acts of repression committed during more than a decade and a half in between. The almost long 16 years saw the inferno of the monstrous dictator’s barbaric mafia misrule. The carnival of her harrowing tales of oppression reached the finish line in July-August 2024 when the tables were finally turned on her and she, like many other dictators in modern history, had to flee the country for her life on 5 August. Just a few days before, on 23 July, the New York Times reported that 'An unbending leader’s crackdown rains carnage on Bangladesh. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s response to protests has left at least 150 people dead and created the biggest challenge yet to her grip on power.' On 29 July when her bloodthirsty crackdown on the popular students-people uprising was still going on with increasing intensity, (Ret) Col Mohammad Abdul Hoque, one of the best social media influencers, did one of his finest videos in support of the uprising. Many of those young and teenage school and college and university students, along with many nonstudent members of the public were already killed in hundreds, probably over a thousand all across Bangladesh. Although most of the major parties’ participation, including the BNP, was very half-hearted, far below the expectation of the nation, many writers, intellectuals, and social media influencers were highly encouraging and inspiring about the July-August Chatro Janata uprising that finally got the army on their side providing the most crucial help they needed. The works of the writers, intellectuals, and social media influencers were making a significant contribution to the moral, ethical and political reconstruction of Bangladesh and should therefore provide the building blocks in the progress of the foundation of the nation after the Awami destruction of it. All Bangladesh governments, including the present (interim) one and those to come in the future, may benefit from their patriotic and enlightening ideas. All such governments, now and later, should stay, as the majority of those writers and speakers clearly convey, rooted and anchored in Islam and Muslim identity—the identity of the vast majority of the country with justice, safety, peace and security ensured for all, regardless of caste and creed. Unfortunately, fascist Hasina’s Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) was a massively and monstrously Modi-fied ruling machine defrauding the nation right and left all the way. It was so horrendous in its oppression and so highly and hugely Hindu-spirited in its mafia political culture that it has justifiably acquired the humiliating acronym of BAL over the years of its awfully authoritarian rule. That acronym is just an abbreviation of the full name of the party with no cultural connotation or expletive implied. It’s like the last name ‘Chuppu’ of Hasina-appointed ‘President’ Shahabuddin (who rose through filthy and fishy means). চোরের মনে পুলিশ পুলিশ, যারা চুরি করে তাদের মনে সবসময় ভয় থাকে। No wonder, she dropped ‘Chuppu’ from her devilishly loyalist Shahabuddin just as she dropped ‘B’ of Bangladesh from her AL and just as she dropped Bangladesh and ‘Wazed’ to India in her devilish intentions. Barrister Fuaad Abdullah describes the BAL as a party that has existed all these years without their political circumcision (রাজনৈতিকভাবে যারা 'খাৎনা' বা 'মুসলমানি করা' ছাড়া অবস্থান করে আসছে)। BNP MP Rehana Akhtar Ranu’s classic চুদুর বুদুর or the BAL’s Dipu Modi’s নিষিদ্ধ পল্লীর ভাষা (language of the red light district), both told in the parliament in 2013, still rings funny with a hullabaloo. Donald Trump, famous for sharply ridiculing his political opponents by referring to their names, would have attacked the BAL the same way. Almost 16 years of Hasina regime leading up to July-August 2024 were a time of radical opposites and contrasts representing the forces of good and evil--fascist bondage, on the one hand, and freedom and liberation, on the other. As Dickens’s novel A Tale of Two Cities (London and Paris) begins with a famous juxtaposition of a series of paradoxes, 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness ….' Dictator Hasina, dubbed a cruel canine crime minister and sadistic she-hyena prime monster, fell a sudden fall on 5 August only to flee away to her evil and egregious political backer India. Well-known journalist Masood Kamal rightly suggests: 'পতিত স্বৈরাচার হাসিনা মানুষ নন তিনি হাজার খুনের আসামি দৈত্ত দানব দুর্গন্ধযুক্ত আবর্জনা। ভারত এই 'মাল' কে কোথাও রপ্তানি করতে পারবেনা।' Barrister Fuaad Abdullah is just brilliant in talking about the need of embargo/moratorium to be imposed on the ‘uncircumcised’ BAL and Sheikh family/dynasty (রাজনৈতিকভাবে যারা 'খাৎনা' বা 'মুসলমানি করা' ছাড়া অবস্থান করে আসছে)। Even after Awami RakkhiBahini’s widespread killings and widespread Awami corruption during Mujib’s not too long reign, they were allowed to walk away without their ‘circumcision’ being complete. They made a comeback in 1996 and again in late 2008. In the words of self-employed Bangladeshi-Canadian A K Delwar Hussain, son of A K Rafiqul Hussain, second Joint Secretary of the then Awami Muslim League in the 1950s, '২০০৮ সালের নির্বাচনের ঠিক আগে পরে বাংলাদেশের জয়-বাংলা ব্যবস্থা একটি পরিকল্পনা, সমন্বয় এবং সতর্কতার সাথে বাস্তবায়নের মাধ্যমে BAL এর ক্ষমতায় ফিরে আসার আয়োজন করা হয়েছিল! বাংলাদেশ সশস্ত্র বাহিনীর মূল অংশে আঘাত করে BALএর ষোল বছরের অশুভ যাত্রা শুরু হয়।আমাদের নিরাপত্তা, সার্বভৌমত্ব, সম্মান এবং গর্ব --আমাদের প্রিয় বাংলাদেশের সশস্ত্র বাহিনীকে কেন্দ্র করে ‘মিউটিনি ফর দ্য বাউন্টি'র’ লক্ষ্য করা হয়েছিল। ৫৭ জন অত্যন্ত বীর ও অভিজ্ঞ অফিসারকে অসহায়ভাবে হত্যা করা হয়। যারা এই মর্মান্তিক ঘটনা ঘটিয়েছে তাদের চুল-চেরা বিচার ও শাস্তি ছাড়া জাতি স্বস্তিতে থাকতে পারে না।' This is the voice of reason, voice of Bangladesh. To continue with Hasina the Terrible and her Awami fascists, India is the hiding place of the horrible hyena Hasina (1975-1981, 2024-?). It is also a communal, fanatical and fundamentalist Hindutva country, especially under the BJP-RSS Narendra Modi, known as the 'Butcher of Gujarat', ever hostile and inimical to Bangladesh and the Muslims of his own country. So, 'That is no country' (meaning India here) for patriotic Bangladeshis, regardless of their caste and creed. The quoted phrase is the opening words of W B Yeats’s 'Sailing to Byzantium' that makes an indirect reference to the poet’s country of birth Ireland. It was on 5 August that a 'terrible beauty was born', to borrow the classic oxymoron, again, from Yeats ('Easter 1916'), following an unprecedented bloodshed and genocidal violence starting from around 15-18 July. There was hardly any news leaked then in ​the state-controlled mass media. It was a media running in the heinous Hasina’s Dracula-and-Gestapo-style police and prison state of absolute authoritarianism. The recent spate of chaos and turmoil​--inhuman, blood-clotting, and heartbreaking​ as it was--started when ordinary students from all levels –schools, colleges, and universities--demanded that the ridiculously biased​ and discriminatory job quotas​ (intended for the utterly toxic and autocratic Hasina’s men of crooked and canine loyalty) be done away with so that the​ graduated or graduating students' fair share of jobs and job opportunities based on merit could be ensured and made available to them. But the call for their more than just and fair cause fell on ​the deaf ears of the hooded and horrible Hasina. Awfully authoritarian Hasina has entirely destroyed all kinds of human rights, civil rights, constitutional rights, and individual rights, there being no space for freedom of speech available, no scope for democratic dissent left, no room for free and fair electoral culture remaining and no ‘privilege’ for any opposition politics whatsoever under cultivation. Horrendous Hasina’s fascist ​one-party rule was a rule of ​nepotism, favoritism, cronyism, division, bondage, and state terrorism​ that had no limits during the last sixteen years. She was bent upon eliminating and annihilating the entire range of social justice and rule of law. To repeat after Fyodor Dostoevsky (in his The Brothers Karamazov), she thought that when there was no God (in her case, absence of strong political opposition), everything nefarious, notorious, and anarchically nihilistic was possible. In her enormously gargantuan appetite for power and corruption, she thought, as the French emperor Louis IV did, she was the state. Backed by India with which Hasina, by admission of her own foreign minister, developed a ’husband-wife’ relationship and also agreed to by politicians like Dr Col Oli Ahmad (not to speak of the alleged or fake rumours of her father’s origin of birth), she was gloating in glee in exercising her sole and absolute dictatorial authority and total grip on power. The latest round of slaughter by the ​hooded and hissing Hasina and her canine police was unleashed ​on young protesters from 15-18 July onwards and was still continuing through 5 August. They suddenly lost their tender lives and got their blooming dreams nipped in the bud. The number of casualties stood at least in hundreds (over one thousand killed and many more critically injured and dismembered), even if one goes by the most conservative estimate. No wonder, journalist Masud Kamal says: 'পতিত স্বৈরাচার হাসিনা মানুষ নন তিনি হাজার খুনের আসামি দৈত্ত দানব দুর্গন্ধযুক্ত আবর্জনা। ভারত এই 'মাল' কে কোথাও রপ্তানি করতে পারবেনা।' As the nation has noticed, those few days, especially since 18 July, were as dark and black as those of her bloody and beastly massacres before, one after another and also those of her father in the past, not too long after the birth of Bangladesh. In fact, the father-daughter duo’s days were doomed and dotted (one can’t miss them!) with some of the darkest and blackest and bloodiest in ​the history ​of the nation. Weeks and days of July (and to continue into early August) saw the entire count​ry immersed and engulfed in the loud and legitimate protest cries that were abruptly quelled by live bullets and deafening sound grenades from tanks and armored vehicles of the police (and later some isolated cases from the army too) descending like locusts and vultures on Dhaka streets. The country just witness​ed a wild carnage of school children, college and university students, small boys and girls, and innocent men and women on the​ir rooftops and by the side of their windows at home. That was the latest ​and ugliest manifestation of the idiotically fascist Hasina’s police rule behind the iron curtain she ​established since 2009. In July 2024 the country was bleeding from a brutal crackdown under the darkness of a nationwide curfew when there was a total internet shutdown and complete news blackout imposed by ​illegal, illegitimate and unelected Hasina killing hundreds, perhaps thousands of unarmed student protesters and the supporting members of the public. The nation is well aware that Hasina came to power in late 2008 for the second time through Indian-orchestrated foul means and was clinging to power since then by using all tools and means available to her in the state machinery—police, army, judiciary and the parliament​. Her cynical and manipulative tactics found ways to bend​ and twist all those ​presumably position hungry and/or ‘willing’ offices and institutions to her personal favor​ and ​her self-serving whim​s and caprices. ​In addition to police and paramilitary forces like RAB and BGB, autocratic Hasina was letting her party cadres armed with lethal weapons to ​ruthlessly assault and suppress the people ​in a deadly manner. By the force of her sheer and sordid authoritarian power, she held sham​ and shoddy​ and shadowy ​and ghostly ‘elections’-cum-selection​s again and again with the people indiscriminately killed and cowed down by her police, RAB and party operatives and apparatchiks. Dictator Hasina had her intelligence, administration and ‘law enforcement’ but actually lawless agents take away the freedom of press and freedom of expression; do blanket detentions, widespread repression, and enforced disappearances; commit rampant human rights violations and indiscriminate murders, and file millions of fake and baseless and harassing court cases against dissenting leaders, activists, journalists, writers, and thinkers, thus completely wiping out the whole range of democratic opposition consisting of numerous parties, big and small, major and minor. Never accountable to anyone, Hasina and her men were widely known to have been involved in massive loot and plunder from bank heists, foreign loans, mega projects, state coffers and state budgets in the name of so-called development, a mirage for the majority facing a complete moral, political, educational and economic decline and deterioration. All this oppression and repression was done by the horribly authoritarian Hasina with the help of her blind puppets and flatterers deployed in all the branches of the government during the last 16 years and also with the help of the government of her dark and evil allies in the neighbouring country. All this was also possible to a great extent by the fact that there was no strong and effective challenge coming from the political opposition. The major party, BNP, highly popular though it was, has been rendered weak and useless, primarily at the top level, due to the regime’s ongoing persecution and prosecution. The top ranks of the party were/are also ideologically lost and floundering, suffering from lack of worthy leadership. Many supporters and sympathizers accuse them of being ignorant, incompetent, compromising, uncommitted, opportunist, and hypocritical, widely rumored to be involved in demoralizing favoritism, nepotism, extortion scams and lucrative ‘businesses’ related to nomination, appointment and committee memberships at every level, from top to bottom. As mentioned at the outset, that was how the Hasina government recently attempted to 5suppress, with dastardly and despicable heavy-handedness, a great and just historic movement -- a movement of memorably 'terrible beauty' -- by millions of students and other people together demanding that the very unjust and unfair quota system for government jobs be scrapped. The evil quota system had earlier been in practice for many years, then dropped in the face of student protest a couple of years ago, then was reintroduced again in July (until it would be gone only after this most unwanted mass slaughter) by the autocratic and unelected government—as fascist and totalitarian as one could imagine, corrupt and rotten to the core. In the quota system, nearly 60% jobs were reserved for the government supporters and sycophants, their crooks and conmen and their dolts and dullards in the guise of different but deceiving, hoodwinking, dust-throwing and eye-washing categories with no true opportunities for merit-and-competition-based selection process. As a result, millions of students and other eligible job seekers found their future to be blank and bleak, and dark and dreary with no real hope and prospect for their dreams to come true. As Bangladesh knows, the Awami government was extremely fetid and fascist. It was intolerably and obnoxiously so since early 2009. Since then, hundreds and thousands of people, including political leaders and activists and journalists, were mercilessly killed and beaten and tortured to death. Since then, not to speak of those perpetrated before by the same party known for their notoriously nihilistic oppression, there were brutal and beastly massacre after massacre--Arson attack on double decker public bus near Hotel Sheraton (4 June 2004); Logi Boitha (Boat Hook and Oar) massacre on 28 October 2006; BDR massacre (25-26 February 2009; Hefazat massacre (5 May 2013); Jamaat-Shibir massacre (17 December 2013; and countless other killings by the Hasina regime throughout the last 16 years. Since 2009, there were hundreds and thousands of premeditated political murders, killings, kidnappings, and enforced disappearances by the Hasina police, Indian-infiltrated Hasina DGFI, and Hasina’s party thugs in separate, yet connected incidents, which became a regular phenomenon of repression made possible by direct state terrorism unleashed by Hasina and her henchmen. Since then, there were thousands and thousands of detentions, including those inmates in the dark dungeon AinaGhor, inhumanly tortuous remands and deadly beatings and incarceration in jail, many dying or getting critically injured due to police brutality while in custody or in open public places. Last two weeks of July and the first few days of August were no different when hundreds and thousands of protesting students and ordinary people joining together in solidarity were being maimed, wounded and shot to death with machetes and live bullets on the streets and even in their homes – bullets coming from the helicopters flying overhead and also the tanks and armored vehicles deceptively carrying the UN signs and logos. All concerned worldwide were then requested to bring that plight and predicament of the people of Bangladesh to the attention of the freedom-loving international news and human rights organizations and ask their respective governments to take necessary punitive and punishing measures against the almost two decades-old Awami regime that had brought the nation of 175 million people to their knees during the regime’s iron-fisted muscle-powered mafia rule of malicious intent for that long duration. All concerned also took the opportunity to sincerely urge the democracy-loving international entities and authorities to take steps to force that utterly obnoxious regime headed by Hasina the Horrible to go. Time was long overdue then to force a regime change with Hasina caught, detained, handcuffed, chained, remanded, imprisoned and brought to justice. Time was overdue to bring to power a third party of honest and committed people drawn from selected politicians, academics, intellectuals, journalists, political analysts and other professionals. We the people of Bangladesh needed the help of Chatro Janata (political parties failing), America and the West to achieve this democratic, patriotic and nationalist goal to save our country from the clutches of a ferociously fascist regime led by Hasina the Horrible, far worse than Hitler, Namroud (Nimrod) and Feraoon (Pharoah)! Thank God the country would be free on 5 August! Post-5 August unacceptable role of the BNP However, it’s unfortunate that the BNP, under its present incompetent leadership, has been playing a mew-mew cowardly and compromising role despite being a target of nonstop ruthless oppression by the fascistically strong BAL. Cowed down by its RAW-BAL-engendered B-team-like ineptitude and inability, BNP has been drifting and deviating far, for well over a decade, from the patriotic, nationalist, pro-Islam, and pro-Bangladesh ideals and legacies of their party’s great and glorious founder late President Ziaur Rahman and then the stellar and spectacular Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia. Not only that, they, including her treacherously selfish son, never fought for Begum Zia and against the injustice she suffered for years. It is in this context that the BNP’s Standing Committee Member (Ret) Maj Hafizuddin Ahmad Bir Bikram has recently hurled blistering criticism of the horrible Hasina BAL, praising the students-people movement and vilifying those (maybe some of his own party!), who are shamelessly compromising with the fascist Hasina and her party associates consisting of mafia gangs and goons and hoodlums and hooligans. Barrister Fuaad Abdullah was also brilliant in asking for the political dialysis for the endlessly corrupt and criminal Hasina BAL whose ‘kidney’ (in metaphorical sense) has gone extremely bad. At the same time he also took to task those people and parties (perhaps implying the hopelessly useless BNP leaders like Mirza Fakhrul), who are still trying to play civil and sympathetic to the Hasina BAL. In the name of being so-called civil/সুশীল to the fascist BAL, Mirzas and Fakhruls of the BNP also have become indistinguishable from the forces of Hasina, as Fuaad Abdullah claims. Those who are stupid to the extent of being shamefully soft and weak and compromising with the hugely Modi-fied and highly Hinduized Hasina BAL need to be kicked out immediately. Committing perfidy, they are traitors and betrayers to Zia’s and Begum Zia’s ideals and legacies and thereby to the people of the whole country, who suffered indescribably hard in the hands of the Indianized fascist Hasina BAL. (Ret) Maj Delwar Hussain rightly attacks the mew-mew Mirza Fakhrul. এই প্রসঙ্গে আরো বলতে হয়, এই বিএনপি অমর ও মহান জিয়া ও বেগম জিয়ার আদর্শের দল নয়। অনেকে বলে থাকেন এই বিএনপি ও বাল (BAL) একই মুদ্রার এপিঠ এপিঠ। এই বিএনপির বড় ছোট বিভিন্ন পর্যায়ের অনেকই RAW Mathur India-controlled অযোগ্য, চাঁদাবাজ দখলবাজ, দুর্নীতিপরায়ন, আপোষকামী।এই বিএনপি আবার কখন কোথায় আন্দোলন সংগ্রাম করলো? তাদের লক্ষ লক্ষ লোক থাকা সত্তেও তেনারা হাসিনাকে নামাতে পারে নাই। RAW India-controlled and compromising, তেনারা মুজিব-হাসিনার মতই রাজপথ থেকে বার বার পালিয়েছেন। তেনারা যদি লক্ষ লোক নিয়ে হাসিনার গুনাহভবনের দিকে এগিয়ে যেতেন হাসিনা অনেক আগেইতো পড়ে যেত। হয়তো কিছু লোক মারা যেত। তেনাদের নয়াপলটন বা আরামবাগে সীমাবদ্ধ আন্দোলন ছিল লোকদেখানো। আন্দোলন সংগ্রাম করেছেন ছাত্র জনতা আর দুই GOP। তেনাদের নেতৃত্ব ছুটে যাবে এই আশংকায় ও আপোষকামীতার কারনে তেনারা লক্ষ লোক নিয়ে ঘরে বসেছিলেন। তেনারা তেমন শক্ত করে ডাকও দেননি ঝাঁপিয়েও পড়েননি। দায়সারা গোছের ডাক। ভারতিয় সৈন্যরা যেমন ১৯৭১-এ একদম শেষের দিকে যোগ দিয়েছেন বিনপিও ছাত্র জনতার আন্দোলনে একদম শেষের দিকে কিছুটা হয়তো ছুটে গিয়েছেন। যদি তেনারা জুলাই ১৫ থেকে ইনিয়ে বিনিয়ে যোগ দেয়ার কথা না বলে সমস্ত শক্তি দিয়ে ঝাঁপিয়ে পড়তেন তাহলে হাজার লোকের প্রানহানি হতনা হাজার লোকের অঙ্গহানি হতোনা। কাজটা করলেন ছাত্রজনতা ও GOP উভয় গ্রুপ আর কৃতিত্ব নিতে চাচ্ছেন BNP-র তেনারা। তড়িঘড়ি করে নির্বাচন করে ক্ষমতায় এসে ফাযদা লুটতে চাচ্ছেন। আমরা চাই বর্তমান ইউনুস সরকার অনেক দিন শাসন করুক এবং সব সংস্কার শেষ করুক এবং দেশকে RAW BAL মুক্ত করুক। জুলাই আগস্ট বিপ্লব শুধু তথাকথিত সংখ্যাগরিষ্ঠতার জোরে বিএনপির মত অথর্ব অয়োগ্য ভুয়া ভাঁওতাবাজ অকর্মক দলকে ক্ষমতায় আনার জন্য হয়নি। আমরা BAL-এর মতো BNP-র ও tyranny of the majority চাইনা অথবা দুই পার্টি মিলে মিশে সন্ত্রাস চুরি বাটপারি করে যাবে সেটাও চাইনা। আওয়ামী বালকেতো নিষিদ্ধিই করতে হবে। দেশে ইসলামী মনোভাবসম্পন্ন দেশপ্রেমিক অনেক পার্টি আছে। সবার ক্ষমতার অংশীদার হয়ে দেশের উন্নয়নে অবদান রাখুক সেটাই চাই। আবার হাসিনার গুনাহভবনের মতো কুখ্যাত হাওয়া ভবনের সাথে যারা জড়িত ছিল অথবা তাদের মতো অসাধু এবং অনুপযুক্ত বা আওয়ামী যুক্ত যারা লন্ডনে তারেক রহমান সাহেবকে ১৫ বছর ধরে ঘিরে আছেন এমন লোকদের উত্থান বা পূণর্বাসন চাইনা (শুধু এম এ মালেক একটু ব্যতিক্রম হতে পারেন)। অথচ তিনি তাদের সঙ্গ ছাড়ছেননা যেমন তিনি ঢাকা থেকে শুরু করে লন্ডন পর্যন্ত RAW Mathur-কেও ছাড়েননি। । ১৫ বছর ধরে তিনি লন্ডনে কোন উচ্চ শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের দোরগোড়ায়ও যাননি। দুঃখের বিষয় উনার শিক্ষাগত যোগ্যতা ছোটবেলা থেকেই প্রশ্নবিদ্ধ। Enlightened intellectual Azam Mahmud is correct to say that 'মূলত বিএনপি এবং আওয়ামী লীগের ভিতরে তেমন কোন পার্থক্য নাই। দুটোরই বেশিরভাগ বড়-ছোট নেতা সমানভাবে পরিত্যাজ্য। এবং এই অতি ঘৃণ্য এবং অতি নিকৃষ্ট মহিলাকে বাদ দিলে তারা আসলে একই। পরস্পরের প্রতি সত্যিকারের সম্মানবোধ তাদের খুব একটা কখনোই ছিলো না। আর এই মহিলা যখন তার অন্তর ভরা বিষ এবং বিদ্বেষ নিয়ে সামনে আসলো, রাজনীতিবিদদের স্বভাবজাত সম্মান বোধের ঘাটতির কারণে তখন তার দলের অন্যেরাও (নিজস্ব স্বার্থ রক্ষার খাতিরেই) তার সাথে তাল মিলালো। ফলে একটা ভয়াবহ এবং অতি জঘন্য পরিবেশ এবং পরিস্থিতির উদ্ভব হলো। তার অবর্তমানে বিদ্বেষ টুকু যদি কেটে যায়, তারা আগে যেমন *খারাপ ভাবে* চলছিল তেমনি চলতে থাকবে।' People of Bangladesh think that the BNP’s appeasement of the BAL and India is tantamount to national treachery. That’s the view subscribed to by A K Delwar Hussain (identified above), who states that 'At the same time, BNP has played a foul sinister game along with the Awami Bha-RAT-io League in the past 16 years!!! BNP is the very reason by which the BAL perpetrated its ruthless mafia regime over Bangladesh. ‘চোরে চোরে হালি/এক চোরে বিয়া করে/আরেক চোরের শালি’. In hindsight, since Hasina's vacation to her BhaRAT, the role of the BNP has surfaced clearly, particularly through Mirza Fakhrul (whom Donald Trump, J D Vance and Elon Musk would have targeted as ‘fool’ and ‘trash’ and perhaps belittled as Mirza-Far Fake-Rule), Mirza Abbas (same as Fakhrul), Habibur Rahman Ya Habibi, Ya Rumman Farhana and others.' It’s the same view subscribed to by the veteran and highly knowledgeable Bangladeshi-British online activist and campaigner Zoglul Husain, who has this to say: 'স্বাধীনতা ও অর্থনৈতিক মুক্তির জন্য আজ আমাদের জাতীয় করনীয় হচ্ছে, ফ্যাসিবাদ ও আধিপত্যবাদকে সম্পূর্ণ পরাভূত করা এবং একটি দেশপ্রেমিক ও গণতান্ত্রিক সরকার প্রতিষ্ঠা করা। বর্তমান বিএনপি সহ যে সব দল ভারতীয় আধিপত্যবাদ ও আওয়ামী ফ্যাসিবাদের কাছে নতজানু রয়েছে, এবং ভারত ও আওয়ামী লীগকে তোষণ করে চলেছে, তাদের উচিত আত্মশুদ্ধি করা এবং ফ্যাসিবাদ ও আধিপত্যবাদের বিরুদ্ধে দৃঢ় অবস্থান নেওয়া, তা নাহলে তারা জাতীয় বিশ্বাসঘাতকতার ভূমিকাতে অবস্থান নেবে।' He takes the opportunity of the BNP’s 7 November observation this year (2024) to criticize the party’s ungrateful forgetfulness towards the 15 August heroes asking the Interim Government to withdraw all unjust lawsuits against them and allow them to walk free --- আজ, ৮ নভেম্বর ২০২৪, ঢাকার নয়াপল্টনে বিশাল মিছিল ও র‍্যালি করে বিকাল ৩ টা থেকে বিএনপি, ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ এর স্মরণে, বিপ্লব ও সংহতি দিবস উদযাপন করছে। কিন্তু, লক্ষ্য করার বিষয়, সেখানে ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ এর গৌরবময় সেনা-জনতার অভ্যুত্থান সম্বন্ধে কোন উচ্চবাচ্চ্য নেই। বলা বাহুল্য, ১৯৭৫ এর ১৫ আগস্ট, ৩ নভেম্বর ও ৭ নভেম্বর এক সূত্রে গাঁথা, ১৫ আগস্টের অভ্যুত্থান ৭ নভেম্বরে সম্পন্ন হয়। কাজেই, ১৫ আগস্টের গৌরবজনক অভ্যুত্থানের কথা ভুলে গিয়ে ৭ নভেম্বর উদযাপনে রয়েছে বিশাল ঘাটতি ও অসংগতি। এর কারণ বিএনপির অনেক বড় বড় নেতা আছেন যারা এখনও মুজিবভক্ত। অথচ মুজিব ছিলেন একজন ফ্যাসিবাদী জাতীয় বেঈমান, যিনি কখনো স্বাধীনতা চান নি, কিন্তু ক্ষমতায় এসেই যিনি ভারতের সঙ্গে মৈত্রী ও বন্ধুত্ব নামক ২৫ বছরের গোলামী চুক্তি করেছিলেন, ভারতের তৈরি রক্ষী বাহিনী দিয়ে ৩০ থেকে ৫০ হাজার দেশপ্রেমিক হত্যা করেছিলেন, সীমাহীন দুর্নীতি ও সীমান্ত পাচারের মাধ্যমে মানবসৃষ্ট দুর্ভিক্ষ সৃষ্টি করেছিলেন যাতে মৃত্যু হয় ১৫ লক্ষ মানুষের, যিনি বাকশাল সৃষ্টি করে গণতন্ত্র ধ্বংস করেছিলেন এবং যিনি জনগণের উপর হত্যা, নির্যাতন, নিপীড়নের স্টিমরোলার চালিয়ে জনগণের জীবন দুর্বিষহ করেছিলেন, আওয়ামী-ভারতীয় সীমাহীন লুণ্ঠনে দেশটিকে ঝাঁঝরা করেছিলেন এবং ভারতের কাছে স্বাধীনতা-সার্বভৌমত্ব বিকিয়ে দিয়ে বাংলাদেশকে ভারতের অধীন করেছিলেন, দেশকে ধ্বংসের অতল গহ্বরে ঠেলে দিয়েছিলেন। তখন দেশকে রক্ষা করেছিল ১৫ আগস্ট ও ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ এর গৌরবময় সেনা-জনতার অভ্যুত্থান। ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ এর বিষয়ে সেই সব বিএনপি নেতা চুপ থাকেন যারা মুজিবের প্রতি নতশির এবং ভারত ও আওয়ামী লীগের প্রতি নতজানু। তারা ভুলে যান ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ না হলে জেনারেল জিয়াউর রহমানের উত্থান হত না বিএনপিও গঠিত হত না, এবং জামায়াতে ইসলামী দলও বাংলাদেশে রাজনীতি করতে পারতনা। ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ এর গৌরবময় সেনা-জনতার অভ্যুত্থান যারা করেছিলেন তারা সকলেই সূর্য সন্তান, জাতীয় বীর। কিন্তু সাড়ে তিন যুগ পর ফ্যাসিবাদী জাতীয় বেঈমান, মুজিব কন্যা শেখ হাসিনা প্রতিহিংসার বশবর্তী হয়ে একটি প্রহসনের বিচার ঘটিয়ে এই জাতীয় বীরদের ৬ জনকে ফাঁসিতে ঝুলান, এরা সকলেই শহীদ। এছাড়াও অনেকে আছেন যাদের বিরুদ্ধে ফাঁসী অথবা জেলের রায় বলবৎ থাকায় তারা দেশে ফিরতে পারছেন না। আমরা আজ ৫ আগস্ট ২০২৪ এর গৌরবজনক ছাত্র-জনতা-সেনা অভ্যুত্থানের সকল শহীদদের যেমন শ্রদ্ধার সঙ্গে স্মরণ করি, তেমনি শ্রদ্ধার সঙ্গে স্মরণ করি ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ থেকে ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ এর শহীদদের, ১৯৫২ র ভাষা শহীদদের, এবং স্বাধীনতা যুদ্ধসহ অন্যান্য সংগ্রামের শহীদদের। আমরা অন্তর্বর্তী সরকারের কাছে আবেদন জানাচ্ছি যে, ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ থেকে ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ পর্যন্ত গৌরবময় সংগ্রামে দেশের পক্ষে অবস্থান নেওয়া যেসব বীরগণ, হাসিনার মিথ্যা আদালতের ফাঁসি অথবা জেলের আদেশের কারণে দেশে আসতে পারছেন না, তাদের উপর থেকে ঐসব মিথ্যা আদালতের মিথ্যা আদেশ প্রত্যাহার করা হোক। ১৫ আগস্ট ১৯৭৫ থেকে ৭ নভেম্বর ১৯৭৫ পর্যন্ত গৌরবময় সংগ্রামে দেশের পক্ষে অংশ নেওয়া সকল বীরগণকে জাতীয় বীরের মর্যাদা প্রদান করা হোক। Similarly, the following views of the decorated FF, former diplomat and author of dozens of books and articles, (Ret) Col Rashed Chowdhury also amount to the same line of argument. He comments: এটা বড়োই পরিতাপের বিষয় যে জেনারেল জিয়াউর রহমানের সৃষ্ট বিএনপির বর্তমান নেতৃবৃন্দ ১৫ই আগস্টের ঐতিহাসিক অবদানকে অগ্রাহ্য বা অস্বীকার করছে। ১৫ই অগাস্ট না হলে জিয়াউর রহমানের উত্তান ঘটতোনা, বিএনপিরও জন্ম হতোনা। অর্থাৎ, জেনারেল জিয়াউর রহমান, বিএনপি, বেগম জিয়া, তারেক রহমান এবং বিএনপির পূর্বাপর নেতৃশ্রেণী ১৫ ই আগস্টের ফসল। তাই ১৫ আগস্টকে অগ্রাহ্য করা মানে নিজ পিতৃত্বকে অস্বীকার করা, জারজ হিসাবে পরিচয় দেয়া। এই ঐতিহাসিক গরমিল ও ন্যাক্কারজনক পরিস্থিতি থেকে বিএনপিকে বেরিয়ে আসতে হবে এবং ঐতিহাসিক সত্যকে স্বীকার করে দেশ ও জাতিকে শুধু আস্বস্তই করতে হবে না, তাদেরকে মুক্তি দিতে হবে। নতুবা তারা দলটিকে কোনোদিন ক্ষমা করবে না। Col Chowdhury goes on commenting What is extremely unfortunate is that the present leadership of the BNP, locally headed by Mirza Fakhrul is making the life of the Interim Government (IG) difficult by continuously giving various threats and asking for a quick election. The whole nation agrees that there should not be election before necessary reforms, but Mirza wants to do the reform themselves. No way. All his threats are mostly in favor of rehabilitating the fascist Hasina regime and its disgraced Awami League. Looks like he didn't have enough of Hasina's fascism in the past 16 years and likes to bring them back to continue the same with perhaps more or increased intensity. Zia's assassination, KZ's suffering under Hasina mean nothing to him. খাল কেটে কুমির আনতে মরিয়া হয়ে উঠেছে। It's a sheer betrayal of not only the ideals of Ziaur Rahman's BNP but also the betrayal to the nation. But I believe the party's grassroots are still strong and are still following the original values enshrined by its founder. As such, I think the BNP grassroots should revolt and reject these pro-Awami, pro-Indian leadership. The BNP must return to Zia's BNP. And, let the IG continue working on its agenda of untangling the knots created by the fascists. I would say, the BNP of today was not so in Zia’s time.Mirza Fakhrul, by extension, maybe TR too, is displaying his pro-Awami, pro-Indian attitude more openly. To me, he is becoming a nuisance, to the extent of being an outright villain against the IG. Today he issued a warning that nothing can be done by the government by sidestepping the BNP. This is an outright rebellion. I think the IG should not ignore such villainous utterances from MF. He could be arrested for such a challenge to the running of the government. The IG and students-people should watch out. Whatever, such hostile challenges should not stop or slow down the necessary reforms that include the removal of Chuppu and impose a moratorium, if not total ban, on the Awami League. Also, I am not unaware of what Mirza Fakhrul has gone through over the years, most of which, according to me, were his/BNP’s own doing and their half-hearted opposition to the Hasina regime, some say India/Awami scripted. Mirza Fakhrul’s Mujib-Hasina-Chuppu-India pleasing attitude now gives credence to that. On the other hand, many of us have been screaming for years for the BNP to form a national unity with all parties, particularly the Jamaat, and create a tsunami to oust the fascists, but the Mirzas failed or did not heed. Now when the students-people did the same and succeeded, the Mirzas are out to grab the pie, to the extent of opposing the students-people and their IG. How can one exonerate this villainous attitude? 'Nothing can be done without BNP' is a thuggish statement. Common BNP members and members of other parties also died in the July/August movement but not a single top leader. They were in their Mujrakhana. That’s why I always say, problem is with the leadership, not with the grassroots, which is still strong and dedicated. It is not the question of election any time soon. The IG is already working on a roadmap. Putting undue pressure is counterproductive. There should be no election without the needed reforms, whatever time it takes. Such criticism of the BNP is in tons in Bangladesh itself as well as abroad. Criticism of patriots abroad cannot be overlooked. In today’s infotech, the diaspora is current with minute-by-minute details or developments back home. They know who is worth what and who sings whose songs. The contribution of Bangladeshi diaspora in the victory of August 5 is no less. And they do have a right to think about the good of the country. Enchanted by Mirza Fakhrul’s pro-Awami stances, Hasan Mahmud, foreign minister of the fallen Hasina regime, wanted to work with the BNP to establish democracy in Bangladesh. Hah-ha, is the sun rising from the west! First, Awami League’s desire to work for democracy in Bangladesh is as weird and ridiculous as a tiger asking a deer cub for peaceful cohabitation after devouring its parents. Second, this demonstrates how dangerous Mirza Fakhrul is turning the Bangladesh’s post-August 5 politics into the Awami hands. I think the IG, the students-people and the people at large must guard against such dubious characters who want to খাল কেটে কুমির আনতে। People must decide if Bangladesh can be safe in the hands of such dangerous leaders. The hard-earned victory of August 5 cannot be allowed to be hijacked or destroyed by rehabilitating the fallen fascists. Let me clarify. When I am talking about the dubious role of Mirza Fakhrul, I am not talking about the glorious BNP founded and nourished by Ziaur Rahman the Great. A highly intellectual-minded and well-educated business owner Bangladeshi-Canadian Shamim Iqbal Rony finds Bangladeshi-Belgian BAL Hasan Mahmud’s expression of interest to work with the BNP towards the establishment of democracy in Bangladesh deeply disturbing and disgusting. It is out of utter frustration that he says that 'Bangladesh is a bastard child of India and is like Palestine actually. We are basically owned by them and BAL is their slave manager. I don’t have much hope for this county, to be honest, as our people are the problem. We are happy to be slaves and have a memory of a goldfish.' To continue with Col Chowdhury finding the BNP’s post-5 August role highly unacceptable, মনে হচ্ছে বিএনপির বর্তমান নেতৃবৃন্দ, বিশেষ করে মির্জা ফখরুল, প্রফেসর ইউনূসের নেতৃত্বে গঠিত এবং পরিচালিত অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের প্রতিপক্ষ হিসাবে অবতীর্ণ হয়েছেন। ছাত্র জনতার বিরুদ্ধে জনগণকে বিষিয়ে তোলার চেষ্টা করছেন। দেশের বৃহত্তম দল হিসাবে দেশ পরিচালনার দায়িত্ব নিতে চেষ্টা করছেন। কতেকটা বিশ্বাসঘাতক মুজিব কাহিনির পুনরাবৃত্তি । স্বাধীন বাংলাদেশ না চেয়ে, স্বাধীনতার ঘোষণা দিতে অস্বীকার করে এবং মুক্তিযুদ্ধ থেকে পালানো মুজিব নয় মাস জল্লাদ ইয়াহিয়ার মেহমান খানা থেকে ফিরে এসে বনে গেলেন জাতির পিতা। জাতির কর্ণধার । ৪৪ মাসে দিলেন দেশটাকে বরবাদ করে, বারোটা বাজিয়ে। বিএনপির মির্জারা এখন তারই পায়তারা করছে। (মুজিব হাসিনা) বাপ বেটি যেমন ভারতের কথামত চলে দেশটাকে ভারতের করদ রাজ্য বানিয়েছিল, মির্জারাও সম্ভবত গোপনে তাই করছে। ৫ ই আগস্ট হাসিনা মুজিবের পতনে তার কান্না, হাসিনার বিচার না চাওয়া (বলেছেন তিনি হাসিনার মৃত্যু চান না, অর্থাৎ সহিসালামত চান), এসব কিসের আলামত? গণতন্ত্র বিকাশের দোহাই দিয়ে স্বৈরাচারী আওয়ামী লীগকে পুনপ্রতিঠার চেষ্টা চালাচ্ছে। চুপ্পুকে বিদায় নিতে বাধা দিচ্ছে। গতকাল প্রয়াত সাদেক হোসেন খোকার অনুষ্ঠানে ঔদ্ধ্যাত্বপূর্ণ বক্তৃতা দিয়ে বলেছেন, মাইনাস ফর্মুলা চলবেনা। বিএনপিকে কিছুতেই বাদ দেয়া চলবেনা। এটা দস্তুরমত সরকারকে হুমকি। এ যেন মুজিবের ‘কোথায় সিরাজ সিকদার, লাল ঘোড়া দাবড়াইয়া দিমুর’মতো ঔদ্ধ্যাত্ব। মির্জাই যেন দেশের প্রকৃত শাসক বা শাসনের হকদার। আমার মতে মির্জাদের এসব কর্মকাণ্ডের জন্য আইনী ব্যবস্থা নেয়া অতীব প্রয়োজনীয়। নতুবা ৫ d ই আগস্টের বিজয় নস্যাৎ হয়ে যাবে অতি শীঘ্রই। স্মরণ রাখবেন মুজিবও অনেকবার স্বেচ্ছায় বা নিজ অপকর্মের জন্য জেলে গিয়েছেন। অথচ স্বাধীন বাংলাদেশে তার অপকর্মের জবাব দেশের সিপাহী জনতা দিয়েছে ১৫ ই আগস্ট। পরিশেষে বলি, মির্জারা সাবধান। এবং ছাত্র জনতা এদেরকে চিনতে ভুল করবেন না। Texas-based Senior Engineer Aftab Sheikh (unlike the terrible Tungipara and #32 Sheikhs, some patriotic and sensible Sheikhs still roam the earth!) has this to say: আমার মনে হয় বিএনপি ৫ই আগস্টের চেতনা ধারনে Confidence হারিয়েছে। তার পেছনে বড় কারন হচ্ছে জামায়াতের মত চরিত্রবান, সুশৃংখল, আদর্শিকভাবে সুশিক্ষিত এবং সাংগঠনিক নীতির আনুগত্যকারী নেতা ও কর্মীবাহিনী গড়তে পারেনি । ৫ই আগস্টের পরে দলীয় শৃংখলা ভংগের কারনে বহু নেতাকে বহিস্কারাদেশ সহ শোকজ করতে হয়েছে। তাদের অনেকেই আওয়ামী স্টাইলে লুটপাটের ঘটনাও ঘটিয়েছে। এসব আচরন কেন্দ্রীয় বিএনপির পক্ষে কন্ট্রোল করা দুস্কর হয়ে পড়েছে। এসব থেকে সহজেই আন্দাজ করা যায় যে ক্ষমতায় গেলে কিভাবে বিএনপি এদের ঠেকাবে? অন্যদিকে, ফ্যাসীবাদ উৎখাতে সব দলের ও ছাত্র-জনতার অংশগ্রহন থাকলেও অত্যন্ত কৌশলী ও রিসকী এই আন্দোলেনের মুল নীল নকসা যে জামায়াত ও শিবির নেতারা এঁকেছিল তা দিবালোকের ন্যায় পরিস্কার হওয়ার পর বিএনপি হীনমন্যতায় ভুগছে। যদিও জামায়াত ও শিবির নেতারা এই সফলতার একচ্ছত্র দাবীদার তা ভুলেও করেনি। জামায়াত-এর এই উদারতার কারনে দিন দিন এক ঈর্ষনীয় ও অপ্রতিরোধ্য জনপ্রিয়তা (যেমন পিনাকীর ২ মিলিয়নের বেশী ফলোয়ারদের মধ্যে যে জরীপ তাতে জামায়াত ৫৪% এবং বিএনপি ২০%) আমজনতার মাঝে স্পষ্ট লক্ষনীয়। এতে বিএনপির এই হীনমন্যতা, হিংসা বা ঈর্ষা আরো প্রকট হচ্ছে। তারপর থেকেই লক্ষ্য করা যাচ্ছে বিএনপির নতুন রুপ। আর কেউ ক্ষমতায় গেলেও জামায়াত ক্ষমতায় যাক -- এটা তারা মেনে নিতে পারছেনা। সুতরাং আওয়ামী -- বিএনপি মিলে জামায়াত ঠেকাও আন্দোলন গড়ার ভবিষৎ চিন্তা থেকেই এমন একটি পোলারাইজেশন এর দিকে বিএনপি ধীরে ধীরে অগ্রসর হচ্ছে বলে মনে করার যথেষ্ট কারন রয়েছে। অন্যদিকে, বিএনপির এহেন আচরন জামায়াতকে আরো বেশী জনপ্রিয় করে তুলছে । Gen Z-এর চরিত্র বুঝতে বিএনপির বুডো ও মিশ্র আদর্শের (এক সময় বাম রাজনীতি করেছেন বা অন্যদল করছেন) ধ্বজাধারী নেতারা একেবারেই অক্ষমতার প্রমান দিচ্ছেন । যেমন, মীর্জা ফখরুল যিনি ছাত্র ইউনিয়নের নেতা ছিলেন, বলেছিলেন জামায়াতকে উদদ্যেশ্য করে ‘মৌলবাদী’ যা বাম ও লীগের বয়ানের নির্যাস । মীর্জা আববাস, সালাহউদদীনও এমন মন্তব্য করেছেন। রিজভী একা কুলিয়ে উঠতে না পেরে তিনিও সাথে তাল দিয়ে চলেছেন। এসব খুবই অনভিপ্রেত ছিল। আমার মতে ফখরুল ও আব্বাস এর মত অদুরদর্শী নেতারা বিএনপির হাল ধরে থাকলে কোনদিনই বাংলাদেশের মানুষ জুলাই-আগস্টের চেতনার ফল ভোগ করতে পারবে না। বাংলাদেশ যে তিমিরে ছিল সেখানেই বার বার ঘুরে ফিরে আসবে। আমার ধারনা ভুল হোক, বাংলাদেশ ঘুড়ে দাঁড়াক সেটাই কাম্য। ১৯৭৫ সালে আওয়ামী লীগকে এবং ছাত্রলীগকে শেখ মুজিব নিজ হাতে কবর দিয়ে গেছেন। সেই সংগঠন আর নাই । যেটা আছে সেটা জংগী ও মাফিয়া সংগঠন। অনুরুপভাবে, শহীদ জিয়ার ইনতেকালে মুলত বিএনপি জিয়ার আদর্শ থেকে বিচ্যুত হয়ে গেছে। শুনেছিলাম তিনি দলের নেতা কর্মীদের রাজনৈতিক প্রশিক্ষন দেয়ার মত একটা বিভাগ খুলতে চেয়েছিলেন । কিনতু সে সময় তিনি পাননি। কোন দলের নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে দলের লক্ষ্য, আদর্শ ও মোটিভেশন এ ঐক্য না থাকে ঐ দল দিয়ে আর যাই হোক দেশ গড়ার কোন কাজ করা সম্ভব নয়। ফখরুল সাহেব নিজেই স্বীকার করেছেন জামায়াত ও শিবিরের নেতা কর্মীরা নিয়মিত পড়ালেখা করে সংগঠনের একটা আবশ্যক কাজ হিসেবে——-তিনি প্রশংসা করতে বাধ্য হয়েছেন। কিনতু তার নিজের দলের নেতা কর্মীরা পড়াশোনা করে না সেটাও অকপটে স্বীকার করছেন। এই পড়ালেখার ফল কি হয়েছে জানেন? জামায়াত এর কেন্দ্রীয় আমীর থেকে শুরু করে কর্মী এমনকি সক্রিয় সমর্থক পর্যন্ত সবার মধ্যে চিন্তার ঐক্য আছে। যা একমাত্র কমিউনিস্ট পার্টী ছাড়া আর কোন দলে নেই। কেননা কমিউনিস্টদেরও বই পড়তে হয়। বিএনপি has lost their intrinsic values overtime. তাদের দলে শুদ্ধি অভিযান চালিয়ে জামায়াতের ফর্মুলায় শক্তিশালী জাতীয় সরকার গঠন করা ছাড়া দেশী বিদেশী সকল ষড়যন্ত্র মোকাবেলা করা দুরহ হয়ে পড়বে যে কোন এক দলের পক্ষে। কাজেই সময় থাকতে বিএনপি হাই কমান্ডের উচিত বিভেদ নয় বরং দেশের সার্থে লোভ লালসা ভুলে আপনারা ঐক্যবদ্ধ হোন । কাদা ছোড়াছুড়ি বন্ধ করুন। তাহলেই জংগী ও মাফিয়া আওয়ামী লীগ গং আর কখনই মাথা চারা দিয়ে উঠতে পারবেনা, ইনশাআললাহ। All the above views are the voice of reason, voice of logic, voice of Bangladesh. Like the kaleidoscopic বিশ্ব বেহায়া H M Ershad, pretty much RAW-Indian-looking BNP under its treacherous, incompetent and hypocritical Dhaka-London leadership has been shamelessly compromising its position towards the deeply and directly Indian-looking Hasina BAL, which has become an ‘Alias’ of a possible Indian Awami League for decades. It is as if the BNP hasn’t gotten enough lessons from হাসিনা ওরফে হিন্দুস্তান and her last 16 years of terror and torture. Was it all a prearranged drama staged for a shifting/rotating duty through RAW Mathur India? Both the BNP and the BAL have become indistinguishably synonymous with each other in their respective pro-Indian, anti-Muslim, anti-Islam, anti-Jamaat, anti-patriotic and anti-nationalist thuggish ruffian-type savage ‘gunday’ stance. It’s said that when the late Cuban President Castro was asked about the 1960 US elections between Nixon and Kennedy, his reply was that 'It is not possible to compare the two shoes worn by the same person. America is governed by only one party, which is the Zionist Party, and it has two wings: the Republican wing represents the hard-line Zionist power, and the Democratic wing represents the soft Zionist power.' The same is applicable to the BAL and the BNP, the former representing the hardcore Hindustani hegemony and the latter representing softcore. Is it that there are no differences in the so-called ‘goals and strategies’ of the BAL and the BNP, except that their ‘means and tools’ are to differ slightly to give each other some space to maneuver their respective dirty and devilish aims and intentions through in their own ways? Shouldn’t the BNP refrain and be prevented from becoming an Awami BNP (ABNP)? Or, Basically No Party (BNP)? Or, ⁠Basically Nasty Party (BNP)? Or, Basically Nuisance Party (BNP)?Or, Bangladesh Beiman Party (BNP)? To rephrase, summarize and versify the above: কে আছ জোয়ান হও আগুয়ান ধর জিয়া-খালেদা বিএনপির হাল । লন্ডন-ঢাকা বিএনপি যে হয়ে গেল হাসিনা আর তার বাল। জেনেভা বিমান বন্দরে ড আসিফ নজরুলের উপর আওয়ামি হামলা-হেনস্তার ঘটনায় লক্ষ কোটি বারের মতো আবারো প্রমানিত হল টুংগি হাসিনা বাল কি মাল। আর বিএনপি নির্লজ্জ বেহায়ার মত তাদের সাথে আবার সতীনের ঘর করার আগ্রহ প্রকাশ করছে। However, BNP may like to take a look at the reading of the pulse of the people of Bangladesh, which is as follows: — 1. No Hasina, No Parliament, No Chuppu. The lame and loose and lax and tailored and retailored constitution is to be thrown out. 2. The Interim Government should adopt more revolutionary character with Dr Yunus assuming the Presidency with all executive powers. 3. General Wakeruzzanan, a great hero, should remove all elements suspected of being pro-Hasina BAL from the army and take his patriotic forces above all bad rumours of a coup attempt or counterrevolution, if any. 4. The BAL and all their activities need to be banned with all urgency.5. BNP under the current Dhaka-London leadership with their compromising Awami and Indian dalali remains incompetent, hypocritical, deceiving and untrustworthy. There should be a revolt against this leadership from within the party and a new patriotic and nationalist BNP should emerge.6. TR needs to be challenged as a hypocritical, cowardly and compromising pro-Indian and pro-BAL agent playing a conman drifting away from the ideals of the great and glorious President Zia and Prime Minister Begum Zia. He and the rest of the top BNP leaders should be politically castrated and castigated. He should be vilified as a parricide, patricide and matricide. 7. People don’t want any Awami BAL BNP. They don’t want any treacherous Bangladesh Beiman Party (BNP) in alliance with the RAW India BAL and the secularist leftists, all against Islam and Muslims. Any RAW India BAL-BNP cohabitation as two co-wives of India must be prevented.8. The new revolutionary interim government (RIG) should stay in power for at least 5 years to complete all the necessary reforms inclined and oriented towards the religious faith of the vast majority. No election in 5 years! 9. A due national recognition of President Ziaur Rahman, 15 August heroes, President Khandoker Mushtaq Ahmed, 7 November and 5 August heroes is needed. 10. The name of Sheikh Mujib (who was a national villain, national traitor, national betrayer) should be dropped from the list of true national heroes consisting of H S Suhrawardy, Sher-e-Bangla, Moulana Bhasani, Gen MAG Osmani and Gen Ziaur Rahman. 11. A new Chatro Janata party should be formed under whatever name. 12. An alliance of that new party + the new BNP+Jamaat + GOP both groups + Chor Monai Islami Andolon + Hefazat+Islami Oikkyojote+LDP+AB Party = Allahu Akbar Bangladesh ZindabadIf the TR-Fakhrul BNP soaked and submerged in RAW India is about to forget all the tons and trucks of torture they suffered in the hands of Hasina (looks like they suffered intentionally as part of a prearranged scam or scheme) and is now willing to compromise and work together with Hasina BAL who are more directly and deeply RAW India, who is more নির্লজ্জ বিশ্ববেহায়া—Ershad-GM Qader or TR-Fakhrul BNP? If that is true, let’s say (out of frustration though) that JP deserves to survive and this TR-Fakhrul BNP deserves to be dissipated, dissolved and extinct, while a truly patriotic and nationalist new BNP should arise in the footsteps of Zia and Khaleda. 1.

Asteroid Grains Shed Light On The Outer Solar System’s Origins	Tiny grains from a distant asteroid are revealing clues to the magnetic forces that shaped the far reaches of the solar system over 4.6 billion years ago. Scientists at MIT and elsewhere have analyzed particles of the asteroid Ryugu, which were collected by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Hayabusa2 mission and brought back to Earth in 2020. Scientists believe Ryugu formed on the outskirts of the early solar system before migrating in toward the asteroid belt, eventually settling into an orbit between Earth and Mars. The team analyzed Ryugu’s particles for signs of any ancient magnetic field that might have been present when the asteroid first took shape. Their results suggest that if there was a magnetic field, it would have been very weak. At most, such a field would have been about 15 microtesla. (The Earth’s own magnetic field today is around 50 microtesla.) Even so, the scientists estimate that such a low-grade field intensity would have been enough to pull together primordial gas and dust to form the outer solar system’s asteroids and potentially play a role in giant planet formation, from Jupiter to Neptune. The team’s results, which are published in the journal AGU Advances, show for the first time that the distal solar system likely harbored a weak magnetic field. Scientists have known that a magnetic field shaped the inner solar system, where Earth and the terrestrial planets were formed. But it was unclear whether such a magnetic influence extended into more remote regions, until now. 'We’re showing that, everywhere we look now, there was some sort of magnetic field that was responsible for bringing mass to where the sun and planets were forming,' says study author Benjamin Weiss, the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT. 'That now applies to the outer solar system planets.' The study’s lead author is Elias Mansbach PhD ’24, who is now a postdoc at Cambridge University. MIT co-authors include Eduardo Lima, Saverio Cambioni, and Jodie Ream, along with Michael Sowell and Joseph Kirschvink of Caltech, Roger Fu of Harvard University, Xue-Ning Bai of Tsinghua University, Chisato Anai and Atsuko Kobayashi of the Kochi Advanced Marine Core Research Institute, and Hironori Hidaka of Tokyo Institute of Technology. A far-off field Around 4.6 billion years ago, the solar system formed from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust, which collapsed into a swirling disk of matter. Most of this material gravitated toward the center of the disk to form the sun. The remaining bits formed a solar nebula of swirling, ionized gas. Scientists suspect that interactions between the newly formed sun and the ionized disk generated a magnetic field that threaded through the nebula, helping to drive accretion and pull matter inward to form the planets, asteroids, and moons. 'This nebular field disappeared around 3 to 4 million years after the solar system’s formation, and we are fascinated with how it played a role in early planetary formation,' Mansbach says. Scientists previously determined that a magnetic field was present throughout the inner solar system — a region that spanned from the sun to about 7 astronomical units (AU), out to where Jupiter is today. (One AU is the distance between the sun and the Earth.) The intensity of this inner nebular field was somewhere between 50 to 200 microtesla, and it likely influenced the formation of the inner terrestrial planets. Such estimates of the early magnetic field are based on meteorites that landed on Earth and are thought to have originated in the inner nebula. 'But how far this magnetic field extended, and what role it played in more distal regions, is still uncertain because there haven’t been many samples that could tell us about the outer solar system,' Mansbach says. Rewinding the tape The team got an opportunity to analyze samples from the outer solar system with Ryugu, an asteroid that is thought to have formed in the early outer solar system, beyond 7 AU, and was eventually brought into orbit near the Earth. In December 2020, JAXA’s Hayabusa 2 mission returned samples of the asteroid to Earth, giving scientists a first look at a potential relic of the early distal solar system. The researchers acquired several grains of the returned samples, each about a millimeter in size. They placed the particles in a magnetometer — an instrument in Weiss’ lab that measures the strength and direction of a sample’s magnetization. They then applied an alternating magnetic field to progressively demagnetize each sample. 'Like a tape recorder, we are slowly rewinding the sample’s magnetic record,' Mansbach explains. 'We then look for consistent trends that tell us if it formed in a magnetic field.' They determined that the samples held no clear sign of a preserved magnetic field. This suggests that either there was no nebular field present in the outer solar system where the asteroid first formed, or the field was so weak that it was not recorded in the asteroid’s grains. If the latter is the case, the team estimates such a weak field would have been no more than 15 microtesla in intensity. The researchers also reexamined data from previously studied meteorites. They specifically looked at 'ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites' — meteorites that have properties that are characteristic of having formed in the distal solar system. Scientists had estimated the samples were not old enough to have formed before the solar nebula disappeared. Any magnetic field record the samples contain, then, would not reflect the nebular field. But Mansbach and his colleagues decided to take a closer look. 'We reanalyzed the ages of these samples and found they are closer to the start of the solar system than previously thought,' Mansbach says. 'We think these samples formed in this distal, outer region. And one of these samples does actually have a positive field detection of about 5 microtesla, which is consistent with an upper limit of 15 microtesla.' This updated sample, combined with the new Ryugu particles, suggest that the outer solar system, beyond 7 AU, hosted a very weak magnetic field, that was nevertheless strong enough to pull matter in from the outskirts to eventually form the outer planetary bodies, from Jupiter to Neptune. 'When you’re further from the sun, a weak magnetic field goes a long way,' Weiss notes. 'It was predicted that it doesn’t need to be that strong out there, and that’s what we’re seeing.' The team plans to look for more evidence of distal nebular fields with samples from another far-off asteroid, Bennu, which were delivered to Earth in September 2023 by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. 'Bennu looks a lot like Ryugu, and we’re eagerly awaiting first results from those samples,' Mansbach says. This research was supported, in part, by NASA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTa6G2VThv7xZ	2024-11-09T16:34:08-08:00	
New Option For Treating Prostate Cancer	Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Despite medical advances in recent years, this type of tumour is still responsible for one in eight male cancer deaths in Austria alone. An international research team led by MedUni Vienna has now investigated a new strategy for the development of treatment options that not only slow tumour growth, but also stimulate the immune system to combat tumour cells. The results of the study have just been published in the top journal Molecular Cancer. The scientific team focused its investigations on the GP130 signalling pathway, which researchers expect to have a major potential in the fight against cancer. The background: the signalling pathway, which is mediated by the protein GP130, plays a central role in cell communication and influences the activity of the transcription factor STAT3, which in turn is associated with the development and spread of tumours. Accordingly, blocking the GP130 signalling pathway is currently seen as a great hope in cancer medicine. Yet the current study proves the opposite: tumour growth can be slowed down not by inhibiting but by activating the GP130 signalling pathway in prostate cells. New hope, especially for aggressive tumours To achieve these new findings, the researchers investigated genetically modified mice in which GP130 was specifically activated in the prostate. 'This allowed us to directly observe the reduction in tumour growth in the cell,' reports Lukas Kenner (Clinical Department of Pathology, MedUni Vienna), who led the study together with Stefan Rose-John (Biochemical Institute, University of Kiel). The results were further backed up by analyses of tissue samples from prostate cancer patients. This showed that high GP130 values correlate with a better survival rate. At the same time, extensive molecular analyses were carried out, including gene expression profiling. 'Our research provides exciting new evidence that the activation of GP130 in prostate cells not only slows tumour growth, but also stimulates the immune system to actively fight the cancer cells,' says Lukas Kenner, summarising the significance of the results, which will now be confirmed in further studies. The research work opens up a promising new therapeutic option, particularly for aggressive prostate cancer, which is still difficult to treat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTVsnRWG5shN0	2024-11-09T16:29:30-08:00	
Up To 30% Of The Power Used To Train AI Is Wasted: Here’s How To ...	A less wasteful way to train large language models, such as the GPT series, finishes in the same amount of time for up to 30% less energy, according to a new study from the University of Michigan. The approach could save enough energy to power 1.1 million U.S. homes in 2026, based on Wells Fargo's projections of AI power demand. It could also take a bite out of the International Monetary Fund's prediction that data centers could account for 1.2% of the world's carbon emissions by 2027—and the water demands that come with that energy use. Some experts say that these costs could be outweighed by environmental benefits. They argue that AI could be a 'game changer' for fighting climate change by identifying ways to optimize supply chains and the grid, manage our energy needs, and improve research on climate change. Still, that doesn't excuse squandering energy, and some of the power used to train AI has zero impact on training time and model accuracy. 'Why spend something when there's no point?' said Mosharaf Chowdhury, U-M associate professor of computer science and engineering and the corresponding author of the study presented at the 30th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles. 'We can't keep building bigger and bigger data centers because we won't have the power to run them. If we can reduce the energy consumed by AI, we can reduce AI's carbon footprint and cooling requirements and allow for more computation to fit within our current energy constraints.' The energy waste is created when AI training is unequally divided between GPUs, which are computer processors specialized for large data and graphics applications. Although it opens the door for waste, splitting the work is necessary for processing huge datasets. 'AI models today are so large, they cannot fit inside a single computer processor,' said Jae-Won Chung, U-M doctoral student in computer science and engineering and the first author of the study. 'They need to be divided into tens of thousands of processors to be trained, but dividing the models in perfectly equal sizes across all processors is practically impossible.' The training jobs are so difficult to evenly split up because some tasks need to be grouped together on the same processor—like how each installment of a book series will be grouped together in an organized shelf. Depending on how the tasks are grouped, some processors might get stuck with the AI-training equivalent of the Encyclopedia Britannica while others get assigned a fantasy trilogy. Because current training methods run each processor at top speed, processors with a lighter load will finish their calculations before other processors. This doesn't speed up training, which isn't complete until every processor finishes its job—but it is wasteful because faster calculations require more energy. In addition, problems such as faulty hardware or network delays create energy waste by slowing down a single processor's computing speed. To save energy, the researchers developed a software tool, called Perseus, that identifies a critical path, or a series of subtasks that will take the longest time to complete. Then, Perseus slows down processors that aren't on the critical path so that they all finish their jobs around the same time—eliminating unnecessary power use. 'Reducing the power cost of AI can have important implications for equitable AI access,' Chowdhury said. 'If a country doesn't have enough power to run a big model, they might need to use services from far away, or be stuck running smaller, less accurate models. This gap could further perpetuate disparity between different communities.' The team tested Perseus by training GPT-3, three other large language models and one computer vision model. Perseus is an open-sourced tool available as part of Zeus, a tool for measuring and optimizing AI energy consumption.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdSEEVEdzlYTXg-Bx2GVang	2024-11-09T16:26:03-08:00	
Free Trade Agreements Key To Asia’s Prosperity – Analysis	By Mohd Faiz Abdullah Asia’s ascent as the centre of global economic activity has been nothing short of profound. Even in the face of the trials and tribulations brought on by cycles of financial and health crises, Asia has withstood the test of time, emerging as the fastest growing continent. Asia’s economic rise has been inextricably linked to the forces of globalisation, particularly through the proliferation of free trade agreements (FTAs). These agreements have facilitated Asia’s integration into the global economy and shaped its regional dynamics, making Asia one of the most interconnected and economically vibrant regions in the world. From the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Asia’s FTA network has been a cornerstone of its development and a key contributing factor in maintaining ASEAN centrality. FTAs have been instrumental in driving Asia’s economic growth and prosperity by opening new markets, reducing trade barriers, fostering investment and innovation and, in some instances, accelerating domestic reforms. Countries like Japan, South Korea and China — all of whom are already in some form of free trade arrangement with ASEAN Member States — have leveraged these FTAs to expand their exports, fuelling growth and development. The export-oriented strategies of these nations, supported by FTAs, have lifted millions out of poverty and transformed the region into a global economic powerhouse. The ASEAN region’s economy grew by 5.7 per cent in 2022, maintaining an average annual growth rate of 4.4 per cent between 2010 and 2022. ASEAN’s nominal GDP per capita stood at US$5,395 in 2022, a notable increase of 37.6 per cent from 2015. With such strong economic fundamentals, the region has also become a focal point for global supply chains, with Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia emerging as key manufacturing hubs. The ASEAN Economic Community has promoted the free flow of goods, services and capital, enhancing the competitiveness of its member states. In addition, the ASEAN Agreement on Movement of Natural Persons has also facilitated the mobility of talentwithin the region. RCEP underscores Asia’s central role in global trade. By harmonising trade rules and reducing tariffs across 15 countries, RCEP has solidified Asia’s position as a critical node in the global economic network. The CPTPP, despite the withdrawal of the United States, remains a significant agreement that binds its members to high standards of trade and investment rules, further integrating Asian economies with the rest of the world. These FTAs are both economic tools and strategic instruments that reinforce ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture. Despite the benefits brought by FTAs, Asia now faces significant challenges as globalisation encounters harsh headwinds. The rise of protectionism, trade wars and the potential decoupling of major economies like the United States and China pose a threat to the very foundation of Asia’s economic success. Any move towards decoupling could have profound implications on Asian economies, particularly for countries heavily reliant on trade with China. If global powers attempt to isolate or decouple from China, the ripple effects would cascade across the region and disrupt supply chains in industries ranging from electronics in South Korea to automotive parts in Thailand. Such disruptions would cause economic losses and destabilise the political and security environment in Asia, where economic interdependence has been a key factor in maintaining peace and stability. Confronting these challenges head-on, ASEAN centrality has become the linchpin upholding and promoting globalisation, particularly through FTAs. ASEAN has been the bedrock of regional economic integration, acting as a platform for dialogue and cooperation among its member states and external partners. Through initiatives like the ASEAN Economic Community, FTAs with Dialogue Partners and RCEP, ASEAN has strategically positioned itself at the heart of Asia’s economic architecture. Still, for the region to continue to benefit from free trade, ASEAN must address persistent weaknesses in the ASEAN Economic Community, such as non-tariff barriers and varying regulatory standards. ASEAN’s commitment to the rules-based trading system, plurilateralism and inclusive growth is a powerful counterbalance to the growing trends of protectionism and unilateralism. By championing FTAs and regional integration, ASEAN can help mitigate the risks associated with decoupling and ensure that Asia continues to reap the benefits of globalisation. ASEAN’s approach to consensus-building and respect for sovereignty serves as a model for other regions facing similar challenges. Through its active participation in FTAs, Asia has secured a strategic edge in globalisation, with its economic prosperity and political stability thriving on open markets and interconnected economies. But with the rise of protectionism and the growing potential for decoupling, Asia stands at a crossroads. ASEAN centrality, supported by robust FTAs, is essential to safeguard Asia’s interests in this shifting global landscape. By continuing to promote regional integration and engage in strategic dialogues, ASEAN can ensure that Asia remains at the forefront of the global economy, navigating the challenges ahead with resilience and foresight.

Cuba’s Real Power Problem Is Socialism – OpEd	Millions of Cubans remain without power in the wake of Hurricane Oscar, but bad weather is not Cuba’s real problem. Its centrally planned socialist economy is the root cause of the blackout and most of its other problems. Cuba’s nationwide blackout began a few days before Oscar made landfall when the Antonio Guiteras power plant went offline. Seven of Cuba’s eight thermoelectric plants were offline for maintenance or otherwise not operational. The failure of the Guiteras plant left the country without a major power producer. Oscar made things worse for Cubans on the island’s east end and will likely delay power returning to that region. However, other areas unaffected by the storm faced blackouts. The Cuba Electrical Union announced that 216,000 people in Havana, a city of more than 2 million, had their power restored Sunday, October 20th, only to have that grid collapse later in the day for the fourth time since blackouts began. Hospitals, hotels, and other businesses have limited power from generators, but fuel is in short supply and will not keep the generators running much longer. Venezuela has provided subsidized fuel to Cuba for two decades, but its own economic crisis has limited how much it can help Cuba in recent years. Meanwhile, fuel from the United States remains unavailable due to the embargo. But the root causes of Cuba’s lack of energy are homegrown. Without private property, socialist economic systems cannot provide the information and incentives necessary to create prosperity. Prices convey information about what goods and services are most scarce in market economies. However, prices in socialist economies don’t convey that same information because they are dictated by central plans or distorted by artificial scarcities due to the planners’ import controls. When I was researching a recent book in Cuba, I thought that Cuba should have a game show called 'The Price Is Wrong.' The lack of property rights also means that the managers of the factors of production, such as power plants, don’t have the same incentive to maintain them as entrepreneurs in market economies do because state managers are not entitled to the profits generated by long-term maintenance. Under socialism, entrepreneurs have no incentive, or even the right, to outcompete inefficient state firms to better serve consumers. Socialist systems stagnate and fail to create prosperity because of their inherent nature. Plenty of fuel could be imported from countries other than the United States and Venezuela, but the Cuban economy doesn’t generate enough wealth to afford it. North Korea is the only country in the world that is more completely centrally planned than Cuba, and it is perpetually without power. Satellite images reveal that the entire country, except the capital, is without power at night, and only about half the population has electricity for more than four hours a day. Power is far from the only thing in short supply in socialist countries. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, beef and pork production is collapsing in Cuba. Starvation has been a recurring problem in North Korea ever since Soviet aid ended in 1991. North Koreans are not free to flee their economic woes, but Cubans are. As a result, more than 1 million Cubans, 10 percent of the population, emigrated in 2022 and 2023. Cubans took to the streets demanding greater freedom three years ago in protests sparked in partby power outages and food shortages. Despite President Miguel Diaz-Canel’s announcement that he will not tolerate protests, pro-freedom protests are exactly what Cuba needs again today. Until it scraps its centrally planned system and grants Cubans a large measure of economic freedom, Cuba’s economic and power problems will continue.

Congress Should Fire Jerome Powell – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken There were a few seemingly tense moments at the FOMC press conference on Thursday when two reporters asked Jerome Powell about the prospect of Donald Trump asking Powell to resign. The first reporter asked 'would you resign if asked to do so by Donald Trump?' To this, Powell responded with a resounding 'no' followed by silence. A few moments later, Powell was asked by another reporter if it was lawful for Trump to either remove or 'demote'—that is, remove Powell as chairman, but leave him on the Board of Governors—Powell. To this, Powell responded with a forceful 'not permitted under the law.' Apparently, Powell wished to leave no ambiguity whatsoever about this position that he cannot be removed or demoted by a sitting president. It would agree that the spirit of the law here is that a president not be able to remove a Fed chairman, except for some kind of misconduct. But, ambiguity remains. Even Alan Blinder, a proponent of the myth of 'Fed independence,' admits that in the world of political reality, Trump could potentially remove Powell: Experts who spoke to ABC News acknowledged that some legal ambiguity looms over what type of conduct warrants sufficient cause for removal, but they said a policy dispute is unlikely to meet such a standard. Still, Trump could attempt to push out Powell and test how courts interpret the law, experts added, noting that the case could end up with the conservative-majority Supreme Court. 'Trump could try and he might try,' Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. 'It’s very unlikely that he has that authority, but if he takes this to the Supreme Court, I don’t know what to think of the Supreme Court.' Instead, Trump could leave Powell in his position on the Fed’s 7-member Board of Governors but demote him from his role as chair, Blinder said. 'That’s a subtle question that has never been tested,' Blinder said, acknowledging a lack of clarity about whether it would be allowed. 'We can’t answer that quite as definitively.' In any case, Trump would likely have to expend some serious political capital if he wants to remove Powell via presidential power. Yet, Powell’s defiance ought to provoke us to ask why wealthy, pampered, out-of-touch technocrats like Jerome Powell get to act like their removal constitutes some sort of transgression. Central bankers are just bureaucrats, and their removal ought to be regarded with no more trepidation than the removal of an undersecretary of agriculture. Congress Should Fire Powell, and Not Stop There Regardless of what Trump’s legal powers may be, it is clear that Congress has the power to remove Powell, just as Congress has the power to abolish the central bank altogether. The Congress ought to abolish the Fed entirely, of course, but if members lack the stomach for that heroic act, Congress can begin with amending the Federal Reserve Act to make it clear that the chairman of the Fed is not a Holy Person, untouchable by the mere mortals who are actually elected to run the federal government. There are many ways Congress could approach this issue. For example, Congress could rewrite the law to allow Congress to remove the Fed chairman with a majority vote in either house. It doesn’t really matter, so long as central bankers get the message that they’re not special. While Congress is at is, it could make a few other crucial changes as well. Congress should prohibit the Fed from buying any assets of any kind. This would end the Fed’s habit of buying up mortgage-backed securities and government securities to prop up the banker class and Powell’s buddies—i.e., Janet Yellen—at the Treasury. It would also end the Fed’s ability to manipulate interest rates since the Fed’s main tool here is its 'open market operations.' A second key change that is very necessary is removing the Fed’s so called 'dual mandate.' As the Fed likes to often mention, the Fed has a dual mandate of both 'stable prices' and 'maximum employment.' Congress should immediately abolish the mandate for 'maximum employment' because the only purpose this has ever served has been as an excuse for the central bank to inflate the money supply. As is abundantly clear from Fed press conferences and publications, the Fed routinely justifies its dovish policy in terms of fulfilling its mandate to maximize inflation. That is, the Fed often says something to the effect of 'we’re embracing easy-money policy because our dual mandate to maximize employment says we have to.' Congress should just delete the mandate. (By the way, the Fed actually has a third mandate. It’s to ensure 'moderate long-term interest rates.' Getting rid of the Fed’s power to purchase assets probably nullifies this mandate in any case, but Congress might as well remove any doubt and totally prohibit the Fed from manipulating interest rates of any kind.) Fed Independence Has Never Been Used for Good Things Of course, if Congress were to attempt any of this, Fed simps in the media and in Congress will try to talk about how such things are unprecedented and we must respect 'Fed independence.' Media stories in the Fed often claim that attempts by elected officials to rein in Fed technocrats violate 'long-standing norms' that respect Fed independence. This is a fantasy version of history. There is not now, and there has never been, any such thing as Fed independence because the Fed always willingly helps the regime get what it wants. Early on, Fed independence didn’t even exist in theory, and was explicitly limited in law. Prior to 1935, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of the Treasury sat on the Fed’s Board, thus ensuring a direct line from the White House to the Fed. In 1933, of course, Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order abolishing the gold standard and ordering the Fed to turn over all its gold to the Treasury. So much for 'Fed independence' under the Left’s favorite twentieth-century president. Even after 1935, it was understood that the Fed would always assist the Treasury with funding whenever necessary. This again became obvious during the Second World War when the Fed essentially helped launder funds for the war effort. The Fed agreed in 1942 to peg interest rates on government securities. The Fed also engaged in a variety of price control measures and regulations designed to assist the White House. Only since the Monetary Accord of 1951 has there been a de jure nod to giving the Fed autonomy on policy. The Fed has never used any of this alleged autonomy to do anything good, however. We’ve seen this proven countless times since the Fed has always gladly done its part to ensure the Treasury gets what it wants. From the Fed’s efforts to finance federal deficits in the 1970s, to the Plaza Accord in 1985, and to the flood of easy money since 2008, the Fed has never used its so-called independence to actually rein in federal profligacy. What Matters to the Fed Is Protecting the Banking Class Central bankers have never cared about Fed independence as a way of limiting state power. According to its own historical narrative, the Fed has now allegedly been 'autonomous' for sixty years or more. Has inflation and federal spending been more restrained during that time? Obviously not. The Fed has always and everywhere been happy to enrich the state, regardless of whatever levels of self-governance it might achieve. The real reason the Fed wants more independence is so the Fed can also more easily enrich the banker class while also making the Treasury happy. That is, the banking cartel that works hand in glove with the Fed cares deeply about having control over who gets onto the Board of Governors and who gets to be chairman. The elite bankers are perfectly willing to effectively serve the Treasury so long as the cartel gets to have its own people in charge. This is how the banker class ensures that its monopolistic powers are protected, the competition is crushed, and the bailouts are guaranteed. If the Fed pushes back against the elected government, it’s only if the priorities of the elected government conflict with the Fed’s priority, which is serving the interests of the banker class. Experience makes it abundantly clear that central bankers are fine with endless price inflation. But, the Fed wants to inflate in a way that most suits the Fed and the banking cartel. That’s why Powell and the Fed are so opposed to the idea of being removed from office. There is no higher principle here. There is only power.

Australia’s Covid Inquiry Report Is Not Fit For Purpose – OpEd	On 24 October, Jay Bhattacharya, once derided by Anthony ‘Mr Science’ Fauci as a fringe epidemiologist, was awarded the Zimmer Medal for Intellectual Freedom by the American Academy of Sciences and Letters. The medal ‘is presented annually to a public thinker who displays extraordinary courage in the exercise of intellectual freedom.’ The 2023 winner was Salman Rushdie. Jay’s citation recognises his ‘courage and firm commitment to intellectual freedom’ who ‘resolutely refused…to compromise his scientific findings’ and took ‘a stand for the public’s right to unrestricted scientific discussion and debate.’ His writings and speeches are powerful examples of passion, courage, and clarity of expression that reflects clear thinking. He toured Australia in 2022 and I had the honour to share a packed town hall meeting with him in Melbourne on 22 September. Sadly but not surprisingly, his tour was mostly ignored by Australia’s mainstream media. On 29 October, the official panel inquiring into Australia’s Covid-19 response submitted its 868-page report. I regret to say the report is not fit for purpose. Bottom line: This is a report of, by, and for the public health clerisy. The prolix report is packed with turgid prose and bureaucratic analysis and recommendations. The Great Barrington Declaration of October 2020, co-authored by Bhattacharya, still offers better big-picture value in both language and content. The 513-word one page GBD might even profit PM Anthony Albanese to read, since during last year’s doomed campaign for the Voice referendum he let it be known that his attention span does not extend beyond the first page of a report and he sees no reason for it to do so. At the granular level, the report has some positive features but these are outweighed by flaws of commission and omission, much like the response to the pandemic itself. Granted, the inquiry was hobbled by very tightly circumscribed terms of reference in yet another broken election promise that is itself destroying public trust in politicians and political institutions. Still, the panelists could have said no to the call to serve. The report opens with virtue-signalling genuflections to political correctness. There is the ritualistic acknowledgment of ‘Traditional Owners and Custodians of Country throughout Australia on whose lands we all work, play and live,’ ‘their continuous connection to lands, waters, skies, culture and community’ and the ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s significant contribution to society.’ The panelists pay ‘respects to their Elders past and present.’ The relevance of this to an inquiry report on Australia’s Covid response is difficult to discern. If this is a signal that henceforth, every official report is going to begin with these mantras then we can expect a significant and rapid rise of mainstream antagonism and resentment towards Aboriginal people. Next, there is an acknowledgment of ‘lived experience:’ ‘We acknowledge that Covid-19 touched every person, every organisation and each sector,’ albeit ‘in different ways.’ Well, yes, that’s why the inquiry was set up, to determine the details and identify the impacts. To coin a phrase, this is a statement of the bleeding obvious. This is topped off with a content warning: ‘This report contains material that may be distressing for some readers,’ complete with advice on who to contact for help. This was an inquiry into the Covid years that wrecked our lives, economy, and society for three years and counting. What did the panellists think readers would expect: lyrics to the latest kumbaya hymn? Instead of such mindless infantilisation, how about this: ‘We acknowledge the great loss of life, liberty, and happiness caused by Covid-19 and the response to it. We strongly recommend a Royal Commission of Inquiry to establish the division of causal responsibility between the disease and government policies, so that the perpetrators of mass public harms may be held accountable.’ Positives of Report Are Outweighed by Flaws The report confirms that lockdowns, state border closures, school shutdowns, and vaccine mandates broke public trust in governments and science. They drove lower Covid vaccine takeup in the last two years and promoted cross-vaccine hesitancy. Inconsistent advice, recommendations, and enforcement practices across the states, compounded by the refusal to release health advice and its science and evidence base further eroded public trust. The strong emphasis on human rights and the wider economic, social, and mental health consequences of the pandemic policies is also welcome. So too discussion of the long-term damage to children’s learning, development, and emotional health. All this is good, but neither particularly new nor insightful. Several critics warned about precisely these downstream consequences from day one. The report ignores how Australia’s Covid response marked a radical departure from the prevailing consensus on science and policy as synthesised in the WHO September 2019 report. Nor is there any clarity on why Australia’s own existing pandemic preparedness plans were ditched. Critical flaws of commissions begin with paeans to leaders’ courageous decision-making in conditions of mass fear and extreme uncertainty. The fear and hysteria did not match the data yet the government and media fed it. Experts who called for calm and responses that were proportionate to risks were ignored, censored, and vilified. Early data, including from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February 2020 confirmed that the risk from Covid was highly age-correlated and concentrated in the elderly. There was no reason to strip peoples and businesses of their liberties and freedoms, to put healthy populations under wholesale house arrest, treating them as germ-ridden criminals even if proven innocent. Far from courageous, the leaders were cowardly and hypocritical, or else just too credulous of what their expert advisers told them. They had no skin in the game, suffered no financial penalty while decimating small businesses, paid no political penalty, got sugar highs on power tripping, hid behind health officials, and typically exempted themselves from inconvenient restrictions they foisted on all others. Australians were prevented from returning home, diluting the quality of citizenship, and also from leaving the country. But the prime minister was able to fly to the UK to attend the G7 summit (where he reversed Australian policy to commit Australia to Net Zero as the price of a guest seat at the exclusive high table), one state premier flew to Tokyo to lobby for hosting the Olympics, and one state chief health officer flew interstate to Canberra to attend an awards ceremony that recognised his stellar contribution to managing the pandemic. Australia became fixated on the single, dubious metric of case numbers, exaggerating the Covid risks, downplaying the harms of interventions, heightening the fear, stripping people of rights and liberties, censoring dissent, and cancelling critics. Hard to believe, dozens of Victorian firefighters who were dismissed for being unvaccinated are still banned from work despite staff shortages as the fire season is about to start. We threw extravagant and wasteful amounts of money at the problem. We sacrificed children’s futures for modest extensions to old people’s lives. Professor Margie Danchin, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne, says bluntly that ‘We punished kids to protect the adults.’ Has any society ever done this before? The assumption of world-leading performance by Australia is rooted in simplistic and inappropriate European and North American benchmarks against which to assess our outcomes. Our Southern Hemisphere location, island identity, plentiful sunshine and open spaces, love of outdoors activities, relative paucity of high-density housing etc. conferred immense advantages in coming through the pandemic with much better outcomes than Europe and America. The most visible embodiments of courage through the pandemic public policy insanity were Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Sweden’s state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. Florida and Sweden resisted the lockdown groupthink, are in the mid-range of Covid metrics, avoided most of the health, economic, educational, and social damage in European countries and US states with authoritarian approaches, including loss of public trust, and came out better on the balance of benefits versus harms. The panelists betray astonishing, one-dimensional ignorance in their references to Sweden, as though we are still stuck in 2020 instead of having moved on to near the end of 2024. The only mentions of Sweden are by way of its significantly worse comparison in the first year of the pandemic. ‘Australia would have had between 15 and 46 times the number of deaths if it had experienced the same Covid-related death rates as comparable countries like Canada and Sweden’ as well as France, the UK, and the US. The most striking variations in Covid mortality rates were by season (the Northern Hemisphere was much harder hit initially because of winter, giving a major seasonal buffer to countries in the Southern Hemisphere), geographical features like island identity and distance from Covid hotspots, and region. Tegnell insisted that lockdowns lacked any ‘historical scientific basis.’ In July 2020, he rejected short-term performance measures and said judge me in a year. Sweden’s initial bad outcomes reflected the equivalent of the ‘dry tinder’ effect with low flu mortality in 2019, the mid-term school holiday calendar that saw many Swedes vacationing on Italian slopes at a particularly unfortunate time for the spread of the infection, and badly mishandled elderly patients in care homes. The better point of comparison for light-touch Sweden is the heavy-handed UK, whose Covid outcomes were worse. Omissions Mean the Report Is Not Fit for Purpose This section explores three important examples of where the inquiry fell short. In the first two on social distancing and facemasks, the non-pharmaceutical interventions departed radically from existing understandings with no scientific basis or evidence in justification. In the third on vaccination, the response departed alarmingly from all established protocols governing the approval and authorisation of vaccines after duly completed trials to determine their efficacy and safety, not just in an immediate timeframe but over the long haul. To circumvent the full trials requirement, emergency use authorisation was necessary. This could not be done if existing treatment was available. When physicians who claimed high success in clinical treatment of Covid patients with repurposed ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were ordered by regulators to cease and desist, suspicions were fuelled about industry capture of the regulators. There is also a plausible argument that the legal framework governing the approval process in Australia should have been that for genetically modified organisms. This wasn’t done. Social Distancing ‘Social distancing,’ the requirement that everyone must maintain the minimum specified distance from physical contact with any other human being, was a profoundly anti-social rule that severely disrupted social and economic functioning around the world for more than three years. On 31 May, the US Congress published the transcript of two days of testimony in January from Dr Anthony Fauci, the face of America’s Covid response. On the second day of the closed-door testimony on 10 January, Committee Staff Director Mitch Benzine asked about the origins of the six-foot social distancing rule applied at businesses, schools, and all public settings. Fauci frankly admitted: ‘You know, I don’t recall. It sort of just appeared.’ Pressed on relevant ‘studies that supported six feet,’ he said ‘I was not aware of studies that – in fact, that would be a very difficult study to do’ (pp. 183–84). As early as 25 April 2020, Professor Robert Dingwall, a scientific adviser to the UK government as a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), said there has ‘never been a scientific basis for two metres,’ it was ‘conjured up out of nowhere,’ and it should more accurately be called a ‘rule of thumb.’ He also warned that the social distancing measures would cause ‘serious damage to society, to the economy and to the physical and mental health of the population.’ Was he right, or was he right? A group of Oxford University scientists explained in June 2020 that the science behind the social distancing rule was complex while the rule was starkly binary. It assumed that the sole or primary transmission route was through physical contact or large droplets. This also explained the early phobia about the constant use of hand sanitisers and disinfection of all potential contact surfaces like chairs and tables in restaurants and benches in parks. But the really small viruses can also be aerosolised and spread through the air. Our chief health officers and ‘experts’ thus need to be interrogated on whether the adoption of the two-metre rule for Australia was an example of copycat idiocy or the persistence of culture cringe: where the Brits and Americans lead, we unquestioningly follow. Facemasks At the Congressional hearing on 10 January, Benzine also asked if a cost-benefit analysis had ever been done ‘on the unintended consequences of masking kids versus the protection that it would give them.’ ‘Not to my knowledge,’ Fauci conceded (p. 135). Until 2020, ‘settled science’ was clear. Masks are ineffective. They stop neither infection nor transmission. The UK Influenza Preparedness Strategy 2011, reaffirmedon 27 February 2020, encapsulated the prevailing consensus (paragraph 4.15): Although there is a perception that the wearing of facemasks by the public in the community and household setting may be beneficial, there is in fact very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use in this setting. Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good respiratory, hand, and home hygiene behaviour in order for them to achieve the intended benefit. Research also shows that compliance with these recommended behaviours when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods reduces over time. This conclusion was reaffirmed in the WHO report published in September 2019 that summarised the best available studies to date, noting that ‘there is very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use in community and household settings. It was repeated by top WHO doctors Mike Ryan and Maria Van Kerkhove on 31 March 2020: ‘There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly.’ The benefits-harms equation for masks doesn’t compute, especially for children. They are dehumanising and a potent force for stoking mass fear. Facial expressions are crucial in social interactions, including for babies. And also for the elderly and people suffering from dementia in care homes. Consider this poignant testimony to Scotland’s Covid inquiry hearings from Alison Walker, a former BBC sports presenter, on 17 November 2023. Having witnessed the trauma of her 89- and 90-year old parents residing in care homes in 2020, she asked (around the 36-minute mark): ‘If you are surrounded by a group of people 24/7 wearing masks, and you don’t see people smile for up to two years, what kind of effect is that going to have on your mental health and wellbeing?’ Care homes abandoned their duty of ‘care and compassion,’ she believed, and instead ‘operated under a veil of fear’ (at 1:24:46). This was reinforced by the closing statement from the Care Home Relatives Scotland (paragraph 20): ‘The evidence demonstrated that the use of masks caused distress, confusion and considerable difficulties with communication. Residents couldn’t see smiles, had difficulty recognising relatives and those with hearing difficulties couldn’t lip-read or read facial expressions or visual clues.’ Masks also do cause some harms as side effects in some people. Compulsory masking for everyone in all settings is a gross violation of fundamental human rights. It can be justified only if the evidence for their efficacy in community protection is compelling and the risk of harms is negligible. Instead mask mandates were heavy on fear-mongering and virtue-signalling but light on data and science, overturning, in a couple of months, cumulative scientific consensus built over decades. The report mentions masks several times, but only in the context of the inconsistent application of mandates. It doesn’t address the lack of high-quality studies and data that would contradict the pre-2020 consensus on their lack of efficacy in community settings, as confirmed in the Cochrane Review. It fails to tell us why Australia’s health authorities flipped on the old understandings. Vaccines Part of the explanation for the tone-deafness towards the still smouldering white-hot rage in the community is the failure to address the fiasco of the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. From the start of vaccine rollout in February 2021 to 70 percent full vaccination on 21 November 2021, Australia’s total number of deaths was 1,187 (2,110-923) (Table 1). From initial rollout until 80 percent full vaccination on 20 March 2022, it was 5,599 (6,482-923). Since achieving those landmarks, which for practical purposes amount to full adult vaccination, the numbers of Covid-related deaths are 23,126 and 18,754, respectively. There are two ways to put these figures in perspective. More than 25 times as many people have died with Covid-19 since 70 percent full vaccination compared to the total number before vaccination; and more than 20 times since 80 percent full vaccination than before vaccination. Source for Table 1 and Figures 1–3: Our World in Data (accessed 31 October 2024) That is, 91.6 and 74.3 percent of Australia’s Covid-related deaths occurred after 70 and 80 percent full vaccination, respectively. This contrasts with just 3.7 percent before the vaccines began to be rolled out. I really do hate to think what the statistics would be if vaccines were ineffective. And this is even without taking into consideration vaccine injuries or age-disaggregated Covid risks of hospitalisation and death for unvaccinated vs vaccinated and boosted healthy children, adolescents, and adults until age 60. On 23 October, the BBC said that AstraZeneca vaccines had saved 6.3 million livesand Pfizer another 5.9 million, just in the first year from December 2020 to December 2021, including 120,000 British lives saved until September 2021. Looking at Figures 1–2, one can see why they would make such a claim. Yet as per Popperian falsifiability, just the one contrary example of Australia is sufficient to falsify the hypothesis of the Covid vaccines having saved millions of lives. As can be seen in Figure 1, among the four countries plus the EU, Australia’s vaccine rollout was the last to begin yet the most rapid and successful of all five in covering the population. Figure 2 shows that Australia’s Covid mortality rate was above one death per million people almost continually for 17 months from 9 January 2022 to 23 June 2023, except for a brief period of three weeks in March–April 2023. If we look at Figures 2 and 3 against the vaccination coverage in the five jurisdictions, two things become clear. For the four entities in the Northern Hemisphere, the heaviest Covid mortality toll both in terms of the daily count (Figure 2) and cumulatively (Figure 3) was in the first twelve months of the pandemic and the toll fell dramatically coinciding with the vaccine rollouts. For example, contrasting sharply with Australian data where the pre-vaccine deaths with Covid were under four percent of the total until October 2024, for the UK this was almost forty percent. Confusing correlation with causation, authorities, and vaccine-faithful advocates continue to attribute the fall to vaccines. Yet, in the case of Australia, the relationship is reversed. Its Covid-related mortality rates and cumulative toll were exceptionally light in the first twelve months beforethe vaccine campaign was launched. For vaccine-sceptics, it’s tempting to attribute this to vaccines causing the explosion in deaths. Yet such a conclusion is contradicted by the experience north of the equator. Equally, however, the Australian (and New Zealand) experience refutes the hypothesis that vaccines saved millions of lives. Instead, to my mind, taken together the divergent experiences powerfully indicate two alternative conclusions. Firstly, as was the case with lockdown restrictions and mask mandates, the rise and fall of the various coronavirus waves were policy-invariant, following a trajectory to some inner virus logic that was stubbornly indifferent to pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Second, population-level immunity acquired naturally through infection likely played a more critical role in getting to herd immunity than vaccines. This occurred much earlier in the UK, Europe, and America. Hard border closures in Australia (and New Zealand) kept the virus at bay until such time as borders were reopened in the wake of rapid and high vaccine uptakes. This finally seeded the virus in the population and infection, hospitalisation, and death rates rose sharply, herd immunity was achieved, and the virus receded. If this is so, then of course the benefit-harms equation for vaccines changes quite dramatically also. To my absolute astonishment, the three words ‘cost-benefit analysis’ cannot be found even once in the more than 353,000 words of the report. The failure – nay, the cussed refusal – to engage in such analysis and publish the results, for an experimental product that may very well be contaminating our DNA (see Rebekah Barnett’s comprehensive refutation of the charge that this is misinformation), offers yet another bit of evidence that regulators have become vaccine enablers first, more committed to defending vaccines from criticism than protect people from harmful vaccines. Conclusion On the one hand, the report confirms how the policies implemented by political leaders acting under the guidance of public health officers and experts caused substantial health, mental health, economic, educational, and social damage that triggered a significant fall in trust in government and science. On the other hand, the major solution to this problem recommended by the report is to increase the authority and resources of the same two groups (politicians and the public health bureaucrats) to control our behaviour in future health emergencies. The contradiction has been picked up by pretty much every commentator. Did none of the panelists notice the incoherence between analysis and recommendations? The report vastly underrates public anger and cynicism. People were locked up at home on dubious data and science, forced to isolate from parents and grandchildren, unable to visit grandparents in their final days or attend family reunions, weddings, funerals, and birthdays, coerced into taking the shot in order to shop, travel, and keep jobs on false assurances of safety and effectiveness. Some of the worst offenders, responsible for the most egregious policies and thuggish enforcement measures, have been awarded the highest gongs going, promoted into governors’ mansions, and even promised a statue in their honour. The report’s solution to the overreach and abuse of power by authorities during Covid is to create even more bureaucratic structures with more powers and resources, including an Australian Centre for Disease Control even as the US CDC sinks into ever greater disrepute by the month. Governments grabbed too much power, coming uncomfortably close to becoming police states. Who but the same experts would staff the Australian CDC? This could potentially include one of the panellists, Catherine Bennett, who is professor of epidemiology at Deakin University. In an interview with SBS TV on 7 July 2022, she said, ‘We have to ensure people have all their recommended boosters because the booster…reduces the risk of serious illness quite dramatically.’ She also recommended ‘people wear face masks and maintain social distancing.’ It’s certainly not unknown for a government report to turn out to be a successful job application for one of the authors. It would incense many if those guilty of the biggest assault on Australians’ health, political, and economic freedoms in the nation’s history were to be rewarded with increased powers and resources to serially indulge their inner bullies. Dealing with the past is a prerequisite for imposing justified punishment for crimes against the people, enabling closure for the many physical injuries and emotional trauma of the totalitarian responses, and deterring future wrongdoers. This report doesn’t take us far on the path we must but are yet to travel.

Don’t Urge Hotels To Censor, Even In The Name Of Opposing Genocid...	Medea Benjamin has done much good in educating people about violent aspects of United States foreign policy and why such should be opposed. But, via a brief video Benjamin posted Thursday at Twitter, in which she calls on people to urge Hilton to cancel an upcoming event at one of its hotels, she is promoting a curtailment of speech that endangers her cause and individual rights more broadly. Hotels have managed to remain a refuge for free speech as a censorship trend has proceeded among major American companies. This refuge is very valuable for people opposing the expansion of government power at the expense of individual rights. And part of defending this refuge is accepting that hotels will host on occasion events you abhor or see as harmful. In Benjamin’s case such an event is a conference to be held on November 14-17 by the Jewish National Fund (JNF) at a Hilton hotel in Dallas, Texas. 'Say no to the JNF; say no to genocide and ecocide,' concludes Benjamin in her video. The course Benjamin is pursuing in regard to this conference is detrimental for liberty in America and ultimately for her cause. As we have seen, it is the forces for expanded government power, including in the area of foreign policy, that have been able to direct the extensive censorship pursued by other sorts of companies. If liberty defenders and peace advocates do not stand up unequivocally for free speech, they are sure to lose. They may be able to shut down a 'bad' event here and there at the beginning. But, ultimately, expect the advocates of expansive government power, including the warmongers, to be the ones directing who hotels censor. By all means, educate people about events you oppose. But, beware of taking the censorship approach. That approach plays into the hands of the opponents of liberty and peace.

Days Of DEI In The Pentagon Should Be Numbered – OpEd	By Dave Patterson Governments, like people, all too often adopt beliefs that are not true. As the opening quotation from the movie The Big Short asserted: 'It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.' And when those who believe for sure what 'just ain’t so' include the Pentagon leadership, then America is in trouble. The promise of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) falls squarely in the 'just ain’t so' category, as corporations are finding out. Will the Pentagon be the last to get it? DEI Is a Failure When Performance Is Demanded Many have seen all too well the performance of federal agencies that emphasize DEI over the quality of personnel. The Pentagon has favored DEI theories over merit for nearly four years, and there has been little to impede this trend – until now. President-elect Donald Trump will no doubt apply the brakes to DEI as he did in his first administration. 'To further advance equity within the Federal Government, this order establishes that it is the policy of my Administration to cultivate a workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation,' were the words codified in an executive order signed by President Joe Biden during his first year in office. Since then, the divisive nature of the DEI ideology has had a chilling effect on recruiting and retention. What the Pentagon should find particularly worrying is a recent report in The Wall Street Journal: 'The focus on DEI is driving an especially profound disillusionment among conservative veterans, the military’s longstanding support bedrock. Between 2019 and 2024, the percentage of conservative veterans who would advise a young family member to join the military declined from 88% to 53%. That almost entirely explains the shift in the broader veteran population. Far more conservative veterans cited the ‘military’s DEI and other social policies’ as a ‘major factor’ (85%) in withholding their endorsement.' This is especially troublesome since 80% of volunteers for military service have family members who were in the military. It’s more than likely that the US government’s DEI programs will be short-lived under a Trump presidency. The real question is, why were they installed in the first place? Evidence is building that whatever motives existed for embracing the DEI craze are rapidly disappearing. Many corporations that adopted the flawed notion are backing away. Aerospace and defense giant Boeing is the most recent to ditch DEI. 'Boeing reportedly dismantled its global diversity, equity, and inclusion department as part of an overhaul of its operations ordered by the company’s new top executive — becoming the latest major company to ditch the controversial initiative,' according to The New York Post. Dissolving DEI comes on the heels of billionaire Elon Musk criticizing Boeing for 'prioritizing DEI over safety and quality controls.' Boeing is not the only company that is repudiating DEI. 'First Tractor Supply and John Deere; then Harley-Davidson and Brown-Foreman Corp., then Ford and Molson Coors' are among Fortune 500 companies dropping DEI as corporate objectives, HR Drive reported. You would think that US government agencies would view this trend as a cautionary tale prompting a review of DEI initiatives. One might expect Pentagon leadership to understand that if DEI has failed in business, it is not worth pursuing as a mission goal for the nation’s defense. The US Military Cannot Fail to Keep Americans Safe While Americans depend on the US Armed Forces to keep them safe, the Pentagon is mired in the diversity, equity, and inclusion ethos, prioritizing the tenet that DEI delivers a military that mirrors society. At some level, it does that. But it is pure mythology that such a military service would be preferable to a fighting force focused on relevant accomplishments and skills. The Pentagon should observe the trend of corporations moving away from DEI and follow suit before it is ordered to by its new commander-in-chief. As the saying goes, 'A new broom sweeps clean.' DEI will be something in the dustbin, unencumbered by the past. About the author: National Security Correspondent at LibertyNation.Com.

Ralph Nader: Electing An American Fuhrer As Wall Street Cheers An...	On September 17, 1787, the last day after the drafting of our Constitution in Philadelphia, Ben Franklin was leaving the building when a prominent resident, Elizabeth Willing Powel, asked him 'Well Doctor, what have we got – a republic or a monarch?' Franklin replied, 'A republic, if you can keep it.' On November 5, 2024, our fragile Republic became a Monarchy-elect. A majority of voters elected a Dictator. This is no exaggeration. Look at just some of the damage Trump has done and the appalling things he has said. In July 2019, he declared 'With Article II, I can do whatever I want as president.' And he did, throughout his four years, he violated all kinds of federal laws and provisions of the Constitution, mostly openly, with impunity. He obstructed justice from the White House as a way of life. He defied over 125 Congressional subpoenas. He is a very successful fugitive from justice with lawyers skilled at endlessly delaying judges and courts where federal and state prosecutors have obtained indictments. His convictions and adverse civil verdicts are like water on a duck’s back. He openly admires foreign dictators and meets with them proudly, musing about wanting to be more like them. Moreover, he is gathering around him a large number of vengeful, dictatorial Trumpsters readying to take over the federal departments and agencies. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, 900-page report prepared a detailed blueprint for the corporate state that is the definition of fascism, American style. Together with Trump, they have their 'enemies list' both individually and collectively. In speech after speech, Trump, Vance, and others have spoken as if they will have boundless power after January 20, 2025. They are not wrong. They control the compliant Republican House and the Senate. The U.S. Supreme Court (6 to 3) decided fanatically last June that a president’s 'official' conduct no matter how extreme was immune from criminal prosecution. Three of the Justices were Trump’s nominees. He believes his presidency will be above the law. There is no one to challenge him. Ordinary citizens have no 'legal standing' to sue. And as is the practice, he will replace all the federal prosecutors working at the Department of Justice, under the new Attorney General whom he chooses. Trump may be on facts and policies, 'dumb as a rock,' 'with a low IQ!' – to use his words about other persons, but when it comes to knowing the electorate and the mass media, he is a master magician who induces mass masochism. As with violent climate disruptions are 'a hoax, drill baby drill.' He weaves a web of fantasy about his past failed business and presidential records and constantly repeats his megalomaniac refrain: 'Only I can fix it.' His daily lies often come across to his supporters as a form of entertainment garnished with massaging their own grievances and biases into political campaign fodder. He tells those who think they are victims, that he is their savior. He promises a paradise in America in his next presidential term but doesn’t have a clue about how to get there. As far as the media, his denunciations of them, 'fake news,' and the 'failing New York Times,' only result in journalists giving him constant top-level coverage, even repeating in CAPITAL LETTERS his pejorative nicknames for people who are not given a chance to reply in the press. True, the major newspapers have exposed his numerous dark sides – whether personal against women, commercial against workers, students and creditors, against the government with his tax evasions, or as past president, with his brazen violations of law and overt unethical self-enrichment. Mark Green and I contributed two books– 'Fake President: Decoding Trump’s Gaslighting, Corruption, and General Bullsh*t' in 2019 and 'Wrecking America: How Trump’s Lawbreaking and Lies Betray All' in 2020 – about dangerous, corrupt Donald. However, in the end, nothing stuck or mattered. Do-little Donald’s fulminating lies were embraced by his followers. His slippery Teflon persona was underestimated. Voter acceptance of the Trumpian mirage reflects poorly on the majority of the voters who cast their ballots for him. Trump did have some crucial luck. A weak, arrogant Democratic Party leadership, loaded with inhibitory corporate campaign money, constrained by corporate conflicted political/media consultants, who control the Party’s campaigns and bar input from the experienced citizen community (see, winningamerica.net) made it impossible for the Democratic Party to learn from its past mistakes or its recurring disastrous strategies. Trump played the Democratic Party, from its bungling nomination process to the anemic Harris campaign like a fiddle – repeatedly, personally, and without a teleprompter, he fed his crowd blatant falsehoods, hateful rhetoric, and delusionary promises. And he gave the middle finger to the 'deep state.' People must realize they are, with all voters, in a two-party duopoly Trap, excluding full access to third-party and independent candidates. No Western country erects, as the U.S.A. does, such barriers to ballot access and many other exclusions and endless harassment. (See Theresa Amato’s book, 'Grand Illusion: The Myth of Voter Choice in a Two-Party Tyranny'). A competitive democracy we are not. Still, at the presidential level, alternative candidates are often on the ballot if not in the news or in the debates. But most voters want 'to be with a winner,' and glumly or willingly accept their electoral incarceration. Get ready this January for chaos, revenge, greed, rampant abuses of power, and the unbridled control of corrupt plutocrats and oligarchs. With Elon Musk in the lead. Fascistic states flow into exercises of terror. The majority of the voters have elected an American Fuhrer. Trump will be our founding father’s greatest nightmare. They inserted numerous protections in our Constitution to block another King George III tyrant with their separation of powers and checks and balances. Come 2025 these protections will be shredded.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawD9fCSZuBI_-	2024-11-08T17:42:43-08:00	
Climate Objectives Of COP29 May Be Unmet – Analysis	By Yi Wang The 29th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) will be held from November 11 to 22, 2024, in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Over 100 heads of state and government are expected to attend the conference. The primary goal of COP29 is for wealthy countries to support poorer nations in their efforts to combat climate change. To this end, participants are seeking to establish a climate action fund aimed at raising trillions of dollars, with voluntary contributions from fossil fuel-producing countries and companies. However, many leaders from the world's major economies will be absent from this important event. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.S. President Joe Biden, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba have all canceled their plans to attend. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have also stated they will not participate. Neither Mexico nor China has been included in the agenda for leaders' speeches at the UN climate summit. Whether due to domestic political developments or personal reasons, their absence signals that COP29 negotiations are unlikely to yield a new climate action agreement, making it difficult to secure additional financial resources. This hesitation among developed countries in fulfilling their climate commitments suggests uncertainty about the outcomes of the conference. Western countries, particularly in Europe and the U.S., have notably downplayed the issue of moving away from fossil fuels.' For them, the more pressing concerns are energy security, price stability, and inflation reduction. Following the U.S. presidential election, after the victory of Donald Trump, it is expected that oil and gas production will increase to lower electricity costs. South Korean officials are considering increasing imports of U.S. oil and natural gas. Changes in Germany's coalition government also highlight the challenges of balancing economic transformation with key measures for emissions reduction, pointing to significant political divisions in decision-making. Global investors are increasingly dissatisfied with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) regulatory requirements and, in the pursuit of higher returns, are willing to abandon their green commitments. British oil giant BP has announced plans to abandon its restrictions on fossil fuel production, with its new strategy focusing on investing in oil and gas in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico. Shell had earlier indicated it might slow down its emissions reduction efforts, and its latest energy transition strategy has lowered its targets. Moving away from fossil fuels is proving to be a hard task. Amid various disruptions and obstacles, momentum seems to be waning. Hence, the expectations for climate financing at COP29 are likely to fall short this year. 1. Localized military conflicts and their increased intensity are generating the most carbon emissions. Parties have failed to reach agreements on ceasefires, and negotiations on military withdrawals are unlikely to form any substantial agreements. Military activities are consuming vast amounts of resources, placing a greater burden of responsibility for global climate change and damage. In developed Western countries, military spending continues to rise, while domestic economic growth slows, making it difficult to quickly deliver on climate financing commitments. 2. Due to the Russia-Ukraine war, armed conflicts in the Red Sea, and other tense situations, flights have been rerouted, and commercial ships have altered their paths, further complicating efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Many air routes have been forced to change, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions on both land and sea. Emissions reductions in aviation have a long way to go, especially in terms of reducing the use of traditional aviation fuel. Transportation costs have already risen sharply in many countries, and prioritizing survival has become more important than other concerns. The loss of enthusiasm for climate action may be unavoidable. 3. The explosive growth of artificial intelligence applications has led to a rapid expansion in electricity demand. The production of chips, the construction of cloud data centers, and cryptocurrency mining all consume vast amounts of electricity. In the short term, addressing power shortages is more urgent than the source to generate electricity, and most countries are unable to complete a full transition to clean energy in time. This year is expected to be the hottest one on record, with an increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, torrential rainfall, and typhoons, alongside the proliferation of infectious diseases and declines in agricultural yields. These trends are largely driven by climate change and its far-reaching effects. As the full scope of these risks becomes increasingly apparent, it is of utmost importance to critically assess the intricate interplay between economic and social development and climate change. This is not a concern limited to a select few or political leaders. Rather, the climate agenda is inextricably linked to the collective well-being, resilience, and long-term sustainability of societies and individuals across the globe.

Germany: Chancellor Signals Openness To Deal On Earlier Snap Elec...	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz suggested he would be open to negotiations on an earlier election date in exchange for opposition backing on key legislation, which could trigger snap elections sooner than planned. This marks a notable shift from Scholz’s previous announcement that he would call a vote of confidence on 15 January to hold elections 'by the end of March' after his coalition government broke down on Wednesday (6 November). Scholz said on Friday (8 November) that the 'democratic' parties in parliament would have to come to an agreement on which laws could be passed by the end of the year. 'That understanding could also answer which point in time is the right one to hold the vote of confidence in the Bundestag, also with regard to a possible date for snap elections,' Scholz told journalists at an informal EU summit in Budapest on Friday. He said the discussion on the election date would have to proceed 'with calm.' Prior to this, Scholz had resisted demands to hold an immediate vote of confidence at a meeting on Thursday with Friedrich Merz, the CDU/CSU leader and frontrunner in the election, according to Merz. Scholz cannot be constitutionally forced to hold a vote of confidence and subsequent elections before the slated election date on 28 September 2025. However, his minority government is dependent on opposition votes to pass any remaining legislation. Scholz refused to detail whether there were specific laws that he would insist on in order to agree to earlier elections. But shortly after Scholz's statement, it emerged that Germany's Federal Returning Office had warned the chancellor against holding elections too early. Ruth Brand, the agency's leader, said that setting 'dates and deadlines' during the Christmas season or New Year's Eve would make important election preparations 'virtually impossible to realise.' A snap election must be called within 60 days after the dissolution of the parliament, which has to follow within 21 days of a vote of confidence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawJSc96iO33yr	2024-11-08T17:33:07-08:00	
NATO-Type Southeast Asian Defense Alliance Not Feasible At Presen...	By Jason Gutierrez A Southeast Asian defense alliance modeled after NATO and aimed at countering China may not be set up any time soon because the region’s nations would want to maintain good relations with the superpower, regional security analysts said. The creation of more minilateral agreements, though, rather than multilateral ones like the 32-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization, are not only likely but may be more effective, they added. A minilateral agreement is an accord between a small group of nations that have come together to achieve mutual goals or tackle shared problems, according to international relations experts. For instance, a good example is a minilateral agreement renewed last year by the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia for joint patrols on their seas, said geopolitics expert Don McLain Gill. 'The most we can expect [in the form of a defense alliance] for now is an area- specific and time-dependent security cooperation between particular states in the region in a way that would also reflect individual varying sensitivities,' he told BenarNews. Another lecturer from the university concurred. 'I think that [creating] minilaterals is more plausible,' political science lecturer Sherwin Ona told BenarNews. 'I also think that armed enforcement has its limitations and has a tendency for escalation.' Established in 1949, NATO commits its 32-member countries to each other's defense in the event any are attacked. Aside from the United States, other NATO members include the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, and Canada Conversation about a regional NATO, Asian or Southeast Asian, revived after now-Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba wrote a paper late September for think-tank Hudson Institute about his proposal for such a defense alliance. '[T]he absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense,' Ichiba wrote late September. 'Under these circumstances, the creation of an Asian version of NATO is essential to deter China by its Western allies,' added the then-candidate for prime minister added. The proposal was rejected by the United States and India said it doesn’t share Ishiba’s vision. Similar ideas have irritated Beijing, which sees itself as the main focusof these proposals, in the same way that Moscow has accused NATO of concentrating its defense efforts against Russia. In Southeast Asia specifically as well, the idea of a NATO-like grouping has been talked about in response to some countries claiming harassment by Beijing’s vessels in the South China Sea, where they have overlapping claims. Beijing claims most of the South China Sea, but its claims overlap those of Taiwan, which isn’t a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which are. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. trod carefully when asked on Tuesday about a grouping similar to NATO consisting of the 10 members of ASEAN. 'I don't think it is possible at this time because of the dichotomies and divergence between country interests,' Teodoro answered at the venue of a private conference in Manila. Still, he acknowledged the need to boost multilateral security alliances. Teodoro noted that Manila has a bilateral defense alliance with Washington since 1951, even before it became one of the Southeast Asian countries to set up the ASEAN in 1967. Sherwin Ona, a political science lecturer at Manila’s De La Salle University, told BenarNews that ASEAN nations would stick to the bloc’s 'non-interference policy.' Besides, some Southeast Asian countries are very pro-Beijing because their economies are heavily dependent on China, indicated Ona. 'I agree [with Teodoro] about the beneficial relationship between countries that are pro-Beijing.' Another reason Southeast Asian countries may be cool to the idea of an 'Asian NATO' is because they have different security interests, noted a researcher at the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation. 'This is because most countries are convinced that a multilateral security architecture will only elevate regional insecurities, and make them subservient to great power contestations,' Abhishek Sharma wrote on Deccan Herald. 'Loose, flexible' minilaterals Minilaterals are 'loose and flexible,' believes Gill. 'This is not NATO’s established collective security structure,' he said. Minilaterals are 'only as good as they last.' Gill explained that if one country in a three-nation minilateral agreement felt it did not any longer share the same interest with the other two, 'it can walk out anytime.' Geopolitical analyst Julio Amador III believes a network of 'minilateral ties' might be able to offset this shortcoming and would be more effective. Additionally, he said there was a way ASEAN as a bloc could become 'a formidable diplomatic counterweight.' If the group’s members, particularly those that drift towards China, agree that there are some issues 'that go beyond national interests, that there are issues that do matter to the collective interests of the group,' ASEAN could be powerful, Amador said. However, De La Salle University’s Gill said that the character of Southeast Asian cooperation tended to be based mostly on mutual interest. 'An ASEAN version of NATO is unlikely going to happen given the nature of ASEAN,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawMi6QlmHplcK	2024-11-08T17:31:14-08:00	
Trump’s Win Could Lead To Push For Peace In Ukraine, But On Whose...	By Steve Gutterman (RFE/RL) -- The common view is that an end to Russia’s war against Ukraine is nowhere in sight. But Donald Trump’s election could generate a push to reach a peace deal -- with Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and others wrangling over the potential terms. Trump’s victory in the November 5 presidential vote set the clock ticking, in a way, because he repeatedly said during the campaign that he would be able to end the war very quickly if elected, without even waiting for his inauguration on January 20. Russian President Vladimir Putin seized on this in his first public remarks about the U.S. election result, saying on November 7 that what he called Trump’s statements about a desire to 'revive relations' with Russia and help end the war in Ukraine 'deserve attention, to say the least.' That comment came amid high praise from Putin for Trump: He said that the now president-elect had shown 'courage' and 'acted like a man' when a would-be assassin shot at him in July, and that his impression was that during his 2017-2021 term, Trump was straitjacketed and prevented from pursuing his goals. Putin’s words were delivered in a way that was clearly meant to seem casual and off-the-cuff. But they suggest that the Kremlin will try to leverage the change of power in the United States, and Trump’s hopes of brokering peace, in a bid to further its own goals in Ukraine. Big Challenges However, there’s no sign that Moscow has abandoned its stated goals, which include Russian control over five Ukrainian regions in their entirety and a permanent ban on Ukraine joining NATO. The morning after Putin made his remarks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov seemed eager to drive that message home. He said Putin has repeatedly mentioned that Russia is open for dialogue but that the president 'has never said that the goals [of the invasion] have changed.' With its forces advancing in eastern Ukraine at a faster pace than they have since a few months after the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Moscow does not seem to be in the mood for compromise. Putin’s Security Council chief, Sergei Shoigu, also suggested that Moscow is open to talks, but only on its own terms. 'Now, when the situation in the theater of military operations is not in favor of the Kyiv regime, the West is faced with a choice -- to continue financing it and destroying the Ukrainian population or to recognize the current realities and start negotiating,' Shoigu said on November 7. That’s one of the big challenges facing any bid by Trump to end the war: A cease-fire or peace on terms that satisfy Moscow would likely be seen as a defeat for Kyiv and could leave Russia in a position to threaten Ukraine and even the West. That would be hard for the White House to cast as a geopolitical victory. With Trump’s inauguration 10 weeks away, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is trying to prevent that from happening. He is urging the West to deliver more weapons, to help Ukraine improve its position on the battlefield and pave the way for a 'just peace,' warning that giving Russia what it wants would be a grave mistake. 'There has been much talk about the need to yield to Putin, to back down, to make some concessions. It's unacceptable for Ukraine and suicidal for all Europe,' Zelenskiy said in a speech at a European Political Community meeting in Budapest on November 7. Rifts In The West Divisions in the West threaten to play into Russia’s hands. Speaking in Budapest on November 8, European Council President Charles Michel echoed Zelenskiy, saying, 'We have to strengthen Ukraine, to support Ukraine, because if we do not support Ukraine, this is the wrong signal that we send to Putin, but also to some other authoritarian regimes across the world.' But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, an ally of Trump who is also close to Putin, voiced something close to the opposite position. 'The situation on the front is obvious, there’s been a [Ukrainian] military defeat,' Orban said. 'The Americans are going to pull out of this war.' But whether that will happen is not yet clear, despite Trump’s repeated statements that the war must end, and his criticism of the tens of billions of dollars in military and other support the United States has provided Ukraine under President Joe Biden. Beyond indications that he would use the volume of aid to Ukraine as leverage in getting Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table, Trump has said little about how he would go about trying to stop the fighting, so the approach he chooses remains a crucial variable as his new term approaches. Trump’s advisers have presented ideas, some of them publicly. But in a November 6 report that cited unnamed allies of Trump, The Wall Street Journal reported that he 'hasn’t approved a specific peace plan' or settled on a way to get Putin and Zelenskiy 'to sit at the same table and negotiate.'

France To ‘Expand And Diversify’ Naval Presence In Asia-Pacific	France is preparing for the deployment of its flagship Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in the next four weeks, the French navy has announced, amid reports it may head to Asia-Pacific waters. The navy said in a press release that the crew of the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle carried out a three-week training session on Oct. 4-25 in the Mediterranean in order to regain operational capability after a recent technical shutdown that lasted nearly four months. The crew has now embarked on a final four-week logistical and operational preparation at the quayside before the next deployment of the Charles de Gaulle in a 'constituted carrier battle group,' the navy said in the release without specifying where the carrier strike group would be heading to. Before this announcement, however, the Naval News quoted a senior French officer as saying that the months-long deployment would take place in the eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and 'possibly the far reaches of the Pacific Ocean.' The carrier strike group could make first, 'historic' calls to Japan and the Philippines, the Paris-based publication said. Apart from the Charles de Gaulle, the strike group may include several other warships, a nuclear-powered attack submarine, a logistics support ship and some support and assistance vessels. The air wing is set to include two E-2C Hawkeye AEW aircraft, 24 Rafale Marine jets and four helicopters. About 3,000 sailors and naval aviators would take part in several exercises during the deployment, among which a multinational exercise would 'focus on the theme of maritime security in the Indonesian straits,' Naval News said. China’s reaction 'This deployment is significant because it marks a major expansion of France’s presence in the Indo-Pacific,' said Benjamin Blandin, a network coordinator at the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies. 'Since the announcement of France’s Indo-Pacific Strategy in 2019, the French military’s presence in the region has really grown and diversified,' Blandin told Radio Free Asia. Last week, Taiwan’s ministry of defense said that a French naval vessel sailed through the Taiwan Strait from the south to the north. Notably, the Prairial (F731) – a Floreal-class frigate – was sailing on the west side of the median line closer to China, unlike U.S. and Canadian ships, which normally pass east of the median line closer to Taiwan. Beijing did not immediately protest against the transit but on Nov. 4, the Communist Party-sanctioned Global Times published an article denouncing the possible deployment of the Charles de Gaulle carrier strike group in the Indo-Pacific. The Chinese news outlet quoted analysts as saying that the deployment 'is an attempt to pander to NATO’s expansion into the Asia-Pacific, which is detrimental to regional peace and stability.' Zhang Junshe, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times that despite being the only country outside the U.S. that possesses a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, France’s strength in this area was limited. Zhang warned that 'neither the countries nor the people of the Asia-Pacific region want external forces to build up their military presence in the region to sow discord and intensify regional tensions.' French comeback Paris has a long history of involvement in the region and after a period of relative inactivity, it seems it is making a strategic comeback. France has several arms deals in the Asia-Pacific, with Indonesia, Singapore and most recently, a US$438-million aid project to provide 40 patrol vessels and logistical support to the Philippine Coast Guard. 'The Philippines can be seen as one of the new cornerstones of France’s strategic presence in the region,' said Blandin. France and the Philippines agreed to enhance cooperation in December 2023 and a French defense attaché office was established in the Philippines in May this year. Frigate Vendémiaire participated in the Balikatan exercise in April and the destroyer Bretagne made a port call in Manila from May 31 to June 4. The frigate Prairial that recently transited the Taiwan Strait also conducted a goodwill visit to Cebu between Oct. 22-25. 'The French military is in the process of negotiating a visiting forces agreement with the Philippines, which is expected to conclude in the first semester of 2025,' said Blandin. 'Paris wants to put its name back on the map.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawOlP07Co6xSm	2024-11-08T17:24:54-08:00	
Despite The Bombast, Trump Never Turned His Back On Europe – Anal...	By Luke Coffey Donald Trump’s historic presidential victory has already sent ripples through Europe, as allies and partners wonder what it means for transatlantic relations. During his first term, Trump’s rhetoric often made European leaders uneasy, but beneath the bombast his administration arguably did more to bolster Europe’s security than any US president since Ronald Reagan. After a rocky start marked by his infamous press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, the Trump administration implemented policies that significantly strengthened NATO and US commitments in Europe. By the time Trump left there were more American troops stationed in Europe than when he took office. The US also increased military exercises and stationed forces further east, including Poland. Trump sharply criticized European defense spending and questioned America’s role in European security, but his actions told a different story: US defense spending for Europe, through the European Deterrence Initiative, was more than 40 percent greater than under the Obama administration. Trump’s record on Ukraine also deserves recognition. He was the first US president to provide advanced anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, when his predecessor offered only non-lethal aid. Trump also supplied air defense and anti-tank systems to Georgia within his first year in office, something the Obama administration had resisted for eight years. On broader geopolitical matters, the Trump administration was ahead of the curve. He was a vocal critic of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which deepened Europe’s energy dependence on Russia. While this stance strained relations with Germany, it was welcomed by many Central and Eastern European nations wary of Moscow’s influence. Trump also imposed economic sanctions on companies involved in the pipeline's construction — sanctions lifted by his successor. Additionally, Trump championed the Three Seas Initiative, led by Poland and Croatia, which aimed to enhance infrastructure, connectivity, and trade across Central and Eastern Europe. His administration also oversaw the largest expulsion of Russian diplomats in history, withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty over Russian violations, and welcomed North Macedonia and Montenegro into NATO, strengthening the alliance. The Europe Trump knew in his first term, however, has changed dramatically. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine was a wake-up call for European defense. When Trump first took office in 2017, only a handful of NATO members met the alliance’s 2 percent of GDP defense spending target, with the European average at 1.46 percent. Collectively, NATO’s European members spent $254 billion annually on defense. Today, 23 of NATO’s 32 members meet the target and the European average has risen to 2 percent. Annual defense spending by NATO’s European members now totals $380 billion, a significant increase that will undoubtedly be welcomed by Trump. While Europeans need to do more in this area it is undeniable that this has been good news. The biggest question, however, is how Trump will handle Russia’s war in Ukraine. The invasion has reshaped the geopolitical landscape of the transatlantic alliance in ways not seen since the 1940s. While Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end the war quickly, he has yet to outline a concrete plan for doing so. His meeting in September with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered some insight. Trump emphasized the need for a 'fair' resolution to the conflict but stopped short of detailing how he would balance Ukrainian sovereignty with Russia’s demands. Given the high stakes, a kneejerk approach is unlikely. Instead, Trump will probably take time to craft a coherent policy on Ukraine, drawing on his administration’s past successes in Europe. For European leaders, the focus now is on how to work with Trump’s second administration. Fortunately, they do so from a stronger position. Europe’s increased defense spending and greater commitment to its own security will be welcomed in Washington. There's a far greater awareness in Europe today of the challenges and threats posed by China than there was during Trump’s first administration. Even with Ukraine, Europe has stepped up to the plate and spends as much as the US does. Some around Trump will argue that Europe is yesterday’s news, and there should be a renewed focus on Asia. The reality is different: Europe is too important for America’s economic well-being to ignore. Perhaps the future of the global economy is in Asia, but right now half of the world's GDP is shared between North America and Europe. Europe is responsible for two thirds of foreign investment into the US, and 48 of the 50 American states export more to Europe than they do to China. In the end, Trump’s return presents both risks and opportunities for European security. If he can navigate the complexities of the Ukraine war and broader transatlantic relations with the same strategic pragmatism his administration demonstrated the first time around, his second term could leave a lasting positive legacy. But if he gets Ukraine wrong and misjudges his engagement with Putin, this could have consequences not only for transatlantic security but for other regions too, such as east Asia and the Middle East. The future of transatlantic security depends not only on what Trump does next but also on how Europe rises to the occasion. History has shown that when America and Europe stand united, both sides benefit. The foundation for transatlantic cooperation remains solid. The challenge for Trump will be to build on this foundation while addressing the new realities posed by Russia’s aggression. Europe, for its part, must continue to step up, ensuring that its security framework is robust and meets the new geopolitical challenges. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

US Exposes Iranian-Directed Network Plotting Trump Assassination	By Jeff Seldin Iranian operatives sought to assassinate now President-elect Doanld Trump just weeks before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election and were willing to forego other plots against regime critics and high-profile targets to see it through, court documents say. The revelations, in documents unsealed Friday against the suspects in an unrelated murder-for-hire plot, stem from a series of conversations between the alleged ringleader, 51-year-old Farhad Shakeri, and the FBI. The documents indicate that Shakeri, who said he was in Tehran at the time of the conversations, agreed to speak with the FBI to gain a reduced prison sentence for an unnamed prisoner in the U.S. Shakeri told the agents that an official with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached him in mid- to late September, asking him to set aside a plot to kill an Iranian dissident and journalist in New York, to instead go after Trump. Shakeri said he was asked to provide a plan within seven days and that when he said targeting Trump would be costly, the IRGC official told him, 'We have already spent a lot of money … money's not an issue.' He also told the FBI that if a plan could not be formulated within the seven-day timeframe, the IRGC official planned to wait until after the U.S. election, reasoning Trump would lose and that it would be easier to kill him. The court documents do not say whether Shakeri’s conversations with the FBI were authorized by the IRGC or other authorities in Iran. The Iranian mission at the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The plot against Trump is just the latest in what U.S. officials have described as brazen attempts by Tehran to kill the former and future U.S. president in retaliation for a 2020 drone strike in Baghdad that killed Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the IRGC's Quds Force. In August, U.S. officials charged a Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, who had traveled to the United States months earlier on behalf of Iran looking for hitmen to kill Trump and others. 'There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement Friday. 'We will not stand for the Iranian regime's attempts to endanger the American people and America's national security,' he added. U.S. officials have been especially concerned about Iran's repeated use of criminal gangs and others to carry out its dirty work ((plotting)) on American soil. Court documents allege Shakeri, an Afghan national who immigrated to the U.S. as a child, fits the description. The documents say Shakeri was deported from the U.S. in 2008, after spending 14 years in prison for robbery. But they add that during his time behind bars, Shakeri cultivated a network of criminal associates that he then would use in efforts to carry out Iran's orders. According to prosecutors, one of those associates was working with Shakeri up until the U.S. election to kill VOA Persian Service journalist Masih Alinejad, described in the court documents as 'an Iranian American journalist, author, and political activist, and an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime's human rights abuses and corruption.' The associate, 49-year-old Carlisle Rivera, then turned to one of his acquaintances, 36-year-old Jonathan Loadholt, to carry out the attack for a sum of $100,000. Rivera and Loadholt were arrested Thursday. Shakeri, Rivera and Loadholt are charged with murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering conspiracy. The charges carry maximum prison sentences of 10 to 20 years. Shakeri is also charged with providing and conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Alinejad on Friday expressed astonishment that she was wrapped up in the plot to kill the president-elect. 'I am shocked,' she wrote on the X social media platform. '[T]he person assigned to assassinate @realDonaldTrump was also assigned to kill me on U.S. soil.' 'I came to America to practice my First Amendment right to freedom of speech — I don't want to die,' she said. 'Thank you to law enforcement for protecting me.' Last month, U.S. prosecutors charged a senior IRGC official in connection with a failed assassination attempt against Alinejad in 2022.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawH95PP9A0Duc	2024-11-08T17:19:52-08:00	
Riding The Trump Wave: India’s Gamble With A Tumultuous Ally – An...	The world has taken notice of Donald Trump’s recent victory in the U.S. presidential election. The presidential elections in the United States have a significant impact on regional security, economic policy, and international diplomacy due to its status as a global superpower. India, one of the United States’ closest strategic allies, also eagerly anticipated this outcome, and many Indians see Trump's comeback as a chance for deeper bilateral relations and strategic advantages. But there are also serious potential drawbacks, which puts India in a difficult balancing position. Will India face unexpected difficulties under Trump's leadership, or could it be a game changer? In order to understand the implications of Donald Trump for India, it is essential to analyze his objectives for America and contextualize India, a significant player in US strategy, albeit not as crucial as some in India may assume, within that framework. The Unprecedented Comeback: Trump’s 2024 Win and Cleveland’s Legacy Reimagined Donald Trump’s extraordinary reascendancy to the U.S. presidency in 2024 draws historical comparisons to Grover Cleveland, the sole president prior to Trump to hold non-consecutive terms. Cleveland, who held office from 1885 to 1889 and again from 1893 to 1897, epitomized political resilience by losing his re-election campaign yet successfully reclaiming his position through a concerted and strategic resurgence. Similar to Cleveland, Trump utilized his time away from the White House to sustain public prominence, openly criticizing the policies of his successor and echoing voter dissatisfaction. Cleveland's relentless opposition to the elevated tariffs enacted by President Benjamin Harrison capitalized on economic discontent, which ultimately catalyzed his political resurgence. This strategy reflects Trump's 2024 campaign, in which he leveraged prevalent dissatisfaction arising from economic instability, including inflation and perceived policy shortcomings under President Joe Biden. Trump’s resurgence can be ascribed to a multitude of factors that parallel Cleveland's historical context while also being distinctly modern. His triumph was propelled by a confluence of anti-incumbency sentiment, substantial backing in rural America, strategic augmentation of his minority constituency, and his capacity to sustain credibility among voters as an unvarnished, genuine political figure. Cleveland opposed federal expenditure initiatives that he believed undermined American resilience, whereas Trump's policies focused on pledges of economic revitalization and national pride, appealing to a substantial segment of the electorate, particularly those who felt marginalized by the Democrats. Furthermore, Trump's coalition-building tactics resembled those of Cleveland's political operatives, who maintained his visibility despite challenges. Trump also gained from a demographic transformation, garnering heightened support from Latino and Black voters while solidifying allegiance among rural, working-class whites. Kamala Harris's campaign, by contrast, faced challenges in addressing economic criticisms and reconciling internal contradictions within the Democratic platform. Concerns regarding perceived hypocrisy in foreign policy positions and the inability to mobilize essential voter demographics, particularly women, further highlighted Trump's advantage. Trump's unrepentant demeanor, despite his controversial policies, starkly contrasted with the perceived inconsistency of the Democrats, facilitating a historic and uncommon political resurgence. Trump’s Transactional Blueprint for America's Objectives and Its Impact on U.S.-India Relations Donald Trump’s goals for America highlight a focus on transactions and trade, characterized by economic nationalism and protectionist policies. His focus encompasses the implementation of comprehensive tariffs aimed at addressing trade imbalances, emphasizing the importance of reciprocal agreements, and confronting adversaries such as China with substantial tariffs, potentially reaching 60% or higher. Trump appears to focus on immediate outcomes rather than fostering enduring partnerships or engaging in multilateral agreements, as evidenced by his previous actions and the strategy he may adopt in a potential second term (Sharma, 2024). In the context of India, it is probable that Trump's strategy would be characterized by a transactional nature. He would assess India's value through measurable advantages for the U.S., like job creation or heightened exports, instead of focusing on the overarching objective of countering China or fostering enduring strategic relationships. India's role as a significant ally in countering China is recognized; however, Trump's interactions with India are expected to prioritize trade balance and the protection of U.S. interests. During his previous term, he implemented tariffs on Indian goods and demonstrated hesitance to prioritize stronger relations without evident mutual advantages. Furthermore, the human rights issues raised by the Democrats may not be as significant during Trump's administration, which could reduce certain bilateral tensions while underscoring a 'quid pro quo' approach. It can be said that the policy of Trump 2.0 regarding India is expected to be characterized by a distinct approach focused on transactional relationships. The institutional strength of the India-US relationship guarantees its ongoing existence, yet the extent and character of its development will depend on Trump’s priorities. Should the relationship correspond with his ‘America First’ agenda and yield tangible advantages, it could experience instances of collaboration. Under Trump’s extractive framework, India is likely to encounter pressures such as tariffs and demands for reciprocal benefits. Strategic collaboration remains a possibility, particularly in countering China's influence. However, India needs to approach Trump’s demand-driven strategy with caution to sustain and strengthen the bilateral partnership while safeguarding its wider strategic and economic interests. Potential Benefits for India Despite the complexities, Trump’s presidency holds a promising horizon for India-U.S. relations, given the alignment on certain strategic priorities and Trump's public admiration for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 1. Strengthening the Strategic Partnership Trump's presidency may signify a more robust U.S.-India strategic alliance, especially in the Indo-Pacific region. His administration is expected to strengthen India's position as a counterbalance to China. This alignment was evident during Trump's first term, characterized by the initiation of a strong Indo-Pacific strategy with India as a central ally. This strategy is crucial for India, which has been entangled in territorial and economic disputes with China, especially along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Himalayas. India's role in counterbalancing China's influence is anticipated to be pivotal to U.S. policy, likely enhancing collaboration within frameworks such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) with Japan and Australia. 2. Enhanced Defense and Security Ties During the Trump administration, defense cooperation may achieve new milestones. Trump's preference for high-value defense agreements may facilitate India's acquisition of advanced U.S. technologies, thereby aiding the modernization of its defense infrastructure. Joint military exercises may increase in scale and frequency, thereby improving India’s preparedness and promoting interoperability between Indian and U.S. forces. A renewed emphasis on defense partnerships may enhance India’s indigenous defense production capabilities via technology transfers and joint ventures, similar to agreements established during Trump’s prior term, including the sale of advanced helicopters and other defense equipment. 3. Revitalized Trade Relations Trump's transactional trade approach could be advantageous for India if bilateral trade negotiations are initiated between the two nations. India has encountered trade tensions with the U.S. regarding tariffs; however, Trump's emphasis on individual trade agreements may enable India to obtain more favorable conditions, particularly in the sectors of technology, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. This strategy may facilitate the expansion of markets for India's agricultural products, enhancing exports and supporting the Indian economy. The balance will be crucial, as the U.S. may pursue concessions in specific sectors. 4. Enhanced Energy and Technology Cooperation Trump's pro-energy policies are expected to enhance collaboration in the energy sector, allowing India to increase its LNG imports and thereby mitigate its energy deficit. The administration may promote investment in India's expanding technology sector, particularly in essential domains such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure. These collaborations align with India's objectives of technological advancement and digital transformation. 5. Counterterrorism and Security Cooperation The Trump administration's strong position on counterterrorism may benefit India, which has faced challenges related to cross-border terrorism originating from Pakistan. Trump's support could intensify pressure on Pakistan to confront terrorist organizations operating within its territory. Improved intelligence-sharing between the two nations may bolster India's capacity to address regional security challenges, particularly regarding threats from groups active in Kashmir. 6. Improved Diaspora Relations Trump's acknowledgment of the contributions made by the Indian-American community may enhance relations between the two countries. Relaxing H-1B visa restrictions could enable the entry of skilled Indian professionals into the U.S., thereby increasing remittances to India. Trump's favorable stance towards the Indian community has garnered significant support in India, and improved relations with the diaspora are expected to bolster India's soft power in the United States. 7. Support for Religious Minorities in South Asia In recent declarations, Trump has expressed his backing for Hindu minorities encountering difficulties in Bangladesh, a matter that has struck a chord with numerous individuals in India. Should his administration choose to extend support for the protection of religious minorities, it could effectively address the concerns of Hindus and other minority groups in the neighboring regions of India, thereby reflecting a cohesive commitment to the principle of religious freedom. Potential Challenges for India While the prospects appear promising, the reemergence of Trump may also introduce considerable obstacles. His frequently erratic and transactional approach to diplomacy, coupled with his 'America First' doctrine, may not consistently correspond with India's strategic objectives. 1. Paroxysm in Foreign Policy Trump's approach to foreign policy can be very transactional, frequently putting immediate financial gain ahead of long-term strategic partnerships. His snap decisions have left allies reeling, as evidenced by the sudden withdrawal from Afghanistan. Such uncertainty could make long-term strategic objectives, such as attempts to balance China and participate positively in the Quad, more difficult for India, which prioritizes stability in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia. 2. Strained Trade Relations Trump's protectionist policies may result in trade friction. Critiques of trade imbalances with partners, such as India, may lead to heightened tariffs or more stringent regulations. Stricter trade policies may present significant risks to India's IT and pharmaceutical sectors, which depend heavily on U.S. markets, potentially restricting market access and impacting economic growth. 3. Restrictive Immigration Policies Trump has praised Indian contributions to the United States; however, his position on immigration, particularly regarding H-1B visas, poses a potential issue. The enforcement of stricter regulations on work visas may negatively impact the Indian workforce in the United States, influencing remittances and India's expanding influence via its diaspora. Policies designed to limit immigration may hinder opportunities for Indian professionals and students. 4. Reduced U.S. Engagement in South Asia A Trump administration prioritizing a reduction in U.S. engagement in global conflicts may create a power vacuum in South Asia, which could advantage entities opposed to Indian interests. This encompasses Pakistan, where diminished U.S. influence may encourage cross-border terrorism. India prioritizes regional stability, and a reduced U.S. presence may intensify security challenges in Afghanistan and surrounding areas. 5. Environmental and Climate Concerns Trump's prior withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and his pronounced focus on fossil fuels raise significant concerns for India, a nation susceptible to the effects of climate change. A diminished U.S. commitment to global climate initiatives may jeopardize collective efforts to address climate issues, thereby impacting India's ambitious goals for renewable energy and environmental sustainability. 6. Increased U.S.-China Tensions Trump's assertive approach toward China could heighten regional tensions, potentially compelling India to adopt a clear position. India's cautious approach towards China is influenced by the potential destabilization of the region due to an intensified U.S.-China rivalry, which could affect trade owing to India's economic and strategic interdependence with China. Conclusion India faces both opportunities and challenges as a result of Trump's potential comeback to the presidency. Even though his policies might help India fight China, improve defense cooperation, and build relationships with the Indian diaspora, his transactional, trade-centric style and propensity for abrupt changes could strain the two countries' relationship. India must carefully manage this relationship, striking a balance between the real advantages of a U.S.-India partnership led by a transactional leader and its strategic autonomy. The ability of Trump's administration to successfully combine its deal-driven, pragmatic approach with the stability required for a robust, long-term U.S.-India alliance will ultimately determine whether his presidency is a 'game changer' or a diplomatic challenge for India. To ensure that it can reap the rewards of this partnership while defending its national interests, India's diplomatic flexibility will be crucial.

Notre Dame Bells Ring For First Time Since Devastating Fire 5 Yea...	By Madalaine Elhabbal The bells of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris have rung for the first time since April 2019, when a devastating fire broke out in the spire and roof of the historic French church. Notre-Dame of Paris passed the major milestone today at about 10:30 a.m., just one month away from its highly anticipated reopening on Dec. 8. Housed in the northern belfry of the cathedral — which had been partially destroyed by the fire — the bells rang out one at a time, then sounded out together, according to AFP. Though authorities have not determined whether the fire was an accident, an initial investigation found that it could have been caused by an electrical malfunction. French President Emmanuel Macron immediately announced his intention to repair the cathedral within five years and even called for alternative contemporary proposals to reconstruct the church. For a brief period, debates swirled over whether the French government would sanction such an update instead of preserving Notre Dame’s original character. However, the French Parliament soon passed a bill stipulating that reconstruction efforts must 'preserve the historic, artistic, and architectural interest' of the historic cathedral. Macron officially declared a year later, in 2020, that the reconstruction would seek to resemble the original structure in the interest of finishing the project ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics. Notre Dame Cathedral was built between the 12th and 14th centuries. Its spire was first completed in the 13th century but was ultimately replaced in the 19th century on account of damage.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawGs9DXMsZ1pc	2024-11-08T17:08:39-08:00	
UN Accuses Israel Of ‘Deliberate’ Attack On Peacekeeping Position...	By Ephrem Kossaify The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon on Friday said two Israeli excavators and a bulldozer destroyed part of a fence and a concrete structure in one of its positions in Ras Naqoura in southern Lebanon. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon added that in response to its 'urgent protest,' the Israel Defense Forces denied any activity was taking place inside its position. UNIFIL is stationed in southern Lebanon to monitor hostilities along the demarcation line with Israel, an area that has seen more than a year of fighting that turned into fierce clashes since last month between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters. Israel claims that UN forces provide cover for Hezbollah, and has told UNIFIL to evacuate peacekeepers from southern Lebanon for their own safety. But UNIFIL said the incident, which took place on Thursday, 'like seven other similar incidents, is not a matter of peacekeepers getting caught in the crossfire, but of deliberate and direct actions by the IDF.' UNIFIL issued a statement warning that 'the IDF’s deliberate and direct destruction of clearly identifiable UNIFIL property is a flagrant violation of international law and resolution 1701.' It called on the IDF and all other actors to honor 'their obligation to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times.' UNIFIL also expressed concern over the destruction and removal this week of two of the blue barrels that mark the UN-delineated line of withdrawal between Lebanon and Israel (the Blue Line). Peacekeepers said they directly observed the IDF removing one of them. 'Despite the unacceptable pressures being exerted on the mission through various channels, peacekeepers will continue to undertake our mandated monitoring and reporting tasks under resolution 1701,' UNIFIL said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawIfoP8GGySvr	2024-11-08T17:04:25-08:00	
Beyond Deep Learning: Advancing Affective Computing With Diverse ...	Affective computing, a field focused on understanding and emulating human emotions, has seen significant advancements thanks to deep learning. However, researchers at the Technical University of Munich caution that an over-reliance on deep learning may hinder progress by overlooking other emerging trends in artificial intelligence. Their review, published in Intelligent Computing, a Science Partner Journal, advocate using a variety of AI methodologies to tackle ongoing challenges in affective computing. Affective computing uses various signals, such as facial expressions, voice and language cues, alongside physiological signals and wearable sensors to analyze and synthesize affect. While deep learning has significantly improved tasks like emotion recognition through innovations in transfer learning, self-supervised learning and transformer architectures, it also presents challenges, including poor generalization, cultural adaptability issues and a lack of interpretability. To address these limitations, the authors outline a comprehensive framework for developing embodied agents capable of interacting with multiple users in many different contexts. A key to this vision is the assessment of users’ goals, mental states and interrelationships for the purpose of facilitating longer interactions. The authors recommend integrating the following nine components, which they describe in detail, to improve human-agent interactions: 1. Graphs that map user relationships and context. 2. Capsules that model hierarchies for understanding affective interactions. 3. Neurosymbolic Engines that facilitate reasoning about interactions using affective primitives. 4. Symbols that establish common knowledge and rules for interaction. 5. Embodiment that enables collaborative learning in constrained environments. 6. Personalization that tailors interactions to individual user characteristics. 7. Generative AI that creates responses across multiple modalities. 8. Causal models that differentiate causes and effects for higher-order reasoning. 9. Spiking neural networks that enhance deployment of deep neural networks in resource-limited settings. The authors also describe several next-generation neural networks, resurgent themes and new frontiers in affective computing. Next-generation neural networks are advancing beyond traditional deep learning models to address limitations in capturing complex data structures, spatial relationships and energy efficiency. Capsule networks enhance convolutional networks by preserving spatial hierarchies, improving the modeling of complex entities, such as human body parts, which is vital in healthcare and emotion recognition. Geometric deep learning extends deep learning to non-Euclidean structures, allowing for a better understanding of complex data interactions. It has been particularly useful in sentiment and facial analysis. Mimicking the threshold-based firing of biological neurons, spiking neural networks offer a more energy-efficient alternative for real-time applications, making them suitable for environments with limited resources. Traditional AI concepts, adapted to new contexts, can improve affective computing applications. Neurosymbolic systems show particular promise, combining the pattern recognition of deep learning with symbolic reasoning from traditional AI to improve the explainability and robustness of deep learning models. As these models enter real-world settings, they must conform to social norms, enhancing their ability to interpret emotions across cultures. Embodied cognition furthers this goal by situating AI agents in physical or simulated contexts, supporting natural interactions. Through reinforcement learning, embodied agents can achieve better situatedness and interactivity, which is especially beneficial in complex fields such as healthcare and education. In addition, three substantial ideas have emerged in affective computing in recent years: generative models, personalization, and causal reasoning. Advances in generative models, especially diffusion-based processes, enable AI to produce contextually relevant emotional expressions across various media, paving the way for interactive, embodied agents. Moving beyond one-size-fits-all models, personalization adapts responses based on user personalized characteristics while maintaining data privacy through federated learning. By incorporating causal reasoning, affective computing systems can not only associate but also intervene and counterfactualize in emotional contexts, enhancing their adaptability and transparency. The future of affective computing could hinge on combining innovation and a variety of AI methodologies. Moving beyond a deep learning-centric approach could pave the way for more sophisticated, culturally aware, and ethically designed systems. The integration of multiple approaches promises a future where technology not only understands but also enriches human emotions, marking a significant leap towards truly intelligent and empathetic AI.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawIkRYL6TkpJg	2024-11-08T17:02:11-08:00	
Nanoparticle Bursts Over The Amazon Rainforest	During the wet season in the Amazon rainforest heavy rainfall frequently occurs during the afternoon. For clouds and precipitation to develop, tiny airborne particles known as cloud condensation nuclei are required for water vapor to condense and form cloud droplets. But what are the origins of these cloud condensation nuclei? An international research team from Germany, Brazil, Sweden, and China now showed that rainfall regularly induces bursts of nanoparticles that can grow to form cloud condensation nuclei. The scientists analyzed comprehensive long-term measurements of aerosol particles, trace gases, and meteorological data from the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory, ATTO, which is equipped with sophisticated instrumentation and measurement towers that are up to 325 m high. The observatory is located in the middle of the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil, about 150 kilometers north-east of Manaus, and jointly operated by scientists from Germany and Brazil. Luiz Machado, first author of the study now published in the journal Nature Geoscience, explains: 'Rainfall removes aerosol particles and introduces ozone from the atmosphere into the forest canopy. Ozone can oxidize plant-emitted volatile organic compounds, especially terpenes, and the oxidation products can enhance the formation of new particles, leading to temporary bursts of nanoparticles.' Nanoparticle concentrations are highest just above the forest canopy The researchers discovered that nanoparticle concentrations are highest just above the forest canopy and decrease with increasing altitude. 'This gradient persists throughout the wet season, indicating continuous particle formation in the canopy and an upward flux of newly formed particles that can grow by further uptake of low volatile molecules and serve as cloud condensation nuclei', adds Christopher Pöhlker, co-author and research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. Among the low volatile molecules involved in the formation and growth of natural nanoparticles in the atmosphere are oxygen- and nitrogen-containing organic compounds that are formed upon oxidation of isoprene, terpenes, and other volatile organic compounds, which are naturally emitted by plants and oxidized by ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the air. Earlier studies had detected new particle formation in the outflow of convective clouds in the upper troposphere and suggested a downward flux rather than an upward flux of newly formed nanoparticles. 'Our findings imply a paradigm shift in the scientific understanding of interactions between the rainforest, aerosols, clouds, and precipitation in the Amazon, which are important for regional and global climate', concludes Ulrich Pöschl, co-author and director at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawF5SL3YbcQ6R	2024-11-08T16:57:25-08:00	
Off-The-Shelf Thermoelectric Generators Can Upgrade CO2 Into Chem...	Readily available thermoelectric generators operating under modest temperature differences can power CO2 conversion, according to a proof-of-concept study by chemists at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The findings open up the intriguing possibility that the temperature differentials encountered in an array of environments—from a typical geothermal installation on Earth to the cold, desolate surface of Mars—could power the conversion of CO2 into a range of useful fuels and chemicals. 'The environment on Mars really got me interested in the long-term potential of this technology combination,' says Dr. Abhishek Soni, postdoctoral research fellow at UBC and first author of the paper published in Device. 'This is a harsh environment where large temperature differences could be leveraged to not only generate power with thermoelectric generators, but to convert the abundant CO2 in Mars’ atmosphere into useful products that could supply a colony.' Thermoelectric generators produce electricity by being attached to places with two different temperatures—in this case, a hot plate and an ice bath in the lab. The research team determined when the temperature difference between the two faces was at least 40 °C, standard model thermoelectric generators provided enough steady current to power an electrolyzer that converts CO2 to CO. Close to home, a refinement of the technology could be attached to geothermal installations. 'Our results in the lab indicate the temperature difference between hot geothermal pipes returning from underground and the relatively cooler surface temperature is enough for thermoelectric generators to power a convertor,' says Dr. Soni. The vision for Mars would be a bit more extreme. Any biodome on Mars would need to be maintained at room temperatures. Thermoelectric generators clamped over a dome’s surface would leverage the difference between indoor temperatures and the frigid temperatures outside to generate power. That power could in turn be used to drive CO2 conversion into useful carbon-based products like fuels and chemicals. The Martian atmosphere is 95 per cent carbon dioxide, and temperatures range from 20 °C to -153 °C. 'This paper shows a fun way to make carbon-neutral fuels and chemicals,' says Professor Curtis P. Berlinguette, principal investigator at UBC. 'We’ll need plastic on Mars one day, and this technology shows one way we can make it there.' Next steps will be to see how the thermoelectric generators work with our electrolyzer in the real world, here on Earth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWclcEk3xclawCioGVfn5rsF	2024-11-08T16:54:46-08:00	
BRICS Suits Putin But Is No Friend Of Israel – OpEd	From October 22 to 24, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, as host of the 2024 BRICS summit, welcomed 36 world leaders to Russia. This conference marked the first gathering of the BRICS group after its expansion to include, alongside the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), four new members: Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Other countries attended as partners or aspiring new members. The expanded body brings together countries representing approximately 41% of the global population and 24% of the global GDP. BRICS aims to promote cooperation among major emerging economies and increase their economic and political influence. Its primary purpose is to provide an alternative to Western-led institutions like the G7 economic grouping. It seeks to reduce reliance on the US dollar in international trade. The group's aims conform precisely to Putin’s domestic and international aspirations, which he does not seek to conceal. At an open meeting on October 22, 2022 he said: ''The unipolar world is being relegated into the past…The West is unable to rule humanity single-handedly, and the majority of nations no longer want to put up with this…. A future world arrangement is taking shape before our eyes.' BRICS is the perfect instrument for assisting Putin reach his goal. Given the inclusion of Iran and South Africa in its membership, the viscerally anti-Israel stance it has adopted is not, perhaps, surprising. The summit was held in the Russian city of Kazan, so the statement issued on its conclusion is titled the Kazan Declaration. In it, the BRICS leaders devote 8 of its 35 paragraphs to denouncing Israel in one way or another. In paragraph 30, for example, without any reference to the horrifying events of October 7, 2023, or even one mention of the word Hamas, they express 'grave concern' at the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, which they ascribe to 'the Israeli military offensive, which led to mass killing and injury of civilians, forced displacement and widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure.' They call for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages and detainees 'from both sides', drawing no distinction between civilians illegally seized, and people imprisoned for their crimes. Providing no evidence to support the charge, they denounce 'Israeli attacks against humanitarian operations'. Unsurprisingly they approve of the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice in 'the legal proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel.' They call for a two-state solution based on what they term the 'borders of June 1967,' and for the State of Palestine to be granted full membership in the United Nations. In paragraph 31 the Declaration turns to Lebanon. Here BRICS members, without once mentioning Hezbollah or making any reference to its ceaseless bombardment of northern Israel starting on October 8, 2023, 'condemn the loss of civilian lives and the immense damage to civilian infrastructure resulting from attacks by Israel in residential areas in Lebanon and call for immediate cessation of military acts.' They move on to condemn, among other things, what they term 'the premeditated terrorist act of detonating handheld communication devices in Beirut on 17 September 2024,' which, they claim, 'resulted in the loss of life and injury of dozens of civilians.' They make no mention of the fact that the devices in question had been issued only to Hezbollah members and certain other VIPs like Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani. The Kazan Declaration makes it clear that BRICS turns a blind eye toward terrorist activity aimed at eliminating Israel and its people, and has nothing but unreserved condemnation for the steps Israel takes to defend itself. The summit was undoubtedly a personal triumph for Putin. Ostracized and sanctioned by the West, here he was able to straddle the world stage, host to a large gathering of global leaders. At Kazan Putin demonstrated that he has been rehabilitated personally by a large section of the world, and that an alternative to Western dominance is a real possibility. The topics discussed included how emerging economies could cooperate more fully across a variety of fields. In addition it set the ball rolling on one of Putin’s pet projects – a new international payments system that would undercut the dominance of the US dollar. The magazine Newsweek believes that the overarching ambition of BRICS leaders such as Putin and China's President XI Jinping is to accelerate and bolster the shift away from America as the sole superpower, and toward a multipolar world that counterbalances the US and its Western allies. It points out that the Russian economy has managed to readjust following the sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has done so with the help of its key partner China, aided also by Iranian weapons supplied for use in Ukraine. Putin is now seeking to expand trade with India through a strategic partnership, particularly in the areas of energy resources and defense. 'These partnerships,' says Newsweek, 'are Putin's multipolar vision in practice, undermining the US-led West's ability to exercise its power and enforce its desired global norms through sanctions and other economic and diplomatic levers at its disposal.' His overall aim is to dismantle the US-led transatlantic and global order so that Russia can exercise greater power regionally and internationally Allied to the bid by BRICS for economic, financial and political independence from the West is a rejection of the principle, staunchly upheld by the US and most of the free world, that Israel has the right to defend itself against the genocidal and illegal terrorism of Iran and its axis of evil. In fact, with Iran and South Africa as leading members, it is doubtful if BRICS as an organization regards Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Iranian-supported militias in Iraq and Syria as terrorist bodies at all. It is this myopia that underlies its root and branch condemnation of Israel. However Israel need not submit to being blackened and isolated. A closer look at the list of BRICS members reveals the presence of Abraham Accord partner, the UAE, while hovering in the wings, invited to join but as yet uncertain, is Saudi Arabia. Other countries enjoying good relations with Israel, such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Belarus, are also possible new members. Putin himself has a nuanced attitude toward Israel – a position that could be affected by the result of the forthcoming US presidential election. Self-interest could well override any demand by Iran, South Africa or Turkey (another possible new member) for a permanent anti-Israel stance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcd7av1bCIhtehjVBWmRX44	2024-11-08T09:17:01-08:00	
Russia, China Figure Out Trump’s Landslide Victory – OpEd	One great paradox of our era is that the robustness of American democracy has come to be measured in coffee spoons in terms of the country’s archaic system of electoral college votes. The result is, foreign observers lacking a sense of the forces of history miss the woods for the trees. The ancient Greeks who invented democracy never thought of an electoral college system. The word democracy came from two Greek words that mean people (demos) and rule (kratos). Don’t miss the bigger truth that Donald Trump’s landslide victory is highly consequential. Trump was on comeback trail, something that happened only for the second time in American history. He was fighting against very heavy odds including real threats of assassination by unknown forces whose identity still remains a mystery, and in circumstances enveloped in darkness that is impossible to penetrate. He estimates that he is entirely beholden to God’s will. And he went on to secure a mandate that is so comprehensive that no caveats can be attached to it — securing a majority of votes (first time this is happening in 20 years) as well as winning a grand slam in the key swing states and counties too, plus walking away with an impressive Republican Party majority in the Senate that can only be seen as a reflection of the 'Trumpmania' sweeping America from coast to coast. If that isn’t a wave, what is it? Kamala Harris lost no time to understand its meaning and graciously accepted the nation’s will. The Guardian, no friend of Trump, reported today, 'The results show that America has firmly swung back to the Republicans. The Democrats won 2020 by expanding their share of votes across the country, but 90% of counties swung back to the Republicans in 2024.' The Russian President Vladimir Putin felt compelled, finally, to change his mind and 'offer my congratulations on [Trump’s] election as president of the United States.' All that rancid talk in Moscow about 'apocalypse now' for American democracy is petering out. And the dull roar of a retreat is vaguely audible in Putin’s turnaround to a conciliatory tone during a major speech at Sochi yesterday. Putin who maintained that he wouldn’t be congratulating Trump probably took the cue from Beijing. The night before Putin spoke on Thursday evening, Chinese President Xi Jinping had sent a formal congratulatory message to Trump on his election victory underscoring that 'history tells us that both countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Xi wrote, 'A China-U.S. relationship with stable, healthy and sustainable development serves the common interests of the two countries and meets the expectations of the international community. It is hoped that the two sides will, in the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, enhance dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and find the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other in the new era to the benefit of the two countries and the world.' These incipient signs of a new dawn breaking in big-power politics could well turn out to be the salience of the new Trump Administration’s foreign policies. Who knows? Beijing senses that the US is reemerging credibly as a flag carrier and a decent burial of the American dollar is nowhere in sight — BRICS or no BRICS. In comparison, alas, Moscow’s hyperbolic rhetoric was that the US election tolls the death knell of Democracy in America and that the country may even disintegrate: 'For the [USA] republic itself, dark forebodings abound. Some warn that unchecked discord could rend the union asunder, casting the states as enemies sworn to conquer one another, much as kingdoms of old clashed on blood-soaked fields. Political battles, once confined to speeches and votes, may soon take the form of steel and fire, with regions seeking dominance or defense of their way of life. In such a landscape, the banners of free states could be raised high, each upholding its own 'God-given' reign, even as they march against one another.' This was absurdity carried to the extreme, and it appeared in a Kremlin-funded publication on November 3! Again, the Foreign Ministry’s statement in Moscow in the afternoon of November 6 even as the news was appearing on Trump’s victory was simply appalling — defensive like a porcupine’s behaviour in times of stress raising its quills with body shivering, clattering its teeth and producing an unpleasant odour to warn predators not to approach. But here, again, Putin, fortunately, had other thoughts on his mind and made amends just in time. On the other hand, China is pinning hopes that a strong president in the White House may be a good thing to happen, as the neocon shibboleths get discarded, and with a mind steeped in intuitive cognition and realism, Trump is in a position to take difficult decisions. If that happens, of course — veering toward a non-confrontational trajectory in the Sino-American relationship that has seamless potential to create synergy for Trump’s MAGA movement as well as China’s peaceful rise — it becomes a 'win-win' for all sides and humanity as a whole. Four decades ago, in fact, Trump had espoused to newly-elected Ronald Reagan precisely such a detente with the Soviet Union in a full-page paid write-up in New York Times and even offered to be a presidential envoy to make it possible. The heart of the matter is Trump 2.0 remains an enigma. Importantly, he is being presidential after a four-year internship in DC from 2016 to 2020. But there is no question that Trump will assert his presidential authority. He has no more heights to conquer in a tumultuous career, which makes him, like Shelly’s skylark, 'an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.' Robert Kennedy Jr, is on record that 'I spent two days with [Trump] recently and he was saying things that were kind of shocking to me…The level of change that he wants to make in our government, I think is going to be unprecedented… He wants a revolution and I think he’s going to get one.' The 11 words that shook the world in Trump’s victory speech was undoubtedly, 'I’m not going to start wars, I’m going to stop wars.' Indeed, China is taking Trump’s victory very seriously — rationally, positively and with cautious optimism. Conceivably, Beijing draws comfort that aides like Tesla CEO Elon Musk may provide a sense of proportion to Trump’s policymaking. Certainly, Trump cannot hope to turn back the tide of historical forces and restore US hegemony. Being a civilisation state, China has its own concepts of time and space. The Chinese economy is nowhere near collapse. And it is unrealistic to wage a technology war and impose global standards vis-a-vis a vast economy like China’s, which has reached high levels of research and innovation backed up by industrial production on a scale surpassing the entire western world’s put together. The 1970s analogy of the US breaking Japan’s will and compelling it be a subaltern forever doesn’t hold good today. Then, there is the spirit of the times that must be noted: the CEO of the official government think tank in New Delhi NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) — erstwhile Planning commission — has just spoken out that India should seek membership of the RCEP(Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) where China has a lead role, to tap into the potential of the free trade bloc comprising the 10-member ASEAN group plus their six FTA partners China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

NATO Statement On The Democratic People’s Republic Of Korea	Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and Ukraine associate themselves with this statement NATO Allies strongly condemn the decisions by the leaders of the Russian Federation and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to dangerously expand Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. In addition to the DPRK’s already substantive support to Russia’s war effort, through the provision of millions of rounds of ammunitions and ballistic missiles, the thousands of combat troops deployed by the DPRK constitutes a dangerous expansion of its ongoing support for Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. The deepening military cooperation between Russia and the DPRK deeply impacts Euro-Atlantic security, with implications also for the Indo-Pacific. Increasing military cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is a breach of multiple UN Security Council resolutions, including 2270 (2016), 1718 (2006), and 1874 (2009). This is particularly egregious given Russia’s status as a Permanent Member of the UN Security Council. We call on Russia to return to compliance with these resolutions and to uphold its international obligations. Russia’s statement on 26 September asserting that the denuclearisation of the DPRK is 'off the table' is unacceptable, as it undermines the global non-proliferation regime, directly contradicts relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and further exacerbates regional tensions. The Russian statement forms part of its wider effort to undermine the global non-proliferation regime and to dismantle UN sanctions. We urge all countries not to provide any kind of assistance to Russia’s aggression, and condemn all those who are facilitating and thereby prolonging Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine. NATO will continue to work with its partners, in particular in the Indo-Pacific, to promote peace and stability, and prevent Russia and those facilitating its war effort from undermining regional and global stability. Allies continue to enhance NATO’s deterrence and defence against all threats and challenges, in all domains, and in multiple strategic directions across the Euro-Atlantic area. Allies remain as resolute as ever in supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes for Ukraine to prevail. Allies and partners continue to step up vital political, military, financial, economic, and humanitarian assistance as Ukraine exercises its inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. Allies are determined to support Ukraine in building a force capable of defeating Russian aggression, in line with the pledge of long-term security assistance for Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfD6N4_oDWhsTiYE-5VYhRG	2024-11-08T09:14:32-08:00	
An Assessment Of Israel’s War As Peace Efforts Grind To A Halt – ...	A year has passed but the war in the Middle East has not slumped. Israel’s many fronts war seems only to be expanding with the direct intervention of Iran. As peace efforts have been sidelined, Israel’s war strategy has been caught adrift, especially with a besieged front in Gaza. At the outset, Israel has mostly withdrawn from the Gaza strip although it has kept a sizable presence in strategic areas such as the Philadelphi corridor among other high grounds, this is fundamentally to prevent any regrouping of Hamas fighters. The Rafah crossing is equally vital for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) since large quantities of infrastructure and material supplies have been funneled through that infamous crossing. Yoav Gallant has publicly acknowledged that Hamas’ military capabilities have been downgraded severely. One of Israel’s core rallying points for the October 7 retaliation was the complete disintegration of Hamas’ military wing coupled with its political arm insomuch that it could never establish an authoritative presence in Gaza. This is confirmed by the continuous bombings in Beit Lahiya a municipality in northern Gaza and the Jabaliya refugee camp despite exterminating Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the ignominious October 7 massacre. In Lebanon, the IDF’s strategy has been to target Hezbollah affiliated sites in and around Beirut while the ground forces are carrying out clearing operations. A relatively small number of Israeli troops are fighting along the border. Whether the IDF will make the grade in pushing Hezbollah beyond the Litani River is still early to predict however in 2006, they were unable to achieve that goal. Meanwhile, attacks from the West Bank are growing in number and lethality whilst the internal security agencies within Israel have contained the threats. Within Israel, there were internal dissensions at play considering what Israel’s Defence Minister had to say about the trajectory of the war. Yoav Gallant wrote a letter to top military officials and cabinet ministers including Benjamin Netanyahu about the direction the war is heading; the Defence Minister has opined that the ongoing war seems aimless. According to former CIA Director David Petraeus, the strategy of 'clear and leave' employed by the IDF is not a viable option. This strategy has certainly worked for Israel in the short-term especially, after the death of key leaders and commanders. But ideally, the approach should have been 'clear, hold, and build' but it is too late for that since the quantum of depredations and destitution in Gaza has crossed epic proportions. In the backdrop of these myriad developments, negotiations are rife in the back channels of war between the US, Lebanon, and Israel as reports of a draft agreement under discussions is slated for 60 days. The onus of this agreement has been entrusted to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) who are required to gradually deploy 10,000 troops as both Hezbollah and the IDF cease attacks, while the US alongside the UN, Europe, and regional states would ensure a 'Monitoring and Enforcement Mechanism' to supervise ceasefire violations including sanctions packages. The ultimate objective is to steer this agreement towards enforcing the UN Resolution 1701. However, this truce effort has been rejected as Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that 'agreements, documents, proposals are not the main point', thus crushing any prospects for brokering a ceasefire settlement. Another ceasefire proposal mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US was aborted. They had designed a cessation-of-hostilities agreement backed by the US advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza. It has several stages. First, a prisoner swap is to be implemented under which the following criteria has to be applied i.e., the IDF has to gradually withdraw and Israel should allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Second, Hamas should release all remaining hostages and Israel should follow suit by releasing a number of Palestinians alongside the withdrawal of all soldiers from Gaza. Third, the end of the blockade and the exchange of dead bodies has to be undertaken. A fourth option beseeches that Hamas should not rearm. Lately, a senior Hamas official Khalil al Hayya has outright rejected a proposal for their safe passage from Gaza so that the hostage deal could be resolved. The reticence shown by Hamas indicates two possible scenarios: on the one hand, Hamas will continue their fight against Israel while on the other, they will prima facie look for avenues to form a government in Gaza. Indeed, Hamas is seeking to build a national unity government in coalition with the Palestinian Authority (PA) clinging on to the idea of a vacuum in the post-war reconstruction of Gaza. As peace efforts in the Middle East grind to a halt, the options for de-escalation appear distant. First, the destruction of Gaza will have ramifications in the long-term as anger against the Israelis is mounting; many disgruntled youths would in all likelihood join Hamas and other militant clusters against Israel. Second, there is no alternative vision to reconstruct Gaza on humanitarian grounds which could perhaps solicit the support of the Arabs if the Israeli government resorts to such a course. Nevertheless, to expect such a directional change in the war from either side is preposterous. Third, Tel Aviv would certainly hold on to vital corridors such as the Philadelphi corridor and the Rafah crossing if future attacks are to be prevented. Fourth, the Biden administration, belatedly, had tightened the noose on Benjamin Netanyahu just before US elections on pertinent issues. Washington pressed for a 30 days timeline under which Israel had to help improve the living conditions in Gaza— allowing aid into Gaza including 90 percent of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza and to provide access to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) which was recently barred by the Israeli Knesset. Finally, the return of Donald Trump to the White House could perhaps a) tighten the noose on Iran and its proxies although that does not preclude the latter would cease to threaten Israel; b) Trump’s foreign policy could facilitate the probable annexation of the West Bank by Israel at the expense of the Palestinians and c) Netanyahu’s discretion in total war against Hamas and Hezbollah may be curtailed by a strong US President. However, until Trump assumes office, Israel’s objectives in Gaza, its ground operations in Lebanon would persevere in full swing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfD6N4_oDWhsZzOW6M4lkqH	2024-11-08T09:13:27-08:00	
Operation Iron Swords: Israel’s Long Game In The Middle East – Op...	Pundits in International Affairs comment that after one year of military exhaustion, Israel’s Operation Iron Swords has made some twisted dynamics in the Middle East as an unmitigated disaster in which both Israel and its foes are equally wounded. For Hamas, the death of its leaders one after another caused a disastrous effect as it may take years for them to revive their organizational apparatus. Israeli’s jubilation over crushing the key leaders in both Hamas and Hezbollah is not long-lasting as their escalation with Iran is symbolic of a new regional conflict, which can undermine the international order. The contention often heard from the commenters in the global affairs is that Israel lacks the long term strategic ability of transforming its massive military victories into a durable political one as Tel Aviv is losing its international partners due to violating the proportionality in the military operations in Gaza and Lebanon . From a vantage point of view, all these arguments are good enough as ingredients for a scholarly soup as the realist position in the war in the Middle East has taken strides in favour of Israel by the strategic victories that the IDF acquired. Iranian entry into the theatre of the Middle East has been sometimes depicted as a turning point, but Tehran and its proxies show less advancement over the Israeli operations in Lebanon indicating the military superiority of the latter. The only significant threat posed by Iran towards Israel lies in deploying its proxies outside the centre of gravity against the Israeli targets. For example, the recent alleged threat reported in Sri Lanka on Israeli tourists visiting the island’s East Coast referred to Iranian agents.One might speculate if Israel has achieved its strategic ambitions from Operation Iron Swords, how would Tel Aviv turn them into a political reality, which would consolidate Israel’s position in the Middle East? In order to address such a question, it is essential to understand whether Israel accomplished what it yearned for after the 7th of October. Here are Israel’s declared strategic and political goals in Operation Iron Swords: In Gaza: 1) To eliminate Hamas’s military power and force the collapse of its rule, with the object of bringing about a situation in which there is no longer any security threat from the Gaza Strip; and 2) to create conditions for the return of the hostages. In Lebanon: To return the residents of the Israeli north to their homes by destroying and pushing Hezbollah forces north of the Litani River. A much more ambitious overarching goal that Israel desires to achieve is to form a new regional security reality bolstering the formidable position of Israel. In achieving this target, Israel aims to dismantle the Iranian proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah that loom before the Israeli boarder causing a severe existential threat and it may not be an exaggeration to contend that Iran will be much weaker without the consistency of these two forces. Country’s dwindling economy which has been stagnated for years is another additional burden for Tehran which reduces its ability to sustain in a long term war against Israel . As American strategic guru Edward Luttwak cleverly argued Iran’s export revenue which earned nearly 80% from oil has been spent on imported components and supplies consumed by the domestic Revolutionary Guards, with its 125,000 troops and a naval force. This includes the imports of Chinese and North Korean missile and rocket components, as well as the foreign-currency costs of the entire nuclear programme which proceeds at a very large scale. The oil export process is mainly located in the Khark island within 1500 km proximity of Israeli airbase. In the UN general assembly, Netanyahu hinted that Israeli’s long arms can extend to Iran’s oil resources, which can certainly collapse Iran’s wounded economy. All in all, from the Iranian front a threat posing against Israel is not much inimical as Israel’s military machinery stands stronger as a lethal threat to Tehran. The challenges loom before Israel in Gaza seem to be more complex regardless of Israel’s military victories over Hamas, in which the latter has been devastated both logistically and numerically. Israel’s dilemma with Gaza is the fact that if it decides to distribute humanitarian aid among Gazans, Israel will become the de facto force ruling Gaza which Tel Aviv does not want. But, this can lead to accelerating the authority of Hamas again even after its eclipse. The history of Hamas since its inception has shown that it contains the ability to relish major blows as the Hamas ideology that its founders nourished remains unaffected. Yet on the strategic front the achievements that Israel earned from its operation Iron Swords elevate Tel Aviv’s status into a powerful position which they did not hold in the region before the 7th of October. Mainly its ability of freeing itself from the threat paranoia from Hezbollah in Lebanon is a deterring factor that fortifies Israel. Overall, Israel seems to have tighten its grip over Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran with the aim of securing its position in a long game, which may alter the security architecture of the Middle at unprecedented level. The other paramount factor adding one more brick to Israel is Trump’s return to the White House for his second term, which has already made many right-wing Israelis jubilant. Considering how the Trump administration supported Israel between 2017 to 2020, it appears to be reasonable to see these latest changes in Washington as catalyst factors changing the chain of events in the Middle East. From the act of moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem to the successful completion of the Abraham Accords in 2020, Trump’s actions appeased Tel Aviv. In return, Israel backed out of the plot to assassinate Iranian General Soleimani in January 2020, which frustrated Trump and even became a point of discussion during the presidential election. Despite the troubling memory of Israel’s broken promise, Trump’s second term is likely to be favorable to Tel Aviv, as he would oppose bringing the Palestinian Authority to Gaza or moving earnestly toward a two-state solution. With the military victories earned by IDF for past few months, Israel can begin a fresh start when Trump enters the White House on the 20th of January. It can also be presumed that Trump may support Israel to launch pre-emptive strikes on Iran nuclear reactors as an emulation of what Israel achieved against Iraq in 1981, which completely wiped out Saddam Hussain’s nuclear ambition.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfD6N4_oDWhsRF0AU-gMurN	2024-11-08T09:12:00-08:00

Hegemonic Masculinity As A Political Strategy For Donald Trump’s ...	Donald Trump's historic success in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election can be significantly linked to his representation of hegemonic masculinity, which resonate with traits such as strength, authority, and assertiveness. Trump's political identity and campaign strategies, characterized by resilience, assertiveness, and a defiance of established norms, struck a chord with voters who felt marginalized by evolving gender dynamics and progressive social movements. Through his rhetoric and media portrayal, Trump leveraged these gendered power dynamics, solidifying the appeal of hegemonic masculinity as pivotal to leadership and political achievement in modern America. The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election appears to be significantly influenced by narratives intricately linked to established gender power dynamics, especially the notion of hegemonic masculinity. This sociological framework, which denotes the prevailing form of masculinity within a society, significantly influences political ideologies, the attractiveness of candidates, and the results of elections. Donald Trump’s persona, political style, and strategies during the campaign illustrate the substantial impacts of hegemonic masculinity traits on his electoral success. Therefore, the hegemonic masculinity, left indelible imprints within the political sphere, its expression in Donald Trump’s political persona, and its significant impact on his achievements in the 2024 election. Understanding Hegemonic Masculinity Hegemonic masculinity, a concept initially articulated by sociologist R.W. Connell in the 1980s, denotes the culturally prevailing ideal of masculinity that is regarded as the standard within a particular society. It is defined by attributes such as physical strength, dominance, aggression, emotional stoicism, competitiveness, and sexual virility. These characteristics are frequently regarded as the standard for defining a 'true man' within a specific cultural context. Hegemonic masculinity functions as a systemic power framework rather than merely an individual identity, reinforcing patriarchal norms while simultaneously marginalizing those who deviate from traditional gender expressions, such as femininity, homosexuality, and various forms of gender diversity (Connell, 1995). The concept of masculinity is dynamic; it is shaped by social constructs and differs across various cultures and historical periods. Nevertheless, specific elements consistently persist, such as the oppression of women and the disparagement of alternative masculinities that diverge from this dominant standard. Within this context, political candidates—particularly male politicians—tend to portray themselves in a manner that aligns with the anticipated traits of strength, control, and dominance linked to prevailing masculine ideals. The Role of Hegemonic Masculinity in Politics In the political sphere, hegemonic masculinity significantly influences how the public perceives leaders and assesses their effectiveness. Political leaders who embrace this ideal frequently attract significant support from voters, especially those who equate masculinity with robust leadership. In a country such as the United States, where political discussions frequently revolve around power dynamics, strength, and authority, the influence of hegemonic masculinity can profoundly affect voter behavior, ultimately shaping electoral results. The concept of hegemonic masculinity in the realm of politics is complicatedly connected to the nuances of political discourse, the formulation of campaign strategies, and the representations found within media portrayals. It shapes the perception of candidates regarding their leadership capabilities, negotiation skills, and ability to tackle challenges effectively. Voters frequently gravitate towards candidates who embody conventional masculine characteristics—those who present a strong stance on matters such as crime, national security, and foreign policy, while embracing positions that resonate with ideals of strength and authority. The phenomenon has been particularly pronounced in the context of Donald Trump, who has adeptly utilized the notion of hegemonic masculinity to craft a persuasive narrative surrounding his political persona. The focus of his campaign consistently highlights themes of resilience, tackling both domestic matters (like immigration and crime) and international challenges (including trade and military strategy). Trump’s emphasis on 'law and order,' his pledges to restore the nation’s stature, and his confrontational stance towards the media and political elites have established him as a prominent embodiment of assertive masculinity in the American political landscape. Donald Trump's 'America First' policy is closely aligned with hegemonic masculinity, especially in its approach to conventional security threats. This policy underscores national strength, military superiority, and unilateral decision-making, presenting a vision of America as a preeminent global power, aligned with the principles of hegemonic masculinity—strength, control, and aggression. Trump’s emphasis on military strength, border protection, and economic independence underscores the concept of American masculinity as inherently robust and self-sufficient. His rhetoric frequently frames America as requiring a restoration of its supremacy, addressing external threats—such as terrorism, China, and illegal immigration—through assertive, 'tough' measures, reminiscent of the conventional masculine characteristic of aggression. Donald Trump’s Hegemonic Masculinity Donald Trump's political identity is closely associated with the representation of hegemonic masculinity, a concept that highlights characteristics such as strength, control, aggression, and dominance. Trump's identity as a leader has consistently centered on these masculine ideals, which are firmly rooted in conventional American concepts of power. His political rhetoric, frequently marked by bold statements and a lack of concern for conventional decorum, positions him as the quintessential 'tough' leader who boldly confronts established norms and asserts his authority. The characteristics of hegemonic masculinity strongly connect with white working-class male voters who experience a sense of alienation due to changes in gender roles and power dynamics within society. Trump's hegemonic masculinity approach has played a crucial role in his political achievements, framing him as a champion of conventional values in opposition to what he and his followers perceive as the feminization or dilution of American society. His portrayal as a formidable and pragmatic leader capable of commanding respect has positioned him as an emblem of strength, resonating with voters who perceive in him a dismissal of contemporary political correctness and a commitment to decisive action in both domestic and international affairs. His confrontational approach to political adversaries, especially women, solidifies his portrayal as a commanding male presence in a sector historically led by men, thereby reinforcing the notion that authority is to be established through force and dominance. Trump's leadership approach, characterized by a steadfast assurance in his capacity to command the political arena and global affairs, serves as a distinct representation of dominant masculinity. His political decisions, including the emphasis on military strength and a strong focus on immigration control, reinforce his position as a representative of conventional, patriarchal masculinity. In this context, Trump's appeal is anchored in his portrayal as a dominant leader, a persona that continues to resonate with significant portions of the American electorate. Election Campaigns During the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election campaign, Trump's rhetoric and public appearances were meticulously designed to resonate with his voters’ perception of hegemonic masculinity. Through his speeches and social media communications, Trump highlighted his assertiveness, confrontational nature, and unapologetic stance—traits that strongly appealed to his voters. Unlike the typically measured and diplomatic strategies employed by other candidates, Trump's campaign was characterized by assertive and confrontational rhetoric. The employment of 'fight' imagery, including phrases like 'take back America' and 'drain the swamp,' resonated with voters’ aspirations for a leader capable of asserting authority and countering perceived threats to the nation’s stability. This form of rhetoric aligns with the broader cultural narrative surrounding hegemonic masculinity, portraying the ideal leader as someone who remains resolute in adversity and is prepared to tackle challenges directly. Trump leveraged his unique persona to set himself apart from his rivals, especially those affiliated with conventional political establishments. His self-presentation as an outsider—unconstrained by the norms of Washington politics—bolstered his image as a robust figure capable of confronting the political elite. By presenting himself as the advocate for 'ordinary Americans' in the face of perceived threats from immigrants, foreign adversaries, and progressive social movements, Trump’s campaign effectively leveraged themes of dominance and defiance against external pressures. Furthermore, Trump's media strategy played a pivotal role in the manifestation of hegemonic masculinity throughout the campaign. He leveraged his media presence to enhance his reputation as a bold leader unafraid to express his views, frequently at the expense of conventional political decorum. This bold expression of masculinity was positioned as a strength rather than a drawback, resonating with a portion of the electorate that felt disconnected from what they viewed as the gentleness or fragility of the political establishment. Trump’s Victory The outcome of the 2024 election in favor of Trump can be partially linked to the prevalent endorsement of traditional masculine ideals among a considerable segment of the American voting population. The acceptance of this phenomenon is not uniform; however, it is notably pronounced within specific demographics, including white working-class voters, evangelical Christians, and rural communities. These groups, perceiving a decline in their cultural and economic influence amid evolving social dynamics, frequently interpret Trump’s endorsement of traditional masculinity as a means of countering this perceived erosion. The concept of hegemonic masculinity significantly influenced Trump's capacity to rally his supporters. A significant portion of his electorate perceived that their identities as men were being sidelined by modern social movements advocating for gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and feminist initiatives. Trump's rhetoric frequently featured anti-feminist undertones and direct appeals to male voters, effectively reinforcing a sense of solidarity among those who perceived a threat from the feminist movement and evolving gender norms. By presenting himself as a champion of traditional masculinity, Trump successfully brought together a substantial segment of the electorate that felt disconnected from the changing dynamics of gender roles. In the framework of the 2024 election, the appeal of Trump's brand of hegemonic masculinity transcended personal identity, serving as a calculated political strategy that enabled him to convey strength and authority on issues that profoundly connected with his supporters. Trump's success in the 2024 election transcends the boundaries of his political platform or economic policies. This outcome represents a triumph for a specific interpretation of masculinity that prioritizes strength, authority, and opposition to advancing social movements. This portrayal of masculinity is one that Trump has consistently represented throughout his career and one that continues to connect with a substantial portion of the American electorate. Conclusion Ultimately, the concept of hegemonic masculinity significantly influenced Donald Trump’s success in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Through the embodiment and promotion of characteristics linked to dominant masculinity—such as strength, aggression, and control—Trump successfully shaped a political identity that resonated with a significant portion of voters who regarded these traits as vital for effective leadership. Through his campaign rhetoric, media strategies, and public persona, Trump established himself as a champion of hegemonic masculinity during a time of societal evolution, leveraging anxieties surrounding cultural decline and shifts in gender norms. The 2024 election illustrated that hegemonic masculinity remains a significant influence in American politics, affecting both voter preferences and the fundamental characteristics of political discourse. The connection Trump established with his voters through the framework of masculine power played a crucial role in his electoral success, highlighting the persistent impact of gendered power dynamics within the political landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfx1oYP38RQLOcLJFo2FbkV	2024-11-08T09:05:54-08:00	
Reflections On The US Election – OpEd	Not surprisingly, the mainstream media are in disbelief over the results of the presidential election. That’s because they live in an intellectual ghetto. Instead of just talking to each other, it would be so nice if they actually spent time talking to those who work in housekeeping, the cafeteria, maintenance and security. Will they change now that they have been proven wrong? Not at all. They are hopelessly incapable of changing, though they love to say that the public has a hard time accepting change. Not so. They do. Does money count in elections? Not as much as many think. Harris raised over $1 billion and wound up $20 million in debt in the final week. Trump spent half as much, over $400 million. In the few weeks before the election, Bill Gates gave Harris $50 million, and Michael Bloomberg followed with another $50 million. George Soros topped them both. Do celebrities matter? They may if they occasionally show up for a rally or fundraiser. But Harris went overboard, bringing in Oprah, Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Jennifer Lopez et al. She also went on Saturday Night Live before the election. This actually hurt her. Why? She was already seen as a lightweight, the word-salad queen, so being surrounded by celebrities only fed the perception that she was not a serious person. Why were so many of the polls wrong? Because most of them never corrected for the Trump supporters who simply won’t speak to them. They don’t trust them, and, importantly, they know it is not popular in many circles to admit being for Trump. The pollster that was the most accurate was J.L. Partners. Based in the U.S., it was founded by pollsters for the British Prime Minister; it published its results with the Daily Mail, a conservative U.K. publication. It was one of the few that got it right: it said in the run-up to the election that Trump had a 54 percent chance of winning. McLaughlin & Associates also did a good job. Pollsters often ask the wrong questions, or they don’t dig deep enough. For example, the media kept reporting that Trump’s unfavorability rating was significantly higher than Harris’. On election day, Nate Silver, who runs an influential survey site, reported that Trump’s unfavorability score was 8.6 points higher than his favorability score. For Harris, her unfavorable rating was 2.0 points higher than her favorable rating. A more important question is how the public views the candidates on their leadership abilities and their ability to get things done. A month before the election, Gallup found that when it comes to who is a strong and decisive leader, Trump outscored Harris 59 percent to 48 percent. On their ability to get things done, Trump won 61-49. Exit polls on election day found that his numbers increased significantly on related measures. In other words, an election is not a popularity contest. It is about issues and who is the most likely to govern effectively. Billy Martin, who coached the New York Yankees, was hard to deal with. Bobby Knight, who coached the University of Indiana basketball team, could be obnoxious. Bill Belichick, who coached the New England Patriots, was surly. Unlikeable though they were, they were also great leaders who knew how to win. Ergo, while Trump’s persona may strike many as offensive, few question his ability to get things done, and that is what counts in the end. Democratic strategist James Carville warned Democrats in October that Harris was not getting her message out. This misses the point. She had no message. That was her problem. Being against Trump is not a message—it’s a feeling: it doesn’t tell voters what policies you want to implement. Admittedly, she was put in a delicate position. Joe Biden dropped out after the debate in June because the media could no longer pretend that he wasn’t mentally challenged. They covered up for him for years, but could do so no longer. Harris never faced a challenger—she was anointed—and proved incapable of separating herself from his policies. More than anything else, it was the politics of extremism that did her in. Flooding the economy with funny money drove prices sky high Allowing millions of migrants to crash our borders and then be rewarded with better services from the government than are afforded homeless veterans angered millions Playing catch and release with violent criminals was indefensible Forgiving student loans for the middle and upper classes while making the working class pay for them was infuriating Promoting policies that allow children to change their sex behind their parents’ back was mindboggling Allowing boys to compete against girls in sports and shower with them was morally bankrupt Allowing the FBI to spy on Catholics was malicious Inviting foreign aggression was irresponsible These policies did Harris in. For the most part, the American people do not want extremists on the right or the left in office. Thank God for that.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfx1oYP38RQLGNJ3VIbb4xz	2024-11-08T09:04:02-08:00	
Overpopulated India Leading To Social Tension And Unrest – OpEd	Chief minister of Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has triggered widespread concern with his recent statement that families should have more children than at present. The Chief Minister of Indian state of Tamil Nadu has also said that each family should have sixteen children. Such views of two chief minsters have shocked the discerning people in India and as a matter of fact, several people think that these are careless and thoughtless remarks. It is well recognized that India is now a over populated country with one of the highest population density amongst all countries in the world. The views of the two chief ministers go completely against the national consensus on two child norm. It is extremely difficult to understand why such statements were made by these two chief ministers, who ought to know better. India's alarming population growth & likely scenario in future The Indian population which was around 35.9 crore in 1950 have now surged to around 144 crore in 2024. Population is likely to increase at not less than 0.8 % per annum, if the present trend were to continue , particularly since population is still increasing and also that average life span pf people is increasing and longevity is now around 65 years, which has much improved compared to earlier period. Indian population is likely to touch more than 170 crore people by the year 2050. India's population density India's population density has steadily increased over the years from 428.19 people per square kilometre in 2021` to 438.58 people per square kilometre in 2024. India has one of the highest population density in the world amongst all countries. Growth in economy and job opportunities unlikely to match the population growth The Indian population level and population density has already reached an alarming level and the adverse impact is already evident. In spite of impressive growth of Indian economy and progress in industrial, agricultural and services sector particularly during the last ten years, significant section of Indian population still remain below poverty line or just above poverty line. In other words, the economic growth is unable to catch up with the population growth. With the population increasing, it is necessary to create adequate employment opportunities for people at different skill level. Any view that in tune with the future population growth, generation of large number of jobs at different level and promotion of skill amongst the people as required by the level of population can be created is an Utopian expectation. This would be particularly so, since the emphasis in the various projects that contribute to economic growth, would be on greater automation, less manpower requirement and more so in the context of recent developments such as artificial intelligence. Future technological changes would result in less manpower requirement for various tasks. Such view amount to wishful thinking and certainly not based on ground realities in India. It is easily said than done. Increasing level of population and inability to keep the people engaged by providing employment adequately is bound to cause social tension and unrest. It is said that the idle brain is the devil's workshop. So-called demographic dividend It is vaguely said that growing population would provide demographic dividend for India. This statement is incorrect and would prove to be wrong , as demographic dividend can be availed only if jobs would be made available to the population at different skill level.It is extremely difficult to get the possible demographic dividend as it is already evident now with the level of unemployment in the country. India may become large exporter of migrants The future trend in the densely populated India is likely to be that more and more people from India would be seeking jobs abroad and seek migration to other advanced countries. They would be forced to do so , due to lack of job opportunities in India with the steady growth in Indian population level and population density. It is quite likely that in the coming years , several advanced countries would feel concerned about the growing entry of migrants from India , which may disturb the demographic balance in the countries and probably create social issues and tension. Such migrants entering the advanced countries would become unwelcome people. India's population carrying capacity Factors to be considered: • Level of economic growth already achieved and growth likely to be achieved in the coming years. • Land size of India.• Availability of natural resources • Likely water scarcity.• Ability to create jobs in large number to meet the need of increasing population.• Unsustainable urban migration due to lack of job opportunities• Waste generation and consequent environmental issues. India has to strive to reduce the population density by bringing down the population level in a gradual and painless manner over the next few years. Taking a holistic view, it can be said that the optimum population for India is around one hundred crore people. If and when India were to achieve this level of one hundred crore population, India would certainly emerge as one of the most prosperous countries in the world. Strategies There is a need for the strong compaign, as in the last several years, the campaign to check population growth has not been conspicuous and not visibly seen. On the other hand, the country has been brain washed with the view that population growth is unlikely to be a threat, as birth rate is tapering down and fertility rate in several states in India have already reached replacement level of 2.1 and economic growth would be sustained. Common man has not been told in clear terms about the grave issues that would arise due to further increase in Indian population, which may increase by another 40 crore in the coming years before stabilizing. This would be an unbearable burden on the nation. Empowerment of women Empowerment of women and creation of awareness amongst women about the need for population control is the primary requisite. This can be done only by vigorous public campaign. Need for one child policy for some period India has to frame one child policy per family, which China implemented successfully, in spite of the fact that China's land area is much larger than that of India and China's density of population is lower than that of India. China has brought down the population growth level within acceptable limits by one child policy and is now stabilizing the population by appropriate measures. Of course, China adopted dictatorial methods, which India cannot do in view of India's highly desirable democratic structure. The only way out is that one child policy must be implemented by persuasion and by disincentivising more than one child family. Fix population sustainability index Since the extent of population growth is different in different states, population sustainability index has to be fixed for each state. This policy should fix a specific population target for each state, which is necessary for the nation at this juncture. Ban polygamy Any man marrying more than one woman should be banned by law, to curtail the population increase and to protect the dignity of women. Prognosis Central and state governments should realise that India has not time to lose and India's future stability can be ensured only by achieving affordable population level, which could be several crores less than the present level.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfx1oYP38RQLBJBvza5r3Ie	2024-11-08T09:02:26-08:00	
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) And The Path To Pakistan’s Econom...	Pakistan, like many developing countries, faces numerous challenges in revitalizing its economy. However, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and an increase in exports are two powerful catalysts that can significantly contribute to the country's economic recovery. These elements are not only instrumental in revitalizing sagging economies but also in setting a nation on the path to sustained economic development. The inflow of FDI signals investor confidence in the revival of Pakistan's economy, while boosting exports generates foreign exchange to finance essential imports and promotes industrial development, leading to job creation. FDI is one of the most effective ways to rejuvenate an economy, particularly in countries like Pakistan, which are grappling with financial instability and limited resources. The arrival of foreign investment not only provides capital but also helps improve technological infrastructure, fosters innovation, and creates jobs through projects initiated by foreign investors. Importantly, it sends a positive message to the global market about the country’s economic potential, encouraging other international investors to consider the local market. Pakistan has witnessed increasing foreign investment from key players in the Middle East and Asia. Countries like China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar have committed to injecting capital into various sectors of Pakistan's economy. The recent visits of high-profile delegations underscore this growing confidence. In August, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang visited Pakistan, during which 13 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) were signed, emphasizing cooperation in security, education, agriculture, and the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This phase is expected to bolster connectivity and boost economic ties between the two nations. Saudi Arabia, too, has pledged significant investment in Pakistan. A Saudi delegation led by Investment Minister Khalid Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Falih visited Pakistan recently, committing to a $2.8 billion investment. This is an increase from the original $2.2 billion pledged during the previous visit. This is in addition to the $5 billion commitment made by Crown Prince Salman Bin Abdul Aziz during a past visit. The UAE also recently announced a $10 billion investment in Pakistan, while Qatar committed to investing $3 billion. These pledges were made through the platform of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which aims to streamline and expedite foreign investments in Pakistan. Azerbaijan, too, is contributing to the cause, with a $2 billion investment commitment. These developments are significant indicators of the global community's confidence in Pakistan's economic future, given that these investments are contingent upon sustained economic recovery and growth. Alongside FDI, an increase in exports plays a vital role in revitalizing Pakistan’s economy. Exports generate the much-needed foreign exchange to support the import of vital goods, such as oil, machinery, and raw materials for industrial production. Moreover, as exports grow, so does the country’s industrial sector, which in turn enhances job opportunities and stimulates economic activity. Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) highlights a positive trend in exports. In the first quarter of the year, Pakistan’s exports reached $7.495 billion, marking a 7.82% increase compared to the same period last year. The textile and footwear sectors have shown particular growth, with footwear exports rising to $45.136 million in the first quarter, compared to $41.192 million in the same period last year. This increase in exports not only boosts the economy but also enhances Pakistan’s trade relations with other countries, further diversifying its economic partners. Pakistan’s bilateral trade with Uzbekistan also underscores the growing export potential. In 2023, Pakistan and Uzbekistan signed a $1 billion deal to increase trade between the two nations, with plans for further discussions to maximize the benefits of this agreement. Such collaborations are critical for Pakistan, as they open up new avenues for trade and help reduce the country’s dependency on traditional export markets. The impact of the government’s economic policies is also evident in the industrial sector. Major projects in sectors like power generation, mining, and electric vehicles (EV) are gaining momentum, providing a glimpse of a promising industrial future for Pakistan. Hub Power Company Ltd, Pakistan's largest independent power producer, is expanding into lithium mining, battery manufacturing, and electric vehicle production under the SIFC. This move will cater to the growing global demand for rechargeable batteries used in mobile phones, laptops, and automobiles, thus positioning Pakistan as a key player in the emerging EV industry. Additionally, the government is developing a 15,000-acre industrial park on Pakistan Steel Mills land as part of a broader strategy to establish nine special economic zones under CPEC. These zones are expected to attract foreign investment and contribute to Pakistan’s industrial growth by providing infrastructure and facilitating production in key sectors. The economic recovery in Pakistan is not just a product of foreign investments and export growth but also of positive macroeconomic indicators. Inflation has dropped below 7%, and interest rates are on a downward trajectory, with the State Bank of Pakistan reducing the policy rate from 17.7% to 15%. Foreign exchange reserves have crossed the $10 billion mark, and remittances have shown an encouraging rise. The stock market is also performing well, with the KSE 100 Index surpassing the 91,000 mark for the first time. International financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF have also expressed optimism about Pakistan’s economic prospects. The World Bank expects Pakistan’s GDP to grow by 2.8% in FY25, while the IMF has acknowledged the country’s improved policymaking, noting that inflation has reached its lowest level in three years, and international reserves have more than doubled. However, the path to sustained economic growth is contingent upon political stability. While economic recovery is underway, political uncertainty remains a threat. The opposition party, PTI, has been actively creating disruptions and undermining the government’s efforts, which could derail the economic recovery. Political stability is critical to maintaining investor confidence, and any disruption could negatively impact the growth momentum. Foreign Direct Investment and an increase in exports are two crucial pillars that can help Pakistan overcome its economic challenges. The commitment of key countries like China, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar to invest in Pakistan reflects growing international confidence in the country’s economic revival. Furthermore, the rise in exports and positive industrial developments signal a hopeful future. However, political stability is essential to ensuring these gains are sustained and that Pakistan remains on a path toward sustained economic development. Political parties, particularly PTI, must recognize the importance of unity and work together to promote the country’s interests above political rivalry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcLLGibGsLXfu6mFSNniVz8	2024-11-08T09:00:12-08:00	
Evaluating The Security Impact Of Pakistan’s Taliban Outreach Pol...	Imran Khan’s long-standing support for dialogue with the Taliban and similar factions has had considerable implications for Pakistan’s security. Initially, Khan’s advocacy for peace negotiations with groups such as the TTP was seen as a bold move to curtail violence in Pakistan. However, as terrorist attacks rise across the country, critics argue that his policies have inadvertently emboldened these factions, risking the safety of Pakistani citizens and challenging the state’s ability to control extremist activities. Khan’s Stance on the Taliban Since his days as an opposition leader, Imran Khan has called for a reconciliatory approach toward the Taliban, emphasizing that dialogue over military action could address the grievances fueling their activities. He has, on multiple occasions, publicly sympathized with the Taliban’s anti-Western rhetoric, earning him the moniker 'Taliban Khan' in some circles. Khan contended that peace could be achieved through understanding rather than confrontation, a perspective that, while appealing to some, overlooked the deep-seated ideological motives driving groups like the TTP. Policy Shortcomings and the Surge in Attacks Following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan, Pakistan has experienced an upsurge in attacks. Statistics indicate that militant activities have nearly doubled since the U.S. withdrawal, with the TTP and other groups feeling emboldened by Khan’s overtures. Security experts argue that Khan’s approach has fostered a perception of Pakistan as willing to compromise with extremists, thereby diminishing the deterrent effect that a firm counter-terrorism stance would provide. This pattern suggests a crucial oversight in Khan’s approach: by extending a hand of reconciliation without stringent conditions, he inadvertently allowed extremist factions to regroup and strengthen. The TTP, for instance, capitalized on the peace negotiations to consolidate its networks, increasing its operational capacity and resources. As a result, Pakistani citizens are now facing one of the worst waves of terrorism in recent history, with attacks targeting public spaces, government offices, and border areas alike. Implications for Regional and International Relations The repercussions of Khan’s policies are felt beyond Pakistan’s borders. Countries in the region, particularly Afghanistan, India, and Iran, have voiced concerns about the spillover effects of Pakistan’s leniency toward extremist factions. The recent statements by the Taliban, urging Pakistan to engage in dialogue with Imran Khan’s supporters, reflect an uneasy dynamic. They raise questions about Pakistan’s autonomy in decision-making and its influence over cross-border militancy. From an international standpoint, Khan’s reconciliation policies could have broader diplomatic implications. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has maintained pressure on Pakistan to strengthen its counter-terrorism financing frameworks, and any perceived leniency risks further scrutiny. International actors expect Pakistan to demonstrate a clear stance against extremism, and policies that suggest otherwise can harm Pakistan’s economic and diplomatic ties. Public Disillusionment and Calls for Change The public response within Pakistan has been mixed but increasingly critical. Many Pakistanis question the wisdom of accommodating groups responsible for years of violence and instability. Families affected by terrorist violence, as well as members of the security forces, have voiced their disapproval of any policy that appears to grant legitimacy to these groups. This growing disillusionment poses political risks for Khan and his party, as citizens become frustrated with a security approach that appears to prioritize appeasement over safety. Historical Context and Lessons Pakistan’s previous peace deals with militant groups reveal a troubling pattern. In past agreements, such as those in Swat and Waziristan, extremists exploited the periods of ceasefire to bolster their ranks and resources. Instead of leading to sustainable peace, these deals often resulted in a renewed surge of violence once the factions had regained strength. Khan’s policies, which echo this strategy of reconciliation, appear to be repeating these mistakes, as militant groups use negotiations as a cover to advance their agendas. Conclusion Imran Khan’s outreach policies toward the Taliban and TTP, while grounded in a desire for peace, have ultimately weakened Pakistan’s security framework. The country now faces an increased threat of terrorism, amplified by factions that see Khan’s policies as an invitation to escalate their activities. Moving forward, Pakistan needs a more stringent approach that unequivocally opposes terrorism. Only through a consistent and uncompromising counter-terrorism strategy can Pakistan hope to safeguard its citizens and restore public confidence in its security apparatus.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcLLGibGsLXfrP2pTsu94SY	2024-11-08T08:58:38-08:00	
Fantasies Of Free Market Under Capitalism – OpEd	The concept of the 'free market' under capitalism is often promoted as an emblem of individual consumer choice and a driver of national economic growth and development. The priests of capitalism view the free market as the most effective and efficient mechanism for resource allocation, framing it as a key engine of economic progress. However, in practice, the free market is neither free nor fair for producers and consumers. Instead, it is largely controlled by capitalist interests. This idealised notion of a free market under capitalism becomes a mechanism that separates producers from consumers, establishing independent pricing structures designed to generate super-profits—often at the expense of working people. In a capitalist system, 'free market' implies that the state, government, and working masses—as both producers and consumers—cannot interfere in the market’s operations. Instead, market forces alone control prices, production, supply, demand, distribution, and consumption. Within this framework, the purchasing power of consumers and the productive capacities of producers determine individuals' perceived worth. Price, rather than intrinsic value, dictates everything in a free market. As a result, it is often fictitious desires, rather than genuine human needs, that shape the culture of the capitalist free market. The belief in the free market as an ideal under capitalism, championed by the Chicago School, has not only distorted economics as a discipline but has also eroded the social and moral foundations of the market once based on trust between consumers and producers regarding price, quality, and value. Capitalism’s version of free market undermines this trust, rendering market interactions impersonal, where consumers and producers are unknown to each other. Furthermore, neither symmetric nor asymmetric information is adequately accessible to producers and consumers concerning demand, supply, and pricing. As a result, the notion of perfect competition in the so-called free market under capitalism becomes a myth. Ultimately, it is the arbitrary nature of this free market that defines the system. Governments provide both legal protection and security for the so-called free market under capitalism, allowing it to operate with minimal risk. When the free-market faces crises, the state and government step in to rescue it. The rules and regulations of the free market are neither neutral nor natural; rather, they are designed to protect the interests of the capitalist classes. Market forces establish their own rules to maintain dominance over economic activities, backed by the approval of the state and government. Thus, there is no inherent virtue in an unfettered 'free market'; it is a capitalist project and a tool of exploitation of consumers and producers, legitimised by state and government. The free market serves as a tool for transferring resources and wealth from the masses to a small, capitalist elite. It functions as a system for profit accumulation, aimed at expanding capitalism and benefiting capitalists. Today, the fundamentalist belief in the free market and its absolutist nature act like an opiate for policymakers, driven either by ignorance or a conscious choice to overlook the market's history, social origins, and moral foundations. The capitalist voices like George Soros describe the free market as a system in which 'the doctrine of laissez-faire capitalism holds that the common good is best served by the uninhibited pursuit of self-interest.' In reality, however, there is little common ground between capitalists and the working masses, who are both producers and consumers. The free market does not offer genuine economic freedom to consumers or producers; instead, it is the antithesis of freedom and choice for both groups. It imposes control over production and consumption by manipulating the processes, institutions, and structures of the free-market economy and its culture. The free market has failed to allocate resources effectively and efficiently. As a process, a project, and an institution, it has not succeeded in delivering and distributing resources, products, and services according to genuine human needs and desires. Free market has accelerated different forms of inequalities and undermined all attempts to achieve equality. It is time to reclaim the social and moral foundations of the market, where both consumers and producers are truly free to produce and consume. Saving the free market from capitalism and its proponents is essential. Free producers and free consumers can only establish free and fair market that works based on human trust and values of human needs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcLLGibGsLXfg_-DYCn0U0V	2024-11-08T08:56:52-08:00	
How A Swiss-Led Global Network Fosters Greater Access To AI – Ana...	Switzerland is spearheading a global initiative to promote equal access to artificial intelligence (AI), regardless of a country’s economic strength or political power. Three pilot projects demonstrate the power of pooled international resources to boost AI research into some of the world’s most pressing problems. By Matthew Allen AI is widely acknowledged as a breakthrough technology that can power rapid advances in many areas of scientific research, from weather predictions to medicine and energy. But there is also a danger that resource-rich countries and companies could monopolise the new generation of powerful computers. While perceived as slow to adapt national laws to govern the use of AI domestically, Switzerland has now earned praise on the international stage for promoting the sharing of AI expertise and experience worldwide. The Swiss-led initiative, called the International Computation and AI Network (ICAIN), aims to matchmake scientific projects in developing nations with the most cutting-edge supercomputers and the world’s best AI know-how to create a level playing field. 'We observe a huge power imbalance,' Katharina Frey, deputy head of digital foreign policy at the Swiss foreign ministry, told SWI swissinfo.ch. 'There are a handful of companies worldwide capable of developing large-scale models, while the majority of the world does not have access to this level of computing power.' Pushing back against inequality Besides the Swiss foreign ministry, the founding members of ICAIN also include the federal institutes of technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) and Lausanne (EPFL), the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems, Data Science Africa, plus supercomputer centres in Switzerland and Finland. 'It is important that ICAIN is pushing back against inequality of access to AI,' said Ciira Maina, chair of Data Science Africa. 'Big tech is in itself not a bad thing – we all use the products. But it’s important to have a varied ecosystem in place.' Launched in January, ICAIN supports two science projects in Africa and an AI initiative with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Each project is granted access to supercomputers and leading academic AI experts. The ICAIN network closely follows a United Nations call for equal access to AI. In a September report, the UN singled out ICAIN as an example of how global resource-sharing AI networks can promote sustainability goals. 'Advanced economies have both the capability and duty to facilitate AI capacity-building through international collaboration,' the report reads. In the context of ICAIN, what are the practical implications of this? According to Maina, who’s also a professor of electrical engineering and data science at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Kenya, international collaboration can boost African research into weather predictions and identifying crop diseases. 'Bringing on board more computing power is an exciting new ingredient because it means we can do this research on a larger scale,' said Maina. 'ICAIN has unlocked high-quality expertise and access to high-level computers.' Protecting sensitive data AI is able to crunch more data in machines that can be trained to 'think' for themselves, learning as they go along. This leads to a higher rate of computation and a greater variety of solutions to problems. This computational bounty could also prove beneficial to the humanitarian work carried out by the ICRC. The ICRC relies on vast amounts of case files and field notes obtained from their workers on the ground, supplemented by data from satellites, for example. The ICRC hopes that Large Language Models – AI systems trained to understand and interpret large volumes of data – can make better sense of the continuous flow of ever-changing data that derives from chaotic situations, allowing it to better plan and mobilise operations. 'We see how AI is reshaping warfare and the direct impact this has on civilians in conflict zones,' said Blaise Robert, who advises the humanitarian organisation on AI. 'AI also presents important potential to improve the way we deliver humanitarian aid.' Swiss initiative It is also important to the ICRC that ICAIN allows it to retain complete control over sensitive data. 'Retaining the trust of the people we talk with in sensitive situations depends on our capacity to maintain the confidentiality of that dialogue,' said Robert. 'It’s very important that the ICRC keeps very tight control of its data. We need to be certain we are not dependent on certain actors who could later bring negative operational consequences.' Maina from Data Science Africa praised Switzerland for taking the initiative to get ICAIN off the ground. 'Many people have been talking about the AI inequality problem, but sometimes it takes leadership to bring the right people together in the same room to solve problems collaboratively,' he said. 'We have started with a seed that can hopefully fuel more global interaction and bring new partners on board.' Switzerland may have initiated ICAIN, but the Swiss foreign ministry says it has no desire to control its operations and continued growth into other regions of the world. The plan is to create an independent legal entity in Switzerland that will manage the matchmaking between scientific projects and AI resources. Sustainability and justice Details of the association are yet to be released but the idea is to free the body from any suggestion of political interference by countries. 'We absolutely need initiatives that aim to create alternatives to the current political economy behind AI, which is dominated by a handful of enormously big global companies,' Angela Müller, head of policy at the NGO Algorithm Watch Switzerland, told SWI swissinfo.ch. 'ICAIN should not limit itself to focusing on how we can use more and more AI to promote sustainability or justice, but also on how we can make AI itself more sustainable and just,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWco__jhnAERvcgjojmG4DSc	2024-11-07T16:50:14-08:00	
Fighting The Rat Menace In Cities: The NYC Experiment – Analysis	By Ramanath Jha Recently, New York City’s (NYC) proposed experiment with rodent contraceptives to combat rats became global news. The step was labelled by the city mayor as a 'new paradigm in urban rat management.' The city council recently approved the deployment of ContraPest, a type of rodent birth control tool, to be tested in limited areas of the city. Its developer, US biotechnology company SenesTech, claims that it provides a humane and sustainable choice for long-term rodent management. Based on the success of the city’s trial, a new approach might be taken to deal with NYC’s about 3 million rats. If successful, this experiment could mark a departure from traditional methods of rodent control. Rats have been known to co-exist with humans in cities for centuries. They have also been a nuisance in cities all over the world. They are a risk to human health and a danger to built structures, electrical cables, and parked cars. They could result in a major loss of food grains stored inside granaries. The World Health Organization (WHO) for instance, estimated that rat control measures in Mumbai alone could save enough food to feed 90,000 people annually. Studies conducted in India indicate that 2.5 percent of all food grains stored in India are lost to rodents. A conservative analysis estimated that between 1930 and 2022, rats caused a loss of US$ 3.6 billion to the world’s economy. Rats contaminate food and animal feed, introducing unwelcome parasites such as fleas, lice and ticks into the human habitat. They can cause allergies, rat bite fever, scrub typhus, leishmania and plague. At times, their activities could lead to salmonellosis (food poisoning). The COVID-19 pandemic, forced rats to discover new food sources. Rodentologists estimate that hundreds of thousands of rats were killed during the pandemic. But as businesses and eateries have become operational and returned, the resilient rats have rebounded, and their population has grown in cities across the globe. Furthermore, climate change, which brought longer periods of warm weather, has given them more time for breeding. Dealing with rats has not been easy. They are tenacious, highly adaptable, and prolific breeders. NYC has tried various methods in the past to tackle the menace. In 2023, the city council passed a new law that required contractors of construction projects to shoulder rat extermination costs. The law emphasised prevention over reaction and laid down strategies for rat control, which included conducting regular inspections, identifying potential rat entry points (gaps in walls or floors) and sealing them, discovering signs of infestation early and eliminating them, adequately storing garbage and ensuring its safe disposal. Additionally, NYC has altered the trash take-out times for businesses and residents to prevent garbage from staying out too long on the streets, allowing rats to fester. The city now requires food-related businesses to dispose of their waste in secure containers instead of trash bags. To incentivise households, NYC also decided to replace the residents’ trash bins with larger cans at the cost of US$ 3.4 million. Rats in Indian cities Indian cities have had large rat populations for a long time and controlling rats has been an age-old responsibility of Indian Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). The task has been traditionally assigned to the Pest Control Officer of the Public Health Department. Mumbai was especially vulnerable to the dangers of a plague on account of it being a port city. The city’s infamous plague attack at the end of the 19th century killed 200,000 people. During the plague threat of 1994, Mumbai used the plague vaccine prepared by the Municipal Rat Destruction Unit at the Haffkine Institute to bring the epidemic under control. Wards of the city were divided into ‘rat labour boundaries,’ assigned to beat officers for inspection and prevention. The most common methods for rat destruction were physical and chemical. Additionally, night rat killing was a unique method of rat control that was exclusively used in Mumbai. Delhi, too, has a massive rat population, mainly residing underground, adroitly finding shelter in sewerage networks, water pipes, fibre optic and gas pipelines. Delhi’s rats have thus been able to develop a complex underground network of rat colonies. Kolkata has also been battling rats which have been found to tunnel through the concrete foundations of flyovers and nibble away at vital underground sewage and cable lines. They have been seen in slums, eateries and historical colonial buildings. Kolkata Municipal Corporation has been seeking advice from other ULBs and exploring measures to combat the growing rat population. In Patna, rats were found to have burrowed under the railway platform causing its collapse. The library of Patna University was at one point closed to deal with rats that had taken over a section of the book shelves. Although some cities around the world have claimed to have successfully controlled rodent growth, in most places, rats have managed to survive and continue to operate as usual. Rat control complexities Over the years, different rodent management measures have come into use. Trapping rats has been one of the earliest used methods. Use of rodenticide has also been common. However, rats are known to develop a resistance to them. The use of rat poison has not been favoured by experts since it often ends up bio-accumulating in the food chain. Encapsulated bait formulations have been observed to have reasonable success. These, however, run the danger of risk to non-target. Chemical control, according to rodentologists, is the most effective known method for rodent management in urban conditions. However, even this has had limited effectiveness. Even though city rats are widely prevalent and pose a huge threat to city infrastructure as well as the health of citizens, they are among the least studied wildlife in urban environments. As a consequence, very little is known about their ecology. This disinterest in rodent research exists despite the broad concession that traditional methods of rat control in the urban landscape have not produced the desired results. The ongoing speed of human urbanisation, compounded by the effects of climate change, is leading to a proliferation of rat-related risks. Further, urbanisation in countries like India, along with heavy densification of its cities will inexorably lead to conditions that will substantially support the multiplication of rats. Studying urban rats has also been fraught with difficulties because rats inhabit spaces owned by both public and private entities, which poses problems with entry and a hindrance to the prolonged observation of rat behaviour. A suitable urban rat research site, that is a mix of public spaces, commercial and business sites, as well as residential areas, which can allow for a comprehensive study over a long enough period to generate robust science, is difficult to obtain. This problem is directly attributable to some notable knowledge gaps that continue to accrue in the rat ecological literature. However, there have been recent successes achieved in fertility control studies through immuno-contraceptives. What is now required is testing their effectiveness in a live situation. Here, NYC has taken the lead by designating city areas where contraceptive delivery will take place. This step towards rodent control could prove invaluable in the cities’ fight against rats. If this experimentation is successful, it may open up a new methodology that can provide an effective mechanism for rodent control globally.

Material World: How Europe Can Compete With China In Race For Afr...	By Sarah Logan Critical juncture Despite heightened focus in the West about dependence on China – and high-level efforts to recalibrate these relations at the strategic level – Europeans’ economic reliance on China has continued to grow in recent years. EU imports from China reached €515.9 billion in 2023, across a wide array of products, many of which are vital to advanced economies. At the heart of these entangled relations is European states’ and economies’ dependence on China for the critical raw materials (CRMs) needed to produce green energy technologies, including solar modules, electric vehicle (EV) batteries, and permanent magnets for wind turbines. The central importance of these technologies today risks leaving Europe heavily reliant on other countries for their supply – an acute challenge when production is highly concentrated in China as strategic competition intensifies between China and the West. To respond to this situation, the European Union has vowed to diversify its energy sources and build out CRM supply chains and processing capabilities that are unconnected with China (ex-China). The bloc has introduced an array of policies aimed at achieving this. 'De-risking' supply chains is the way the EU terms its efforts to reduce its economic reliance on China. This de-risking approach encompasses the green energy technologies critical for the EU’s decarbonisation and energy security, as well as a range of other technologies, including in the military field. Managing European exposure to China in different domains is vital not only for Europe’s energy security, but also for the EU to retain and enhance its geopolitical and geoeconomic strength in a rapidly changing world. In its quest to access ex-China CRMs, the EU has turned to resource-rich African countries it regards as politically friendly. In the last two years, it has signed strategic partnerships to develop sustainable CRM value chains with several African countries, and it is supporting the development of an economic corridor in southern Africa. The EU hopes such agreements will unlock opportunities for European participation in CRM supply chains in these African countries. Despite these ambitious policies and the strategic partnerships signed to date, Europeans are struggling to overcome market forces to break their dependence on China. Other players, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, are also entering CRM mining and processing and are focusing on Africa in particular. Time is fast running out for Europe to win access to the CRMs it needs. The sluggish progress indicates a wide gap between ambitions and reality, especially regarding CRM projects in Africa. It is essential that Europeans understand this disconnect and consider how to address it. This policy brief aims to support this understanding and propose solutions. It begins by situating EU efforts within the evolving global CRM landscape. The paper examines the EU-Namibia strategic partnership on sustainable CRM value chains in order to show what it will take to increase European participation in ex-China CRM supply chains in African countries. This agreement illustrates the ways in which political factors may have influenced the EU’s selection of third country partners more than the commercial reality of a country’s CRM opportunities. At the same time, market dynamics and commercial viability challenges continue to deter European private sector involvement in CRMs in Africa. The paper suggests ways Europeans can begin to turn this state of affairs around. Most urgent is the need to innovate with new financial mechanisms offered by the EU and member state governments, which have so far failed to motivate European companies to enter CRM supply chains in African countries. If the EU is to succeed in its stated mission, it will need to provide greater financial support to better align European private sector interests with the bloc’s own energy security and de-risking objectives. This will come at a cost. But it is the price it must pay if the EU is to reduce its dependence on China and others. The global race for CRMs The EU has introduced a number of key policies to reduce its supply chain dependence on China. These include the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), which aims to secure a sustainable supply of CRMs for European industry and remove import dependencies on any single country. The Net-Zero Industry Act seeks to enhance the capabilities and competitiveness of European manufacturing of net zero technologies. The EU has also joined the Minerals Security Partnership, a group of countries (excluding China) that seeks to develop diverse and sustainable CRM supply chains. Additionally, the EU launched the Global Gateway initiative, which aims to mobilise €300 billion between 2021 and 2027 to boost European investments in energy, transport, and digital infrastructure in countries across the world. The Global Gateway is of particular importance to the EU’s engagement with African countries, given its explicit focus on external partners. The EU hopes the initiative will enhance the relationship between the two continents. Africa has emerged as a key battleground in the scramble for access to CRMs. The continent possesses around one-third of the world’s mineral resources, including significant deposits of cobalt, copper, lithium, graphite, and a range of rare earth elements. CRMs are vital for the production of a wide range of technologies, including green energy technologies such as solar modules, EV batteries, and permanent magnets. Military uses include beryllium needed for fighter jets and targeting and surveillance systems, and semi-conductors, which are critical to missile guidance systems and encryption technology. As the world decarbonises and increasingly switches to green energy, demand for these minerals is set to soar. The production of some of these minerals, such as cobalt, lithium, and graphite, will need to rise by up to 500 per cent by 2050. This feat cannot be achieved without the supply of Africa’s CRMs. In pursuit of its goals, the EU signed strategic partnerships with Namibia in November 2022, the DRC and Zambia in October 2023, and Rwanda in February 2024. It is also party to the multi-stakeholder agreement for developing the Lobito Corridor, a railway and economic corridor joining Zambia, the DRC, and Angola, which is a logistics route enabling access to the CRMs of these African countries. Despite the EU’s ambitious policies and strategic partnerships, European companies have been hesitant to venture into CRM supply chains in these African countries. In fact, since the advent of de-risking as an approach, little has actually materialised by way of projects. This points to a major disconnect between the EU’s geopolitical and geoeconomic agenda and the interests of the European private sector. This is a key challenge given that the EU is extremely dependent on European companies to deliver on its de-risking goals. As EU efforts falter, other geopolitical powers are working to obtain African mineral resources in pursuit of their economic and energy security. For example, Emirati companies have recently purchased stakes in a number of mines in Zambia and the DRC. Turkey is making inroads into African mining, including in Sudan and Niger. Recently, India has also initiated discussions with some African countries around CRM mining opportunities, with exploration activities planned in Zambia. Even like-minded allies are geoeconomic competitors for Europe in this area, also aiming to build out their own CRM supply chains. Notably, the United States is drawing some investment away from European manufacturing in solar and EV supply chains, for example, through the attractive subsidies offered under its Inflation Reduction Act, which comprise an estimated 20 to 40 per cent of unsubsidised costs for solar modules and a $7,500 tax credit for EV batteries. This financial support has persuaded manufacturers to locate themselves in the US rather than in Europe, taking production capacity, job opportunities, and CRM supply chains with them. How China’s dominance grew To work out what Europeans need to do to get ahead of their geoeconomic competitors, a deeper understanding is required of how China in particular got to where it is today. In short, China appears to have spotted the strategic importance of CRMs at least 20 years ago. It has succeeded in gradually expanding both its mining operations in Africa and processing capacity back in China. Over time, China has moved up the value chain to manufacture more sophisticated technologies. Moving in as Europeans retreat For many decades, European mining companies were leading players in African mining. However, European operations in Africa declined steeply over the last 10 to 15 years, coinciding with the end of the commodity super cycle, an extended period during which prices had remained above their long-run trend. The high commodity prices of the super cycle period were driven by demand outstripping supply – these high prices encouraged greater mining investments which, in turn, led to higher supply and eventual collapse in prices as supply overtook demand. Mining companies and their financial backers, who had extended themselves when commodity prices were high, found themselves unable to fully recoup their investments once prices dropped. Around this time, international environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards also grew in importance, driven by a range of governmental, business, and civil society initiatives. European countries became signatories to many of these efforts, placing new expectations on European companies to adhere to ESG standards, including those encapsulated in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct. Bringing mining operations into quick compliance with ESG standards in more undeveloped environments was not straightforward, as mining is a relatively ‘dirty’ industry and is costly to pursue in a responsible manner. To illustrate: complying with ESG standards involvessafeguarding biodiversity, lowering carbon footprints, rehabilitating land after mine closure, implementing community engagement activities (such as providing clean water and health services), and committing to responsible resource use, transparent reporting, and good governance practices, among other things. ESG compliance often increases operational costs in the short term, requiring additional resources for these efforts. This new state of affairs initially rendered European companies uncompetitive compared to others that were not similarly expected to comply with ESG standards. European public and private finance for mining also waned, with banks having little interestin the sector amid challenges around ESG compliance and after the losses occasioned by the end of the commodity super cycle. As European mining operations in Africa declined, Chinese companies were aggressively increasing their mining interests on the continent. This was facilitated in part by minerals-for-infrastructure deals under China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Unconstrained by ESG standards, Chinese mining companies enjoyed greater freedom to strike deals with African governments on accessing mineral resources. China has since grown its control in the African mining sector, particularly in valuable CRMs such as cobalt, copper, and lithium in the DRC, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Like Europe before it, China exported Africa’s resources in raw form for processing back home. This allowed it to use its cheaper electricity and labour, as well as notable state supportand more relaxed approach to ESG standards within China, to build out CRM processing capabilities at home. Within a matter of years, China began to develop economies of scale that further reduced processing costs and allowed it to refine CRMs more cheaply than anyone else. Even metals and minerals mined in the EU, such as lithium, are commonly processed in China, at a lower price, and with the risk of environmental damage removed from Europe. For a number of years, the mining and initial processing of CRMs in China suited European firms well enough – after all, these were often hazardous activities with low profit margins. European companies seized the opportunity to concentrate on higher value phases of processing and manufacture. Over time, however, China came to control 60 per cent of global CRM production and 85 per cent of processing capacity. Chinese manufacturers also started working their way up the value chain, leveraging their greater access to CRMs and lower manufacturing costs to establish a system that now poses both a supply chain risk and competition risk for Europe. China appears to have had a comprehensive strategy in the CRM sector long before others recognised the crucial importance of these products. China has decisively strengthened its hold on the manufacture of the green energy technologies that are now in high demand globally. Europe today sources 90 per cent of its solar modules from China, and European-manufactured solar modules are heavily reliant on imported components and materials from China. China achieved this through its lower production costs, as well as creating a supply glut of cheaper products that have depressed prices and undercut production elsewhere. European solar producers are unable to compete on price with Chinese manufacturers. As a result, around half of the EU’s solar production capacity is at risk of being shuttered. This is not only bad for European industry, it also threatens to further entrench Europe’s dependence on China. China similarly controls 80 per cent of the global market for battery cell production, in which it leads on cost by a substantial margin. Overcapacity in battery manufacturing in China was already three times that of domestic demand in 2023 and may rise to more than six times by 2025; oversupply has collapsed prices and severely impacted on European producers. With batteries comprising around a third of the cost of EVs, and with labour and electricity costs markedly higher in Europe, European car manufacturers cannot compete with their Chinese equivalents on cost, particularly when some Chinese firms also benefit from unfair subsidisation. Consolidation in China European efforts to reduce this reliance on Chinese CRMs and green energy technology supply chains are made more challenging by the particular market dynamics of CRMs. Understanding these market dynamics is necessary for considering Europe’s de-risking options. Importantly, the markets for CRMs are smaller than those for industrial metals, both in terms of volume and value of commodities, with some CRM markets amounting to only a few billion dollars annually. The pricing of CRM products can be opaque, with prices often agreed through confidential bilateral agreements or by vertically integrated Chinese companies that both mine and process CRMs. In some instances they may also be the buyer of the refined CRMs, while receiving some form of state support. A further complication is that a number of CRMs are by-products in the processing of other primary products, so their supply may be tied to the price of the primary product. This can increase price volatility and means that increased demand for CRMs does not necessarily lead to increased supply in the short term. Refining encompasses a complexity of different processes required for different CRMs, producing a range of refined products with varying specifications depending on potential uses and users. Many refining processes are highly carbon-intensive and can be very environmentally damaging. Crucially, processing requires a certain scale to be economically viable and not all mines – or, indeed, countries – produce CRMs in sufficient volume and of sufficient quality to make local processing economically viable. The smaller volumes of raw minerals, as well as the complexity and low profitability of refining, mean that processing often needs to be consolidated to be more viable. These dynamics helped facilitate China’s domination of CRM processing. Further processing beyond the initial refining stage is more advanced and includes the manufacture of precursor cells and other components from intermediary inputs. It requires easy access to a variety of intermediary inputs, as well as scale to be economically viable. The co-location in China of different CRM supply chains has undoubtedly facilitated the lower-cost manufacture of technologies such as solar equipment and EV batteries, enabling China to gain considerable market share. Additionally, manufacturing activities taking place in other countries still rely on China for at least some necessary components. Establishing their own access to CRMs and building out processing capabilities will be a monumental task for Europeans. Imposing dutieson Chinese EV imports into Europe will help protect some European manufacturing. But achieving further gains will require Europeans to either directly participate or otherwise invest in every step of the CRM supply chain – mining, refining, and further processing. Understanding what this would involve can help inform the design of the financial and other mechanisms needed to shift European private sector actors to (re-)enter CRM supply chains in Africa. Partnering with Namibia The EU sees Namibia as a partner with a shared commitment to enabling the global green transition. The EU and Namibia signed a strategic partnership on sustainable CRM value chains and green hydrogen two years ago. Enough time has now elapsed to assess the agreement’s impact on European participation in Namibia’s CRM sector – and, therefore, its contribution to Europe’s de-risking objectives. The conclusion is that there is some way to go. Despite the strategic partnership and some new activities, there is still no presence of EU companies in Namibia’s CRM value chains. An attractive partner Compared to other sub-Saharan African countries, Namibia offers remarkable political stability and an investment environment that is increasingly conducive to foreign investment. It has abundant land, a very small population of around 2.5 million people, and a population density of only 3.7 people per km2. Export infrastructure and skilled labour exist, although they need further development if CRM mining and processing activities in the country are to be scaled up. Additionally, it has a notably long coastline and easy access to global shipping routes. High electricity costs and scarcity of freshwater pose notable obstacles to expanding CRM mining and processing in Namibia. In 2020, electricity imports were needed to meet around 60 per cent of demandin Namibia. This high dependency on imports, together with cost-reflective tariffs and margins for regional electricity suppliers, meant that Namibia had the most expensive grid-provided electricity prices in southern Africa for commercial electricity consumers, at around 2.40 NAD (around €0.14) per kWh in 2022 (although commercial consumers using off-grid options such as diesel generators in other southern African countries undoubtedly face substantially higher electricity costs). However, Namibia has world-class solar and wind resources and, leveraging its abundant land, numerous renewable energy power projects are under way. More capacity expansion is planned and is projected to reach 230 MW of solar and 149 MW of wind by 2035. Deployment of solar plants is already lowering the cost of electricity in Namibia and will make desalination of seawater cheaper in instances where this is needed. This will help overcome the country’s current electricity and freshwater constraints. The government also intends to leverage these renewable energy resources to establish a burgeoning green hydrogen sector, which could power CRM mining and processing in the country. At a time when many other southern African countries are struggling with limited and unreliable electricity supply, Namibia is on a trajectory of making electricity both more plentiful and cheaper. Namibia is thus set to become an attractive location for green processing and manufacturing activities – including potentially in ex-China CRM value chains. Critical raw materials in Namibia While Namibia’s broader investment environment is attractive, its CRM potential is more muted, although this is evolving as more mineral exploration takes place. Namibia has a history of mining, particularly in diamonds and uranium, and produces a number of CRMs, including lithium, graphite, copper, and rare earth elements. It has some local processing capacity in copper smelting and zinc processing. Uranium is currently the only CRM for which Namibia is a notable global supplier – it is the world’s third largest producer of uranium. The country’s two most productive operational uranium mines, Rössing and Husab, are majority-owned by Chinese companies. Uranium mining in Namibia has not always been profitable, but its strategic importance for nuclear power reactors in China and China’s long-term investment policy have enabled its continued production. China’s ability to prioritise access to critical minerals over project profitability is a key factor, highlighting the limitations of Europe’s market-based approach to CRM access to date. Namibia has several existing lithium mines but, to date, the country has been a relatively small global supplier of lithium. The quality of currently mined lithium is far below the global 6 per cent standardneeded for production of battery-grade lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, thereby earning a lower price per tonne. Low lithium prices in recent years have led to the temporary closure of some of Namibia’s lithium mines. However, recent exploration activities appear to have uncovered new lithium finds of a higher ore grade, raising the likelihood of more profitable lithium mining in the country, should lithium prices recover. Namibia also has deposits of heavy rare earth metals such as dysprosium and terbium, which are used in the manufacture of permanent magnets. Namibia’s Lofdal deposit is considered to be one of the largest heavy rare earth deposits outside China. The country’s rare earth projects are largely still in the exploration or feasibilityphases. In addition to Chinese mining companies, Australian and Canadian mining companies are also active in lithium and rare earth element mining in Namibia, especially in exploration activities. But once they have identified commercially viable mineral deposits, they have often sold mining projects on to Chinese firms for development.[1] In an effort to force greater local beneficiation, in June 2023 the Namibian government banned the export of unprocessed lithium ore, rare earth elements, and other CRMs. This move follows similar measures elsewhere, including in Zimbabwe and Tanzania. Mining licences now require mining companies to undertake at least initial processing of these raw minerals locally – but it is unclear whether local processing of these minerals is either commercially viable or technically feasible. The new requirement to undertake local processing comes amid a sharp slump in prices. By September 2024, lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide prices had lost almost 90 per cent of their value since late 2022. This makes the proposition for local beneficiation of lithium particularly challenging at this time. The sharp decline in lithium prices has prompted Zimbabwe, for example, to soften its stance against requiring local processing of lithium in the current climate. It may be necessary for Namibia, too, to rethink this requirement in the short term. Similarly, prices for dysprosium and terbium have collapsed since their five-year high in early 2022 and mid-2022, respectively, with the price slump driven by oversupply within China and reduced demand for magnets amid an effort to lower production costs. Despite the current unfavourable market, a Chinese company is reportedly currently constructing a lithium refinery in the country.[2]This is a notable step for local processing in Namibia. Rather than confirming the commercial viability of local processing, however, this may merely indicate how much China is willing to pay for access to lithium. China’s ability to undertake local processing, potentially in the absence of commercial viability, furthers its own strategic goals. It also demonstrates goodwill towards the Namibian government, likely raising its political and economic leverage with them. China taking the first initiative with local lithium refining in Namibia unfortunately may also deter European companies from establishing local processing activities, as it is far from clear whether the country’s lithium production could support more than one refinery, at least in the short and medium term. Subsequent market entrants would struggle to secure lithium ore supply if the first-moving Chinese refinery has locked in supply through long-term agreements. The processing of rare earths is even more challenging. These elements are found in very low concentrations, and extraction and separation can pose serious environmental risks as radioactive residues are released, which can contaminate the air, water, and soil. Around 2,000 tonnes of toxic waste are produced for every one tonne of rare earths, necessitating extensive waste management. Specialist expertise is also needed for processing rare earths but this is relatively scarce outside China. These difficult dynamics need to be borne in mind as Namibian policymakers seek to enforce local beneficiation of rare earth elements – and must also be considered by European stakeholders as the EU pushes for greater de-risking from China. In an effort to comply with the mandate for local processing, an alliance of three rare earth mining companies from Canada and Namibia is undertaking a feasibility study to explore the viability of developing a joint separation plant in Namibia. This plant would separate rare earth elements from concentrates of mixed rare earth oxides. A collaborative effort is necessary to try to meet the significant upfront cost of plant construction and minimum critical mass of ore needed for processing operations, which exceed what each developer would be able to deliver individually. Processing rare earths in Namibia will be very challenging, and the viability of this ex-China local processing will undoubtedly also be undermined by China’s ban on the export of technologies needed for the extraction and separation of rare earth elements. The ban aims to hamstring ex-China processing and retain China’s near-total dominance of rare earth element processing. It will be a costly proposition for European companies to enter projects for local processing of lithium and rare earth elements. This reality is not sufficiently reflected in the EU’s commitments to support local value addition in CRM value chains in African countries. The unintended outcomes of European policy in Namibia The EU’s strategic partnership with Namibia was the first that the bloc signed with an African country. It was motivated by the need for Europe to diversify its energy sources, including towards renewable energy, and Europe perceiving Africa as a close neighbour with common values and interests. Regarding Namibia specifically, the EU hopes to collaborate on green hydrogen development and to gain access to CRMs in Namibia, with the view to building out European CRM supply chains. This would boost Europe’s industrial capacity and de-risk its energy system from China. In turn, Namibia aims to use its CRM resources to increase local value addition, job creation, skills development, and technology transfer, and to support industrialisation and higher domestic revenue mobilisation and foreign currency earnings. Namibia is also keen to diversify its investors and dilute its reliance on China.[3] European interest in its CRM sector would present Namibia with an opportunity to leverage competition for better deals. The scene is thus set to translate the strategic partnership into gains for both Namibia and the EU. However, while European mining companies have the capabilities to mine CRMs, none are currently active in Namibia. Nor have they shown any appetite to participate in mining operations in the country since the signing of the strategic partnership. Several factors may be dissuading them. The cost and difficulty of ESG compliance in mining activities is a barrier. [4] European finance shies away from these projects with concerns around the challenges of local processing predominating among investors amid calls for increased local beneficiation of minerals in African countries. As noted, Namibia’s ban on the export of unprocessed lithium and rare earth elements means that mining licences now require at least initial local processing of minerals. In terms of whether local processing leads to improved outcomes for the host country, evidence from previous export bans, including in Tanzania and Zambia, is not encouraging. There, the result appears to have been decreased local production of both processed and raw materials. This suggests foreign investors’ coolness towards mining operations in countries where local processing is required. If European participation in Namibia’s CRM sector is to be established in this landscape, two key elements are needed: first, the European private sector must be sufficiently commercially interested in available opportunities. The EU and its member state governments cannot themselves participate in CRM supply chains – in mining or processing or even as significant buyers of ex-China CRM products. Rather, they need the European private sector to drive these participation efforts. Second, European mining companies would need to outmanoeuvre others to secure these opportunities, notably through making a superior ‘offer’ to African governments than competitors’. The European offer would need to exceed that of China in particular. Whether European companies can be persuaded to participate in Namibia’s CRM supply chains depends on the economic attractiveness of projects. CRM supply chain opportunities are deeply location-specific in terms of their viability, which can vary depending on the size and quality of mineral deposits and the presence of enabling infrastructure, including transport infrastructure, reliable and affordable electricity, and sufficient water for mining and processing activities. A predictable and enabling regulatory environment, a workforce with the necessary skills, and easy access to global shipping routes are also key factors. Namibia is appealing across several of these factors, but the lack of extensive mineral exploration in the country and limited knowledge around the commercial viability of local processing remain barriers. They also bring into question the basis for the EU’s selection of external partners and the realism of commitments made to partner countries under the strategic partnerships. Europe’s ‘offer’ to Namibia is encapsulated in the strategic partnership itself; two commitments made in the agreement have particular relevance. First, the EU has undertaken to adhere to international ESG standards in projects in Namibia. Second, it has promised to support the establishment of local processing of CRMs. These commitments are attractive to Namibia, with the latter commitment now also reinforced by the Namibian government’s ban on the export of unprocessed lithium ore, rare earth elements, and other CRMs. The EU’s commitment to Namibia reflects its interest in the sustainable development of Namibia’s CRM supply chains – but, as noted, only companies can actually do the work that makes these commitments a reality. The EU and Namibia agreed a roadmap for implementing the strategic partnership in November 2023; it outlines an ambitious list of activities for the 2023 to 2025 period. The roadmap includes activities such as capacity building for geological surveying and undertaking a pre-feasibility study for lithium processing in Namibia. These activities are currently ongoing.[5] Most roadmap activities, including these examples, are aimed at improving the local environment for developing CRM value chains in general – which benefits all actors active in Namibia’s CRM supply chains. Given that European companies are not present in the CRM sector in Namibia, the EU’s contributions are currently improving the environment only for other actors, including China. Nevertheless, by enabling the operations of more actors, these efforts may indirectly contribute to diluting China’s control in some value chains. This may be acceptable from the EU’s perspective if supporting Namibia’s sustainable development was the purpose of the partnership. But Europe’s de-risking from China was an important objective for the EU. It is therefore a point of concern that not only are European companies not benefitting from such activities, but the EU’s efforts may in fact be indirectly undermining its own de-risking objectives by helping Chinese companies and others to strengthen their access to CRMs.[6] At the same time, the EU needs to be seen to be delivering on commitments made under the implementation roadmap in order to maintain its relationship with Namibia and preserve its credibility with other African countries. Europeans are therefore stuck in a lose-lose situation with roadmap implementation unless they can cultivate European private sector participation in Namibia’s CRM supply chain, and quickly. To address this, they must renew efforts to achieve European participation in Namibia’s CRM sector. This would ensure the strategic partnership contributes to Europe’s de-risking efforts. Namibia is an easier prospect in many ways than Zambia or the DRC, given its enabling environment and existence of ex-China CRM supply chain opportunities, such as the operation of Australian and Canadian mining companies. It is vital that the EU is able to make its strategic partnership work for European interests, or it will not bode well for efforts in other countries. The difficulty in getting traction on European investments in Namibia highlights the limits of what EU efforts can achieve without European private sector participation. It also raises the need for the EU to reconsider how it deploys its resources in furtherance of its own de-risking objectives. Specifically, resources could make more of an impact if they were targeted directly at incentivising European companies to enter CRM supply chains – rather than providing all-sector support. More focus on market economics and less traditional development policy is needed. Lining up buyers for ex-China CRMs For European participation in mining or local processing in Namibia to contribute to de-risking, it will also be necessary to keep all further processing of these CRM products outside of Chinese value chains. If products enter Chinese processing or manufacturing supply chains later, it will negate European de-risking efforts in mining and local processing phases. Achieving this starts with finding ex-China buyers for these refined CRMs. Buyers will need to satisfy at least three key criteria to ensure that supply chains remain ex-China and contribute to Europe’s de-risking objectives. Like-minded allies that the EU wishes to work with on CRM access would likely have a shared view on these criteria, potentially creating scope for cooperation. First, buyers will need to be European or from a friendly third country that will later sell components or final products manufactured with ex-China CRMs to Europe, thereby enabling Europe to diversify its supply chains. This would need to be stipulated in contracts, with necessary conditions passed on to every actor in the supply chain until products reach Europe – although this is a complex and difficult arrangement to enforce in practice. Second, buyers will need to be willing to pay a premium for the ESG-compliant, ex-China CRMs refined in Namibia. These products will be more expensive than their Chinese equivalents, due to smaller economies of scale and higher production costs, at least in the short term. Third, buyers must be willing to purchase refined CRMs and undertake further processing of these products into intermediary inputs and components themselves, rather than sourcing already-processed components and final products from China. This requires European companies to build out CRM processing capacity along the supply chain. Finding buyers that meet these criteria will be very challenging. For example, there is currently only one facility in the EU capable of separating rare earths for magnet production, with a second plantpotentially being operational by 2025. European buyers are also not yet willing to pay a premium for ESG-compliant, ex-China CRMs, as much as they may like the idea of responsible sourcing.[7] Price still matters more to European buyers than where CRM products come from, although many European customers are increasingly concerned about the vulnerabilities created by their high reliance on China and are actively looking for alternative suppliers. Policy instruments can be used to help shift European procurement away from China’s supply chains to an extent, such as application of import charges under the carbon border adjustment mechanism or duties on EVs imported from China. Nevertheless, there are limits to what costs European buyers can be expected to absorb where price differentials between Chinese and ex-China products are high. Additionally, European companies have situated themselves at the higher end of the value chain. They need to buy components rather than lithium carbonate, for example, for their manufacturing operations. Little incentive exists for European companies to move to lower rungs of the value chain when cheaper, already-manufactured components and products from China are available. For European companies to build out processing capacity in parallel to China will be costly and will take time – posing a challenge to urgent decarbonisation demands. Underlying these challenges is the further threat that, in an effort to reinforce its CRM supply chain dominance and strengthen its geoeconomic position, China may use its supply chain domination as a tool of retaliation. It could ban the export of CRM products to certain countries, or it could intentionally trigger a supply glut of any CRM product at any time in order to depress global prices and collapse the profitability of ex-China operations. The global impact of a supply glut is already seen with the ongoing collapse in lithium and rare earth prices. Western geoeconomic measures towards China may be met with retaliation that could send European companies active in ex-China CRM supply chains into financial distress or bankruptcy. Given these challenges, it is evident that financial mechanisms are needed to improve the commercial viability of ex-China CRM opportunities and to persuade European companies to participate in ex-China CRM supply chains. What Europeans should do Improve support mechanisms for European companies The EU has introduced various policies and initiatives with the goal of supporting European companies operating in CRM supply chains, including in projects located outside the EU in friendly third countries. To access benefits, projects generally need to be attributed with Strategic Project status. Under the CRMA, for example, applicants for Strategic Project status must submit to the European Commission a range of supporting evidence to demonstrate that the project will strengthen the EU’s supply of CRMs, is technically feasible, will comply with ESG standards, and will undertake local value addition if in a third country. They must share a business plan that shows, among other things, the financial viability of the project, including secured funding and offtake agreements. Applications must be submitted for consideration ahead of board meetings, which may be held quarterly or biannually. Projects given Strategic Project status can receive assistance from the CRM Board to identify potential funding sources, including private investors, the European Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, international finance institutions, and programmes and initiatives of member states and the EU (including the Global Gateway). The CRMA does not itself make new funding sources available, so financing options are limited to what other sources of funding can offer. The act also promises to facilitate offtake agreements, with the European Commission undertaking to establish a bidding process that could match buyers and sellers of CRM products based on the volume and quality of CRMs being sought or sold, intended price at which to buy or sell, and desired duration of the offtake agreement. Most of these mechanisms are very recent and their impact on incentivising European participation in CRM supply chains in Africa is yet to be seen. Indeed, the first application round for Strategic Project status under the CRMA closed in August 2024, with 170 applicationssubmitted. It is not yet known whether any of these applications pertain to possible CRM projects in Namibia or the other African countries with which the EU has signed strategic partnerships. Some challenges are, however, apparent. For example, CRMA Strategic Projects can only receive advice on potential funding sources and the proposed bidding process for CRM offtake can only attempt to match buyers and sellers. This makes receiving financing and offtake facilitation potentially both uncertain and not very time sensitive. This will be a challenge for European companies looking to take quick advantage of an emerging opportunity, particularly when competitors are able to move faster. Projects must also be at a sufficiently mature stage, requiring them to have progressed to that point in the absence of Strategic Project benefits. This excludes projects that could have reached viability if financial support from the EU had been available at an earlier stage. Additionally, the European Commission’s efforts to match buyers and sellers of CRM products will be complicated by the non-standardisation of these products, as CRMs must be refined to particular buyer specifications and few companies purchase the same kinds of raw materials. CRM products do not lend themselves to bulk procurement, creating a very different scenario to, for example, development of joint procurement platforms for green hydrogen or natural gas, which are homogeneous products. The EU pinned much hope on its strategic partnerships with African countries increasing its access to CRMs. Yet the lack of European private sector participation means this is access is failing to materialise. Will the CRMA Strategic Projects approach be more effective? This will depend on whether the benefits extended to these projects succeed in aligning private sector interests with the EU’s ambitions. This seems unlikely in the current market circumstances. Incentivise the private sector The level of financing required for European companies to get in front of competitors in CRM mining and processing in Africa far exceeds the funding the EU and other European partners have made available to date. While other powers are speeding ahead, leveraging significant available resources to aggressively pursue opportunities, the cost of catching up is growing for Europe. In addition to those already adopted, the EU will need to devise the following forms of support. First, European companies participating in either mining or local processing need some form of price protection. This could be provided by European public financial institutions extending guarantees to producers to establish a minimum price (floor) and maximum price (ceiling) for ex-China products. This would remove some price volatility – on the upside as well as the downside – protecting producers against price drops by China while facilitating more long-term offtake agreements made possible by greater price certainty. Second, greater deployment of political risk insurance is needed to support European companies entering more difficult contexts. This would protect companies against the risks arising from arbitrary actions by the host government, including expropriation, confiscation, and selective discrimination. Such risks are comparatively high in the mining sector. The European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are able to provide political risk insurance, as are several European development finance institutions. More extensive use of these facilities is needed, with the institutions providing these products scaling up resources dedicated to them. Third, measures to reduce Europe’s electricity costs will be vital to enable greater processing capacity to be developed in Europe. European electricity costs are currently two to three times higher than those in the US and China, which poses a significant barrier to expanding processing capabilities in Europe. Reducing electricity costs in Europe will take concerted efforts from a number of actors, including private sector investments in renewable energy supported by incentives from the EU and member state governments. Finally, the EU and member state institutions will need to develop better consultation platforms with the European private sector to understand their concerns about entering CRM supply chains in Africa, what they could be incentivised to do, and what support it would take. This understanding should inform the nature of the support extended to European companies active in CRM supply chains in Africa, thereby ensuring that de-risking initiatives are more effective. Geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions cannot wish away market dynamics and the need for the commercial viability of projects. However, well designed policies that target clear interventions can help overcome these factors. Turning the needle on CRM project viability in Africa is essential if European companies are to pursue these opportunities. This will come down to the nature and scale of support extended to European companies. It will undoubtedly be costly to develop incentives that can motivate European companies to enter CRM supply chains in Africa and deploy them at some degree of scale. But Europeans cannot afford not to act if they are to address this vital aspect of de-risking. Not only is their energy security at stake, but so is the EU’s future political, economic, and military strength.

US Drought Conditions Reduce Hydropower Generation, Particularly ...	In our latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), we forecast that electricity generation from U.S. hydropower plants in 2024 will be 13% less than the 10-year average, the least amount of electricity generated from hydropower since 2001. Extreme and exceptional drought conditions have been affecting different parts of the United States, especially the Pacific Northwest, which is home to most U.S. hydropower capacity. As of the end of September, 72.6% of the continental United States was experiencing dryer-than-normal to exceptional drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. By the end of October, this value increased to 87.2%. Multiple regions are affected by drought conditions, but the effects on hydropower generation are more obvious in the Pacific Northwest. For example, a recent study conducted by the University of Alabama found that hydropower generation in Washington state is one of the most susceptible to droughts in the country, ranking right below California based on data from 2003 to 2020. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Short-Term Energy Outlook and Electric Power Annual; U.S. Drought Monitor Drought impacts this year The Pacific Northwest’s Columbia River is the fourth-largest river in the United States by volume. Its watershed, the Columbia River Basin, covers large parts of four states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. The basin is home to some of the largest hydropower dams in the country, such as the Grand Coulee with a net summer capacity of 6.7 gigawatts (GW) and Chief Joseph with 2.4 GW of capacity. As early as April of this year, the Washington State Department of Ecology declared most counties in the state under drought. The department takes this step when water supply in the state is less than 75% of normal. In Oregon, two counties declared a drought emergency this summer, first in June in Jefferson County and then in September in Lake County. The Dalles Dam located between Oregon and Washington, with a total net summer capacity of 1.8 GW, is considered a good indicator of water supply conditions in the upper Columbia River. At the end of September, water supply at The Dalles Dam was at 74% of the 30-year normal for the summer months (April through September), according to the Northwestern River Forecast Center. Hydropower generation peaks in the summer months in response to seasonal peak demand. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Basin Outlook Reports, reservoir storage at the end of September was 48% of capacity in Oregon, 67% of capacity in Washington, 76% in Montana, and 60% in Idaho. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Electric Power Monthly On a monthly basis in 2023, across Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, hydropower generation has been close to or below the lower end of the 10-year range, except for a brief spike in May due to a heatwave. In Washington and Oregon, hydropower generation in 2024 was mostly higher than in 2023, especially during the summer months. In Idaho and Montana, hydropower generation in 2024 was below 2023 levels from April through August. Drought effects in the Northwest according to STEO In the STEO, we forecast electricity generation for electricity market regions instead of state geographical boundaries. We expect hydropower generation in the Northwest electricity region, which includes the Columbia River Basin and parts of other Rocky Mountain states, to total 101.8 billion kilowatthours (kWh) in 2024, a 23% decrease from the 10-year average of 132.8 billion kWh and a 1% decrease from 2023.

Who Was Joe Overton Of Overton Window Fame? – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed On October 28, 2024, on his social media platform 'X' (formerly Twitter), the well-known entrepreneur Elon Musk asked this question: 'Ever wondered about the Overton Window?' His query was accompanied by a 'retweet' of a post by Jash Dholani, who included a photo of Joe Overton and stated that the 'Window' concept that bears his name is 'the best mental model for understanding how political change ACTUALLY happens.' This was just the latest Overton Window reference. They surely number now in the tens of thousands, from all over the world. A few years ago, the concept required an explanation, but it is now so ubiquitous, so much a part of our political lexicon, that it’s routinely used as though everyone knows (or should know) what it’s about. It has its own Wikipedia page, as does Joe himself, and Joe’s Window was the focus of a New York Times article in 2019. Any search engine brings up countless citations of it. Simply put, the Overton Window posits that at any given moment, politicians can only operate and get re-elected when they take positions within a narrow framework shaped by prevailing public opinion. Shift the window by changing popular ideas, and you can thereby make what’s politically unpalatable today into a mainstream view tomorrow. If you are unfamiliar with it, or want some examples of it in action, click on these links and learn more from Michigan’s Mackinac Center for Public Policy, where Joe first formulated the idea: An Introduction to the Overton Window of Political Possibility ‘Now it’s simply referred to as the Overton Window, as if everyone knows what it is’ The Overton Window of Political Possibility Joe Overton was a humble man, but I assure you he would be both proud and amazed that his name, barely two decades after his untimely death in 2003 at the age of 43, is approaching the status of a household word. But how many people could tell you who Joe was? What was he like? The world should know more about the man whose name is invoked so often in political and social discussions these days, and I may well be the most qualified living individual to tell you about him. Why? Joe was my best friend, and both of us said so often while he was alive. I was Best Man at his wedding when he married Helen Rheem in March 2003, just three months before he was killed in an ultralight plane crash on June 30. He and I journeyed to 21 countries together, including China, Poland, and Singapore. We even undertook a dangerous, clandestine visit to Mozambique in 1991, where we lived for two weeks with anti-communist rebels during the country’s civil war. As president of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, I hired Joe in March 1992 and soon thereafter promoted him to senior vice president. Along with my successor and Mackinac’s current president, Joe Lehman, and a superb staff, we built the operation into one of the most effective state policy-focused think tanks in the country. And in 28 'leadership conferences,' we trained more than 600 staff and executives from other 'free market' organizations from dozens of countries. So yes, I knew Joe very well, and I still think of him almost every day. Joe Overton Born on January 4, 1960, Joe was a native Michigander. From 1965 until his passing in 2003, he lived in the town of Midland. I moved there from my home state of Pennsylvania to teach at Northwood University in 1977, but it would be another decade before I met Joe. In September 1987, we were introduced not in Michigan but at a conference in Seattle, Washington. I told him that in December, I would be opening an office of a new think tank in our town of Midland because I had just accepted an offer to serve as its first president. He was an electrical engineer and project manager at the Dow Chemical Company, as well as a staunch libertarian. He immediately volunteered to help us at what would become the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. He knew engineering, but his passion was freedom and free markets. By 1992, our fifth year of operation, the Center was becoming influential in Michigan and even beyond. A new governor, John Engler, had put many of our policy recommendations into law. I asked Joe if he would relinquish his job at Dow, change his career completely, and come to work full-time at Mackinac. He said yes on the spot and never looked back. I remember telling Joe, 'Your first task is to put in place the nuts and bolts of sound management of our operation, freeing me up to pontificate and raise money.' His engineering and management background coupled with his love of liberty proved to be a potent combination. It helped attract top talent and ensured we got maximum bang for our donors’ bucks. We grew from four employees to more than 30 under Joe’s watch. I was on the road much of the time—at news conferences, speeches, and donor meetings—but I never worried for a moment about what was happening back at the office. In our tenth year, Joe even supervised a major construction project: the transformation of an old, abandoned Woolworth department store in downtown Midland into Mackinac’s new headquarters. It was just a block away from our original office, so it was easy for Joe to spend time every day on the new site. His motto during this time was, 'You expect what you inspect,' meaning he felt obligated to monitor every step of the construction process. He even contributed ideas that later won us some notable design awards. Oh, and by the way, he somehow found time during these busy years of the Mackinac Center’s growth to go to law school. He earned his J.D. degree from Thomas Cooley Law School in Lansing, Michigan, and passed the bar exam on his first attempt. Whether in organizational management, construction, or political philosophy, Joe was that rare kind of person who understood both the big picture and the intricate details that composed it. He was fond of telling a story of three workers laying bricks at the site of a new cathedral. A man walks by and asks one worker, 'What are you doing?' The worker answered, 'Laying bricks.' The man walks a little further and asks a second worker, 'What are you doing?' The worker responded, 'Building a wall.' When the man approached the third worker with the same question, the worker said, 'I’m constructing a cathedral.' All three bricklayers were doing precisely the same thing, but it was the third one who truly grasped the significance of the project, though the task of the moment could seem rather menial. Joe saw everything we did at the Mackinac Center—even taking out the garbage—as 'building a cathedral.' And largely because of his obvious competence and admirable persona, that’s the way we all thought of it. To Joe, the most important policy issue of our time was school choice. He saw it as a civil right, a righteous cause worth every effort we could muster. Children belong to parents, not to the State, he believed. Joe devoted much of his professional career and most of his personal time to advancing that cause. He even devised a 'Universal Tuition Tax Credit' that, by variations, is on the books now in multiple states. More than anything else, what I learned from Joe in our 16 years of friendship was the importance of personal character. He possessed it by the boatload. He was a Christian, above all else, and he lived his faith and its teachings as well as anyone I have ever known. In an essay for these pages a few months after he died, I wrote: Through his example, his mere presence in a room would raise everyone’s standards of speech and conduct. As a consummate administrator he taught us the importance of continuous organizational improvement through Total Quality Management. He was able to do that effectively not just because he knew the nuts and bolts of the subject, but because he practiced it in his personal life as well. I heard him say many times, 'You cannot impart what you don’t possess.' Joe Overton was the straightest straight shooter I’ve ever known. Not a speck of deception, guile, conceit, or hidden agenda in him. He said what he meant and meant what he said, always. You never, ever had to wonder if he was telling you the truth. He kept his word as if it was an indispensable and inseparable physical appendage like an arm or a leg. Like so many others, I came to place total, unqualified trust in him. So did others who came to know him. Never underestimate the importance of truth and trust to a free society; if we cannot deal with each other on those terms, we will resort to the ugliness of brute force and political power. …Over and over again, people were attracted to his work because of the sterling character of his persona. Friends marveled at his consistency and self-discipline. They were impressed that he not only preached the virtues of civil society; he practiced them in his own life through endless volunteer efforts, quiet philanthropy, and ceaseless counsel to those who needed good advice. One of Joe’s hobbies was flying. He owned two ultralight aircraft—one was a two-seater, the other built for one. On the afternoon of June 30, 2003, he asked me if I wanted to go up with him that evening in the two-seater. I declined because of a summer cold. So, he went up by himself in the other one. I was sound asleep when my phone rang later around midnight. It was Joe’s brother Scott (1965–2016). 'Larry,' he said in a voice choked with emotion, 'Joe was killed this evening when his plane suddenly lost altitude and fell to the ground.' I was more than a little stunned with disbelief. I was struck to the bone by the awful feeling that the world had lost an extraordinarily good man, that the liberty movement had lost a widely admired and irreplaceable leader, and that I had lost the best friend I ever had. To this day, I have never experienced personal trauma as deep as what I felt at Joe’s death. At the Mackinac Center in the weeks after the crash, we were deluged with unsolicited tributes to Joe. As well as I thought I knew him, there was so much more to the man than any of us knew. In keeping with the Christian calling, it turned out that Joe, in ways big and small but always quiet, was helping somebody all the time. The testimonies we published by the hundreds on the organization’s website were mind-blowing: 'He saved our marriage.' 'He gave me a check to get through a tough time.' 'He went out of his way to give me a hand.' The man I thought was outstanding in every way was more exceptional than I ever imagined. Twenty-one years since he died, I still shed tears when I pause to remember him. So the next time you hear of the 'Overton Window,' please understand that the concept itself is valuable and appealing, but the man behind it deserves to be remembered every bit as much.

National Elections Expose The Sham That Is Centralized ‘Democracy...	By Ryan McMaken The 2024 election is over, and in some states, big majorities voted for the winner Donald Trump. In Wyoming, Trump won 72 percent of the vote. In fact, more than 60 percent of the voting population went for Trump in 13 states. Fortunately for the majorities in those states, they’ll get the president they voted for. However, the outcome would have been different if fewer than a million people—in a nation of 330 million—had changed their votes in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Michigan. Then, Kamala Harris would now be the president-elect. She would have won even though the voters of more than a dozen states had lopsided majorities in favor of Trump. Moreover, Kamala could have won even though there was far less enthusiasm on her side. That is, only a single state, Massachusetts, had a voting majority of more than 60 percent for Kamala Harris. Even If You Win, You Lose We could come up with many similar examples in the past 24 years. In 2012, for example, Mitt Romney won 60 percent or more of the vote in nine states. 72 percent of the voters went for Romney in Utah. But, in the end, those supermajorities meant nothing, and the people of Utah, Oklahoma, Alabama, and several others—who had voted nearly 2 to 1 for Romney—got Barack Obama as president. In 2020, by the way, more than 60 percent of the voters in ten states voted against Joe Biden. These facts should be remembered the next time that some pundit or politician tries to tell us that democracy is 'the voice of the people' or 'the will of the majority.' The question that has to be asked is 'which majority?' and 'which people?' Indeed, for the people of Utah in 2012 or Massachusetts in 2024, the president that rules over those states was chosen by people who don’t live in those states. Even if 100 percent of the voters in a state vote against a certain candidate, they could still end up with that candidate as president based on the votes of people living somewhere else. Moreover, given that many states don’t have voter ID, it stands to reason that even a large majority of your state votes for a certain candidate, foreign nationals in some other state may ultimately make the decision for you. It’s difficult to see how such a method expresses 'the will of the majority' when a tiny majority or plurality nationwide so often nullifies overwhelming majorities in a multitude of US states. On a legalistic level, of course, the courts tell us this is all how it is supposed to be. In presidential elections, it simply doesn’t matter what your local majority says. The only majority that matters is the national majority. This is true even if we take into account the electoral college, which is nothing more than a formula for weighting the national majority vote. It bears noticing, however, that these national majorities are often not even majorities. In 1992 and 1996, for example, Bill Clinton won the race with 43 percent and 49 percent, respectively. And, when a candidate does manage to win a majority, it is usually very slim. Not since 1988 has any presidential candidate managed to get even 53 percent of the popular vote. The closest anyone got was Obama in 2008. Most presidential races since 1948 have been decided by a majority of 51 percent or less. The Rules Are Broken in the Age of the Modern Unlimited Presidency In spite of all this, those who can’t think beyond the status quo—both leftists and conservatives—will simply say 'rules are rules.' They’ll go on to insist that we must blindly follow the rules no matter what. In truth, however, these 'rules' were not ratified by any living person, and they were created in an age when the US president exercised very few domestic powers. In the early nineteenth century, presidents could do virtually nothing domestically without Congressional approval, and even those powers were few. Nowadays, however, presidents exercise vast power within the borders of every single US state. Yet, the current system is based on the idea that even if whole regions of the country vote overwhelmingly against a president, they are still forced to submit to four years of that president’s rule-by-decree, which is what every presidency now is in our post-legislative age of Rule by Executive Order. Yes, this system is based on 'the rules,' but in the world of politics, rules only work until they don’t. Ask the British in 1776 or the Soviets in 1989. You’re Never Allowed to Leave The absurdity and injustice of this system is further illustrated by the fact that no matter how much your state’s majority might object to the federal president or his policies, no state or part of a state is allowed to exit the system. Ever. If a two-thirds majority in your state votes against the federal administration again and again, well, that’s too bad, you’re never allowed to leave. You’ll just have to sit back and take whatever the executive branch decides to dish out. But, hey, you always have your small handful of members of Congress to make little speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives. None of this will ever do anything to protect your state’s population from federal policies—no matter how contrary these might be to your local economic interests and institutions. But, 'rules are rules.' No private, non-state organization would ever function in such a fashion. Imagine telling the owners of a public company that no matter how much the management behaves contrary to various investors’ wishes, those investors are never allowed to sell their shares and leave the organization. Imagine telling members of any dues-paying organization that no matter how much the leaders screw over the members, they are never allowed to stop paying dues. Yet, this is how the 'rules' work in America. No matter how much the central government might ignore, abuse, and generally govern against the majority of the voters in your state, you are never allowed to leave. You are never allowed to stop paying taxes to support the very people who couldn’t care less what you think. The only way out requires that we stop caring what the rules say. The answer lies in decentralization, secession, and the dismantling of the political system that allowed Obama and Joe Biden to shove their policies down the throats of supermajorities that voted against these presidents again and again. The re-election of Donald Trump does not fundamentally change any of this. Even if Trump were to turn out to be some kind of anti-establishment dream candidate in his second term, the 2028 election is just a few years away. On the other hand, to accept the status quo is to continue allowing federal technocrats a thousand miles away to literally dictate federal policies to your community. Unfortunately, like prisoners suffering from Stockholm syndrome, many will elect to continue supporting the central regime because the 'rules-are-rules' propaganda has worked very well.

Why Trump Routed The D.C. Establishment, Again – OpEd	After the media complained nonstop for months about Donald Trump offering a dark message on the presidential campaign trail, a New York Times headline bewailed his election victory on Wednesday morning: 'America Hires a Strongman.' So anyone who cast a ballot became the moral equivalent of a mafia don hiring a hitman? The Times news analysis lamented, 'This was a conquering of the nation not by force but with a permission slip. Now, America stands on the precipice of an authoritarian style of governance never before seen in its 248-year history.' Well, at least never-before-seen by journalists whose knowledge of history does not extend back beyond Taylor Swift’s first best-selling album. The notion that Trump was a unique threat in American history entitled the media to ignore all the civil liberties abuses of the Biden-Harris administration. Coincidentally, that spared many reporters and editorial writers the difficulty of comprehending the policies which they tacitly endorsed. The media betrayed freedom of speech—at least for Americans who do not have a journalism degree. Biden administration officials conducted potentially 'the most massive attack against free speech in United States history,' a federal judge concluded, and a federal appeals court condemned Team Biden for 'suppressing millions of protected free-speech postings by American citizens'—mostly by conservatives and Republicans. But most of the media was the Sherlock Holmes’ 'dog that didn’t bark' when federal agencies browbeat social media companies with endless demands to muzzle and blindfold average Americans. Vice Presidential candidate J.D. Vance raised the censorship issue during his debate with Gov. Tim Walz, but it got little or no traction beyond his spiels. Instead, censorship was championed by the media in recent years as part of a holy crusade against 'misinformation' (i.e., facts that are damned inconvenient for the ruling class). Did progressives discover a hidden asterisk to the First Amendment that nullifies constitutional rights for anyone who jokes about covid vaccine mandates? Because it was a self-evident truth that 'Orange Man Bad,' most reporters and pundits exerted little or no effort to comprehend or expose Biden administration follies and frauds. Almost all the media campaign coverage ignored the risk of World War III thanks to the Biden-Harris escalation of the Ukraine-Russia war. Why was there no controversy about Biden providing F-16 jets to Ukraine—potentially enabling Ukraine to attack practically anywhere in Russia with US bombs? Or did the media believe they had a moral duty to blindly support Ukraine because its president—unlike Putin—supports transgender rights? Journalists who retained jobs at top papers continue to be paid very well. On the Friday before the election, the feds released the worst jobs report since the covid lockdowns, confirming a net loss of private jobs. A few hours after that report hit the wires, a Washington Post headline chirped: 'The economy is strong heading into Election Day. Will it matter?' The article’s subhead assured readers: 'The last batch of economic numbers before the election are in, and they’re looking pretty good. So why aren’t voters feeling them?' Presumably because voters were fools or liars and refused to admit how Washington is making their lives wonderful. Most pundits dismissed or disdained people who complained about how the 20+ percent inflation of the Biden era harmed their families. The average mortgage payment has almost doubled since Biden took office—pricing millions of Americans out of their first home—but that was apparently an illegitimate consideration on Election Day. As Mises Institute fellow Tom Woods noted, leftists 'are now mocking people who are concerned about price inflation by using the expression ‘burger too expensive.’' I predicted in the New York Post in early 2022 that inflation would politically bankrupt Joe Biden and the Democrats and plenty of voters agreed on Tuesday. The Harris campaign believed that perpetually championing the right to abortion would guarantee them more than enough votes from women. But it turned out that 'women buy milk and eggs more often than they get abortions.' That fact of life enraged many media commentators. As a female panelist on ABC’s The View asked other panelists on Wednesday morning: 'Why do you think that uneducated white women voted against their reproductive health freedoms, and why do you think Latino men voted in favor of someone who says he will deport a majority of his community?' Perhaps that panelist wasn’t aware that most Latino men in this nation are American citizens. Democratic Party poohbahs and their media allies could not have shown more contempt for the American people. Until his disastrous debate with Donald Trump in June, doddering President Biden was perennially defended as fit for another four years of ruling America. After Democratic Party bosses pushed Biden out the window, they pretended Vice President Harris was entitled to be the candidate even though she got zero votes in the primaries. Party bosses presumed that her candidacy’s 'coronation-by-Establishment' would assure victory thanks to Harris’s gender and race. And anyone who failed to fall in line could be denounced as sexist or racist. That explains why a senior Harris campaign official told MSNBC early on Election Day that 'we are optimistic that we are literally about to turn the page… and install Vice President Harris as the next President of the United States.' That 'identity push button' failed thanks to Harris’s astounding incompetence in interviews. As a journalist, I have interviewed many government officials and politicians over the years and learned to watch for tell-tale signs. From her first media interviews after her designation as presidential candidate, Harris radiated fear except when she was exuding dread. She turned down a chance to be interviewed by Joe Rogan, whose exchange with Trump garnered more than 37 million views. Instead, she went on a vapid 'Call Me Daddy' podcast run by a woman who usually talked about topics such as sex toys. A Slate columnist notedthat she was 'afraid that the host was going to ask Harris her favorite sex position.' Harris turned down the chance to meet with Time Magazine reporters and editors to discuss her views on policy. She never held a press conference. She felt no obligation to explain why she reversed her positions on fracking and other issues. Instead, she acted entitled to the presidency simply because of who she was—or perhaps because of her resume. She offered voters the strangest policy trifecta in presidential campaign history: 'joy,' 'positive vibes,' and 'Trump is Hitler.' The 2024 election was a defeat for Kamala Harris and progressive authoritarianism. But it would be naïve to equate Trump’s victory with the triumph of liberty. Trump’s bizarre view of tariffs as an economic magic wand could be disastrous for America and the world. Trump does not appear to recognize that the soaring national debt is a ticking time bomb that could detonate beneath the economy. There is a broad strand of Washington conservatives who are championing paternalist economic interventions, making the Republican Party look like it is morphing into the old-time Tory Party of England. But, unlike the downtrodden commoners of nineteenth century England, average Americans have not been taught to stay in their place—which helps explain why Trump defeated Harris. And that is the ultimate problem for zealots who believe lofty SAT scores give the Washington elite a divine right to run everyone else’s lives. PBS pundit Jonathan Capehart whined after midnight on election night that, because of Trump’s victory, 'I can’t help but wonder if the American people have given up on democracy.' A better synopsis of Tuesday’s results came from columnist Bridget Phetasy: 'I can sum it up. He’s not Hitler. I’m not racist. F**k you.'

India Charts Its IMEC Path To Global Trade Influence – Analysis	By Soumya Bhowmick During the G20 Summit in late 2023, an agreement was signed between India, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union to establish the India–Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEC). This initiative is a strategic response to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and aims to position India as a pivotal player in global trade. The IMEC seeks to create a comprehensive infrastructure network connecting countries with a combined GDP of US$47 trillion, encompassing shipping lanes, railways, undersea cables and solar grids. This initiative holds great potential to bolster global trade efficiency and ensure energy security. But the IMEC faces several geopolitical, infrastructural and environmental challenges that must be addressed to ensure its success. While the IMEC holds great promise, its implementation is not guaranteed. The corridor is expected to run through geopolitically sensitive areas such as the Middle East, where conflicts, political instability and regional rivalries could pose significant risks. For instance, the war in Gaza has delayed the project’s progress. Infrastructure bottlenecks, such as the need for substantial upgrades to rail and port facilities in some participating countries, may also delay the expected efficiency gains. The reliance on intermodal transportation — combining rail, sea and road transport — could also create logistical complexities. While the IMEC aims to reduce shipping times by up to 40 per cent, the 30 per cent cost reduction claim remains debatable, since the intermodality involved in the IMEC could increase costs due to additional handling, transhipment and coordination requirements. The project’s success will depend on whether the corridor can maintain its promised efficiency despite these hurdles. The IMEC is not a direct alternative to China’s BRI, but it is part of the global response to counter China’s growing economic influence. Unlike the BRI, which has focused extensively on infrastructure financing in developing countries, the IMEC seeks to establish a network of high-efficiency trade routes by prioritising cutting-edge technology, green energy solutions and digital infrastructure. Crucially, BRI investments also have varied trajectories. While the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp decline in Chinese investment in BRI projects in 2020, data from 2023 suggests a rebound in sectors such as green energy and technology. But IMEC’s focus on sustainable energy solutions and connectivity could make it an appealing alternative for countries looking to avoid the debt traps associated with BRI projects. The IMEC project has attracted attention for its ambitious green energy and infrastructure plans, but it must also deal with environmental and socio-political risks. Developing solar grids and hydrogen corridors is a significant step toward renewable energy, but the environmental footprint of constructing this massive infrastructure is a concern. While the corridor aims to promote clean hydrogen trade, questions also remain about the feasibility of large-scale green hydrogen production and transportation across long distances. Ensuring this energy source is produced using renewable energy rather than fossil fuels will require continuous technological advancements and investments. One of the IMEC’s significant contributions could be reducing the global economy’s reliance on critical maritime chokepoints like the Suez Canal. The corridor proposes an alternative route that could reduce congestion and improve trade resilience for India and its partners. But while the IMEC may offer an alternative route, it is unlikely to replace the Suez Canal entirely, given the volume of global trade passing through the latter. The IMEC may provide some relief, but the Suez Canal will remain vital in international trade due to its centrality and established infrastructure. The IMEC also plans to establish a 20,000 kilometre cable system — the Trans Europe Asia System — to bolster global communication networks. Given that 95 per cent of the world’s communication flows through undersea cables, this project is vital for improving the security of international data transmission. India’s involvement in the IMEC reflects its growing diplomatic prowess. The corridor offers India the opportunity to strengthen its geopolitical alliances with key countries in the Middle East, Europe and North America while simultaneously countering China’s influence in global trade. Similarly, by focusing on the IMEC’s economic and strategic benefits, India can consolidate its role as a significant player in global trade networks. The corridor will also serve to promote India’s Digital Public Infrastructure, a framework designed to enhance financial inclusion and streamline digital transactions. By integrating Digital Public Infrastructure into the IMEC, India could set new standards in cross-border digital trade and communication. The IMEC represents a significant opportunity for India to strengthen its position in global trade networks. It offers a comprehensive strategy to enhance regional cooperation and economic resilience by focusing on trade efficiency, renewable energy and digital connectivity. For the IMEC to succeed, participating countries must align on an actionable implementation plan that addresses these challenges head-on. Only by doing so can the IMEC realise its potential to drive global trade, secure energy transitions and offer a robust alternative to existing trade routes.

The CDC Planned Quarantine Camps Nationwide – OpEd	No matter how bad you think Covid policies were, they were intended to be worse. Consider the vaccine passports alone. Six cities were locked down to include only the vaccinated in public indoor places. They were New York City, Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and Seattle. The plan was to enforce this with a vaccine passport. It broke. Once the news leaked that the shot didn’t stop infection or transmission, the planners lost public support and the scheme collapsed. It was undoubtedly planned to be permanent and nationwide if not worldwide. Instead, the scheme had to be dialed back. Features of the CDC’s edicts did incredible damage. It imposed the rent moratorium. It decreed the ridiculous 'six feet of distance' and mask mandates. It forced Plexiglas as the interface for commercial transactions. It implied that mail-in balloting must be the norm, which probably flipped the election. It delayed the reopening as long as possible. It was sadistic. Even with all that, worse was planned. On July 26, 2020, with the George Floyd riots having finally settled down, the CDC issued a plan for establishing nationwide quarantine camps. People were to be isolated, given only food and some cleaning supplies. They would be banned from participating in any religious services. The plan included contingencies for preventing suicide. There were no provisions made for any legal appeals or even the right to legal counsel. The plan’s authors were unnamed but included 26 footnotes. It was completely official. The document was only removed on about March 26, 2023. During the entire intervening time, the plan survived on the CDC’s public site with little to no public notice or controversy. It was called 'Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings.' 'This document presents considerations from the perspective of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) for implementing the shielding approach in humanitarian settings as outlined in guidance documents focused on camps, displaced populations and low-resource settings. This approach has never been documented and has raised questions and concerns among humanitarian partners who support response activities in these settings. The purpose of this document is to highlight potential implementation challenges of the shielding approach from CDC’s perspective and guide thinking around implementation in the absence of empirical data. Considerations are based on current evidence known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may need to be revised as more information becomes available.' By absence of empirical data, the meaning is: nothing like this has ever been tried. The point of the document was to map out how it could be possible and alert authorities to possible pitfalls to be avoided. The meaning of 'shielding' is 'to reduce the number of severe Covid-19 cases by limiting contact between individuals at higher risk of developing severe disease (‘high-risk’) and the general population (‘low-risk’). High-risk individuals would be temporarily relocated to safe or ‘green zones’ established at the household, neighborhood, camp/sector, or community level depending on the context and setting. They would have minimal contact with family members and other low-risk residents.' In other words, this is what used to be concentration camps. Who are these people who would be rounded up? They are 'older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions.' Who determines this? Public health authorities. The purpose? The CDC explains: 'physically separating high-risk individuals from the general population' allows authorities 'to prioritize the use of the limited available resources.' This sounds a lot like condemning people to death in the name of protecting them. The model establishes three levels. First is the household level. Here high-risk people are'physically isolated from other household members.' That alone is objectionable. Elders need people to take care of them. They need love and to be surrounded by family. The CDC should never imagine that it would intervene in households to force old people into separate places. The model jumps from households to the 'neighborhood level.' Here we have the same approach: forced separation of those deemed vulnerable. From there, the model jumps again to the 'camp/sector level.' Here it is different. 'A group of shelters such as schools, community buildings within a camp/sector (max 50 high-risk individuals per single green zone) where high-risk individuals are physically isolated together. One entry point is used for exchange of food, supplies, etc. A meeting area is used for residents and visitors to interact while practicing physical distancing (2 meters). No movement into or outside the green zone.' Yes, you read that correctly. The CDC is here proposing concentration camps for the sick or anyone they deem to be in danger of medically significant consequences of infection. Further: 'to minimize external contact, each green zone should include able-bodied high-risk individuals capable of caring for residents who have disabilities or are less mobile. Otherwise, designate low-risk individuals for these tasks, preferably who have recovered from confirmed COVID-19 and are assumed to be immune.' The plan says in passing, contradicting thousands of years of experience, 'Currently, we do not know if prior infection confers immunity.' Therefore the only solution is to minimize all exposure throughout the whole population. Getting sick is criminalized. These camps require a 'dedicated staff' to 'monitor each green zone. Monitoring includes both adherence to protocols and potential adverse effects or outcomes due to isolation and stigma. It may be necessary to assign someone within the green zone, if feasible, to minimize movement in/out of green zones.' The people housed in these camps need to have good explanations of why they are denied even basic religious freedom. The report explains: 'Proactive planning ahead of time, including strong community engagement and risk communication is needed to better understand the issues and concerns of restricting individuals from participating in communal practices because they are being shielded. Failure to do so could lead to both interpersonal and communal violence.' Further, there must be some mechanisms to prohibit suicide: Additional stress and worry are common during any epidemic and may be more pronounced with COVID-19 due to the novelty of the disease and increased fear of infection, increased childcare responsibilities due to school closures, and loss of livelihoods. Thus, in addition to the risk of stigmatization and feeling of isolation, this shielding approach may have an important psychological impact and may lead to significant emotional distress, exacerbate existing mental illness or contribute to anxiety, depression, helplessness, grief, substance abuse, or thoughts of suicide among those who are separated or have been left behind. Shielded individuals with concurrent severe mental health conditions should not be left alone. There must be a caregiver allocated to them to prevent further protection risks such as neglect and abuse. The biggest risk, the document explains, is as follows: 'While the shielding approach is not meant to be coercive, it may appear forced or be misunderstood in humanitarian settings.' (It should go without saying but this 'shielding' approach suggested here has nothing to do with focused protection of the Great Barrington Declaration. Focused protection specifically says: 'schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.') In four years of research, and encountering truly shocking documents and evidence of what happened in the Covid years, this one certainly ranks up at the top of the list of totalitarian schemes for pathogenic control prior to vaccination. It is quite simply mind-blowing that such a scheme could ever be contemplated. Who wrote it? What kind of deep institutional pathology exists that enabled this to be contemplated? The CDC has 10,600 full-time employees and contractors and a budget of $11.5 billion. In light of this report, and everything else that has gone on there for four years, both numbers should be zero.

The Plot Against Democracy – OpEd	In Philadelphia this past weekend, I met a number of people who’d given up on democracy. They railed about politicians who make promises they don’t keep. They spun conspiracy theories about the government. A number of those who answered the door told me that they weren’t going to vote. Then there were the grim young men who said, hell yeah, they were going to vote for Trump. They spoke of the Republican presidential candidate as if he were Tony Montana, the gangster played by Al Pacino in the film Scarface: violent, lawless, and powerful. Trump elicited respect laced with fear. According to his supporters, he’d stand up to America’s enemies abroad and be tough on crime domestically. Several said to me—with the usual preface of 'don’t get me wrong but…'—that a woman president would be too weak or 'mixed up by hormones' to do those necessary things. If you cross celebrity culture with gun culture and add a few dollops of testosterone, you get Donald Trump. Much has been written about the rise of the global far right (including by me). It’s important to understand that this global trend is not a type of politics. It is an anti-politics. The far right embodied by Vladimir Putin in Russia, Victor Orban in Hungary, Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, and others is determined to unravel democracy. They have contempt for elections. They revise, bend, or undermine the constitutional order. And they despise the civic engagement at the heart of thriving democracies. They crack down on dissent. They target protesters. They ruthlessly purge the 'enemy within.' This is what Donald Trump has promised to do this time around. The Republican campaign in 2024 relied on anti-government rhetoric, conspiracy theories, and violent innuendo (against FEMA, against the border patrol, against Republican politicians that didn’t toe the MAGA line) in order to do two things. These strategies drew the disaffected to the polls. And they pushed others not to vote: to give up on politics altogether. Rage and apathy are the two modes of right-wing politicking. This is a variation on Albert Hirschman’s famous 'exit, voice, and loyalty' distinction. The loyalists are voicing their anger, the apathetic are exiting, and the dissidents continue to organize in the hopes of avoiding the Russian scenario: an entire opposition in exile or jail. Other countries have managed to buck the trend. Even little Moldova was able to successfully beat back the anti-democratic, pro-Russian, billionaire-supported candidate in its presidential election last weekend. Brazil got rid of Bolsonaro. The French teamed up to stop Marine Le Pen at the polls. It can be done. Rich, prosperous, arrogant America failed to do so. Let’s face it: American politics, as we know it, is over. To be sure, it was always possible for American politicians to win with dirty tricks. But then there’d be a course correction of sorts: Nixon followed by Watergate, Trump 2016 followed by impeachment and electoral loss. That loss in 2020 should have been an inoculation against outlandish lies, threats, and manipulations. Instead, the Republican Party doubled down. It abandoned the few remaining guardrails governing the conduct of a campaign, which is a preview of how the next administration will skirt the few remaining guardrails it reluctantly observed in the waning days of its previous term in office. The political game is now fundamentally different. Forget 'ground game.' Forget strategic messaging. Forget polling. In other words, forget about those traditional methods of mobilizing political sentiment in a democracy. Never bring a knife to a gunfight, the pundits warn. The Democrats brought a computer to a gunfight. Those computer models of how to win an election now lie in ruins. A funereal pall has descended over half of America, and naturally there is a lot of finger-pointing in the wake of the Democratic Party’s loss of the presidency and the Senate. It was misogyny. It was Black men abandoning the Democratic Party. It was poor whites voting against their economic self-interest. It was the Electoral College, Elon Musk’s money, and Russian disinformation. It was Joe Biden’s decision to run again, and Kamala Harris’s failure to explain her positions clearly. It was all of that, of course. But it was also the failure of the Democratic Party to understand the rage coursing through the body politic. The Democrats failed to translate the economic gains of the last four years—the infrastructure bill, the watered-down version of the Green New Deal, the CHIPS Act—into populist language. Put another way, the ordinary gains of an ordinary political process did not prove inspiring because this is a post-political moment. And the Democrats were playing by the rules of the old era. Here’s an instructive story. A friend confessed to me before the election that he didn’t pay attention to politics. 'They’re both bad,' he said 'One’s a fascist, the other’s a communist.' 'Harris is a communist?' I said, surprised. 'That’s ridiculous. She’s just a run-of-the-mill politician, straddling the center. I could understand if you were criticizing Bernie Sanders as a communist. He, at least, is a self-professed socialist. He’s not a communist, of course, but at least he’s – .' 'Oh, Bernie?' my friend interrupted me. 'Oh yeah, I really like Bernie!' There are several lessons here. Even for the apolitical, the lies of Trump ('she’s a Marxist!') penetrated the population with the brutal repetitiveness of state propaganda. The level of political understanding in the populace is shockingly low (a fifth grader should be able to put Trump, Harris, and Sanders on a political spectrum). And Bernie’s populism transcends ideology. Like the Vermont senator, a successful political party must be able to channel anger as well as aspiration. As the opposition regroups, it’s useful to repeat some truisms. Character is forged in adversity. Previous generations have successfully fought fascism to rescue democracy. And democracy is all about learning lessons and moving forward (especially after slipping backward). It’s long been clear that this country needs a new politics. To use a shopworn phrase, let’s build back better—after this third and most devastating hurricane of the season. In his 2004 novel, The Plot Against America, Philip Roth imagined the alternative past of a fascist takeover of the United States. Charles Lindbergh, a pro-Hitler isolationist, wins the 1940 election with his slogan 'Vote for Lindbergh, or vote for war.' In office, he fulfills his promise by keeping the United States out of World War II. But when Lindbergh’s plane mysteriously goes missing, Roosevelt gets reelected to the presidency in 1942. The Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, and history resumes its well-known course. It’s a chilling book that resonates with today’s headlines. It was a reminder, well before the political rise of Trump, that it can happen here. But the current situation is different. This is not just a battle over the soul of America. This is a much larger confrontation. This conflict is being waged against Russia in Ukraine and against Israel in Gaza. It is being fought in polling places in democratic nations around the world. And it is being sustained by anti-authoritarian dissidents in streets, jails, and exile communities. Even as they wrap themselves in the American flag and the U.S. constitution, the American far right and its enablers are plotting against democracy itself. It didn’t look promising in 1940 either, in Roth’s alternative reality or in the actual history. So, let the finger-pointing end and a new era of creative and savvy political organizing begin.

The Sustainability Scam: How Self-Interest Ruins Good Ideas – Ana...	We must ensure ecocentric standards to reverse environmental and social injustices. We have laws to ensure children are born into a safe, sustainable, and unpolluted environment. These laws are also meant to empower future generations and guarantee birth equity. But far from ensuring that these rights are upheld, we disfranchise children at birth because they do not have a legal say in the actions of adults that impact their future. Our ill-advised desire to prioritize economic growth over children's futures has led to the climate crisis. It has also led to children being born into unequal conditions where they do not have equal access to welfare resources. This has resulted in the impacts of environmental degradation being felt unequally among different socioeconomic groups. Poor people, Indigenous groups, and people of color are, by and large, impacted more by the degraded environment than the wealthy and white segment of the population. This is the tragic legacy of environmental racism, which has been referred to as 'the new Jim Crow.' Those most affected by these injustices often have little or no say in shaping policies and laws, and their children eventually inherit this unequal system. In a capitalist, profit-driven economy, it is unsurprising that the corporate sector, driven by financial concerns above all else, is the biggest culprit in perpetuating these wrongs—particularly the extractive industries and industrial agriculture. The Misinformed Power Grab Most leaders—and the biggest beneficiaries of an unequal society—never came close to protecting children from the harm caused by the development model favored by the rich world. Instead, poor children grow up in a world to face the repercussions of a power grab by wealthy, primarily white, families. The first misstep of dissociating the connection between human rights and environmental sustainability was taken in 1948 when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was signed, establishing fundamental rights for all people. Twenty years later, in 1968, the United Nations held a conference in Tehran where some groups raised concerns about the impact of population growth (and, by extension, economic growth) on human rights. Despite these efforts, the concerns were never resolved, and the relevant changes were never incorporated into the UDHR. Fixing the Problem: Laws, Norms, and Reparations The UN's ill-informed, misguided policy decision has led to a socioeconomic system built on the disenfranchisement of children at the time of their birth. There is an urgent requirement to rectify this situation and secure their welfare. Firstly, reparations are needed. The wealth made through this process of disenfranchisement must be used to secure the future of newborn children who are entering the world. Those wealthy individuals and corporations that have benefited most from this disenfranchisement (and may have promoted ignorance by glossing over the actual impacts of economic growth) should be held especially responsible. Secondly, we must establish laws and norms that ensure that the rights and welfare of unborn children are accounted for in the democratic process and that human beings are not merely seen as a means to sustain and grow economies. We must shape a future where children are not born simply to become consumers or workers but as fully participatory citizens with agency over their lives, with the ability to choose and thrive instead of merely surviving. While Effective Altruism and other movements based on financial investments are often viewed by many nonprofits as effective ways to resolve these issues, reparations are the most effective and immediate way to fix problems facing us today if we want to restore the natural balance. If we skip this crucial step, it would be the equivalent of building a house with no foundation. The Sustainability Scam Sustainability has become a buzzword among environmentalists, CEOs, and politicians. Leaders often present themselves as guardians of a better future, bragging about eco-friendly projects and sustainable methods. However, a closer look exposes a darker aspect to these assertions. The rhetoric and reality frequently diverge significantly, with racial disparities, self-interest, and uneven growth undermining various projects' ostensible benefits. Nonprofits working toward social, economic, and environmental changes must also include family planning in their goals. They must first help ensure the shared, inclusive equity of children born into the world. That means giving all newly born human beings an equal capacity to self-determine the social and ecological influences that others have over them. In his 2018 book Winners Take All, The Elite Charade of Changing the World, Anand Giridharadas examines how the global elite's efforts to 'change the world' are only an attempt to retain the status quo. He argues that their actions to try and resolve problems are a bid to hide their role in creating the problems in the first place. Publishers Weekly called the book a 'damning portrait of contemporary American philanthropy.' But Giridharadas—and publications like the New York Times—have missed the biggest charade—the one mainly driving the suffering and death unfolding as temperatures increase. This 'sustainability scam' has at least two standards for activist campaigns that claim to be sustainable, green, humane, democratic, eco-friendly, etc. There is one standard for wealthy investors (and their children), who often fund organizations that promote these terms, hoping that their work might have an impact in furthering them, and a different standard based on birth equity. These standards are artificial, arbitrary, and designed to allow a particular form of economic growth that benefits some—mainly the white population—at a deadly cost to others. This first standard—anthropocentric and adopted in 1968 by the UN agencies bowing to wealthy families—does not require birth equity. It functions on unsustainable welfare as the primary currency or value. This first standard allows significant deviation from the ecosocial baselines and ecocentric standards that would have prevented the climate crisis. These real standards can be measured along at least eight metrics like restorative levels of greenhouse gas emissions and inclusive representative ratios that ensure a healthy, functional democracy. Deviation from these standards—based on self-determination or freedom and equitable share in democracy—has led to the climate crisis that is killing millions. Funders in the polluter nations facing significant climate liability fund various institutions—media, nonprofits, universities, agencies, think tanks, and celebrities—to spread disinformation to support the first standard. This allows wealthy families to treat inherited wealth and other privileges as something outside the realm of the democratic process, which they use to strengthen their positionality and growth to systematically disenfranchise the average voter. We are now at a place where they can use the wealth they made through the scam to attack the democratic process and try to step outside of it. An effort is underway at the United Nations that requires assessments of climate damages. This includes the need to 1) ensure that ecocentric standards are adopted to account for the actual harm being done by the crisis and 2) to treat these standards and the recovery of climate reparations as the first and overriding human rights, a right that preempts the government's authority to assign wealth contrary to it, and allows citizens to engage in preemptive acts of self-defense to protect themselves and their children. Inequitable Growth Policies As a fundamental right, people who are made vulnerable by the actions of others—like fenceline communities put in harm's way by petrochemical plants being built in their backyards—are owed compensation. As millions die in a climate crisis resulting from inequitable growth policies undoing most mitigation efforts, questions arise about how that happened and who should be held accountable. We can see the imbalance in how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts those who are least responsible for causing it. In 2022, Seth Borenstein and Drew Costley of the Associated Press reported that 'the data shows that the top carbon emitter over time, the United States, has caused more than $1.9 trillion in climate damage to other countries from 1990 to 2014, including $310 billion in damage to Brazil, $257 billion in damage to India, $124 billion to Indonesia, $104 billion to Venezuela and $74 billion to Nigeria. But at the same time, the United States' carbon pollution has benefited the U.S. by more than $183 billion, while Canada, Germany, and Russia have profited even more from American emissions.' This problem can no longer be ignored if we want to secure our children's future. We must work toward resolving the social and economic disparities, increasing access to welfare measures, and ensuring better resources for pregnant women and families. Ensuring Child Rights There is a minimum threshold of well-being for birthing a child, which is necessary for self-determination. We must take drastic measures to ensure all children have the resources to become self-determining individuals. This could involve seizing resources from well-defended enclaves of wealth. By doing so, potential mothers might be incentivized to plan for their children's future, knowing these resources would be available. Some will argue that reduced economic growth, for example, is too high a cost to pay for ensuring birth equity and access to the same welfare opportunities for all children, especially those from BIPOC communities. However, these minimum thresholds are essential in forming a just and equitable society. People who argue against these basic standards threaten who we aspire to be as a society. They are more interested in exploiting humans and the environment for their gains, rather than investing in a better future. They threaten our freedom. It's physically impossible to have a legally obligating 'we' that precedes all legitimate national constitutions without measurable birth equity. As the work done by the United Nations shows, no one gets to use authority and state violence to benefit at a cost to others without incurring significant risk. It is important to see beyond the lies perpetuated between 1948 and 1968 to make us think that national sovereignty is magically inherent. It has to be derived from the measurable sovereignty or self-determination of its subjects. The only way to ensure share equity is to entitle would-be parents to bring children into the world only after a certain threshold of planned conditions, measurable on the eight metrics, have been achieved. The wealth accumulated by exploiting nature, which led to the climate crisis, must be used to ensure these conditions. The United States prides itself on being a free nation but uses the concept of freedom that starts by exploiting the most vulnerable. There is no minimum threshold of well-being for future children and animals, as they are seen as a means to growing economies rather than individuals with rights who form integral parts of society. Converting democracies into unsustainable growth economies that enrich a few by diluting everyone else's equal and influential equity shares in our political system is a subtle form of oppression. It leads to millions dying as the growth triggers catastrophic heat waves. This eventually results in justified resistance movements to protest against the scam, where those at the top of the economic pyramid benefitted from a society that promised an inclusive democracy, which is instead based on shared inequity. 'While there is no 'optimal' human population, the evidence suggests that a sustainable global population of 3 billion is an optimistic number given that we long ago entered a continuously intensifying state of ecological overshoot, accumulating ever more massive amounts of ecological debt that must be paid down if we are to avoid the ongoing (and ever-worsening) climate catastrophe, ecological destruction, and the resulting human misery,' Dr. Christopher K. Tucker, chairman of the American Geographical Society, said in an October 2024 email. 'Adding 80 million additional people to the planet each year—the equivalent of 10 New York Cities or an additional Germany each year—is not a recipe for addressing this polycrisis,' he said. 'Fortunately, simply investing (heavily) in empowering strategies focused on women and girls worldwide can hasten the already inevitable demographic transition that would relieve the unrelenting pressure we have foisted on our planet—and help us meet our commitments to the next generation under the UN's 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child.' The wealthy need to pay the cost of creating an unequal system that benefits them instead of ensuring equal and inclusive participation by all citizens in that system. They profit from treating children as part of a labor force to build and grow economies, instead of securing their rights as part of human rights and the democratic process. Many involved in prioritizing birth equity have seen a pattern in how they react to it: they do not offer counterarguments to the idea that restoring nature through ecosocial birth equity must be the first and overriding human right but resort to tactics to evade the issue. These people share a common trait: They attempt to evade being held responsible for the deadly costs and lush benefits of their birth, developmental, and emancipatory positionality. Their phrasing varies from 'I'm just trying to save these specific animals' to 'I'm just trying to focus on this specific area of research.' That kind of siloed myopia ultimately destroysbiodiversity and causes irreversible environmental damage. True Sustainability Means Having Children in a Very Different Way These deceptive tactics undermine the promise of sustainability, allowing leaders to project a false image of environmental stewardship while continuing harmful practices. To achieve genuine sustainability, we must demand transparency, hold organizations accountable, and ensure that the benefits of sustainable development are distributed equitably. Addressing these systemic issues is the only way toward a sustainable and just future. Many willing to benefit at a deadly cost to others want to treat the birth of children as unrelated to their lives. It is not. It is the basis of all things: a commitment to our most fundamental aspirations. Do we care about each other or exploit each other? While economics has dominated the social sciences because humans predictably try to maximize their welfare, it is also clear that many people choose criteria for truth and value that reaffirm their birth and developmental positionality. That's a dangerous form of self-deception, but understanding its existence allows us to move beyond economics, beyond capitalism versus socialism, and toward unifying constitutionality. We can't change lives for the better if disproportionately influential people have the power to define what good is. Recognizing this fact is essential to hold those who evade our obligations to birth equity accountable—so that we all can work together to know what's right and work toward taking remedial steps to prevent further environmental damage. How could you know how much welfare you deserve if you are not involved in making the rules determining welfare? We can't create economic demand by violating neonatal rights. We can't ensure economic growth by preventing all citizens from being born and raised in town halls and participating in the democratic process. Using specific ecosocial thresholds to reform birth and development rights ensures an equal and influential role in rulemaking, thus limiting the influence others have over you to live in relative self-determination. Given the exponential difference between the wealth of Black and white children, massive reforms are necessary to achieve equity. Countries cannot legitimately undercut the sovereignty of their subjects by ignoring children's birth and development entitlements, using those children instead as economic inputs to create ecologically deadly growth. Nations and many powerful interests within them have, while responding to the 'baby bust' of falling fertility rates, openly admitted to doing this. Part of creating deadly growth is to offer tax cuts to women for having children. In the book Walden by Henry David Thoreau, we learn that a basket weaver could not expect to succeed in the 'free' markets created by those colonizing his lands. But even Thoreau missed the fundamental value of nature in constituting the creation of power relations toward equity and freedom. Laws that protect the beneficiaries of any political system only derive their legitimacy by including and empowering future generations—in a measurable way—rather than exploiting them.

Moscow Opens Pandora’s Box With New Talk About Changing Ukraine’s...	On November 4, the post-Soviet Russia’s Day of National Accord, Yevgeny Pozdnyakov, a pro-Kremlin commentator for Vzglyad, published a commentary entitled 'Russia Will Have to Redraw the Borders of Ukraine' (Vzglyad, November 4). Pozdnyakov dismisses the idea that Ukraine should be allowed to exist in its borders established in 1991 because almost all neighboring countries claimed or even controlled part of its territory at one time or another and to this day do not respect those borders. To support this argument, he uses a tactic much favored by Russian commentators, citing Ukrainian authors rather than Russian ones to make his point that Ukraine’s current borders are meaningless. Pozdnyakov then suggests that in the future, Russia should work with other countries, such as Hungary and Poland, to change the borders. That would reduce a future Ukrainian state to a small landlocked country incapable of defending itself or being defended by others against Russian demands. This logic is likely being shared by some Kremlin officials, meaning that any 'land for peace' deal between Kyiv and Moscow will not end the conflict. Instead, after perhaps a brief breathing space, the Putin regime will continue its aggression against Ukraine with the aid of allies. With those successes in hand, Russia could then launch attacks on other neighbors such as the Baltic countries and Kazakhstan. In short, what may appear to some as a peace deal could trigger a broader war rather than prevent one. Pozdnyakov’s argument builds upon and modifies Moscow’s commentaries on border changes that were especially frequent at the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s expanded war in Ukraine in February 2022 (see EDM, March 29, 2022). At that time, Vladimir Vinokurov, a professor at the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Diplomatic Academy, took a very different view about border changes in Ukraine. Vinokurov suggested that Russia should oppose any changes in Ukraine’s Western borders because those could limit Russia’s freedom of action. Although, he conceded, if Kyiv made territorial concessions to Moscow, Hungary and Poland would likely make analogous demands for concessions themselves (NVO.NG.ru, June 2, 2022). After more than two years of fighting, however, Ukrainian resistance has prevented the Russian side from achieving its initial goals and Moscow appears to have concluded that it may ultimately need to involve other countries in the future if it is to achieve the much-diminished Kyiv. Pozdnyakov suggests in his article that not only would Hungary and Poland’s demands for concessions help Russia directly in that effort, but they would also normalize territorial expansion and, thus, reduce criticism of Moscow for engaging in it. In Moscow’s view, if everyone is involved or portrayed as being involved in territorial aggrandizement then Russia should not be singled out with sanctions and other restrictions. If that view prevails, far more wars of aggression will break out, possibly leading to a global conflagration. The borders of Ukraine, like those of many countries in the region, including Russia, have shifted throughout history. This historical context, however, does not validate Pozdnyakov’s conclusions, even though it is true that the evolution of the Ukraine-Russia borders of continued right up to the end of the Soviet period. (On that process, see my 'Can Republican Borders be Changed?' RFE/RL Report on the USSR, September 28, 1990, posted online at Window on Eurasia, May 21, 2021). Moreover, borders of districts within these union republics were also changed frequently, again to serve Moscow’s interests, and especially to prevent any challenges to the Soviet Union’s territorial division (Window on Eurasia, October 5). When the Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991, all 12 countries that had been union republics—the three occupied Baltic countries had left earlier—and the international community committed themselves to accepting the 1991 borders as legitimate. The independence of these countries had only become possible because of a provision in the Soviet constitution allowing union republics to secede. There was a conviction that doing anything else would cause more issues, making the transitions many hoped for impossible and even more dangerous than agreeing to the previously established Soviet borders. Those decisions, of course, did not prevent border disputes among and within the newly independent countries. The most prominent disputes before Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea include Moscow’s war against Chechnya, the conflict of Armenia and Azerbaijan over Karabakh, and a series of disputes among Central Asian countries. These conflicts have attracted the attention of other countries, which have supported one side or the other, but rarely their direct participation. Moscow, until very recently when it recruited North Koreans to fight alongside the Russian military in Ukraine, has opposed any involvement of countries beyond the former Soviet space and see it as a direct threat (see EDM, October 30). Many of these countries, even when they very much supported one side or the other, fear that their involvement could spark an even more serious conflict between the Russian Federation and themselves (Window on Eurasia, May 26). Moscow’s counting on the possibility that East European countries might help it in Ukraine should not come as a surprise. Russian officials have always paid close attention to the ways Moscow can exploit ethnic minorities in adversarial countries. In the case of Ukraine, the Kremlin has long tracked the Hungarian, Polish, and Romanian minorities, of which there are approximately 150,000 each, and these groups’ attitudes in their ethnic homelands—even if those governments have been generally supportive of Kyiv. More recently, Moscow has paid particular attention to Hungary and the Hungarians in Ukraine’s Transcarpathia given the Orban government’s pro-Moscow position and Budapest’s own actions regarding the Hungarian minority in Ukraine (see EDM, June 20). It is entirely possible that the Kremlin may believe that offering Russian assistance to Hungary to regain portions of Ukraine could help Moscow wean Budapest even further away from Europe. Pozdnyakov’s article suggests that Moscow is increasingly attentive to these complicated ethnic relationships, something Western governments need to be aware of as well. Without proper care, any agreement the West encourages Kyiv to sign with Moscow could spark new and broader conflicts in the region and sow the seeds of a much larger and more destructive war.

Unusual Reasons Africa Wanted Trump To Win – OpEd	By Azu Ishiekwene I understand wealthy US citizens and conservatives of the evangelical hue rooting for Donald Trump. The rich believe he would loosen regulations and protect them and their businesses from excessive taxation. Conservative evangelicals believe he is the bulwark against wokeism, especially the ultra-liberal variety. And white folks want their country back. But Africans at home and in the Diaspora—what is their business supporting a guy who described their continent as a 'shithole' and has worn his anti-immigrant rhetoric on his sleeves? It didn’t seem to make sense that anyone who saw Trump 1.0 would ever dream or wish for the second version. But now, he’s back. He even has the Supreme Court and the Senate in his Red corner as of press time. With the media (especially the major networks) awash with polls indicating a dead heat up to zero hours, I became more interested in the pro-Trump sentiment among Nigerians. I also checked in with friends elsewhere on the continent, and the feedback surprised me. Trump, we want Some friends told me Trump is just the man the US needs to purge itself of its hubris and arrogance. Once upon a time, the US was a moral force for good worldwide. Its exceptionalism didn’t often require bullying others to make the point. It did many bad things during the Cold War, as did its arch-rival, the Soviet Union. But after that phase and with the fall of the Berlin Wall, many had hoped to see the emergence of a multipolar world, one in which, if you like, the lion and the lamb would lie side by side. But that was not to be. From Cuba to Venezuela, Libya to the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, and right up to the old sphere of influence of the USSR, the US stoked—and still stokes—a zero-sumness that hardly brooks 'live and let live.' Since then, the world has experienced fewer devastating wars, but it has wrestled with no fewer tensions of a new variety aided and abetted by technology. Same difference? Trump 2.0, these folks hope, will do at least two things for the world. It would further hasten the internal decay of the US by aggravating racial tensions and emboldening right-wing excesses. Two, Trump’s America First ultra-insularity and his off-the-fly foreign policy style will distance the US from its traditional allies and enable crazies around the world, like North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, to run amok. This sounded more like saying that if US voters were happy to be seduced by their worst selves, they deserve what they get. But that was not all. Some also wanted Trump’s victory as a stick to beat their leaders back home. On the eve of the election, Larry Madowo of CNN reported that Kenyans wanted Trump to win because 'with him, you know where you stand.' The report contrasted Trump’s style with Kenya’s political elite, who could hardly be trusted. Trumphobes The CNN report might also have been about Nigeria, where Trumphobes wanted him to win for a slightly curiously different reason. They think his anti-immigration policy will force Nigerians and their government to fix their own country. In the US, Nigeria has the highest diaspora population of Africa, 327,000 citizens, followed by Ethiopia, 222,000, and Egypt, 192,000. It didn’t matter much to the Trumphobes that Nigeria’s US diaspora sends home $20 billion yearly, an increasingly significant source of support for a distressed economy. What is at work is a reverse schadenfreude, which says that the fewer opportunities Nigerian immigrants have outside the country, the more seriously the government would be obliged to fix the country. Someone even said to me that the 'malicious support' for Trump was payback for the bad leaders that the US routinely propped and supported around the world, a list that included Saddam Hussein, Augusto Pinochet and Mobutu Seseko. Republican African record Some pro-Trump sentiments are, however, driven by facts. For example, Republicans have a far better record of engaging Africans than Democrats. The Republican Party opposed colonialism. Its support for African initiatives such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and efforts to combat AIDS contrasts with the Democrat’s preference for aid diplomacy. The hope is that Trump 2.0 will not be an exception. Here, Diasporans are not too far from their Black cousins in the US. A NAACP poll in September showed that one in four Black men under 50 supported Trump for president. Trump 1.0 showed tough love towards Africa, but it was on his watch, for example, that the US finally authorised the sale to Nigeria of the much-needed fighter jets for the prosecution of the war on Boko Haram, which President Barack Obama had blocked for eight years. On his part, President Joe Biden will only make a brief visit – his first to Africa in four years – to Angola on his way out of the White House. Better or worse? Trump’s overwhelming victory might mean one of two things for his presidency: The weight of the responsibility could humble him and increase the likelihood that he would be more restrained than before. On the other hand, it could also bring out the worst in him—that feeling that he never really lost in 2020, that he was cheated of victory as he claimed, that it’s now time to take his pound of flesh with a vengeance. We’ll have to wait and see. If Trump 2.0 means Africans who were not on the radar during the campaign will now have to look inward and find their way through an uncertain future, then so be it. Ukraine and Gaza Trump’s victory might hasten the end of the war in Ukraine and, hopefully, improve the protracted global supply chain crisis that has affected the supply of agricultural products and cooking oils to many African countries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky knows he cannot depend on Trump to bear the cost of a war that has, for all purposes, become a meat grinder. The war in Ukraine might end sooner than later. As for the Middle East, Trump. 1.0 moved the Embassy of the US from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem despite protests by the Palestinians and some Arab countries. If that means anything, it should suggest that Trump 2.0 will not walk on the eggshell of a two-state solution in his approach to the current war on Gaza. He’s flat-out pro-Netanyahu and big on oil deals with Gulf states. I make no pretence of my dislike of Trump’s politics. Nor do I have any illusions that his second term would be significantly different from his first, which left the world holding its breath dangerously for four years. But if he’s the man American voters have chosen to lead them, so be it. Unfortunately, what America does—for good or ill—affects the rest of the world whether or not we cast a ballot.

Zelenskyy Warns EU Leaders That Capitulation To Putin Is ‘Suicida...	(RFE/RL) -- President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned European leaders that capitulation to Russia after it invaded Ukraine would be 'suicidal' for Europe, just hours after Kyiv and the Black Sea port of Odesa were rocked by an unusually intense wave of air strikes. Speaking at a meeting of the European Political Community in Budapest on November 7, Zelenskiy renewed his appeals for more support for his war-torn country ahead of an informal EU summit the next day to be hosted by Hungary, which currently holds the 27-member bloc's rotating presidency. He also said he has already spoken with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump about how both the United States and Europe need to be strong for each other's benefit amid the 'many challenges' facing the world. 'There has been much talk about the need to yield to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, to back down, to make some concessions. It's unacceptable for Ukraine and suicidal for all Europe,' Zelenskiy said in his speech, which came two days after Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Speaking later at a news conference, he said he was not aware of any details of Trump's plan to end the war quickly and that he had not discussed it with him. He said he believed Trump wanted to end the war quickly, but this did not necessarily mean it would happen. He also said talk of introducing a cease-fire without first agreeing security guarantees for Ukraine was 'very dangerous.' 'A cease-fire when there are no security guarantees...is a preparation for the continuation of the occupation,' he said. Trepidation has swept across Europe since the victory given Trump's oft-stated skepticism over U.S. military support for Ukraine.'The concept of 'peace through strength' has proven itself and is needed now. Showing weakness or selling out Europe's positions won't buy a just peace. Peace is the reward only for the strong,' Zelenskiy added. Zelenskiy was welcomed to the meeting by right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has maintained close ties with Putin and has spoken against EU sanctions on Moscow. Orban also has close relations with Trump. NATO chief Mark Rutte, in a pitch to secure Trump's support for Ukraine, told journalists upon arrival in Budapest that the sending troops by North Korea to aid Russia in Ukraine posed a direct threat to the United States. 'What we see more and more is that North Korea, Iran, China, and of course Russia are working together, working together against Ukraine,' Rutte said. 'At the same time, Russia has to pay for this, and one of the things they are doing is delivering technology to North Korea, which is now threatening in future the mainland of the U.S., continental Europe,' he warned. 'I look forward to sit down with Donald Trump to discuss how we can face these threats collectively,' Rutte said. North Korean troops are already fighting for Russia, according to Zelenskiy, who told reporters during the news conference that they already had sustained 'losses' on the battlefield. The gathering in Budapest came as Ukraine shot down 74 of the 106 drones that Russia launched early on November 7 at targets in nine Ukrainian regions -- Odesa, Mykolayiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Sumy, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy and Chernihiv -- while 22 others were lost after being jammed by Ukrainian electronic warfare systems. Russian strikes early on November 7 sparked fires and caused damage in five districts of Kyiv, which was under Russian attack for eight hours, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported on Telegram.Drone debris fell in the the districts of Pechersk, Holosiyivskiy, Solomyansk, Obolonsk, and Podilsk, Klitschko said, adding that two people were injured by falling drone debris.Klitschko reported that the upper floors of a multistory building in Pechersk were burning and residents were being evacuated.In Odesa, a high-rise apartment building was damaged and one man was injured by falling debris after Ukrainian air defenses shot down Russian drones over the Black Sea port, regional Governor Oleh Kiper reported.Telegram channels published a video of a fire on the first floor of a nine-story building in Odesa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olqrlxG7vNvOO	2024-11-07T15:36:49-08:00	
How Chinese Nationalism Is Sending Jitters Through The Arctic – A...	By Jane Tang On an early morning in late July, a luxury expedition cruise ship, boasting the latest in high-end Arctic travel, made a slow approach to the docks of Ny-Ålesund, a remote settlement in Norway’s Svalbard Islands. At 79 degrees north latitude, Ny-Ålesund is the northernmost inhabited outpost on Earth. Isolated in the Arctic’s desolate winter, it hosts just 30 year-round residents. Newayer, a Chinese travel agency, chartered the vessel for 183 tourists from Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing. Each passenger paid at least $13,000 for a two-week 'Three Arctic Islands' tour, marketed as an exclusive opportunity to reach the 'top of the Earth,' complete with 'the luxury of Chinese hospitality.' Clad in matching red jackets bearing a polar bear logo, the travelers disembarked at their first stop: China’s Yellow River Research Station in Ny-Ålesund. There they marked the 20th anniversary of the station – one of several research facilities established on Svalbard by different nations. More than 100 Chinese tourists waved national flags beneath a Chinese Communist Party-style banner hung on the research station’s door. The travel agency’s blog likened the celebration to 'raising the Chinese national flag during the Olympics.' Among the participants, a woman in a People’s Liberation Army, or PLA, uniform was seen saluting and posing for photos. A PLA Ground Force patch is visible on her right arm, two professional cameras are slung over her shoulders. The episode has raised serious alarm in Norway, according to experts and government discussions reviewed by RFA and NRK. Military function and symbolism on Svalbard is highly restricted, and a treaty that governs foreign presence on the island forbids military activity. Yet Chinese interests have blatantly disregarded these prohibitions, in what experts say is a prime example of China’s increasing willingness to push the bounds of legal acceptability to exert its influence and power. Indeed, RFA and NRK can reveal that at least eight tourists on the cruise were PLA veterans, with at least one still appearing to hold an on-going (though not active duty) role with the Chinese armed forces. The PLA-linked tourists participated in a co-ordinated display of nationalism in the Arctic while on board their cruise ship and on Svalbard. The jingoistic displays align with what experts regard as 'gray zone' tactics employed by Beijing, in which blurry lines between civilian and military actions are exploited to exert influence. It comes as China-watchers warn that the West is ill-prepared to address the geopolitical consequences of this flexing of power. 'The big picture of China’s ambitions in the Arctic is that it reflects a clear, long-term strategic goal: China wants to be a significant presence in the Arctic,' says Isaac Kardon, a senior fellow for China Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington D.C. think tank. Since declaring itself a 'near-Arctic state' in 2018—despite lacking territorial claims—China has steadily built its presence through legal, military, commercial, and individual channels. Svalbard has become the latest frontline. An Arctic Battleground for Great Powers A remote Norwegian archipelago roughly twice the size of Hawaii, Svalbard lies less than 1,000 kilometers from the North Pole, some 650 kilometers north of mainland Norway. A land of dramatic peaks and glaciers, its location is of strategic as well as scientific importance. Its proximity to Russia’s Kola Peninsula—home to the Russian Northern Fleet and nuclear submarines—positions it as a critical focal point for military and resource interests. Radar data collected from Svalbard can aid in missile trajectory calculations and satellite calibration. Experts caution that, in the event of a war, missile routes could increasingly traverse the Arctic skies—covering the shortest distance from Beijing to Washington. 'The role Svalbard might play in a large-scale conflict involving the Arctic cannot be ignored,' warns a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'If tensions with the United States continue to worsen, the Arctic becomes the only other viable route (for China) to Europe for significant volumes of energy,' says Kardon. As melting ice opens up new shipping lanes, the waters around Svalbard are set to become even more pivotal in global trade and shifting geopolitical dynamics. In the face of these changes, governance of Svalbard-- until now a sleepy affair-- has come into focus. A 1920 treaty granted Norway sovereignty over the archipelago while allowing signatory nations to engage in peaceful scientific and economic activities. The treaty prohibits any 'warlike purposes,' and gives Norway authority to enforce these restrictions on the islands. Russia has had a decades-long presence, first with mining operations during the Cold War. Today, there is still an active mining town, Barentsburg, and a Russian research station. China joined the Svalbard Treaty in 1925 but didn’t establish a scientific presence until 2004; the founding of the Yellow River Research Station marked a significant step forward in its Arctic ambitions. According to China’s official website, the station supports scientific observation, monitoring, and research in glaciology, and conducts research in ecology, space physics, atmospheric studies, and geographic information. Its goal is to 'contribute to global efforts in addressing climate change and other challenges,' the website says. Not everyone is convinced that it is all benign. 'The fact is, when we’re talking about Russia and China, we are talking about authoritarian states. There’s no such thing really as a completely civilian, independent agency, especially one with very strong strategic implications,' says Marc Lanteigne, a Political Science professor at The Arctic University of Norway. 'Any activity, regardless of how civilian in nature it is, will produce information which will get back to the Chinese military.' Last year, Russia held what Norwegian officials described as a militaristic parade in Barentsburg—something never before seen on Svalbard—in support of Moscow’s troops in Ukraine. Dozens of trucks, tractors, and snowmobiles moved through the town waving Russian flags. A Russian company was fined for unauthorized use of a Mi-8 helicopter that flew overhead. Norway is concerned about the rise of Russian—and now Chinese—nationalist displays on the island, says Lanteigne. An internal report from the Norwegian Polar Institute, the governing authority on Svalbard Island, sounded alarm over the high-profile July celebration staged by the cruise ship tourists in front of the Chinese research station. The report, seen by RFA and NRK, found the activities 'particularly problematic' as they showed a clear disregard for regulations. A month before the event, Norwegian authorities had explicitly denied the station permission to hang a celebratory banner given its nationalistic nature-- but the station displayed it anyway, with Chinese scientists photographed posing in front of it. The Institute noted that tourists appeared 'well-prepared' with Chinese flags and stickers, and that photographs were organized in such a way that 'it is likely that the photos will be used by the Chinese authorities.' It made specific mention of the woman in the military fatigues, which they identified as PLA garb. The report noted that the authority was unsure what to do. Camilla Brekke, Director of the Norwegian Polar Institute later told RFA and NRK: 'New Ålesund is a Norwegian research station, and we do not see it as useful for the various institutions that rent premises there to hang banners, as we want a unified research nation.' 'It would not be a successful practice if various research institutions in Ny-Ålesund start hanging such banners on the houses they rent.' Some experts fear the government has been caught on the back foot. 'I get the feeling that the Norwegian government is still playing catch-up on this,' says Lanteigne. The government’s overall silence about its geopolitics has consequencesaccording to Andreas Østhagen, a Senior Fellow at The Arctic Institute think tank. 'When it comes to Svalbard and foreign and security policy, Norway’s strategy has been to sit quietly and do nothing,' he wrote. 'The less frank and transparent Norway is about issues pertaining to Svalbard, the more misunderstandings and conspiracy theories are likely to emerge, even among close allies.' Following its internal report, the Norwegian government said its representatives had met with the Chinese embassy in Oslo and reiterated the expectations for international guests, emphasizing that 'all activities in Ny-Ålesund must be civil.' They requested an explanation of the person in military dress and were told that the person 'was a private citizen or cruise tourist wearing military-style clothing deemed appropriate for the Arctic wilderness,' they told RFA and NRK. The Chinese embassy in Norway said that the cruise passengers were private tourists visiting Svalbard independently. 'The Chinese scientific team in Ny-Ålesund did not invite any tourists to participate in the relevant celebration activities,' the embassy told RFA and NRK. 'China has always actively participated in Arctic affairs in accordance with international law,' it said. It did not directly address the questions of why banners and flags were displayed despite prior warnings and why military dress was allowed. Entering the ‘gray zone’ Fan Li, the CEO of Newayer, the tour agency, told RFA and NRK that their tour group informed the research station of its plans to stage a celebration at Yellow River, and to hang banners and wave Chinese flags outside the station. The station never objected or even raised it as an issue. 'The staff at the Yellow River Station came out to engage with us, and everyone was quite happy about that,' Li told RFA and NRK. A video of the tour group’s celebration was posted to Newayer’s social media account. It further features eight guests telling the camera that they are PLA veterans and perform coordinated military salutes to China while a patriotic song plays as a soundtrack. Afterward, passengers gathered to share their stories of service in the PLA. Li said that the presence of veterans on board was merely a 'coincidence' and that when Newayer realized the connection, the company organized a ceremony and incorporated the clip into its video. According to Li, all of those featured were retired, as it’s difficult for active military members in China to travel abroad. However, one cruise participant, who identifies herself in the video as Yin Liu, was photographed wearing military garb bearing the insignia of the PLA on Svalbard. On camera, Liu says she enlisted in 1976 and fought in Vietnam in 1984 and gave the name of her unit. Ying Yu Lin, an expert on the PLA at Tamkang University in Taiwan, identified Liu’s fatigues as a 'Type 21' training uniform issued by China’s Ministry of Defense in 2023. It is restricted to military personnel and would not be accessible to civilians, Lin said. The 'Type 21' uniform can be seen on the Chinese Defense Department website. Lin added that based on her age, the uniform, and other descriptions, it was likely that Liu was a member of a local militia unit. Militia units are one of three branches of the Chinese armed forces, the other two being the PLA and the People’s Armed Police, or PAP. Attempts to reach Liu were unanswered by press time. But regardless of her status or those of other PLA-linked tourists, 'the sight of Chinese veterans waving national flags and performing salutes in the Arctic serves as an effective piece of internal propaganda,' says Lin. 'While foreign observers may overlook it, within China, it symbolizes the assertion of influence in a geopolitically significant region.' He added: 'It’s about operating within legal ambiguities—pushing boundaries without directly violating laws. This time, we see veterans in PLA uniform; next time, it could be active-duty soldiers without the uniform, gradually testing international responses and how far they can go.' These displays represent 'classic ‘gray zone’ activity—conduct that doesn’t overtly breach regulations but pushes boundaries,' according to Kardon. 'On one hand, it may appear as patriotic tourists expressing national pride; on the other, it subtly normalizes a more visible Chinese presence, legitimizing scientific activities that can serve dual purposes, like gathering environmental data and military intelligence.' Such incidents can serve to gauge reactions, particularly from Norway and other Arctic nations, helping China understand which behaviors are tolerated, he said. 'Given the strategic importance of the Arctic to the U.S., Russia, and increasingly China, there is little doubt that this expanding presence is deliberate.' Questions of diplomacy But sources familiar with diplomatic discussions say that Norway is unlikely to take a leading role in pushing back against China. 'Like many countries, Norway just doesn’t have a lot of equities in its dealings with China,' says Kardon. Overt criticism or perceived slights can cause notable damage, like in 2010, when Beijing banned imports of Norwegian salmon after its Nobel committee awarded the Peace Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. But as long as that’s the case, room for more muscular tactics in the Arctic will grow. Last month as China celebrated the 75th anniversary of the People’s Republic, the Chinese Coast Guard engaged in joint operations with Russian forces in the Arctic. This was preceded in September by a meeting of Russian and Chinese officials in Beijing to discuss economic development and resource extraction in the region, and earlier, a Chinese and Russian meeting in Svalbard to explore opening a joint research center in Pyramiden, a former Soviet mining hub on the islands. 'So if you’re looking for a pattern here, I would say this is the latest version of what China and Russia are trying to do—find a way to get to the red line without crossing it,' says Lanteigne, referring to the Yellow River celebration incident. 'It is a very subtle signal, one that really demonstrates that China is now starting to deviate more directly from Norway regarding what is and is not proper activity on Svalbard.' Lanteigne views this as a pressing challenge that the Norwegian government must confront head-on. 'I think there needs to be the understanding that with the Arctic beginning to militarize as a whole, Svalbard is caught in it, whether it likes it or not.'

Malaysian PM Lauds China’s Xi As Global South’s ‘Voice’ Day After...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim lauded Chinese President Xi Jinping as 'a new voice for the Global South' during their meeting on Thursday in Beijing, a day after 'America First' candidate Donald Trump won the U.S. election. Xi reciprocated saying his country and Malaysia were good friends and partners that must jointly oppose protectionism and uphold international fairness, although he did not mention Trump or his professed plan to tax almost all imports by 10-20%, but Chinese imports 60%. Anwar met Xi on the last day of his four-day working visit to China, his third trip to Beijing since being named PM in 2022. The Malaysian PM attended the China International Import Expo trade fair in Shanghai during the first three days of the visit. The Malaysian PM visited the United States to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in San Francisco last year, but he has not made an official trip to Washington as PM. In his opening remarks on the visit to meet Xi, Anwar commended the Chinese president for emphasizing 'values and civilization' and his 'passion for the people, the poor, and humanity.' 'More importantly, your vision for global security and development resonates deeply with us,' Anwar said to Xi. 'This is why we view China not just as a leader of the East but as a voice for the Global South, one that champions the interests of the developing world.' Still, Anwar also said that Malaysia will stick to its 'strategic independence, and is willing to maintain close multilateral coordination with China to help safeguard regional peace, stability, development and prosperity,' reported China’s state news agency Xinhua. For his part, Xi said China and Malaysia should 'firmly support each other, jointly oppose protectionism, … [and] advocate [for] an equal and orderly multipolar world,' reported Xinhua. The Chinese president further said his country and Malaysia must also ensure 'inclusive economic globalization that benefits all, push for the reform and improvement of the global governance system, and uphold international fairness, justice and the common interests of developing countries.' Xi said China supported Malaysia’s rotating presidency of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) next year, as well as the regional bloc’s centrality and independence. Referring to Anwar’s comment about Malaysia retaining its 'strategic independence,' Xi said China supports the Southeast Asian nation in upholding that autonomy and 'choosing a development path suited to its national conditions.' During a speech at Peking University earlier on Thursday, Anwar outlined a vision for a Southeast Asia that interacts constructively with global powers 'while maintaining independence and promoting regional stability.' Bridge between East Asia, Southeast Asia Asia, Middle East At the trade fair in Shanghai earlier this week, Anwar invited Xi to a summit next year with ASEAN and the Arab nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). 'As ASEAN chair next year, Malaysia aims to enhance regional cooperation and inclusive, rules-based regional framework,' the Malaysian PM said on Tuesday. 'By linking China, ASEAN, and the GCC, we can build a bridge between East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, enabling deeper economic, cultural, and strategic ties.' The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, all oil-rich countries with substantial investments in Southeast Asia. For Malaysia, the potential benefits of the trilateral forum go beyond economic gains, Lee Pei May, an assistant professor of political science at the International Islamic University Malaysia told BenarNews. 'This is the first attempt to build a bridge between East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, allowing for discussions on critical issues like regional stability and Middle Eastern conflicts.' And although Anwar’s invitation to China was made before the announcement of Trump’s win, the Malaysian PM seemed to have spoken presciently about building new partnerships in the broader region now that sweeping U.S. import taxes, especially on Chinese goods, are a certainty. China’s BRICS support ‘invaluable’ Trump’s expected inward-looking policies, analysts believe, will lead to much unpredictability and could also cause security problems, particularly in the Asia Pacific, analysts told Benar News on Wednesday after the former president’s victory. Perhaps to prepare for such a contingency, Anwar’s participation in the China International Import Expo in Shanghai, included meetings with Chinese officials, investors, and over 23 top industries’ 'captains' from advanced technology and manufacturing sectors. Benedict Weerasena, research director at Kuala Lumpur think-tank Bait Al Amanah, said Anwar discussed expanding cooperation in digital economy initiatives, manufacturing, and infrastructure development with Chinese officials. This signaled a bid to take Malaysia-China relations 'to the next level,' Benedict told BenarNews. As it is, Anwar publicly on Thursday said that China’s support for Malaysia becoming a partner of BRICS has been 'invaluable.' The Southeast Asian nation had in July applied to become a partner of BRICS, an economic bloc that includes Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, in addition to China, and officially became one late last month. Malaysia’s BRICS membership For some observers, Malaysia’s BRICS partnership only solidifies their perception that the Southeast Asian nation under Anwar is becoming closer to Beijing, although the PM has denied it. And Malaysia already had strained ties with the U.S. since October 2023 because of Washington’s support for Israel in the Gaza conflict. BRICS is viewed by some analysts as a forum to provide Asian nations with alternative partnerships that could reduce their reliance on Western institutions or markets. The anticipated worsening of U.S.-China ties under Trump – like under his first 2017-2021 presidency – may complicate Malaysia’s position if the U.S. president-elect feels slighted, regional observers noted. Chong Ja Ian, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore, told BenarNews that the second Trump administration may adopt a more transactional and punitive approach. 'The risk is if the next Trump administration sees this as Malaysia siding with China in the U.S.-China rivalry, it may line Malaysia up for additional punishment from the United States,' the professor said. 'Anwar says he won’t tolerate unilateral decisions, but it’s an open question how he intends to rebuff, say, a blanket tariff imposed by the United States on Malaysian imports.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olry-EUX16IZ5	2024-11-07T15:30:48-08:00	
Asia Must Act Decisively On Climate Change – OpEd	Countries in Asia are set to experience some of the most severe consequences of the climate crisis and this unique vulnerability underscores the urgent need for proactive and collaborative climate action. Asia’s rapid industrialization and reliance on fossil fuels have accelerated its contribution to global carbon emissions, while geographic and socioeconomic factors make the region especially susceptible to rising temperatures, sea level increases and extreme weather events. According to a report released last week by the Asian Development Bank, Asian nations are significantly underfunded in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The annual financing requirement for climate adaptation across developing Asian countries ranges between $102 billion and $431 billion, yet they received only $34 billion in 2021-2022. This funding gap reflects the challenge that Asia faces in both reducing emissions and preparing for the inevitable impacts of a warming world. Asia is the most populous continent, home to approximately 60 percent of the world’s population. Countries like China, India, Bangladesh and Vietnam have high population densities, especially along coastlines, where communities face the dual threats of sea level rises and intensified storm surges. The report noted that, if Antarctic sea ice collapses, sea levels in Asia-Pacific could rise at twice the global average, putting 300 million people at risk. In addition, many of these populations lack the infrastructure to withstand extreme weather, leaving them highly vulnerable to both loss of life and economic disruption. Asia’s economic structure still heavily depends on fossil fuels, with the Asian Development Bank report estimating that governments in the region provided nearly $600 billion in subsidies for fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas in 2022. The issue is that such subsidies make fossil fuels more affordable, providing less incentive to shift toward cleaner energy sources. Consequently, developing Asia reportedly contributes nearly half of global emissions, with China alone responsible for two-thirds of this total. This dependence not only hampers Asia’s ability to reduce its carbon output but also increases the risks associated with climate-related health impacts, such as respiratory illnesses from air pollution. This means that, without decisive intervention, the economic repercussions for Asian countries will be severe. If emissions continue to rise unchecked, regional economies may face a 17 percent gross domestic product decline by 2070. Higher temperatures are already reducing productivity, as heat stress makes working conditions unbearable, particularly in sectors like agriculture and construction. In addition, agricultural yields, fisheries and forestry — vital components of many Asian economies — will suffer, further threatening food security and livelihoods. Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and India could see the most drastic economic downturns. Asian governments ought to prioritize a transition to renewable energy to decrease reliance on fossil fuels. Investment in solar, wind and hydropower infrastructure will not only reduce emissions but also create millions of green jobs. The Asian Development Bank estimates that 'aggressive decarbonization' could generate 1.5 million energy sector jobs by 2050. Nevertheless, this shift requires regional policies that incentivize renewables, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and provide tax incentives or subsidies for green energy adoption. In addition, Asian countries need to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, particularly in coastal cities and rural areas vulnerable to flooding and storms. Constructing flood barriers, creating mangrove forests to buffer against storm surges and developing robust urban drainage systems could significantly reduce the loss of life and property. Bangladesh’s investment in flood shelters that have drastically reduced storm-related fatalities serves as a model for other nations. Furthermore, in order to bridge the financing gap, Asian nations must advocate for more substantial international support and create partnerships with multilateral institutions like the World Bank. Given the scale of the crisis, both private and public sector investments are crucial. Asian countries can explore green bonds and international carbon markets to attract the necessary funds for adaptation and mitigation projects. Effective climate action demands transparent and accountable governance. It is critical to develop comprehensive frameworks that align with Asian countries’ commitments under international climate treaties. This involves setting clear roadmaps toward net-zero emissions, enforcing environmental regulations and integrating climate considerations into all sectors of national policy. Such governance reforms are essential to ensure that actions are consistent, measurable and enforceable. It is worth noting that, although Asia-Pacific is currently the largest emitter, historically, the US and Europe have contributed the most atmospheric carbon. This shared responsibility highlights the need for Western nations to support Asian countries in their climate efforts. Increased financial aid, technology transfer and expertise from the West can accelerate Asia’s transition to sustainable development. Providing these resources would also foster cooperation and goodwill in addressing a challenge that transcends borders. Any economic downturn in Asia due to climate change would reverberate worldwide, given the interconnectedness of global supply chains and financial markets. Europe and the US rely on Asian economies for manufacturing, resources and labor. By supporting climate resilience in Asia, Western nations can mitigate risks to their own economies. Additionally, as climate change fuels migration, political instability and resource scarcity, assisting Asia would reduce the potential for conflicts and humanitarian crises that could impact the West. In a nutshell, the climate crisis in Asia is no longer a distant threat but a present reality with wide-reaching implications. Immediate action is essential to limit and adapt to its impacts. Asian countries need both domestic reform and international support to bridge the financial gap, transform their energy landscapes and prepare for the worst-case scenarios. The cost of inaction far exceeds the cost of proactive measures. By acting decisively now, Asian countries, with support from the global community, can protect their people, economies and natural environments from the worst impacts of climate change.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olk4N6JyS2bBV	2024-11-07T15:29:23-08:00	
Biden Calls Trump Victory ‘Fair’ And ‘Transparent’	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President Joe Biden, long a political adversary of President-elect Donald Trump, declared Thursday that Trump’s election this week to a second nonconsecutive four-year term in the White House was 'fair' and 'transparent,' and that there would be a peaceful transfer of power on January 20. Biden, speaking to dozens of his White House aides in the Rose Garden, said he accepted that Trump had defeated his vice president, Kamala Harris. 'The will of the people always prevail,' Biden said, 'As I’ve said many times, you can’t love your country only when you win. And you can’t love your neighbor only when you agree.' But Biden, a Democratic political figure for five decades, lamented what might have been — for the vice president he picked to run alongside him in 2020 to succeed him. He praised her campaign as 'inspiring' and said she 'gave her whole heart and effort.' 'We lost this battle,' Biden said. 'Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable. We’re going to be okay, but we need to stay engaged. We need to keep going. And above all, we need to keep the faith.' Biden described his single term as the U.S. leader as 'an historic presidency' that will be 'changing people’s lives' for years to come, especially infrastructure improvements throughout that the country that he pushed to congressional approval during the first two years of his presidency. Biden, who ousted Trump from power in the 2020 election, said in a seven-minute address that he is leaving his Republican political rival and now his successor 'the strongest economy in the world.' While economic numerical standards support that assessment, voter exit polling showed to a significant degree that Trump supporters disapproved of Biden and Harris’ handling of the American economy, the world’s largest, because rising consumer prices throughout their time in office sharply squeezed household budgets. Trump vowed during his campaign, without saying how, that he would bring down inflation. He has proposed new tax cuts during his upcoming administration, which would put more money in the pockets of consumers, particularly the wealthiest, and corporate coffers, but could also balloon the country’s long-term national debt that already totals nearly $36 trillion. Biden called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him and invited him to the White House soon to discuss their handover of power. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Thursday that if Trump wants U.S. intelligence briefings, he will get them. An ODNI spokesperson said the agency 'is acting consistent with the tradition, in place since 1952, of providing intelligence briefings to the president-elect,' although it was not known whether Trump has made such a request. Key appointments Meanwhile, Trump is moving quickly to consider appointments to key positions in his new White House administration and could name some choices within days. He has been huddling with aides at his oceanside Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida to mull over his options. Even before the election, transition chiefs Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon met with some potential candidates for top jobs, either in the White House or to head the government’s Cabinet-level departments and an array of other agencies. Trump could name the world’s richest man, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, a staunch advocate and campaign donor for Trump, to a new position to find government inefficiencies and curb spending excesses. Another major Trump political supporter, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a scion of a U.S. Democratic Party dynasty, could be named to oversee health issues, even though he has rebuffed COVID vaccinations as unneeded. Several Wall Street financiers are under consideration for top-level economic positions, and Trump aides say that some Republican senators may be tapped to head Cabinet-level agencies. Trump aides also have prepared a long list of possible executive orders and regulation reversals for him to sign on his first day in office, to end policies that have been adopted by Biden over the last four years. Biden was running for reelection against Trump until his disastrous debate performance against Trump in June and falling poll numbers forced him from the contest. Biden quickly endorsed Harris. In a statement Wednesday, Biden praised Harris for her campaign, saying, 'She’s been a tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage and character. 'Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what’s possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just and full of more opportunities for all Americans,' Biden said. VOA National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olgnFCzTaAsyb	2024-11-07T15:27:20-08:00	
2 Kazakh Zhuzes’ Subjection To Dzungars And Qing Dynasty In 17-19...	Back in 2015, Japanese documentary writer Keiko Kawasoe predicted that a 'serious dispute' would arise between Russia and China over Kazakhstan’s territory and resources in the future. In her article, published by Sankei Shimbun and translated and republished in the Russian media under the title 'China and Russia’s War over Kazakhstan’s Resources' she wrote: 'China, led by Xi Jinping, and Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, are engaged in a bitter struggle for Kazakhstan… It appears that a serious dispute will flare up between China and Russia over the territory and natural resources of Kazakhstan'. Chinese-Russian Non-Contact Dispute Over Kazakhstan It has been almost ten years since then. Even if such a dispute is already happening, it is not yet being done out in the open. But other times, some things that give an idea about it spill into the media. They look like trial balloons sent out to test each other's reactions to their claims concerning Kazakhstan. Well, judge for yourself: here are just a few examples of how things have happened concerning this matter. In spring 2020, an article entitled 'Why is Kazakhstan Seeking to Return to China' appeared on the Chinese website www.sohu.com. It, according to the Russian media, 'states that: - The lands that Kazakhstan now occupies were Chinese territories at different times (when there were states such as Dzungar Khanate, Qing Empire), 'but Russia took advantage of the opportunity to occupy the lands of the Qing Empire, and Kazakhstan returned to Russia'; - 'People in Kazakhstan believe that they are of mixed Han descent'. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador and expressed diplomatic protest over that article. That was an understandable reaction to it. Yet there seemed to have been even more anxiety about the said article among the Russian policy-makers and political experts. This is evidenced by a piece Liubov Stepushova entitled 'Why has China announced its claims on Kazakhstan: Should we give credibility to Nursultan's [Astana's] anger?', and published by Pravda.ru. She came to the following conclusion: 'It is obvious that the author [of the Chinese article] expresses the point of view of a part of the Chinese elite, who considers the territory of Kazakhstan and its resources to be their own… In fact, Chinese money, like any other, 'doesn’t smell', and the Kazakh elite have been stuffing their wallets with money coming through Chinese investment projects for a long time'. Liubov Stepushova also quoted Yuri Solozobov, an associate of the National Strategy Institute of the Russian Federation, as saying 'that China is a very manageable country, so no statement, especially on the official website responsible for dealing with international politics, appears by chance'. Hence, 'the emergence of this [article on the Chinese website www.sohu.com] 'is someone's directive, a trial balloon, approved at the very top, and that is how it was seen by Kazakh diplomats'. Afterward, it was already the Russian spokespersons who embarked on doing a similar task. In December 2020, an article appeared in the Turkish-language press entitled ‘Russia launched a hybrid war against Kazakhstan, according to the scenario tested earlier in Ukraine’. It should be recalled that at that time, several members of the Russian State Duma made territorial claims against the Central Asian country, stating that Northern Kazakhstan had been ‘a great gift from Russia’. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry, just as it had been done in the case of the Chinese website, firmly rejected these statements, making it clear that the official Nur-Sultan (Astana) was not ready to put up with them. But that only seemed to make Russian MPs attack Kazakhstan more. Evgeny Fyodorov, a State Duma deputy and a member of the Central Political Council of the ruling United Russia party, declared the Russian rights to the whole of Kazakhstan. In particular, he said the following: 'Do you want to part [with Russia], comrade Nazarbayev, Tokayev, and [the ones in] the Kazakh Foreign Ministry? All right, take your suitcases, return [us] the territories [of Kazakhstan], the city of Verny (Almaty), and everything else, and leave'. In 2021, those undertakings by Russian MPs expanded into a vast media campaign of anti-Kazakhstani propaganda in Russia. In the period from August to December of that year, Russia was subjecting Kazakhstan - through the media forces and political circles close to the Kremlin - to all kinds of information attacks, ranging from threats disguised as persuasion to outright threats of interference in its internal affairs, unless the Central Asian nation follows in the wake of Russian interests. That year ended with a statement by Nikita Mendkovich, a political analyst and expert at the Russian International Affairs Council, that 'all this [Nursultan's (Astana's) failure to heed the criticism and advice from Russia] might mean that the issues of foreign and domestic policy of Kazakhstan will be dealt with not by Tokayev and the current generation of elites, but by some other people' (‘Flirting with nationalists can lead to the collapse of the Kazakh [ruling] power’, Ukraina.ru, 12.09.21). At the very beginning of 2022, the events of what became later known in Kazakhstan as ‘Bloody January’ happened. On January 6, Reuters reported that 'Russia sent in paratroopers to put down a countrywide uprising'. And then the Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement saying that 'On January 10, 2022, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov'and'with Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister MukhtarTileuberdi'. On January 11, 2022, a decision was made to withdraw troops of Russia and other CSTO member countries from Kazakhstan. That action may have somehow diminished the Russian expansion-minded spokespersons' appetites for Kazakhstan's territory. Thus, following the January 2022 unrest in Kazakhstan, some Russian media started playing the card of the need of ‘protecting… the Kazakhs from the Middle Zhuz, who are historically and mentally close to us [Russians]’, in contrast to ‘the southern Kazakhs’, and, most importantly, of the ‘deprivation’ of the potentially very rich, but actually ‘poverty-stricken West’ (the Junior Zhuz) in the face of the Senior (Southern) Zhuz elites' domination in the country as a whole. A rather direct has been State Duma deputy Mikhail Delyagin, when speaking on this matter: 'Unless Northern Kazakhstan, along with Central [the Middle Zhuz] and Western Kazakhstan [the Junior Zhuz], rejoins their Homeland [Russia] as a result of the upcoming events, it will be … well, like ditching Donbas [non-admission of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic to Russia]'. The title of the relevant article brings the substance of his speech: 'The main point in establishing order in Kazakhstan is to return the Russian lands' - Mikhail Delyagin'. So, the Kremlin sort of sent a very simple message to Beijing through the words of one of the most popular politicians, economists, and MPs in Moscow: from now on, Russia is claiming the right not to the whole of Kazakhstan but the Middle Zhuz and Junior Zhuz traditional territories that cover, respectively, Northern and Central Kazakhstan; and Western Kazakhstan. Thus, the Russian side kind of made the Chinese side understand that they weren't laying any claim to that part of the Central Asian country on which the latter has a claim. Here are some pieces of proof. Globalnews.kz, in an article entitled 'Does China lay claim to Balkhash? Kazakhstan is urged to appeal to the UN' quoted the Chinese source (on Baidu, July 29th, 2023) as saying: 'If we want this territory back, we must first rely on historical and political factors to accurately study [the situation with] Balkhash, as times change, and so does national sovereignty. We are engaged in serious negotiations about rights and interests'. So, if we are to believe even some of the above, it seems that the Chinese kind of lay claim to the territory of Kazakhstan east of Lake Balkhash, or, in other words, up to Lake Balkhash. At the same time, Russian MP Delyagin and his kind in Russia are exactly laying claim to almost the rest of the Kazakhstani territory that lies north and west of Lake Balkhash. There is no information about whether such an interpretation has satisfied the Chinese or not. But seemingly, they go on pushing their agenda on the matter. How Do The Chinese See Kazakhs? Chinese geneticists analyzed the DNA of ethnic Kazakhs living in China and published their results - Ancestral Origins and Admixture History of Kazakhs - in Molecular Biology and Evolution in July 2024. The following revealings they have made in their study seem to deserve the most attention in the context of the topic under consideration: 1. 'The top 4 populations exhibiting the closest genetic affinity to KZK [the Kazakh population residing in northern Xinjiang, China] were Uyghur, Kalmyk, Hazara, and Even'; 2. 'Although KZK and Kazakhs of Kazakhstan live in different locations, they cannot be separated into 2 distinct populations in terms of genetic makeup'; 3. 'Our analyses indicated that the available data do not support the classification of KZK and KZK.CA [Kazakhs of Kazakhstan] as distinct genetic populations'. Hence, the conclusion suggests that, first, Uyghurs, who live mostly in Chinese Xinjiang, and Mongolian [Kalmyks, Hazaras] and Manchu [Evens] ethnic groups are the closest relatives of the Chinese Kazakhs, with the latter long being part of the ethnically mixed Mongolian-Chinese areas having deep-rooted common historical and cultural traditions; and, second, the above matter applies to all Kazakhs of Kazakhstan without exception, as well. In short, Chinese geneticists have brought the talk back to where it started in 2020: the origin of the Kazakh is related to the peoples of China to a much greater extent than to the ones of Russia. This idea is radically different than the narrative accepted in Kazakhstan about China and the Chinese. Here, it is necessary to digress and provide clarifications for a better understanding of what was said above. 'Description of the Kirghiz-Cossack, or Kirghiz-Kaisak hordes and steppes' by A.Levshin, a Russian statesman, historian, writer, and ethnographer, published in St. Petersburg in 1832, has long been and still is considered the first scientific monograph on the history of Kazakhstan and the Kazakh people. That work was translated into Western European languages and thus formed the foundation for Russian and Western Kazakh studies. It later started to serve as the basis for the formation of the Kazakh national school of studying the historical past of the Kazakhs. During the era after A.Levshin, in tsarist Russia and the USSR, Russian-Soviet and Kazakh historiography on the issue of the history of Kazakhs until they had become Russian subjects was developing largely in line with the Russo-centric paradigm of perceiving the past. According to Soviet-era research and textbooks on the history of the Kazakh SSR (the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic), the Mongol invasion of Central Asia was as disastrous to the Kazakhs’ ancestors as the Mongol attack on Eastern Europe was to the Russians of the time. The feat of Ghayir-Khan Inalchuq, the governor of Otrar in the early 13th century, on the defense of that Khwarezmian city, had at some length been described in those books. Such a vision of the historical past was also present in literature, film, and art. How Do The Russians See Kazakhs? The wars of the Kazakhs with the Oirats and Dzungars, who had been periodically invading their lands in the 17th and 18th centuries, were characterized along the same lines. In the historical consciousness of many generations of Kazakhs, the idea has developed that the Dzungarian raids were as terrifying as the Mongol invasion was. It is quite consistent with the Russian Soviet historical narrative that if there had been no ‘salvation’ by the Russian Empire, then there would have been a mass extermination of the Kazakhs by the Dzungars. And, importantly, the Kazakh historical science, as far as it can be judged, continues to remain faithful to the previous theoretical and conceptual approaches and to follow in the mainstream of Russian and other foreign historiographical traditions in terms of studying the historical past of Kazakhstan. In such conditions, the official historical narrative about the times of the Mongol and Dzungar invasions is increasingly at odds with the self-conscience of the culture of the Kazakhs of the Senior Zhuz (which consists of the descendants of the Niru'un or pure Mongols) and the Middle Zhuz (which mainly consists of the descendants of the Darligin or other Mongols), which does not perceive the culture of the Mongols and Dzungars as alien and hostile. For better disclosure of the topic in question, let us separately address here the subject of the relationship between the Kazakhs and the Oirats (Dzhungars) in the 17th and 18th centuries in the context of assessing what Robert Skidelsky, a Harbin-born British economic historian of Russian origin and a member of the British House of Lords, called 'China’s motive for reviving Pax Mongolica'. By the beginning of the 17th century, the Mongolosphere, as a common continuous space where peoples and their rulers adhered to Genghisid political and legal traditions to varying degrees, had significantly shrunk and was located between the Mongolian-Manchurian steppe in the east and the Turgai (Kazakh) steppe in the west. Until then, there were many independent or semi-dependent states ruled by the Khans from among the descendants of Genghis Khan, who established and developed relations with each other based on their own military and political interests. By then, Pax Mongolica had entered a long period of political fragmentation. The result was the weakening of Mongol influence to the west of the Altai Mountains. Manchus and Oirats On The Path Of Expansion With A Focus On Uniting Pax Mongolica The Mongolian lands themselves were divided into three large parts: Southern Mongolia (Chakhar, ор Tsahar), Northern Mongolia (Khalkha), and Western Mongolia (Oiratia). In Southern Mongolia, there was the Northern Yuan, a rump state that emerged when the Yuan remnants retreated to the Mongolian homeland after the fall of the Yuan dynasty in China in 1368; a state where the name Great Yuan remained in formal use, and the Northern Yuan was the name of the dynasty that ruled there until the end of the reign of the last Genghisid emperor, Ligdan Khan, in the 17th century. In Khalkha, three lines of rulers-khans emerged, bearing the titles of Sechen Khan, Tüsheet Khan, and Zasagt Khan. The northwestern part of Khalkha, where the Khotogoids, a subgroup of Mongol people, lived, was the possession of the Khotogoid rulers, who bore the title of Altan Khan. In Western Mongolia, there was the Oirat Khanate, or the Alliance of the Four Oirat Tribes or the Oirat Confederation, that preceded the creation of the Dzungar Khanate in 1635. By the beginning of the 17th century, in that part of the Great Steppe where Genghisid political and legal traditions continued to prevail, two forces emerged that embarked on the path of expansion with a focus on uniting Pax Mongolica under their rule. These were: the Manchus in the east and the Oirats in the west. In 1606, Nurhaci, the founding father of the Manchu state in China, later known as the Qing dynasty, was bestowed the title of Kundulun Khan (Respected Emperor) by the eastern Mongol tribes' leaders. In 1616, he assumed the title of Genggiyen Han (Brilliant Emperor) and founded the Qing dynasty. In 1634, when Ligden Khan, the last of the paramount Mongol khans, died and his son Ejei submitted to the Qing dynasty, Nurhaci's son, Hong Taiji, sometimes referred to as Abahai in Western literature, was granted the title Bogda Khan (Sacred Khan). On that occasion, the ancient imperial seal of the Yuan dynasty came into the hands of Hong Taiji. His son Fulin later became the first Chinese emperor of the Qing dynasty. In 1636, Hong Taiji proclaimed the Da Qing (Great Pure) dynasty. All the lands and populations that had earlier been subject to the Northern Yuan were now formally under its authority. But a year earlier, in 1635, the Alliance of the Four Oirat Tribes or the Oirat Confederation, which had been only part of the Mongol state of Northern Yuan since 1468, proclaimed the creation of the Dzungar Khanate, centered in the Dzungaria region, currently in the north-westernmost part of China, and headed by Erdeni Batur, who took the title of ‘Hongtaiji’. Thus, Abahai, who had been declared the paramount Mongol khan and given the ancient imperial seal of the Yuan dynasty as a certificate that he was entitled to rule the whole Pax Mongolica, found himself deprived of dominion over the Oirats and sovereignty over the territories that were under their control. Since the very end of the 16th century, the Oirat Confederation, which existed before the creation of the Dzungar Khanate, had been creating conquests on the western peripheries of the Mongolosphere in the same way as the union of Manchu (Jurchen) tribes in alliance with the eastern Mongols had been carrying out the expansion on its eastern peripheries. At that period, the Oirats were leading offensive campaigns oriented on all four sides of the world: in the east, against the Khalkha-Mongol Khans; in the north, on the lands of the Russian yasak population of Southern Siberia, in the west, against the Kazakh Khans, in the south, against Moghulistan, or the Moghul Khanate. Thus, by the time of the creation of the Dzungar Khanate, the Oirats had completely subjugated Moghulistan. As evidenced by Tomila Petrov and Ivan Kunitsyn, members of the Russian mission sent in 1616 from Tobol to the Oirats, the Senior Zhuz Kazakhs, along with the Kyrgyz, were then the latter's subjects. Did the described situation change later on? A.Levshin ('Description of Kirghiz-Cossack, or Kirghiz-Kaysak, hordes, and steppes') pointed out that during negotiations with Russian envoy held in 1642, Erdeni Batur-hongtaiji, the then-ruler of the Dzungar Khanate, during negotiations with Russian envoys, had described the Kazakhs [of the Senior Zhuz] as his subjects, and their ruler, as his relative. Russian ex-diplomat: After The Disintegration Of The USSR, Chinese Claims Against Kazakhstan Have Remained Intact Here is one important thing to mention. Even in Russian-language sources, there are claims that the Dzungar Khanate, which remained an independent state throughout its history, was 'formed after the Oirats had usurped the Northern Yuan state's supreme power to rule on the territory of modern Xinjiang, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Western Mongolia'. After the ancient imperial seal of the Yuan dynasty had come into the hands of Abahai (Hong Taiji), the rights of the supreme power of the Northern Yuan state were transferred to the Qing dynasty, which ruled China from 1644 to 1912, having assembled the territorial base for modern China. These days, Xinjiang is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Western Mongolia is part of the People's Republic of Mongolia. The latter's statehood and territorial integrity were guaranteed by the Yalta Conference held in 1945, where the allies - the leaders of the USSR, the USA, and Great Britain - pledged to recognize the independent status of Mongolia after the end of the war. According to paragraph 1 of the agreement adopted at that conference, the Soviet Union pledged to enter the war against Japan on the side of the Allies on the condition of 'preserving the status quo of Outer Mongolia (the Mongolian People’s Republic)'. On August 14, 1945, the then-Chinese government expressed its willingness to 'recognize the independence of Outer Mongolia within its existing borders' if a plebiscite of its people 'confirmed this aspiration'. The results of a referendum held two months later confirmed 'this aspiration'. And on January 5, 1946, China recognized Mongolia within its existing borders. Regarding the parts of 'the territories of modern Russia and Kazakhstan' over which 'the supreme power of the Northern Yuan had been usurped by the Oirats' in the historical past, Nikolai Platoshkin, a former Russian diplomat, said the following: 'As for [the attitude] of China [towards Kazakhstan]. To this day, part of the Kazakh, Kazakhstani territory... appears in their textbooks as the original lands of China, which were at one time taken away by Russian imperialists, Soviet social-imperialists'. According to him, when Soviet-Chinese relations worsened in the 1960s, 'it was about China’s territorial claims against our country (the USSR)'. 'After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, these claims against Kazakhstan… have remained intact', he added. Throughout its history, the Dzungar Khanate remained an independent state that was not recognized by the Qing Empire, which considered it and the regions and peoples subject to it to be parts of its territory and its vassals who had temporarily come from its power. The Dzungar khans, in turn, sought, either by force or through negotiations, to bring the Genghisid rulers of the Khalkha Mongols in the east and the Senior and Middle Zhuz Kazakhs in the west under their control, and thus increase their territorial, mobilization, and material resources to win back Pax Monlolica from the Manchu dynasty. It was a sort of civil war among different groups of the population of the eastern Great Steppe with a mindset based on the Genghisid political and legal traditions. Since coming to power, the Manchu Qing Dynasty began to praise Genghis Khan as a god, following the customs of Tibetan Buddhism. Nurhaci and Hong Taiji or Abahai, whose son Fulin later would become the first Chinese emperor of the Qing dynasty, claimed that they were the reincarnations of Genghis Khan. During the Qing Dynasty, Genghis Khan and other Mongol leaders of the Middle Ages were treated with special respect in its empire, just as it was the case among the Oirats (the Dzhungars) as well as the Kazakhs of the Middle and Senior Zhuz at that time. The Dzungars, who had the most powerful state union of Mongolian-speaking peoples at the end of the late Middle Ages and the beginning of the New Age, considered themselves the direct successors of the Mongols of the time of Genghis Khan and, having adopted Yeke Caaji, the Mongol-Oyirod Great Code of 1640, conducted an independent foreign and domestic policy. They, in turn, also started reuniting the scattered possessions of the Genghisid rulers through force of arms. Their destructive campaigns against the Khalkha Mongols and Kazakhs, having been undertaken for decades in the spirit of steppe military traditions, substantially disrupted economic life throughout much of the territories that now make up the modern Republic of Kazakhstan and the Mongol People's Republic. It is known from history that from 1599 to 1750, the Dzungars carried out numerous raids on Kazakh lands and were not at all peaceful neighbors. They carried out similar raids on the lands of the Khalkha Mongols. As a result of such expansionist actions of the Dzungars, in the 1680-1690s, the Khalkha Mongolian Genghisid khans began to state their willingness to swear allegiance to the Qing dynasty, which ruled China, and in the 1730-1740s, the Kazakh Genghisid khans to the Romanov dynasty, which ruled Russia. But, as they say, politics is a changeable business. Later, there were also cases when some Genghisid rulers of the Khalkhas and Kazakhs combined formal subjection to China and Russia with establishing allied relations with the Dzungar leaders and supporting the latter in their confrontation with their various enemies. How Did The Senior And Middle Zhuz Kazakhs Become Subjects To Chinese Emperor? Thus, according to Wikipedia, in 1751, when two contenders for the Khan's throne in the Dzungar state, noyons Davaci and Amursanaa, were defeated in the struggle for power against Lama-Dorji, they fled in search of salvation to the Kazakhs. There, they were given shelter by Abylai, the Khan of the Middle Zhuz of the Kazakhs since 1743, who called himself 'the son of Galdan-Tseren [the previous Dzungar Khan]' and, in his letter addressed to the Kalmyk female ruler dowager Darmabala, offered her 'to consider him as her younger brother'. A year later, Davaci and Amursanaa returned to their homeland and resumed the struggle for the Khan's throne. In 1753, Davaci became the ruler of the Dzungar Khanate. During the Third Oirat-Manchu War, which took place in 1755-1759, according to Wikipedia, on one side were the Dzungar Khanate led by Davaci and Amursanaa, the Middle Zhuz Kazakhs led by Abylai Sultan, and the Khalkha Mongols led by Chingunjav, a prince ruler, and on the other, the armed forces of the Qing Empire and also other Khalkha Mongols. The war ended in the ultimate defeat and liquidation of the Dzungar Khanate. In 1759, Ablai Khan, formally having already been a subject of the Russian throne, went personally to Beijing and became subject to the Bogda Khan (a title in the Mongolian language used by emperors of the Qing dynasty of China), or the Chinese Emperor as a ‘wang’ - a vassal prince. And in 1762 he sent his son to the capital of the Qing Empire as an amanat, or hostage. Thus, following the Third Oirat-Manchu war, the Senior Zhuz, as a vassal possession of the Dzungar Khan, and the Middle Zhuz, as an ally of the utterly defeated and abolished Dzungar Khanate, became subjects to the Great Bogda Ejen Khan [Qing emperor], who had emerged victorious from the battle of the two contending powers in the then Pax Mongolica. In Kazakhstan, it is now common to diminish the historical importance of the Qing court's bestowing titles of nobility to the rulers of the Kazakhs [of the Middle Zhuz] - they supposedly were put in such conditions that they had no choice but to agree to receive them and create the appearance of accepting Qing imperial suzerainty, while aiming in doing so, according to the First President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, to strengthen the Kazakh Khanate and to liberate their homeland from the invaders. However, some independent overseas researchers interpret those titles' meanings to those receiving them quite differently: 'of course, when Kazakhs requested titles from the Qing court, the ‘self-appellation’ they asked for reflected, to some extent, the organization of Kazakh society', and 'visits of Qing imperial envoys, grand traditional ceremonies, and imperial edicts from the Qing emperor all helped to give authority to the sultan [the Genghisid ruler] in [the Middle Zhuz] Kazakh society [still having been strongly adhered to the Genghisid political and legal traditions]'. The Manchu Qing dynasty, who ruled China from the Khan City, Khanbalyk (now Beijing), just as the grandson and greatest successor of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan, had done, and positioned themselves as their heirs, was most probably seen by the Kazakh Genghisids as the restored seat of power for all countries and peoples of the Genghisid ideology. The factors described above might be the key to explaining why, even in the 1820s, the Middle Zhuz Kazakh rulers continued to confirm allegiance to the Qing dynasty, which had already been a shadow of its former vigor by that time, and still wanted it to legitimize their rule over the Middle Zhuz Kazakhs, while the Kokand Khanate, a tiny state compared to China, already was occasionally making aggressive invasions into Kashgar, i.e., Chinese territories adjacent to Central Asia. At that time, Russian power and influence were on the rise in Central Asia, which was not true for Chinese power and influence. So eventually, the Russians, by right of might, put an end to such a double allegiance. Here is how it happened. In 1821, the leaders of the Kazakh tribes of the Middle Zhuz elected Gubaidulla - a grand-son of Abylai Khan, who, back in 1759, was the first to go to Beijing and become a subject of the Chinese emperor as a ‘wang’, a vassal prince - as their Khan. In 1823 Gubaidulla sent his confidant, his younger brother sultan Zhantore, to Beijing as part of the mission seeking an imperial audience. He delivered the Chinese emperor's representative a letter saying that the Middle Zhuz Kazakhs' tribal elders decided that Gubaidulla was to succeed to the title of khan [han]. In response to it, the Daoguang emperor issued imperial instructions to that effect by the end of 1823. In compliance with them, the imperial charter and attributes of the Han's power were sent to the seat of the Middle Zhuz rulers. But that Chinese mission was intercepted by Russian troops. The Kazakh Khan was taken into custody and forced to renounce recognition of his khanship by the Chinese Emperor. He later started a rebellion against the tsarist government, which was suppressed in 1825. Gubaidulla was exiled to inner Russia. From there, he was able to return only in 1840, when what is called the century of humiliation had already begun in China. But the fact remains that in the mid-1820s, the Middle Zhuz ruler, who had been elected by the leaders of the Kazakh tribes of the Middle Zhuz as their Khan and confirmed his subjection to the Chinese Emperor in that capacity, was deposed by the Russian authorities. In contrast to what happened in the case of the Middle Zhuz, the Russian Empire did not challenge the subjection of the population and territory of the Senior Zhuz to Beijing until the beginning of the period in Chinese history called the 'Century of Humiliation' (1839-1849), when Western colonial powers began to divide the weakened Qing Empire into parts. Here is just one example of this. In response to the expressed willingness of Suyuk Ablaikhanov, a son of Ablai Khan, who ruled one of the tribes of the Senior Zhuz Kazakhs, to enter the service of the State of Russia, in 1821, Emperor Alexander I, who had been victorious over Napoleon Bonaparte, bestowed upon him a rank and ordered 'to build for him a house and a mosque on the eastern side of Lake Balkhash'. In 1825, when a Russian military detachment, having reached the named area in the lower reaches of the Karatal River, began to erect those buildings, the Chinese government lodged a protest with St Petersburg. As a result, the buildings were demolished and the detachment was recalled. While the small Uzbek states' rulers in Central Asia turned out to be more active and consistent in their intentions to expand their realms to the north and northeast at that time at the expense of those lands of the Senior Zhuz and, partially, Middle Zhuz Kazakhs, which the Qing dynasty regarded as their own. So, 'a significant part of the territory that belonged to the Senior Zhuz of the Kazakhs ended up' under the control of the city of Tashkent, which had previously been at the intersection of the interests of the Dzungar and Kazakh khanates, as well as the Kokand and Bukhara rulers and which in 1784 became an independent state entity. In 1798, due to the secession of the regions of Southern Kazakhstan to the Tashkent State, Bolat Khan, who had held the title of the Right Tribe han (youbu han) given by the Qing court, lost control over the city of Turkestan and its environs. In 1808 the city came under the control of the Kokand Khanate. After this, the latter continued the conquest of the Kazakh lands. By 1819, the Kokand Khanate subjugated the bulk of the Senior Zhuz Kazakhs’ territory. Later on, the Kokand troops occasionally made incursions into the Chinese Kashgar. The Russians, who were following these events, received information that 'the Chinese were in great fear'. From this, it is clear that by that time, the military power of the Qing Empire, being gradually waning, had already fallen into such decline that it was difficult for them to resist the invasions of troops even from the tiny states on its outskirts. This all seems to have served as a kind of summoning for the Russian Empire to further expand its presence in the Central Asian region. In 1846, Kapal was established as the first Russian military-type settlement in the Southern Balkhash Lake area. By then, the First Opium War had been over, and what was the century of humiliation for China began, in which Russia played a very active part, too. After that, the entire Senior Zhuz annexation to the Russian Empire was only a matter of time. Japanese Researcher: Kazakh Genghisids Fought Over Titles Granted By The Qing Court Jin Noda, associate professor at the Waseda Insitute for Advanced Study, Tokyo, Japan, who published 'A Collection of Documents from the Kazakh Sultans to the Qing Dynasty' in 2010, in his piece entitled 'Titles of Kazakh Sultans Bestowed by the Qing Empire', wrote: 'Soon after Ablay opened relations with the Qing court, he inquired about the sorts of titles the Qing conferred. In his request, he said, 'If the great Emperor (ejen) were to favor me with the title prince (wang), this would be welcome, and if with the title han, this would be even more welcome'. Thus we know he expected to receive the title of either prince, or han'. Noteworthy… is that the Kazakh sultans [Genghisids] fought over titles of nobility granted by the Qing court. This fact buttresses the notion that there was a rivalry among the sultans... over Qing court titles of nobility. From another perspective, it also shows the considerable value attached to the titles of nobility of the Qing court'. According to the Zongtong Yili Shiyi (Matters Concerning Control of Ili) compiled during the Jiaqing period (1796-1820), 'In [the] Kazakh lands], there were hans [the Chinese rendering of khan], princes, dukes, and gentry, all passed on hereditarily. Through this system, the order was brought to the nomads of the area'. Jin Noda also said the following: 'In the Qing historical sources, there are three recognized tribes (bu) - the Left, Right, and West tribes - but these tribes were based on a confusion of the geographical distribution of the three juz [Zhuz] (tribal unions and the three main khan clan lineages)'. A table [Table 1, 'Succession to Qing Nobility Titles within the Khan clans'] he then provided shows the following: '[1] Kazakh Left Tribe han (Hasake Zuobu han) - Abulay [Abylai], [then] Wali [Uali] ('who inherited the han title in Qianlong 47 [1782]'), [then] Ghubaydulla; [2] Right Tribe han (youbu han) - Tauke, [then] Abulmambet [Abilmambet], [then] Bolat, (Toghum [Toghym] 'who inherited the han title in Jiaqing in 14 [1809]'); [3] Right Tribe prince (youbu wang) - Abulfeiz [Abilpeyiz] ('the second son of Abulmambet'), [then] Khankhoja [Khankozha], [then] Jankhoja [Zhankozha]/Janbubek [Zhanbobek] ('who inherited the prince title in Jiaqing in 5 [1800]'); [4] West Tribe han [xibu] - Tursun, then Kuchuk, then Adil, then Sama [Saman]'. Just one look at Table 1 is enough for any ordinary ethnic Kazakh person to understand that Jin Noda himself, having said that 'in the Qing historical sources, there are three recognized tribes (bu) - the Left, Right, and West tribes - but these tribes were based on a confusion of the geographical distribution of the three juz (tribal unions and the three main khan clan lineages)' created confusion with the interpretation of the notion of 'the Left, Right, and West tribes'. Because all the Genghisids, referred to therein as hans and princes of 'the Left, Right, and West tribes', were mostly, if not completely, the rulers of different population groups in one tribal union of Kazakhs - the Middle Zhuz. Wali, or Uali ('who inherited the han title in Qianlong 47 [1782]') inherited the title of khan, or han and power over various clans of the Argyn, Kerey and some other tribes of the Middle Zhuz Kazakhs, according to the will of his father, Abulay, or Abylai. His residences were in the north, not far from where the capital of Kazakhstan is now located. Bolat, a son of Abulmambet [Abilmambet], was the khan of the Argyn and Konyrat tribes of the Middle Zhuz and the Saryuysin clan of the Senior Zhuz. At different periods, he ruled an area extending as far as the middle reaches of the Syrdarya River in the west, the valleys of the rivers Shu and Talas in the east, and the upper reaches of the river Turgai in the north. Khankhoja [Khankozha], his sons Jankhoja [Zhankozha] and Janbubek [Zhanbobek] were the rulers of the Muryn clan of the Naiman tribe of the Middle Zhuz who lived then to the east of the Irtysh River, in what now is the western part of the Abai province of Kazakhstan. Tursun, Kuchuk, Adil, and Sama [Saman] were the rulers of the Kyzai clan of the Naiman tribe of the Middle Zhuz who lived then in the area of the Tarbagatai Mountains and Alakol Lake located in the south-east of nowadays Kazakhstan. Kazakhs' Joining China Is Associated With Name Of Modern Kazakhstan’s Most Praised Historical Figure So, contrary to Jin Noda's claim that 'the Left, Right, and West tribes' in the Qing historical sources 'were based on a confusion of the geographical distribution of the three juz [Zhuz] (tribal unions and the three main khan clan lineages)' has, as far as can be judged, no basis in reality. Here is what comes out of things he said if one looks at them through the eyes of ethnic Kazakhs: the Zongtong Yili Shiyi (Matters Concerning Control of Ili) is by and large about the Senior Zhuz Kazakhs; while 'the Left, Right, and West tribes' mean mainly the Middle Zhuz Kazakhs. They do not say anything about the Junior Zhuz Kazakhs. This vision is entirely consistent with the research conclusion of the Chinese side regarding the appeal of Abylai Khan to the Qing Emperor Qianlong, which reads, 'Information on the Middle and Senior Zhuzes Kazakhs' joining China'. Using his knowledge of the basics of Chinese hieroglyphic writing, the Japanese historian put an enormous amount of work into researching the archive materials based on the documents from the Kazakh Genghisid Sultans to the Qing Dynasty. His work deserves the utmost respect. But as a whole, his vision of Kazakh history, and his ideas about what the Kazakhs are, seem to be to a significant extent in line with the Russo-centric paradigm of perception of Kazakhs and their past. Perhaps that's why it's not surprising, then, that understanding of even the simplest particularities of the internal life of the Kazakh society sometimes eludes him. If he could turn to sources in Kazakh, he would have had no problem with learning about the following: In the historical documents compiled during the Qing Dynasty, the [Middle Zhuz] Kazakhs, who inhabited the area of the Tarbagatai Mountains and Alakol Lake located in the south-east of nowadays Kazakhstan, were known as 'West tribes'; in the Chinese understanding of that time, 'West Kazakhs' were not the Junior Zhuz Kazakhs, i.e. Western Kazakhstan's natives at all. As for the Junior Zhuz Kazakhs, the question of their joining China in the second half of the 18th century did not arise and could not arise. This assumption is indirectly confirmed by the following words from the piece by Jin Noda: 'But Ablay before he ascended the Kazakh throne as khan, had already received the Qing court nobility title of han, and Qing court never conferred the nobility title of han on Nurali [Nuraly], the Kazakh khan of the Small Zhuz'. In Chinese historiography, the Middle and Senior Zhuzes Kazakhs' joining China is associated, as shown above, with the name of Abylai Khan. He is one of the two most praised national historical personalities in modern Kazakhstan, with the second being Abai Kunanbayev, who has been used to be widely regarded as the founder of modern Kazakh literature. It is noteworthy that both that and another of these two names may also bring to mind the prominent real and mythic figures of Mongolian-Oirat peoples - Ablai Taiji (who, by age, would have been suited to be Abylai Khan's grandfather), the founder of the Buddhist monastery Ablai-kit that is in what is now Eastern Kazakhstan, and Abai Geser, an epic hero. Abylai Khan's real name was Abylmansur. People later began calling him ‘Abylai’, after his grandfather. Abai Kunanbayev’s real name was Ibrahim. He got the nickname ‘Abai’ allegedly from his grandmother Zere. Those historical examples may perhaps indicate that in 18th-19th centuries, the Middle and Senior Zhuz Kazakhs still could have remained profoundly influenced by Mongolian-Oirat history, culture and even language. According to the maps compiled at the time, Dzhungaria once covered much of what is now Northern, Eastern, and Southern Kazakhstan. This could not pass without a trace. Here's what else is to be noticed. In the case under consideration, two quotes from a monograph entitled 'The Nogai Horde' ('Nugai Urdasy') by Marcel Akhmetzyanov, a renowned Tatar historian, are of interest. The first one says: 'The keepers of literary legacy were usually the so-called 'zhyrau' [creators of the epic genre] who, as is known, came from the cities of Saraichik, Astrakhan, Azak [Azov], etc. The most notable 'zhyraus' were Asan Kaigy Sabit ugyly (XV century), Shalkiyz zhyrau (1465 - 1560), Dosmambet zhyrau (1493 -1523). The Nogai 'zhyraus' created beautiful dastans [eposes] such as 'Idegey', 'Koblandy', 'Er Targyn', 'Alpamysh', 'Chura Batyr', and 'Kyrk Kyz'. The second one says: 'The immediate descendants and heirs of the Nogai Horde are the Nogais (a Caucasian people), the Crimean, Volga-Ural, and Siberian Tatars, the Kazakhs of the Younger Zhuz, and the Karakalpaks'. Thus, according to Marcel Akhmetzyanov, it turns out that, first, all so-called Kazakh literature up until the 18th century was and is actually Nogai literature; second, only the representatives of the Alshyns or the Junior Zhuz Kazakhs can be considered the heirs of the Nogai genetic and cultural heritage from among all the modern Kazakhs. Yet the Tatar historian leaves unanswered the questions of whose descendants and heirs the Kazakhs of the Senior and Middle Zhuz were and are, and what should be considered their literary and cultural legacy up until the 18th century. Perhaps Marcel Akhmetzyanov isn’t aware that in the literary history of Kazakhstan, there was and is no other literature applicable to those times (15th-17th centuries), besides what he sees as Nogai’s literary legacy. Because of the above, one can't help but wonder: What language did the Senior and Middle Zhuz people speak up until the 18th century? And it remains open.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olimjJbI5_Rua	2024-11-07T15:25:19-08:00	
Constitutional Court In Spain Forces Catholic Brotherhood To Admi...	By Nicolás de Cárdenas Spain’s Constitutional Court (TC, by its Spanish acronym) has ruled that by refusing to admit a woman, a male Catholic brotherhood violated the legal precept of nondiscrimination on the basis of her sex and her right to association. In 2008, María Teresita Laborda Sanz requested to join the Pontifical, Royal, and Venerable Slavery of the Most Holy Christ of La Laguna, a public association of the faithful founded in 1545. Article 1 of the statutes of the brotherhood states that it is 'a religious association of gentlemen, established to promote among its members a more perfect Christian life, the exercise of works of evangelical piety, and the increase of devotion and veneration of the holy image of Our Crucified Lord,' which is why the application was denied. In 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that Laborda had not suffered any discrimination because 'the purposes of [the brotherhood] being religious, it did not hold a dominant position in the economic, professional, or labor spheres, so no harm could be caused to the appellant, who could create a new religious association with the same purposes.' The Constitutional Court now considers that the content of the Article 1 of the brotherhood’s statutes 'isn’t protected by the religious autonomy of said association to the extent that the prohibition of women from being part of the association is not based on any reason of a religious or moral nature,' a Nov. 4 statementfrom the TC explains. 'The requirements of religious freedom and the principle of religious neutrality not being in question' derived from Article 16 of the Spanish Constitution, the court considers that 'although a private association has the right to freely choose whom it associates with (Article 22), this right cannot constitute discrimination based on gender when the association holds a ‘privileged’ or ‘dominant’ position in the economic, cultural, social, or professional field,' as the Supreme Court held. However, the Constitutional Court maintained that 'although the activities carried out, from which the appellant is excluded, are acts of religious worship and are not related to any economic, professional, or work-related matters, this does not exclude the possibility that these acts may also have a social or cultural impact, given that culture and religion, being different elements, are not watertight compartments, and a large number of religious [public events] in Spain are part of the history and social culture of our country.' The TC concluded that the plaintiff 'has no possibility of carrying out the same activity of veneration of said image in another brotherhood or confraternity of the municipality.' The ruling of the six judges of the Second Chamber of the Constitutional Court was not unanimous. Expert: Ruling is ‘bad news’ Rafael Palomino, a professor of ecclesiastical law of the state at the Complutense University of Madrid, criticized the ruling of the TC in a comment published on his professional profile on LinkedIn, calling it 'bad news.' To the argument of the TC that considers the plaintiff has had her rights violated because 'she does not have the possibility of exercising the same activity of veneration of said image in another brotherhood or confraternity of the municipality,' Palomino responded: 'What do you mean she cannot carry out the same religious activity? Let the appellant set up another brotherhood, another association, another religion if she wants! This is beginning to be the inverse of the law presided over by a banana republic constitutional judiciary.' Consulted by ACI Prensa, the Diocese of Tenerife declined to comment on the ruling. This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner. It has been translated and adapted by CNA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeAARcmdm1olgaIfTt6XUj0	2024-11-07T15:23:09-08:00	
Trump Presidency 2.0: Ending Colonial Mentality In Philippine Def...	President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House should provide opportunities for the Philippines to end the perennial colonial mentality in Philippine defense and foreign policy. When President Ferdinand 'Bong Bong' Marcos Jr assumed office in June 2022, there were enormous expectations that his administration would take this direction by pursuing a flexible foreign and defense policy practiced by most Southeast Asian countries. Otherwise known as 'bamboo diplomacy', this policy delicately balances the country’s bilateral relations with great powers, particularly with the United States and China, with the main goal not only of advancing national interests but also in maintaining regional stability through the principle of peaceful coexistence, neutrality and amity among nations. 'Friends to All Enemy to None' Three years ago, during the presidential campaign, Marcos Jr promised to continue the nationalist policy of his predecessor, former President Rodrigo R. Duterte who attempted to champion a flexible foreign policy by implementing a comprehensive strategic cooperation with China while sustaining, but critically reexamining, military alliance with the US with a pragmatic slogan, 'friends to all and enemy to none'. In January 2023, in fact, Marcos Jr announced during his visit to China to shift to a higher gear Manila ties with Beijing while sustaining defense alliance with the US. The world thought that Marcos Jr would truly uphold an independent Philippine foreign policy as mandated by the 1987 Philippine Constitution. But Marcos Jr surprisingly made a drastic turnaround when he suddenly adopted an excessive pro-Americanism in Philippine defense and foreign policy. This excessive pro-Americanism is a strong indication of the persistence of colonial mentality in the Philippines under his leadership. Excessive Pro-Americanism Marcos Jr policy is now akin to the foreign and security policy of late President Benigno Simeon Aquino III. Like his pro-American mother, the late President Corazon C. Aquino, the late President Aquino III became excessively pro-American when he succumbed to the US influence to challenge China before international arbitration on maritime jurisdictional conflict in parts of the South China Sea (SCS) that Manila calls as the West Philippine Sea (WPS). To counter China, Aquino III even signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the US in 2014 that Marcos Jr expanded in 2023. To date, nine American military facilities are built in Philippine bases as a result of the EDCA expansion under Marcos Jr administration. There are other camps of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) facing the SCS where American troops can easily access as locations of other US satellite military facilities to support various kinds of Pentagon’s military activities in the Philippines. Currently, there is also the controversial and risky deployment of American Typhon mid-range missile system in the Northern Philippines facing Taiwan. AFP Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner even announced his inclination to permanently deploy the Typhon missile in the Philippines. Philippine National Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr also affirmed the indefinite stationing of the Typhon missile in the Philippine to deter China’s 'aggressive and coercive' activities in the WPS. Bases of Philippine Insecurities According to Prof. Roland G. Simulan, American military facilities in the Philippines are, in fact, the bases of Philippine insecurities rather than defense. In the Third Edition of his book, The Bases of Our Insecurity: A Study of the US Military Bases in the Philippines, published in July 2024, Simbulan laments, 'if we allow US troops and warships and aircraft, some of which carry nuclear weapons to use and establish drone bases in any part of the Philippines, we will surely be targeted by China’s missiles or worse by suicide bombers retaliating against US military forces.' Thus, excessive pro-Americanism of Marcos Jr administration is raising the risk of the Philippines to get involved in the worsening American rivalry with China and other US adversaries in the world. The Philippines as a Former American Colony There is nothing new in pro-Americanism in Philippine defense and foreign policy as the Philippines was known worldwide as a direct colony of the US from 1898 to 1935. Because of the struggle of the Filipino people for self-determination and political independence, the US granted the Philippines the Commonwealth Government on November 15, 1935 as a political transition toward sovereign rule. However, foreign policy and military affairs of the Philippines remained in the supreme hands of the US. All legislation passed by the Philippine Congress still needed the approval of the US president. This situated deeply sedimented American colonial rule of the Philippines even during the Commonwealth period. The Commonwealth: The Root of Continuing Dependence The passage in 1935 of the Commonwealth Act Number 1 provided the solid foundation for the US to maintain a strong grip on the Philippines that until now shape the direction of Philippine foreign and defense policy. Better known in the Philippines as the National Defense Act (NDA) of 1935, it established the strategic umbilical cord between the two countries and provided the legal justification for forging a military alliance. The NDA allowed the establishment of US military reservations in Philippine territories while the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines was setting-up its own independent military forces. The NDA also authorized Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon to confer on US Gen. Douglas MacArthur the title of field marshal of the Philippine Army. MacArthur was the architect of the Philippine defense plan that became the basis for the development of the current AFP. Though it has gone through several revisions, the NDA remains in effect and continues to serve as the formal tie that strongly binds and inextricably links the security of the Philippines with the US. The US as the Liberator and Savior When Japanese Imperial forces occupied the Philippines from 1941 to 1945, Commonwealth President Quezon evacuated to the US to run a government in exile. The Commonwealth Period formed a habit among Philippine security officials to be very reliant on the US government for security advice and training, if not outward decision-making. The Japanese occupation allowed the US and the Philippines a common foe. Fighting side-by-side against the Japanese Imperial Forces further cemented the historical foundation of the US-Philippines military alliance; around a million Filipinos and over 60,000 US soldiers died in the Philippines during World War II. World War II served as the main catalyst for Philippine security officials to develop a strong emotional affinity with and psychological dependence on their US counterparts. Most Filipinos during World War II regarded the US as the liberator of their country from the Japanese Imperial Forces. This created an image of the US among most Filipinos as a 'savior' of the Philippine Republic. Neocolonial Philippine Republic When the Philippines received its political independence from the US on July 4, 1946, then President Manuel Roxas enunciated a pro-American orientation of Philippine foreign and security policy. During his inauguration, Roxas declared his unequivocal subordination to the US when he stressed that he was committed to 'subscribe irretrievably' to US foreign policy and to the 'cause and international program of the United States of America.' He also underscored the need to have the 'closest cooperation with the United States in all matters concerning our common defense and security.' Thus, his government signed the Military Bases Agreement (MBA) with the US in 1947. In his book, The United States and the Philippines: A Study of Neocolonialism published in 1986, American scholar, Stephen R. Shalom, argued that Roxas Administration was the beginning of US neocolonialism in the Philippines. He asserted, 'neocolonialism is appropriate for describing the relationship between the United States and the Philippines. Like all concept, neocolonialism is an abstraction but it has had very real consequences for the people of the Philippines.' Succeeding Philippine presidents like Elipidio Quirino, Ramon Magsaysay, Carlos Garcia and Diosdado Macapagal attempted to adopt a less pro-US outlook in Philippine policy. But they all failed to resist strong American neocolonial rule of the Philippines. Quirino, for instance, deployed Filipinos to fight with American troops at the onset of the Korean War in 1950 and signed the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) with the US in 1951. Magsaysay, on the other hand relied heavily on the US to fight the local communist insurgency and supported the formation of the US-led Southeast East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in 1954 to fight communism in the region. Although short-lived, SEATO served as the Asian counterpart of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Garcia appeared to be nationalistic when he implemented the Filipino First Policy. He also acted against the US by signing the Bohlen-Serrano Agreement that shortened the lease of American military bases from 99 years to 25 years renewable after every five years. But Garcia actually failed to overcome neocolonial dependence on the Americans considering that during his administration, half of foreign investments to the country were from the US while American business community occupied the most prominent position in the Philippine economy. Thus, Garcia kept four American bases in Subic, Sangley, Clark and Baguio City. Despite some nationalist resistance, Macapagal also sustained the neocolonial policy of Garcia of keeping US military bases in the Philippines. Though he changed the celebration of Philippine independence from July 4 to June 12 to promote a more independent posture, Macapagal supported American military activities during the Vietnam War in exchange for increased US foreign military assistance. Like other previous Philippine presidents, Macapagal relied heavily on US neocolonial support to fight the local communist insurgency. US 'Waltzed' with Marcos Sr It was former President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr who pursued a more flexible and even pragmatic foreign and defense policy when his administration opened diplomatic relations with China and the so-called 'communist world', particularly with the former Soviet Union. Marcos Sr attempted to overcome American neocolonial rule of the Philippines under his grandious program of the 'New Society'. To reduce the country’s dependence on the US for national defense, Marcos Sr implemented the ambitious but expedient Self-Reliance Defense Program (SRDP). Marcos Sr utilized the US-Philippines alliance not only to confront common external security challenges and internal insurgency threats. He also used bilateral relations with the US to maintain his authoritarian regime. The US had to pragmatically and cautiously 'waltz with the dictator' because the Cold War still required US military facilities in the Philippines. Marcos Sr used nationalist rhetoric and anti-neocolonial propaganda to get more military aid from the US for purposes of rule maintenance. He even threatened to terminate the MBA if the US would not pay an annual compensation package for the use of facilities in Philippine territories. Marcos endeavored to remold the US-Philippines alliance by initiating an amendment of the MBA during the first term of his presidency. This effort led to the signing of the Ramos-Rusk Agreement on Septemeber 16, 1966, which finally reduced the term of the bases treaty from 99 to 25 years – thus the expiration of the MBA in 1991. Autonomous Defense and Moribund Alliance After the Cold War The end of the Cold War in 1991 posed enormous challenges to the relevance of the US-Philippines alliance. US withdrawal from Clark and Subic after the termination of the MBA in 1991 weakened the foundation of the alliance. The complete withdrawal of US military facilities in the Philippines in 1992 made the 'once-strong' and 'once-special' alliance 'essentially moribund.' Many thought that this was the end of American neocolonial rule of the Philippines. During the administration of President Fidel V. Ramos, the Philippine government flirted with the idea of autonomous defense by passing in 1995 the AFP Modernization Program. Confronted with territorial disputes in the SCS and internal armed conflicts with the Maoist and Moro rebels, the Philippine government even accommodated multilateral options, through regionalism, to overcome the country’s complex security dilemma. From its bilateral security alliance with the US, the Philippine government, therefore, Ramos went regional and multilateral by strongly participating in the expansion and strengthening of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Philippine government also supported the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1993 and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in 1989. It even formally joined the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) after the termination of the MBA in 1991. But the Philippine government realized that neither autonomy nor multilateralism was a complete solution. Autonomous defense was not just ambitious, it was also very impractical considering the country’s sluggish domestic economy in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It realized the peril of pursuing security through self-help without adequate military resources. It also acknowledged that while multilateralism was important to promote dialogues for regional confidence building, it was not adequate for national capacity building to overcome the country’s internal and external security problems. Reactivation of Philippine-American Alliance With the growing security challenges emanating from China against the backdrop of complex maritime disputes in the SCS, the Philippines found it necessary to reactivate its alliance with the US, particularly when China took control of the Mischief Reef in 1995. Thus, the Philippines fashioned a new type of security relations with the US when the Philippine Senate ratified the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) in 1999 during the administration of President Joseph Ejercito Estrada. American neocolonial rule of the Philippines did not end. Philippine-American security alliance only fully reinvigorated after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the US. Then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo supported the US-led Global War on Terror (GWOT). The US, on the other hand, declared the Philippines as the second front in the GWOT next to Afghanistan, which the US invaded before targeting Iraq. The Philippine government sent Filipino troops to Iraq to support American activities there. But when the Philippines withdrew its troops from Iraq in 2004 due to the abduction of a Filipino overseas worker by a terrorist group, Philippine-American relations turned very sour. Then President Arroyo, on the other hand, shifted her attention to China for political and economic support. In 2005, the Philippines and China enjoyed the 'golden age' of Philippines-China relations when Arroyo pursued a friendlier policy towards Beijing. Again, there was a perception that the Philippines was ending its neocolonial ties with the US. But the US regained its neocolonial control of the Philippines during the Aquino III administration in the aftermath of the 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff. As previously mentioned, Aquino III signed the EDCA in 2014 allowing the building up of five American military facilities inside Philippine bases. From the 'golden age' of Philippines-China relations under Arroyo, China and the Philippines suffered their lowest moments of bilateral ties under Aquino III. Meanwhile, the Philippines and the US enjoyed the enhancement of their neocolonial alliance during the Aquino III administration. Brief Separation from the US: A Paradigm Shift to China A major challenge in Philippines-US alliance emerged during the Duterte administration who stopped the full implementation of EDCA when he pursued a paradigm shift to China in foreign and security policy. Duterte even announced the separation of his foreign policy from the US. Duterte also suspended the implementation of the VFA while promoting pragmatic cooperation with China. To manage conflicts, Duterte joined China in pursuing the Bilateral Consultative Mechanism (BCM) in the SCS where both countries talked about cooperation, conflict management, and peaceful resolution of disputes. Duterte attempted to overcome colonial mentality in Philippine defense and foreign policy by pursuing a hedging approach with China and the US practiced by Southeast Asian neighbors like Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and even Vietnam. But his term was short-lived to sustain such approach. After his term, the Philippines returned to neocolonial reliance on the US. Subservient Policy and Renewed Dependence on the US Though the world has changed from cold war to post-cold war and to the current century, it is a great pity that until now, the Philippine government under the Marcos Jr Administration still carries the neocolonial policy of dependence on the US. Rather than relying on its own feet and cooperating with close neighbors to address its panoply of security concerns free of American intervention, the Philippine government under Marcos Jr administration is relying again on its distant relative. Nationalist scholars have called this as the neocolonial policy of subservience. This subservience to the US can be attributed to the persistence of century-old colonial mentality of ruling Filipino elites, the political oligarchs and the military, who regard its erstwhile colonial master as a provider and guarantor of Philippine security. They are the patrons of the masses who follow the colonial mentality of their masters. Mendicant Policy As a result of colonial mentality, Philippine foreign policy has become medicant to the American policy. The Philippine government’s blind adherence to the US Indo-Pacific Strategy is a tragic case of this continuing mendicancy in exchange for increased access of the Philippine military to US Foreign Military Assistance (FMA), Excess Defense Articles (EDA) and International Military Education and Training (IMET). Since 1946, the Philippines government has been begging the US for greater privileges in FMA, EDA and IMET. Sadly, the Philippine military is currently free-riding on American defense capabilities through the MDT, VFA, EDCA and other military arrangements,. This actually limits the capability of the AFP to genuinely build its autonomous defense capabilities. Though the AFP continues to procure military assets to modernize the armed forces, the Philippine military continues to suffer from the perennial underdevelopment. Now, the Philippine military is still lagging behind its key Southeast Asian neighbors like Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore because of the heavy reliance of the AFP on the US and other American military allies for defense build-up. Towards a Decolonization Policy The Philippines cannot be a truly sovereign state if its defense and foreign policy continues to be subjected to the colonial mentality of subservience and mendicancy on the US. As what former Senator Claro M. Recto once argued half a century ago, 'The tragedy of our foreign policy is that being an Asian people ten thousand miles away from the effective center of American power, our behavior is that of banana republic in the Caribbean. We have fed upon the fancy that we are somehow the favorite children of America.' While there is no doubt that the Philippines still needs to foster strong mutually beneficial relations with the US for pragmatic purposes and strategic considerations, ties should be built on decolonized mindset. The Philippines under Marcos Jr administration still have chances to adjust its policy by resisting US dominance as what other nations from the Global South or developing world are doing. The US, on the other hand, under the second Trump Administration should deal with the Philippines on equal footing and refrain from treating the Philippines as a subordinate ally, a controlled former colony. Unless Filipinos overcome this colonial mentality through genuine decolonization that cuts its umbilical cord of dependence on its former colonial patron, pursuing an independent Philippine foreign policy and autonomous defense strategy will continue to be a myth rather than a reality. The return of President Trump to the White House should make a difference in ending this neocolonial rule and in reexamining the nature of Philippines-US alliance in the 21st century during the remaining years of Marcos Jr administration.

Banlaoi, 'The US-Philippines Alliance: Meeting 21st Century Security Challenges' in Carl Baker and Brad Glosserman, eds., Doing More and Expecting Less: The Future of US Alliances in the Asia Pacific (Honolulu: Pacific Forum CSIS, 2013), pp. 55-66).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQBnsMDxGLWvH	2024-11-07T09:25:21-08:00	
President Muizzu To Diversify The Tourism-Dependent Maldivian Eco...	New projects will supplement tourism and generate jobs for all skill sets Maldives, which has been over-dependent on the tourism industry for decades, has begun to realize the risks of over-dependence on one sector and President Mohamed Muizzu is taking a range of steps to correct the missteps of the past. COVID had hit tourism hard and Maldives had a hard time recovering from it. Therefore, one of the primary goals of President Muizzu government is to diversify the Maldivian economy. His administration is actively working to develop other industries, such as fisheries, agriculture, and renewable energy, an official said. By fostering growth in these areas, the government hopes to create job opportunities, increase exports, and boost the economy's resilience against global market fluctuations. Fisheries Fisheries has great potential. In 2021, nearly 71% of the animal protein consumed by Maldivians was credited to fish. The demand for fisheries and agricultural products continues to grow not only due to an increasing population, but also due to the increase in tourist arrivals, which total 2 million a year. There is tremendous scope for increasing production for consumption as well export. In 2018, the government issued and renewed 21-year leases for 15 uninhabited islands dedicated to commercial fisheries, 50 uninhabited islands for commercial agriculture and eight additional uninhabited islands for both commercial fisheries and agriculture. The result was that the fisheries sector contributed nearly 96% to the country's total merchandise export of about MVR 2.7 billion (US$ 175.4 million). In 2021 exports in 2021 were MVR 1.9 billion (US$ 123.4 million). Exports included live ornamental fish, fish roe, smoked fish, fish chips, fresh fish, chilled fish, or frozen consumable fish such as yellowfin tuna, albacore, long finned tuna and many more. With these great values, came the responsibility of managing the fish stocks as well. But there was insufficient capacity and institutional support. In addition, lack of market access, inadequate transport as well as poor environmental management and insufficient food safety controls. There were also concerns about over-fishing. Climate change was affecting biodiversity in marine life causing a decline in fish catches, which resulted in overfishing. The lack of air cargo and sea transportation relative to the yield of fishing was a limitation to production and sale flows. There was also a lack of awareness on good aquaculture and high-value market products, due to which the industry fell short in reaching its full potential in the global market. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) is one of the strongest supporting bodies for the development of the fisheries sector in the Maldives. It boosted the sustainability of rural livelihoods, with a focus on climate-smart agriculture and fisheries development. FAO provided funds for fisheries, and till 2011, it had disbursed US$ 411,120 for various projects in the veterinary, aquaculture and agricultural sectors. Renewable Energy and Climate Change President Muizzu is keen on renewable energy to reduce the Maldives' dependence on costly imported fuel. Investments in solar and wind energy not only support environmental sustainability but also promise a more stable and self-reliant future. Maldives is projected to lose 80% of its land over the next few decades. It has therefore, recognized an urgent need to chart a new course. The country has set an exceptionally ambitious target of reaching net-zero by 2030, embarking on a historic transition to clean energy with the help of the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. A joint investment of over US$ 300 million is helping the Maldives develop solar power facilities, increase renewable energy capacity, and remove barriers to private investment and further development. Boosting Entrepreneurship President Muizzu's policies also emphasize empowering Maldivian entrepreneurs and small businesses. By providing financial incentives, grants, and training programs, the government seeks to unlock local talent and innovation. The focus on local entrepreneurship aims to generate more job opportunities across diverse fields, allowing Maldivians to benefit directly from economic growth. Initiatives that support women and youth entrepreneurs are also expected to drive inclusivity and expand access to economic participation. Employment The labour market of the Maldives is characterized by a duality. On the one hand, unemployment rate remains at 28%, on the other hand, the expatriate workers in the Maldives is at par with the economically active Maldivian population. It is estimated that the economically active population of the Maldives will be doubled by the year 2054. Parallel to this growth, by 2054, expatriate workers' population in the Maldives will surpass the economically active Maldivian population. The growth of foreign employment in the Maldives could pose a huge challenge for locals to find employment in the future. Therefore, the way forward for us is to seek entrepreneurship and self-employment. Entrepreneurship According to the Pension Office (2020) statistics, there are 1971 businesses registered with it. Only 0.4% of the population are active entrepreneurs. This suggests that there is a huge potential for entrepreneurship development in the Maldives. The rise of internet, gig and shared economy have created opportunities for entrepreneurship. Equalitarianism To support economic development and enhance access to essential services, President Muizzu has prioritized infrastructure development, particularly in outlying atolls. Through an ambitious decentralization program, the administration is working to ensure that more people across the country have access to high-quality healthcare, education, and public services. Enhanced road networks, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions in remote areas aim to improve living standards, reduce urban migration, and foster sustainable development across the nation. President Muizzu's commitment to regional development also supports the goal of creating a more cohesive society, where economic opportunities and social benefits are more evenly Dr. Muizzu's vision places great emphasis on social stability. The administration has committed to improving social welfare programs, providing safety nets for the most vulnerable populations, including the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income families. These initiatives are aimed at creating a foundation of security that will foster a stable and resilient society. Furthermore, investments in education and healthcare seek to provide Maldivians with the resources they need to lead productive and fulfilling lives. By ensuring access to quality education and healthcare, Dr. Muizzu's government is aiming to equip the population with the tools necessary to contribute to national development. Current Economic Condition Be that as it may, current economic parameters give a grim picture. Domestic inflation stayed low at 0.5% in H1 2024, but food inflation surged to 6.7%, raising living costs, especially for poorer households. The trade deficit widened to US$ 1.5 billion in H1 2024 due to a 45.5% drop in fish exports and a 6.4% increase in imports. Rising import costs and debt repayments reduced official reserves from US$ 590.5 million in December 2023 to US$ 395.4 million in July 2024, while usable reserves fell to a record low of US$ 43.7 million. Recurrent expenditure fell by 7.2% in H1 2024, but capital spending plummeted by 47.6% due to infrastructure spending cuts. Total expenditure is set to moderate, but expenditure arrears are building up. Revenue collections dropped by 5.7%, keeping the fiscal deficit at 12.8% of GDP. The central bank's exposure to government securities increased to 61% of its assets by mid-2024, reflecting ongoing domestic and external financing challenges. There's Light The situation is indeed grim. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. The economy is expected to grow by 4.7% on average over the medium term, slower than the pre-pandemic average of 7.4%. Backed by substantial foreign budgetary assistance, the Maldivian budget for 2025 is for MVR 2.5 billion (US$ 168 million). Out of which, MVR 2.3 billion (US$ 149.8 million) is expected to be received from friendly countries, with India accounting for US$ 104 million of it. Officials believe that Maldivians can look forward to a future where economic opportunities are abundant, social welfare is prioritized, and environmental sustainability is an enduring principle. Dr. Muizzu is keen on positioning the Maldives as a model for sustainable growth and stability in the region and also the world at large.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQLuofv7p8eIb	2024-11-07T09:23:19-08:00	
Trump 2.0 And The World Economy: The Challenges Of Protectionism ...	The re-election of Donald Trump in 2024 has set the stage for a significant shift in both American domestic and international policy. Returning to the White House in January 2025, Trump’s second term is expected to renew his ‘America First’ ethos—a promise to prioritize American interests over traditional alliances and multilateral frameworks. Trump’s appeal, reinforced by a steady erosion of public trust in the Biden-Harris administration, reflects the public’s desire for a return to perceived American strength. Yet as he steps back into global leadership, Trump encounters a more fractured and volatile world order than the one he left in 2021. Global conflicts, economic disruptions, and shifting alliances create an unpredictable landscape that could amplify the effects of his policies in unprecedented ways. His promises of a 'Golden Age for America' face immediate challenges, demanding more than slogans if they are to reshape the global economy. America-First Redux: Reclaiming Economic Sovereignty at All Costs Central to Trump’s renewed agenda is his commitment to an ‘America First’ doctrine, which prioritizes national economic sovereignty over globalization and multilateral cooperation. Trump’s economic stance reflects a protectionist ideology that, while popular among his domestic base, carries profound implications for the global economy. His promise to increase tariffs on imports—from an additional 10-20% on most goods to as much as 100% on certain Chinese products— indicates a return to trade policies that prioritize immediate U.S. benefits, often at the expense of international economic stability. This approach mirrors the Monroe Doctrine in its assertion of American dominance, but it differs in scope, extending protectionism far beyond U.S. borders. Unlike its historic predecessor, which aimed to secure the Western Hemisphere from foreign influence, Trump’s strategy aims at reshaping global trade to prioritize American economic interests worldwide. The implications are clear: reduced engagement with international institutions, prioritization of bilateral trade deals, and a willingness to withdraw from multilateral frameworks. For major trading partners like China, Mexico, and India, these policies promise renewed tensions, likely leading to retaliatory tariffs and a reshuffling of trade relationships. Domestically, Trump’s protectionist stance may satisfy those who feel left behind by globalization. However, it poses risks for American consumers, who would likely bear the cost of higher tariffs in the form of increased prices. These rising costs could dampen consumer spending, thereby slowing economic growth, while the absence of multilateral trade agreements may create an unpredictable environment for U.S. companies reliant on foreign markets. Globally, this protectionist turn risks alienating long-standing allies and could accelerate the formation of alternative economic blocs that seek to insulate themselves from U.S. influence. A Withdrawal from Global Alliances: Retreating from Multilateralism Trump’s approach to foreign policy often draws upon transactional relationships, sidelining traditional alliances in favour of direct negotiations and pragmatic agreements. His first term was marked by withdrawals from key agreements, such as the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), moves that weakened multilateral cooperation on critical issues. His return to the White House signals a continuation—and potentially an intensification—of this trend. With NATO, Trump has previously expressed frustration over what he sees as disproportionate U.S. contributions to the alliance. Speculation suggests he may reduce troop deployments, close certain bases, or scale back financial support, citing these measures as necessary to reduce the U.S.’s global ‘burden.’ This retreat could destabilize NATO’s security framework, emboldening adversaries who view a weakened NATO as an opportunity to challenge Western interests. Trump’s turn from traditional alliances may also indicate a decreased reliance on shared international security commitments, favouring instead a more insular approach that views alliances through a narrow lens of immediate American benefit. A diminished U.S. presence in international agreements is also anticipated in environmental policy. Trump’s resistance to climate change mitigation initiatives remains a defining aspect of his platform. His intent to withdraw, once again, from the Paris Climate Accord underlines a disregard for collaborative climate action, a posture that risks weakening global efforts to address climate change. The retreat from multilateral climate agreements would have far-reaching consequences, particularly for developing countries most vulnerable to climate impacts. Trump’s isolationist stance on environmental policy is not merely symbolic; it directly threatens international funding for climate adaptation, an essential resource for regions facing increased environmental challenges due to global warming. The Global South and the Risks of Economic Fragmentation The effects of Trump’s policies extend far beyond America’s borders, particularly impacting the Global South, where developing nations rely heavily on access to American markets. For countries that have historically benefited from open trade with the U.S., Trump’s tariff hikes and protectionist policies present immediate challenges. Nations in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia could face restricted access to American markets, especially in sectors like agriculture, textiles, and technology. This reduced access could force these economies to seek alternative markets, potentially increasing dependence on emerging powers like China and fostering new regional alliances. Furthermore, Trump’s scepticism toward multilateral institutions like the World Trade Organization (WTO) could create a more hostile global trading environment. Developing nations that depend on the WTO to mediate trade disputes may find themselves without effective recourse if the organization’s influence diminishes. This absence of a reliable multilateral framework would likely increase economic competition, as countries are forced to protect their interests in an environment that prioritizes national gains over cooperative trade. Trump’s focus on dollar dominance as a tool of economic leverage could also drive de-dollarization efforts among emerging economies. His threats to impose tariffs on countries exploring alternative currencies are seen as attempts to maintain the dollar’s global supremacy. However, these efforts may backfire by accelerating the movement among BRICS nations toward independent financial systems. Russia and China have already initiated steps to trade in local currencies, and a second Trump term could strengthen this trend, creating a fragmented global economy where countries are increasingly wary of dollar-denominated transactions. Eroding Stability in Key Regional Economies: China, Russia, and India China: Trump’s re-election brings renewed focus on ‘decoupling’ from China, with a tariff strategy aimed at diminishing China’s role in U.S. supply chains. While this move may create short-term gains for American industries, it risks isolating the U.S. from a critical market. China’s potential pivot toward self-sufficiency and stronger regional alliances, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, could accelerate. A protracted trade conflict with the U.S. might even lead China to establish a parallel economic system, reinforcing alliances with countries that resist U.S.-led financial structures. Russia: Trump’s confrontational stance toward multilateralism aligns with Russia’s interest in reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar. With sanctions limiting Russia’s access to Western markets, a continued de-dollarization push could see Russia strengthen its ties with China and other BRICS countries. This shift might lead to the establishment of alternative financial frameworks that encourage trade in local currencies. For countries within Russia’s influence, this shift could offer a way to avoid U.S. sanctions, although the process of moving away from the dollar would introduce economic volatility. India: India’s relationship with the U.S. under Trump’s policies could be a bit complicated. As the U.S.-China trade relationship remains strained, India may become an attractive partner for American businesses looking to diversify their supply chains. However, Trump’s protectionist trade policies could simultaneously hinder India’s access to American markets, particularly in tech and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, Trump’s push for U.S. primacy in Asia may place pressure on India to align with American interests, limiting its diplomatic flexibility with neighbouring countries. The Global Economy and a Potential Shift Toward a Fragmented Order Trump’s second term is expected to reinforce a polarized economic scenario. His protectionist approach and scepticism toward multilateral organizations challenge the foundations of the liberal economic order, which relies on cooperation and shared governance. The retreat from multilateralism undercuts efforts to create equitable frameworks for international trade and development, potentially worsening global inequality. For developing economies, especially those in the Global South, Trump’s policies could exacerbate economic volatility. Rising debt costs, reduced access to American markets, and increased dependence on alternative alliances threaten the progress many nations have made in recent decades. By undermining the stability of the dollar and sidelining international institutions, Trump’s policies may push the world economy toward a more fragmented order, where economic relationships are increasingly regional and less anchored in a unified system. A Path Forward: The Case for a Sustainable Global Economic Model A second Trump presidency raises critical questions about the sustainability of the current global economic model. His administration’s approach to prioritizing immediate national gains at the expense of long-term stability challenges the assumptions underlying a cooperative global order. The liberal economic framework, with its emphasis on multilateral cooperation and fair trade, offers a viable alternative that can address the needs of both developed and developing nations. By supporting policies that encourage equitable terms of trade, sustainable development, and international collaboration, a liberal economic order could foster an environment where countries work collectively to address shared challenges. For the world economy to address the pressures of a protectionist U.S., multilateral organizations must adapt, finding ways to protect vulnerable economies and maintain pathways for international cooperation. In the face of rising nationalism, the case for a more resilient, inclusive global system becomes not only a matter of economic stability but a necessity for global equity and progress.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQB8w23QCkPP1	2024-11-07T09:22:21-08:00	
NATO Secretary General Meets With European Leaders In Hungary	Thursday (7 November 2024), Secretary General Mark Rutte participated in a meeting of the European Political Community in Budapest, Hungary. The meeting was an opportunity for European leaders to discuss a broad range of security challenges and the importance of working together to address them. This included exchanges not only on traditional threats and challenges but also on issues like economic security and critical dependencies. Rutte highlighted the importance of working together - not only across the European community but through NATO and its global partners as well. He noted the growing alignment between Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, which are working together to support Russia’s war against Ukraine - a reality that has broader impacts. In exchange for this support, Rutte said, 'Russia is delivering technology to North Korea' that will enable the DPRK to 'threaten the US mainland, continental Europe and our Indo-Pacific partners'. 'These are new, dangerous developments that we need to discuss together.' In the margins of the meeting in Budapest, the Secretary General met with a number of other leaders including the host, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Albanian President Edi Rama, and others.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQO3Vkp6vYVr0	2024-11-07T09:20:13-08:00	
Iran: Unprecedented Surge In Executions – OpEd	The number of executions carried out by Iran’s religious dictatorship has exceeded 150 in the month from September 22 to October 21, marking the highest monthly total in the past decade. Since Massoud Pezeshkian was inaugurated as Iran’s new president on July 28, 2024, more than 386 executions have been reported. In a recent and damning report, Javaid Rehman, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran from July 2018 to July 2024, classified two waves of mass killings in Iran as acts of genocide: the massacres of 1982 and 1988. The term 'genocide' applies here because Iran’s religious regime executed its opponents solely based on their beliefs, ethnic background, or political affiliation, with the aim of eradicating them. Shockingly, this practice continues to this day. The Iranian Ministry of Intelligence has intensified its crackdown on supporters and families of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), the regime's sworn enemies, targeting them solely due to family ties or presumed support for the Resistance. This wave of arrests aims to prevent any social movement or uprising against the ruling powers. In July 2024, this organization submitted to the UN a list of 3,600 supporters and relatives detained by the regime who had previously massacred nearly 30,000 PMOI members in 1988. Meanwhile, the judiciary is extending prison sentences for political prisoners, including Maryam Akbari Monfared, one of Iran's longest-held political detainees, and Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi, under spurious pretexts to block their release. Maryam Akbari Monfared’s 'crime' consists of filing a complaint over the execution of her siblings. Like all dictators throughout history who were facing intense pressure, Iran’s religious leadership is resorting to ruthless executions and extreme repression. In an appalling act on October 29, Khamenei’s agents severed the fingers of two brothers, Shahab and Mehrdad Teimouri, using a guillotine at Urmia Prison. Five other prisoners in Urmia are currently awaiting similar amputations. The two brothers were arrested in December 2018 on theft charges and sentenced to the amputation of their right-hand fingers. Amnesty International’s most recent report condemning such inhumane amputations dates back to 2018. Under international scrutiny, the Iranian regime seemed to have paused or at least limited public disclosure of such punishments. However, the regime remains deeply fearful of a discontented populace, which it views as a powder keg on the brink of explosion. Negotiation with and leniency toward this enabler of execution, terror, and war only embolden them to further violate human rights and destabilize global peace. Europe and the international community should follow Germany’s example. After the execution of an Iranian-German citizen, kidnapped by Iran’s dictator four years ago, Germany closed all Iranian consulates within its borders. The European Union should condition its relations with Iran on concrete human rights improvements and an immediate halt to executions. Failure to act will allow this dictatorship to continue undermining peace and stability worldwide, as we have seen in the recent Middle East conflict.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQMYXCeLP6-Fg	2024-11-07T09:18:53-08:00	
Allah Is A Word And A 99 Name – OpEd	Some Muslims say Allah is the Arabic word for God; so the word Allah can be used by non-Muslims to refer to their own religious concept of God. Others vehemently oppose this. They maintain that no believing Muslim should translate the English sentence 'Zeus is a Greek God.' as 'Zeus is a Greek Allah'. It is absurd, sacrilegious, and an affront to Islam. Allah is the name of the one and only God and not just a word. Jews also have a very special name for God (YHVH) that is untranslatable; and has not even been pronounced verbally out loud by Jews for the last 2400 years. In the days of Abraham, the religions of the Near East and India had hundreds of gods, and so had hundreds of different names for their gods. But for the monotheistic religions that trace their prophets back to Prophet Abraham, and his two sons Ishmael and Isaac, the many names of God are not really names of God: they simply describe different aspects or attributes of the one God's multifaceted personality. For monotheists the many names of God are just appellations: titles and descriptions. Thus, to say that God is a King or a Judge describes one of many ways the one God acts. To say that God is the Compassionate One is to describe one of the many character or personality traits of the one God. So for monotheists each of the many 'names' of the one God is only one of the many appellations of the one universal creator of space and time; both Islam and Judaism also have one special Divine name that is always in the believer's heart and soul. Because the Qur'an is filled with beautiful Arabic poetry; it is not surprising that the Qur'an is also filled with 99'names' of the one and only God. Because the Jewish tradition dates back more than thirty five centuries; it is not surprising that Jews have used many additional 'names' (70) for God over those many centuries. The word God in English is not a name of the one God like Allah or YHVH. It is the generic term used for any and every deity, similar to the West Semitic root word EL as it is found in Sumerian and Akkadian Ellil-Enlil; Hittite and Hurrian Ellel, and Hebrew El-Elohim. The words El, Elah, Elohei and Elohim are all pre Abrahamic West Semitic generic terms for a God or for many Gods. In these various forms they appear almost 3,000 times in the Hebrew Bible. But for Jews, the most important unique personal name of the one God is the name that God himself reveals to Moses at the burning bush: YHVH, which appears more than 6,800 times in the Hebrew Bible. In Exodus 3:13-15, Moses said to God, 'If I go to the Israelites and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?'—what should I say to them?' And God said to Moses, 'Ehyeh asher Ehyeh'. Ehyeh is the verb 'to be' future tense singular and means I will/could/might/may be/become who I may/could/will/might be/become i.e. Ehyeh is The God of Potentialities, The God of Possibilities, The Living God of Becoming and Transforming, the One who can and will liberate Israel from bondage in Egypt. Unfortunately, the Greek and Latin translations of this verse were influenced by the Greek philosophical idea that God was similar to a permanent ideal form (like an equilateral triangle) or an unmoved mover; and is not similar to a living personality. Since the Greeks thought God must be a static unchanging being. they mistranslated 'Ehyeh asher Ehyeh' as 'I am who I am' rather than its plain Hebrew meaning of 'I will be whatever I should be to redeem you' i.e. God Almighty The Torah continues, 'And God said, 'You must say this to the Israelites, 'I am' (the usual false translation for God's self revealed name) has sent me to you.'' God also said to Moses, 'You must say this to the Israelites, Ehyeh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial from generation to generation.' (Exodus 3:13-15) When Jews speak of God in the third person, God's name is pronounced Yehyeh and written YHVH-- 'the One who causes being and becoming, the One who brings potentials into existence.' The name YHVH was spoken publicly for almost a thousand years, from the time of Moses, throughout the centuries of the 1st Temple of Solomon. But it was ultimately replaced by Adonai (Lord) before the 3rd century B.C.E., because God's actual Holy name was eventually considered too holy to speak audibly. In later centuries even the substitution Adonai was considered too holy to utter; and pious Jews till this day do not use any name for God at all (except in prayer); but say only HaShem--the name (of God) when speaking about the one and only God. Islam takes a different view. The most well known of Allah's 99 names is Ar- Rahman -'the kindest and most forgiving one'; but Allah has kept to Himself knowledge of His greatest name, and He has not granted knowledge thereof to any of His creation. Prophet Muhammad once stated: 'Verily, there are 99 names of God, 100 minus 1. One who enumerates them will get into Paradise.' (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 4, no. 1410) Some Muslims believe it will only be revealed by Imam Mahdi. Or perhaps if we are all 'Made in God's Image' Mankind might be the 100th name for God. Or Hagar's feminist name for God may be the 100th beautiful name. One name of God that very few Christians, Jews or Muslims even know, much less use today, is a name that I believe will become more important in the future as Christians, Jews and Muslims learn more about each other's religions. This name, El Ro'ee, only appears twice in the Hebrew Bible and, as far as I know, is not used at all in the Talmud or Midrash as a Divine appellation. Prophet Abraham's wife Hagar/Ha-jar uses El Ro'ee as her special name for God. El Ro'ee means A God Who Sees Me. It also became the name for a well (Zamzum?). 'Then she (Hagar) called the name of YHVH, who spoke to her, El Ro'ee, 'You are a God who sees me'; for she said, 'Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?' Therefore the well (where this happened) was called Beer-laHai-roee; the well of the Living One (Al-Hayy) who sees me. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael...' (Genesis 16:13-15) Neither Sarah nor Hagar/Ha-jar are mentioned by name in the Qur'an, but the story of Ha-jar's exile from Abraham's home is traditionally understood to be referred to in a line from Ibrāhīm's prayer in the Qur'an (14:37): 'I have settled some of my family in a barren valley near your Sacred House (Kaaba)' Muslim tradition relates that when Hā-jar ran out of water, and Ismā'īl, an infant at that time, began to die; Hā-jar panicked and ran between two nearby hills, Al-Safa and Al-Marwah repeatedly searching for water. After her seventh run, Ismā'īl hit the ground with his heel and miraculously caused a well to spring out of the ground called Zamzum Well. It is located a few meters from the Kaaba in Mecca. Perhaps these two Torah names of God, El Ro'ee and Hai (Hayy) Ro'ee; which are Hagar's names for God, which mean A Self-reflecting God or A God Who Sees Me, and the name for the Zamzum well 'Beer-laHai-roi'; the well of the Living One (Hayy) who sees (mirrors) me; can help bring Christians, Jews and Muslims, who all share respect for Prophet Abraham and his family, to see each other better and thus become closer together in the future. That would be an excellent example of the power of God's name to cause future seemingly impossible transformations in all kinds of people and places. The meaning of God's name YHWH, is central to Jewish theology. There are two approaches: the philosophical, focusing on God's essence ('being') and the kabbalistic, focusing on God's evolving relationship with Israel ('becoming'). Rabbi Moses Maimonides (1138-1204), Judaism's chief rationalist, holds that all divine names, except YHVH, refer to God's activities: judge, ruler. creator, merciful, forgiver, etc. But for Rabbi Moses Nahmanides (1194-1270), a prominent Spanish Kabbalistic mystical Bible expositor, God is far more interactive and personal than just a first cause of existence, and thus the names capture different dimensions of God's dynamic being. The name YHWH, which occurs repeatedly in the book of Genesis, is only introduced formally in Exodus 3:13, in direct response to Prophet Moses' request for it at the burning bush. Exodus 6:3 corroborates its unprecedented disclosure to Moses: 'I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as El Shad-dai, but I did not make Myself known to them by My (deepest) name YHWH.' The Torah's first communication of YHVH to Moses uses the root 'to be' in the future tense of ehyeh asher ehyeh (Exodus 3:14) 'I will/may/can be who I will/may can be' and not the wide spread erroneous present tense of 'I am who I am.' YHWH conveys a relational being in a partnership of reciprocity with Israel. It connotes a God of endless becoming, as the imperfect I will be indicates, a deity who will be elusive, continually shaped and reshaped by the respective partners with whom he/she/but not it establishes a relationship. Other divine names then derive naturally in this respect from the core relational name YHWH. They correlate to various dimensions of God such as compassion, mercy, or justice, which are all manifest in relationships. Rashi captures this God of relationship by fleshing out the meaning of ehyeh asher ehyeh as, 'I will be with them during this affliction as I will be with them during their (future) oppression by other kingdoms.' For God provides the comfort, assistance, and empathy expected of any partner in a meaningful relationship. ‍ Kabbalists use ehyeh asher ehyeh to push this interactive mutuality between God and human beings even more by employing new words, so that the Name ehyeh asher ehyeh can become I will be what you will be אהיה אשר תהיה. Rabbinic and mystical interpretations of an evolving, impressionable, at times suffering, God, emerge more naturally from the original sense of a personal interventionist God subject to emotions and affectation in the Hebrew Bible as well as its rabbinic glosses. The difference between the personal intimate name of God the believer uses in prayer and when reciting his or her holy scripture, and all other names; is a measure of the believers piety and love of the God of his or her own religion. When Christian believers speak about Jesus they are referring to the 'Divine Son of God' who connects them to God the father. When Jews or Muslims speak about Jesus they are referring not to God, but only to a man of God. Indeed, Paul and his followers converted Jesus the Jewish prophet into Jesus the totally personal Devine Son of God; and this may be why the Qur'an uses 'We' and not 'I' when speaking to Prophet Muhammad so when he repeated God's words, no one should think he was a son of God. When Jews do not utter the name YHVH they are referring to the God who made a covenant at mount Sinai with the descendants of their ancestors; Abraham, Isaac and Jacob/Israel. Neither Christians or Muslims connect to God this way. When Muslims use the word Allah they mean the one God they worship and adore; who sent Prophets, speaking their own language to every nation and tribe in the world, and sent Prophet Muhammad to proclaim the Qur'an in Arabic. This is the same one God; who sent Jesus to proclaim the Gospel and Moses to proclaim the Torah. Neither Jews nor Christians connect to God in this very universal way. Thus, for Muslims the word Allah is both a generic for the one God of all monotheistic religions; and a special personal Islamic name when spoken with devotion and love by a Muslim. As an American Reform Rabbi, I can understand why many Muslims would object to Christians using the word Allah in the context of saying that Jesus is the son of Allah. Another word for Divinity is needed. On the other hand, one could say that Allah spoke to Jesus as the Qur'an itself states, 'Allah said: Jesus, I will take you back and raise you up to Myself...' (3:55) If people of good will use the generic aspect of the word Allah only in a monotheistic context, and use another word for a trinitarian or polytheistic context, we can have more light and less heat in our own religious lives.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQFeanY6Kp3cX	2024-11-07T09:17:13-08:00	
AI And Social Media: Catalysts Of Social Transformation – OpEd	Artificial intelligence (AI) has multifaceted impact on digital contents and social media. In recent years, the impact of AI embedded social media channels has had a profound effect on developing countries. These technologies have transformed both economic activities and social activism by providing new frontiers for growth and civic engagement that were previously inaccessible. Social media platforms, for instance, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and TikTok, are becoming more user friendly but sophisticated and popular with AI-driven algorithms. These platforms have become a go-to place for small businesses, social activists, and communities to leverage the digital media for ensuring social development. In areas where scope, resources and infrastructure are scarce, AI-powered social media is making a tangible difference, enhancing economic resilience and social transformation. Economic Opportunities and Growth AI is revolutionizing every aspect of our life including businesses. AI’s accelerated development has made the technology widely available and accessible. However, the AI’s ethical practices in their business models and/or to streamline their operations represents a unique opportunity to maximize their impact. The social economy represents 7% of global GDP, and generative AI could add values between $182 billion and $308 billion annually to the sector. One of the most significant economic impacts of AI-driven social media platforms in developing countries is the opportunity for small and medium businesses and entrepreneurs to reach wide-ranging markets and consumers at relatively low costs. In many areas, conventional methods of advertising are expensive and often somewhat ineffective for smaller enterprises considering their limited budgets. Social media provides an alternative channel for small businesses to access customers directly, promote products, and build brand loyalty without heavy financial investment. For example, in Nigeria, local businesses are now using WhatsApp to engage with customers. They share product catalogs, and coordinate delivery services through this application. With limited investment, entrepreneurs can now maintain direct communication with consumers and expand their customer base. This digital transformation allows businesses to operate and grow sustainably, even with minimal infrastructure, fostering rural economic growth and enabling a degree of financial independence which was previously unattainable. AI’s role in optimizing these platforms—for example, by targeting specific audiences or enabling chatbots to handle routine customer inquiries—further enhances business productivity and customer satisfaction, benefiting both entrepreneurs and consumers. Empowering through Digital Platforms AI-driven social media plays an essential role in promoting social change and community development. In areas where access to educational materials and awareness campaigns are scarce, social media provides a platform for advocacy and outreach. AI algorithms amplify content which enables social causes to reach diverse stakeholders across geographic and socioeconomic boundaries. In South Asia, for example, social media has become a major platform for social movements for promoting gender equality, education, and public health. In Bangladesh, local NGOs and INGOs leverage Facebook and other social media platforms to disseminate knowledge and organize campaigns to reach out to the less privileged communities by raising awareness on issues like education, health, employment and gender equality. Facebook groups and pages allow NGOs to engage with wider people directly, share key information, and mobilize community support. Campaigns addressing issues such as women’s rights, mental wellbeing, and environmental sustainability are now able to gain visibility and attract participants even from the remote areas. AI-powered tools, such as automated translation and customized content recommendations, further enhance the outreach by breaking language barriers and delivering relevant information to individual users. Social media, in this way, provides an essential platform for communities to engage in social discussions and collaborate on possible solutions—measures that would be difficult to achieve through conventional channels in parts where mainstream media coverage is limited. Challenges and Ethical Considerations The benefits of AI-driven social media are evident. In addition, it is essential to acknowledge the challenges and ethical considerations associated with its use in developing nations. One major concern is the risk of misinformation. As AI algorithms may amplify sensational or false content which may potentially lead to mass unrest or confusion. Especially false rumors about sensitive issues like religion, political beliefs and contentious issues can escalate violent clashes. Bangladesh has experienced several such vigilantism over the years following spread of social media misinformation. Few years back, a violent clash between police and protesters erupted in Bhola due to a social media derogatory post about Prophet Mohammad went viral which was made from a fake account and the four people were killed in the violence. Moreover, the privacy and data security of users are pressing issues as personal data collected through these platforms may be vulnerable to misuse. To mitigate these risks, digital platforms must invest in robust AI-driven moderation systems that can identify and limit harmful content while ensures data transparency. Additionally, partnerships with local governments and organizations can ensure that these technologies are operated in a manner that aligns with the specific needs and contexts of developing nations. To summarize, the integration of AI into social media platforms has emerged as a powerful tool for economic and social prosperity in developing nations. These platforms provide valuable resources for communities that lack access to traditional infrastructure and resources by fostering entrepreneurship and enhancing the visibility of social causes. If we can responsibly operate the AI-driven social media platforms, we can continue to empower individuals, strengthen grassroots economies, and promote social equity in parts that are often underserved. This digital transformation reflects the potential of AI to bridge gaps in opportunity, foster resilience, and support a more inclusive model of development in the digital era.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQFgEurx4QEDv	2024-11-07T09:15:11-08:00	
The Delusion Of A Greater Afghanistan – OpEd	The notion of a 'Greater Afghanistan,' murmured in Afghan nationalist circles, is more fantasy than feasible, a mirage conjured by a handful of fervent propagandists. History and reality offer a stark rebuttal, laying bare the implausibility of this dream. Such ideas are so far from the complexities of the region’s cultural and political landscape that one might call them the musings of those living in a self-created utopia. To grasp why, one must look into the nuances that define this region. The history of Pashtun culture, language, and identity clearly shows that its core has always been located in present-day Pakistan, rather than Afghanistan. The regions of Khurasan and Hind, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), were never part of the Afghan Empire but instead fell under the control of the Mughal and other external empires. The regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Balochistan, and FATA (now merged into KP) have been the primary cradle of Pashtun civilization for centuries. Great Pashtun poets like Khushal Khan Khattak and Rahman Baba, whose works remain a vital part of Pashtun cultural heritage, hailed from what is now Pakistan, not Afghanistan. Peshawar, in particular, has been a center of Pashtun culture, politics, and literature for a long time. Afghanistan, on the other hand, has historically been a melting pot of various ethnic groups—Hazaras, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and others. This demographic reality challenges the premise of a 'Greater Afghanistan' centered around Pashtuns. The Afghan state has always been a heterogeneous entity, and any claim that Afghanistan can somehow unify Pashtun regions under its banner is not only historically unfounded but also practically impossible. Afghanistan’s sociopolitical landscape is defined by its complex ethnic mosaic, which has led to centuries of internal strife. The Pashtuns, though the largest ethnic group, are far from a monolithic entity even within Afghanistan. They share the nation with Tajiks (27%), Hazaras (9%), and Uzbeks (9%)—each with their own distinct identity and political agendas. Unlike the marginalization Pashtuns often experience in Afghanistan, Pakistan's approach has been one of inclusion, embracing Pashtuns within its social, political, and economic spheres. The notion of 'Greater Afghanistan' is a delusion fueled by those living under the influence of unrealistic fantasies. It reflects either a misunderstanding of regional dynamics or a deliberate attempt to incite chaos. In reality, the Pashtuns in Afghanistan have long expressed dissatisfaction with their status in a fragmented state. The region of Afghanistan's eastern provinces, including Kunar, Nangarhar, and Laghman, has seen increasing unrest and a desire for closer ties with Pakistan due to better economic and security conditions across the border. Afghanistan’s economy remains weak, with a GDP that pales in comparison to Pakistan's. The economic disparity is a significant factor that contributes to the frustration of Pashtuns in Afghanistan, who have witnessed Pakistan’s relatively superior infrastructure, educational opportunities, and security apparatus. after the soviet-afghan war, over 3 million afghan sought refuge in pakistan who even after three decades were unwilling to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, Afghanistan has been embroiled in continuous conflict and civil war since the 1980s, which has exacerbated its economic struggles and hindered development, making the contrast even more stark for those on the Afghan side of the border. Pakistan, on the other hand, has emerged as a strong and stable state despite facing its own set of challenges. The integration of FATA into KP was a landmark move, providing former tribal areas with greater access to development resources, political representation, and economic opportunities. This merger was not just a political decision but a reflection of the strong affinity the Pashtuns in these regions have for Pakistan. The development projects initiated in KP and Balochistan have improved living conditions for millions of Pashtuns, solidifying their sense of belonging within Pakistan. Pashtun leaders in Afghanistan have openly expressed dismay at the state of their country. Calls for a stronger connection with Pakistan have grown louder over the years, reflecting the deep dissatisfaction with the Afghan state’s inability to provide stability and economic opportunities. Pakistan’s investments in infrastructure, its military capability, and its growing regional influence make it a natural partner for the Pashtun population in Afghanistan. Claims that Pakistan will eventually absorb the Pashtun-dominated areas of Afghanistan are not far-fetched but are a natural outcome of the current geopolitical realities. The perpetuation of the 'Greater Afghanistan' myth has external roots. Propaganda machines, funded by hostile elements, encourage Afghan nationalists to propagate such ideas. This tactic, aimed at destabilizing the region, serves the interests of those who wish to weaken Pakistan and disrupt regional cooperation. However, the ground realities stand in contrast to these dreams, as more and more Pashtuns in Afghanistan express their desire for greater connectivity with Pakistan. This propaganda must be seen for what it truly is: an attempt to fan the flames of ethnic nationalism in a region that has long been intertwined with a heterogenous mixture of history and nationalism. Such ideas only serve the short-term interests of those funding these provocations, with little concern for the long-term peace and prosperity of the region. The dream of a 'Greater Afghanistan' is not just impractical; it is a hallucination rooted in ignorance or deliberate mischief. Afghanistan’s future lies not in expanding borders but in addressing its internal challenges—poverty, ethnic strife, and political instability. Pakistan, on the other hand, continues to progress and build a strong, inclusive society where Pashtuns play a crucial role in the nation’s success. As Pakistan develops and strengthens, the calls for its leadership in Pashtun regions of Afghanistan will only grow louder. Any notion of a Greater Afghanistan is not only a dream but one fueled by those detached from reality, fanned by enemies of Pakistan, who seek to destabilize the region for their own ends. The future belongs to a united Pakistan, where Pashtuns are equal partners in progress. Long live Pakistan!	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQILP51T0FcGD	2024-11-07T09:13:39-08:00	
Pakistan: Decentralize To Thrive – OpEd	Pakistan, a country long plagued by political instability, corruption, and inefficient governance, stands at a critical juncture in its history. Despite its rich cultural heritage, strategic geopolitical significance, and a young, dynamic population, Pakistan remains trapped in a cycle of underperformance, particularly when it comes to governance. At the heart of the problem lies a deeply fragmented administrative system, one that has long been out of sync with the diverse needs of its provinces and people. To break this cycle and chart a path to lasting stability, Pakistan needs to embrace a radical restructuring of its provincial governance system—a framework that will decentralize power, allow local communities to chart their own destinies, and foster more accountable, transparent, and efficient governance. The need for this restructuring is rooted in the centralization of power in Islamabad, which has historically marginalized Pakistan’s provinces, fostering inequality, resentment, and inefficiency. While Pakistan’s 18th Amendment in 2010 made strides toward devolving powers to provincial governments, the reality is that the provinces still struggle with weak institutions, a lack of resources, and bureaucratic inertia. The central government remains deeply involved in provincial affairs, often with little regard for local realities. This top-down approach has stymied economic development, hindered the delivery of public services, and left many Pakistanis feeling disconnected from the political process. What Pakistan needs now is a reimagined provincial structure, one that fully empowers local governments to take charge of their economic, social, and political futures. It is not enough to simply give provinces more administrative powers; we must redesign the governance framework to reflect Pakistan’s complex demographic, cultural, and economic realities. This means establishing a system of governance that decentralizes decision-making, reduces corruption, increases transparency, and encourages local innovation. Here are three key principles that must guide the restructuring of Pakistan’s provinces for effective governance: The first step toward meaningful change is shifting from a largely ceremonial federal system to one in which provincial and local governments have the power to make decisions on issues that directly affect their populations. Currently, provincial governments in Pakistan are not equipped with sufficient autonomy to implement policies that reflect the specific needs of their regions. In many cases, federal directives override provincial policies, particularly in sectors like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The solution is a more robust devolution of powers, particularly to local governments. Local governments should have greater control over public resources, revenue generation, and policy-making in areas such as education, health, and law enforcement. For instance, in Balochistan, where a history of neglect by the central government has fueled unrest, local leadership should have the ability to prioritize development projects, negotiate directly with foreign investors, and allocate resources based on local needs rather than waiting for Islamabad’s approval. This type of local empowerment is crucial not only for improving the delivery of services but also for fostering a sense of ownership among Pakistan’s diverse communities. When people feel that their local leaders are accountable to them, rather than to a distant capital, trust in government grows, and governance becomes more responsive and efficient. One of the primary reasons that Pakistan’s provinces struggle to fulfill their governance responsibilities is a lack of financial independence. While the 18th Amendment made strides in granting provinces more control over their budgets, the distribution of national resources remains highly uneven, and federal transfers are often delayed or insufficient. Without the ability to raise their own revenue, provinces are left dependent on Islamabad for funding, undermining their ability to develop independently. A truly effective provincial governance system requires a significant overhaul of Pakistan’s fiscal structure. This means allowing provinces to generate and retain their own revenue, particularly through taxes and natural resource extraction. For example, provinces like Sindh, with its vast industrial base, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, rich in natural resources, should be able to collect taxes and reinvest that revenue in their own development priorities. At the same time, a system of equalization payments can ensure that poorer provinces like Balochistan are not left behind in terms of funding. Fiscal autonomy does not mean complete independence from the central government; it means giving provinces the tools they need to be self-sufficient while still contributing to national welfare. A fair and transparent revenue-sharing mechanism, coupled with stringent accountability measures, will ensure that provinces use their resources responsibly and effectively. Even with more power and resources, provinces cannot deliver effective governance without strong institutions to manage those resources. Pakistan’s provinces face significant challenges in terms of bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption, and lack of professional expertise. The provincial civil services, in particular, have been hampered by outdated structures and a lack of skilled personnel, resulting in poor implementation of policies. To address this, Pakistan must invest in building the capacity of provincial institutions, with a focus on professionalizing local bureaucracies and training a new generation of technocrats, administrators, and policy experts. This should involve partnerships with international development organizations, think tanks, and universities to create training programs and mentorship opportunities for provincial officials. Moreover, transparency and accountability must be built into provincial governance structures, with regular audits, open data initiatives, and citizen oversight to combat corruption and ensure that public funds are used effectively. A strong provincial governance framework must also ensure that there is adequate representation of marginalized groups, including women, minorities, and indigenous communities. These groups often find themselves excluded from decision-making processes at both the provincial and national levels, further exacerbating social inequality. Special provisions must be made to ensure their active participation in the governance process. Restructuring Pakistan’s provinces is not an easy task. It requires political will, societal consensus, and a long-term commitment to reform. But the potential benefits are clear. By decentralizing power, promoting fiscal autonomy, and building strong provincial institutions, Pakistan can unlock the full potential of its provinces and create a more inclusive, effective, and responsive system of governance. If Pakistan’s provinces are allowed to govern themselves in a way that is attuned to local needs, Pakistan as a whole will be better positioned to address its myriad challenges, from economic inequality to terrorism to climate change. A new framework for progress is not just a theoretical exercise; it is an urgent necessity for the future of Pakistan. The time for reform is now.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQNMnMhfkJSMi	2024-11-07T09:12:14-08:00	
Shifting Alliances: Bangladesh’s Quest For Autonomy And Justice –...	Under the premiership of Sheikh Hasina Wajid, Bangladesh witnessed widespread violence, corruption, nepotism, manipulation of the electoral process, favoritism, and discrimination. Moreover, the Awami League government faced criticism for its authoritarian tendencies, which included suppressing opposition and curbing freedom of expression. After the resignation of Prime Minister Hasina Wajid on August 5, 2024, due to nationwide protests against the government by students and the public, an interim government was formed under the leadership of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus on August 8, 2024. The people of Bangladesh are yearning for a new governance model that prioritizes accountability and dismantles the clientelist practices that have flourished during Sheikh Hasina’s tenure. The student protesters calling on the new interim government liberate their state from corruption and nepotism. This newly formed interim government also faces the challenge of formulating its foreign policy and establishing new regional alliances with countries of interest. The current administrations of Bangladesh and Pakistan are eager to strengthen their relationship, focusing on regional cooperation and autonomy while addressing historical grievances within SAARC. Sheikh Hasina Wajid has been implicated in approximately 170 FIRs concerning significant human rights violations, including murder and genocide, leading to the arrest of several of her close associates. The public in Bangladesh believes that her government was heavily influenced by India, which compromised the nation's sovereignty. In response to corruption allegations, the interim government has frozen the financial accounts of Sheikh Hasina Wajid's family, reflecting widespread public discontent regarding her perceived alignment with Indian interests. Following an invitation from the interim government, a fact-finding team from the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) has been conducting an independent investigation into the alleged human rights violations facilitated by Sheikh Hasina Wajid. The people of Bangladesh welcome this investigation as an opportunity to expose the abuses tolerated during her tenure under Indian influence. This sentiment reflects a strong desire among the Bangladeshi populace for justice and the dismantling of the authoritarianism associated with the previous regime. Furthermore, the recent legislative modification has eliminated laws that provided additional security to the Hasina’s family. Bangladesh masses considered it a bold move toward political reform, criticizing the previous administration for relying on Indian help rather than addressing the public needs. Constitutional reforms are essential to impose ban on political parties involved in widespread human rights violations. Moreover, on October 6, 2024, the inauguration of the Bangladesh Army Selection Board at Army Headquarters by caretaker govt of Muhammad Yunus marks a significant moment of boosting collaboration between the military and the government. However, this event strongly signals the Bangladesh Army's commitment to assert its autonomy and take decisive steps toward liberating itself from Indian influence, reflecting a renewed sense of national pride and independence. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, the son of Sheikh Hasina Wajid, is facing serious allegations. He has engaged the services of a U.S. lobbying firm, Stryk Global Diplomacy, to influence American policymakers, including those involved in legislative processes. This strategy reflects an attempt to mitigate the backlash from his actions and to maintain a favorable image abroad. However, India's authoritarian stance as a regional power became evident when it expressed regret over Bangladesh’s request for a mutual meeting between the Chief Advisor and Indian Prime Minister Modi during the 79th United Nations General Assembly. This incident reflects India's reluctance to engage collaboratively with its neighbors, raising concerns about the state of regional diplomacy. India's authoritarian posture toward neighboring states has compelled Bangladesh to recall its envoy from New Delhi, highlighting the growing frustration with India's interference in its domestic affairs. This decision signifies a significant diplomatic rift, reflecting broader regional tensions largely attributable to India. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), influenced by its Hindutva ideology, conducted a closed-door meeting aimed at strategizing support for the Awami League (AL) in Bangladesh. Such actions attempt to manipulate the political dynamics in Bangladesh, further straining bilateral relations. India appears to struggle with accepting that Bangladesh is distancing itself from its influence. Recently, Bangladesh issued a strong protest against derogatory comments made by the Indian Home Minister regarding Bangladeshi nationals, signaling its commitment to uphold sovereignty against external pressures. During the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Bangladesh’s Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus held a meeting in which Bangladesh reaffirmed its support for the revitalization of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). This meeting is viewed as a positive step towards enhancing regional cooperation in South Asia. Additionally, Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary, Md. Jashim Uddin, is expected to visit Pakistan in the last week of November 2024, further indicating ongoing efforts to strengthen diplomatic ties. Moreover, in September 2024, a constructive meeting between the Pakistani High Commissioner and Foreign Secretary Uddin resulted in an agreement to hold an early Foreign Secretary-level meeting, also likely scheduled for late November 2024. To boost trade relations, Bangladesh's National Board of Revenue has eliminated the requirement for 100% physical inspection of goods imported from Pakistan, aiming to facilitate smoother trade operations. Both nations need to put aside their past differences and work towards improving bilateral relations. Due to Pakistan's liberal visa policy, Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) has encouraged its students to pursue educational opportunities in Pakistan. This initiative represents a renewed commitment to fostering people-to-people connections and enhancing bilateral understanding between the two countries. Bangladesh's support for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), echoed by similar sentiments from Nepal, presents a promising avenue for revitalizing the organization. This cooperative approach reflects a shared vision for regional collaboration and economic integration, paving the way for stronger ties among South Asian nations. The newly formed caretaker government in Bangladesh has a significant opportunity to work diligently on national development while maintaining a balanced foreign policy within SAARC, focusing on cooperation rather than regional grievances.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQGr3y_F8EWBC	2024-11-07T09:10:47-08:00	
Trump’s Victory: Implications For Pakistan – OpEd	Donald Trump’s second term as the US President is expected to have profound impact on geopolitics and global asset/ commodity prices, which would ultimately have implications for the ongoing macro recovery in Pakistan. There is a high probability of a 'clean sweep' by the Republican Party (it is likely to take control of both the US Senate and House), which will give Trump greater ability to execute his campaign pledges. Trump’s policies – cracking down on immigration and large import tariffs on China – are expected to be inflationary for the US economy and negative for global growth. If he is able to bring a quick end to both the wars, in Ukraine and Gaza, oil prices are likely to continue falling under the weight of weakening global demand. There are various caveats to these expectations: Global experts point to the strength of US institutions in checking/ taming some of the draconian policies Trump has pledged. Second, China has begun rolling out huge stimulus measures, both fiscal and monetary, to revive its ailing economy (particularly its large property sector). This could serve as a boost to global commodity prices. For Pakistan, the prospect of lower or stable oil/ commodity prices is positive. US-China trade war improves the opportunity to attract Chinese industries into Pakistan. Certain exports out of Pakistan, including steel and textiles, may become more competitive in the US. But, it could be a challenge for Pakistan to execute CPEC Phase 2 in the face of deteriorating US-China relations. At this stage, the event does not materially affect outlook of continued macro stability in Pakistan – continued disinflation and foreign exchange reserves buildup – and equity market re-rating, According to Pakistan’s leading brokerage house, Inter Market Securities: Oil prices are more likely to fall or stabilize around US$70/bbl over the medium term. Trump is likely to encourage greater shale oil production in the US, while at the same time, he would work to bring an end to the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Global inflation could make a comeback as Trump promises to slap up to 60% import tariffs on China and up to 20% from elsewhere. He has also committed to deport illegal immigrants from the country – which could stoke another round of labor shortage in the United States. US interest rates may remain elevated as the resurgent inflation could lead to a slowdown of rate cuts in the US, leading to a stronger greenback against other major currencies. This could mean that global equity flows into the emerging and frontier markets would remain weak. Raising debt through Eurobonds could therefore become difficult for Pakistan. The USD index has appreciated 5% since September, while the US 10-year bond yield has risen to 4.5% from 3.6% by end September – both have risen in anticipation of Trump’s re-election. Global growth could be slower and commodity prices, depressed if Trump administration impose higher import tariffs on China, then growth in China could be undermined (notwithstanding the stimulus measures the Chinese government has recently begun rolling out. This would spell an extended period of down-trending commodity prices and a global oversupply in some key commodities (steel, petrochemicals) and products (EVs). Weak US participation in achieving global climate goals could reverse or slow down the recent trend of multilateral lenders (IMF, WB and ADB) ramping up loans to developing economies for building defense against climate change. Possible implications for Pakistan A decline in global commodity prices would maintain the dis-inflationary trend in Pakistan. However, a fresh wave of global inflation will be felt in Pakistan through a stronger greenback and imported inflation. At this stage, the brokerage house maintains it outlook for average inflation in Pakistan over the next 12 months to be around 9% and expect the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to cut the policy rate up to 11% by June 2025. US-China trade war could make some exports out of Pakistan more competitive in the US, compared to imports from China. These would include HVA textiles, flat steel, tires and cement. However, if PKR-US$ remains stable while other regional currencies depreciate against the greenback, it could undermine the competitiveness of Pakistani exports. Pakistan could see greater Chinese FDI. As Chinese industries would continue to set up facilities outside China to avoid import tariffs, some could potentially be set up in Pakistan. However, for this to happen, Pakistan would have to offer a more stable policy environment to Chinese investors, and the government may have to drop plans to renegotiate the power tariffs of CPEC power plants, in our view.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQHsTEUSXbVxo	2024-11-07T09:09:07-08:00	
India’s Diplomatic Tightrope Act – OpEd	As the era of unipolarity is almost over, major powers as well as the rising powers from across the globe are eyeing to maximize their strategic and diplomatic footprint. International organizations play a critical role in the geopolitical maneuverings. China and the US have global competitiveness while states like India are ogling for regional supremacy. In the same vein, Pakistan amid her huge financial crunch is refurbishing its posture. The 2024 SCO summit, held in Islamabad, marked a pivotal moment in Pakistan's efforts to revitalize its international stature. The summit, attended by heads of state from member countries, underscored Pakistan's diplomatic maneuvering within the region. India was represented by Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, who stood in for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This diplomatic engagement reflects the interplay of state interests in a multilateral setting, reinforcing the notion of 'complex interdependence' as outlined by Keohane and Nye, where states prioritize diplomacy even amid geopolitical tensions. Pakistan has always prioritized promoting an atmosphere where peaceful coexistence is the outcome. This behavior has often negatively affected Pakistan’s interests, but her quest for ensuring global peace has been consistent. Considering regional hostilities, emanating from her western and eastern neighbors it has still relied on diplomatic resolutions rather opting an offensive approach. Amidst ongoing economic challenges and regional instabilities, Pakistan's commitment to multilateralism has allowed it to regain a significant diplomatic foothold. The 2024 SCO summit in Islamabad, attended by key global actors, illustrates this resurgence. Even Indian Prime Minister could not afford bypass the meeting, so he sent Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar on his behalf. Despite expectations that J. Shankar would continue with his typical dig at Pakistan, portraying it as a state sponsoring terrorism the rhetoric was tempered by recent developments. Canada’s expulsion of Indian diplomats implicated in transnational terrorism, a move that undermined India's moral high ground. As reflected in the theory of 'constructivism' in international relations, this turn of events showcases how norms and perceptions are shaped by evolving political dynamics, influencing state behavior on the global stage. Primarily, J. Shankar’s speech at the SCO forum manifests Chanakya Kautiliya’s teachings on hiding true motives and seemingly keeping good intentions. While India projects itself as a champion of multilateralism and peaceful coexistence, it simultaneously pursues strategic autonomy under the aegis of the United States. This duality reflects India's efforts to position itself as a regional hegemon, leveraging its relationship with major powers to evade accountability. The transnational terrorism activities linked to New Delhi underscore this lack of restraint, as India capitalizes on the absence of effective international oversight. J. Shankar in his speech repeatedly focus on 'three evils' terrorism, extremism, separatism that aims to target Pakistan, as it always framed it as a source of cross border terrorism in global forums. Here it aimed to downplay the growing unrest in India where it is faced with active separatist movements in Manipur, Khalistan and Kashmir. Its social fabric is shrinking against religious and ethnic minorities. Since last four years, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom has consistently recommending the US department of State adding India in the list of 'Country of Particular Concern,' owing to the gross violation of human rights against religious minorities, where they have been lynched by vigilante groups their homes and worship places being bulldozed. The laws are discriminatory against minorities such as Citizenship Amendment Act, cow slaughtering laws, etc. and the government officials’ hatred speeches openly call for violence against them. As far as terrorism is concerned, India has been caught red handed in transnational repression where its diplomats along with High Commissioner expelled from Canada for their involvement in transnational terrorism activities in Canadian soil. The US also foiled Indian attempt to kill Sikh activities on American soil. Indian spying network recently caught in Australia, its naval officers were spying in Qatar for Israel. While in Pakistan, Kulbhushan Jhadev, a serving officer of Indian Navy caught for spying and involvement in terrorist activities. RAW was involved in up to 20 assassinations Kashmiri activists in Pakistan in 2020. India being a critical of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) claimed it to be against its territorial integrity and sovereignty. In SCO summit, J. Shankar reiterated the same stance via emphasizing need for cooperation based on sovereignty and territorial integrity aimed at criticizing CPEC project contrary to India itself promoting connectivity to Central Asia. India’s strategic posturing towards the western bloc portrayed in J. Shankar’s speech who promoted multi-polarity & rebalancing in his speech, where India aimed at consolidating its influence through QUAD and other Indo-Pacific initiatives. While on other hand, its strategic alignment with Western bloc excludes China and Russia. Furthermore, his desire to make SCO platform for honest dialogue is unrealistic amid bilateral tension with Pakistan where it is unwilling to engage with Pakistan bilaterally. Although India accepted the invitation to join SCO summit, its reluctance to engage in any bilateral talks with Pakistan was apparent. India attended SCO summit 2024 with a purpose to pursue its strategic objectives in the contesting geopolitical landscape. It tried to portray its anger towards the US and Canada amid its bashing by the formers concerning transnational terrorism. In light of growing concerns about New Delhi’s human rights abuses, it is a challenge for the Modi government to not only refute the charges but also to keep the relations with the West smooth. The delicate balance approach depicts that India wants to garner maximum from both blocs but wants to pursue its hegemonic designs in the region as well.

The Horn Of Africa States: President Trump’s Re-Election And The ...	The Horn of Africa States region has been a significant geopolitical battleground on the world stage since the opening of the Suez Canal in the second half of the nineteenth century. The region’s history, however, indicates that it was always a major economic player connecting Asia to Africa and Europe from Pharaonic times. It still is, as it overlooks one of the major shipping lanes of the world. That it is also the source of the Blue Nile which provides most fresh water to Northeast Africa (Sudan and Egypt) adds to its major geostrategic importance. The closeness to Yemen and hence the Houthi/Iranian/Israeli troubles on the other side of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, further adds to its significance, which is also complicated by the Gulf States dynamics and activities in the region. Its own historical ethnic and religious idiosyncrasies and hence conflicts do not help either. A lot of rhetoric in this regard and 'nationalism' playing foul and fooling tunes only add to the miseries of the populations of the region. It is, therefore, a region which attracts all major powers. In the recent past, it was the communist ex-Soviet Union against the capitalist world. Today it is the West against China and the BRICS crowd. The Iranian/Israeli war and the Palestinian issue also impact the region indirectly because of its location. The Horn of Africa States region is a resource rich region (Read my Article: The Horn Of Africa States: A Resource Rich Region – Op-ed and published in Eurasiareview.com on November 4th, 2024). It has a large youthful population which could both be a labor source with many years of working life ahead of them and a market. It also presents itself as an efficiency manufacturing base because of a cheaper labor cost and it enjoys a large material resource base, involving agriculture, marine and sub-soil. How would the new administration of President Trump affect the region? This is an important question that must have come to the minds of many Horn Africans. We shall attempt in this short article to address our thoughts in this respect. President Trump is a businessman, and his politics follow his acumen in the art of dealing and making business transactions and investments. He will no doubt encourage American businessmen and corporations to be provided with easier access to markets, involving perhaps removal of regulatory barriers. He will no doubt pursue businesses that show investment returns quicker. The region should, therefore, be prepared to attract those American corporations which may help in the extraction of the sub-soil wealth of the region including gold, silver and uranium and/or lithium and copper and cobalt of which the region owns substantial deposits and reserves. American firms could be enticed to invest in the region’s food production for export to regions like the Gulf States, where they could make good returns, but also benefitting the region through the employment of the large youthful population of the region. It would definitely be much better for the region to work with investing corporations and firms instead of NGOs which have been a burden and a plaque on the region or for that matter wait for government aid, which does not add one iota to the development process of any country. This will, of course, require pro-business administrations in the region itself, which emphasize on development instead of personal political preservations. It is not only the governments but also the regional corporations which should benefit from the pro-business administration. We know that President Trump has supported African exports to the United States through the AGOA project or the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Bilateral deals in this respect would be more beneficial for the Horn African exporters than going through multilateral agreements, including transactions through the IMF and the World Bank Group. A growing economic pie in the region would require investments in infrastructure, education, health, and technologies. A sustained resource exploitation and managed well can create the necessary income and hence provide the finances required for developing these projects. Life is a chain where every action is connected to another. This will need the Horn African leadership to manage the resources of the region better and cooperate with those who are interested in investing in the region. Certainly, Trump in his competition with the Chinese will become a better business partner for the region, should the region be willing. On the security front, the Trump administration is isolationist but will continue to defend the interests of the United States anywhere. There should be no doubt about that. While the administration will continue the pressures on terrorism, the United States will be more concerned about the presence of the Chinese in the region. Note the only foreign naval base of China is in Djibouti. With China being Africa’s largest trade Partner at present, the Trump administration may put some countries in the region into diplomatic difficulties, because of their large Chinese footprints. This is, however, to be seen. The Horn of Africa States region, perhaps, needs to take stock of its situation and redefine its path. This will require the countries of the region to revisit their relations and establish cordial and cooperative platforms avoiding the recent interferences in each other’s internal affairs, such as the Ethio-Somali interstate conflict. This issue bedeviled some of those partners who may have wished the conflict to disappear and attracted other actors to the region. Ethiopia should make the first move to make peace as it did instigate the latest problem between Somalia and Ethiopia. A united Horn African dynamic would have helped the region better in negotiating with others and especially with the Trump Administration which prefers straight deals instead of clumsy so-called diplomatic maneuvers which only cause more problems as they are generally built on cheating and lies. This would enable the region to procure fair trade deals on good terms. This would help in reviving the manufacturing businesses of the region such as the clothing, the leather, and the gold industries. The region’s ownership of large reserves of gems and precious stones would have helped it build a successful jewellery industries both for local consumption and for exports. It may also build on a thriving tourism industry. Perhaps a Trump Tower in one of the beautiful beaches of the region would help, where a significant mobile tourist population from Europe and the Americas can descend on those currently empty beaches and enjoy the beautiful sun and sand of the region and this will be copied by other tourism companies worldwide. America’s oil corporations have been in the region for nearly a century, and they certainly own concessions signed with previous governments of the region, which are currently under force majeure clauses. These could be re-invigorated, which would add to the wealth of these corporations and the region. The Trump Administration would love to see deals in this respect, noting that the Horn of Africa is the last oil and gas frontier in the world. This would put his administration as the American Administration which drilled first oil and gas in the region. Now that President Trump is back, we shall see how the region will dance with the shift in American politics. It is certain that he will work for American interests, but how this will affect the region will have to be seen. We see opportunities for both the United States and the Horn of Africa region, and we hope they will work together for mutual benefits.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQJYgsT78IPbW	2024-11-07T09:06:05-08:00	
Lessons Learned From The 2024 US Presidential Election – OpEd	The 2024 U.S. presidential election has sparked many discussions on the evolving political landscape and the key issues that influenced voters. Reflecting on these results reveals several crucial lessons for future campaigns and governance. 1. Challenges for Black Female Candidates: Despite increasing representation and visibility of women and minorities in politics, the 2024 election illustrated the persistent challenges Black female candidates face in reaching the highest office. Structural barriers, implicit biases, and the need for broader voter outreach are issues that continue to shape electoral success. Future efforts must focus on fostering a more inclusive political environment to break down these longstanding obstacles. 2. Immigration and Asylum Policies: Immigration, especially regarding asylum seekers, remains a hot-button issue. Calls for stricter policies, including deportations, resonated with a significant portion of voters. The outcome suggests a growing consensus for a more controlled approach to immigration, yet it also highlights the need for humane policies that balance security with compassion. 3. The Dominance of Economic Concerns: Once again, the economy proved central to voters’ decisions. Rising costs, job security, and income inequality were top concerns. The phrase, 'It’s the economy, stupid,' held true, reinforcing the idea that economic policies that directly improve citizens’ daily lives are crucial for gaining voter support. 4. Skepticism Towards Media and Polling: This election underscored a deepening distrust in mainstream media and polling, as many voters felt misrepresented by the narratives these sources projected. Future campaigns may need to reconsider their reliance on traditional media outlets and polling data, focusing instead on direct communication with voters through digital platforms and community outreach. 5. Caution on Foreign Policy and Military Involvement: Lastly, voters expressed a clear preference for avoiding involvement in global conflicts. The outcome suggests a shift towards prioritizing domestic concerns over international entanglements, signaling a public weariness with prolonged military engagements abroad. Future administrations may face pressure to adopt a more restrained and diplomacy-focused foreign policy. The 2024 USA election provided a strong mandate on key issues like representation, economic priorities, immigration, media trust, and foreign policy restraint. These insights will shape political strategies and policies moving forward, guiding candidates to address the evolving expectations of the American electorate.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQLTlHaSdsw7b	2024-11-07T09:04:31-08:00	
Biden Lost Against Trump, Not Kamala – OpEd	Convinced as I am that there are some very positive aspects of Trump's election, economy and foreign policy, I believe that this is where we need to start to be able to say, as I believe I can say, that Kamala Harris did not lose the 2024 election but Joe Biden did. Superficial commentators on the election results miss some things. 1- Biden when he declared he was giving up competing said that his resignation did not depend on health reasons. If the President says so - paraphrasing Shakespeare,- we must believe him, because the President is a man of honor. And this cannot be questioned. 2. But if the responsibility for the withdrawal was not health, then it was the polls. But then the President should have resigned to cut the umbilical cord that unified Kamala's image to his, leaving her free to decide her own electoral program without overlaps, which were already clearly losing. That was not the case. Biden remained on the political scene as President, and Kamala was unable to express her own political campaign. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (German: Im Westen nichts Neues,) by Erich Maria Remarque is the case: 'Nothing new on the Democratic electoral front, one might say in relation to Biden’s replacement with Kamala. Voters are not stupid. They understood it. Why would they have changed their preference of Trump for that of Kamala Harris-Biden? If there were no changes there was no reason to do so, and no one did. And this is what the 'I told you so' style commentators miss. Biden gave up competing but continued to occupy the political scene as President. He spoke about the economy, attended meetings (see the leader of Israel and Ukraine), with his cumbersome presence he superimposed his image on that of Kamala, preventing her from expressing her own differentiated political proposal if any. What is the difference between Biden and Kamala? asks the American voter. None. It is only natural that Kamala's negative vote would have reflected and confirmed that of Biden's negative polls. In the image of future voters, differentiating Biden from Harris was impossible. Kamala was a junior version of Biden. It is only obvious that if there were no differences, the results would have been the same. And so it was. So that what i say does not seem like hindsight considerations, taking advantage of the hospitality of this magazine on more than one occasion I have written a- that Biden having withdrawn from the electoral campaign should have resigned as President b. Kamala should have differentiated herself from the fundamental principles of Biden's campaign to demonstrate to voters that she was not a copy of Biden but an autonomous candidate, but to do so Biden should have resigned as President. c. I suggested that in foreign policy and economics it was more important than ever for Kamala to indicate to Americans that there were substantial differences with Biden's policies. The Democratic general staff made a fundamental mistake. Candidate Kamala Harris should need to express a personal electoral strategy copying Biden she would loose. And for Biden resignation there were two cases. If health reasons justified his withdrawal, he should have resigned as President. If they were not health reasons but polls, the electoral campaign should have distanced itself from Biden thanx to his resignation. This did not happen. Kamala, also due to a natural dependence as vice president for four years, continued to slavishly follow Biden's same path. The leveling out in foreign policy and the failure to address the problem of inflation were sensational. It is therefore no surprise that Kamala's election results have reaffirmed exactly Biden's bad polls, something that the hasty 'I told you so' commentators fail to grasp. Biden's continued presence on the political scene has prevented voters from forming their own idea of ​​the candidate - PERSONAL AND DIFFERENT - In fact, the American voter took it for granted that he would continue Biden's policies. and Biden's continued presidential activity has confirmed this. Biden failed in the polls. Kamala failed in the votes. Biden, it has been written several times in articles hosted by this newspaper, should have resigned to leave the Democratic candidate free to express her presidential visions. This was not the case - For the common voter, given Biden's continued presence, Kamala was a minor electoral double of Biden. That said, Mr. Trump, in some economics and foreign policy, for what you have declared, I personally completely agree, they are good for America and for the world. But there must be no doubt: you defeated Biden. In conclusion. Kamala was sent to the slaughter to correct a losing situation, but she was not given the margins to correct. Biden lost the elections, not Kamala.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfJpC25WbjzQHaW42jO4oa7	2024-11-07T09:03:12-08:00	
Narrative Intelligence: Detecting Chinese And Russian Information...	By Joe Stradinger (FPRI) -- As geopolitical conflicts are increasingly shaped by misleading and deceptive information, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) has become an indispensable tool in understanding adversarial information operations and being able to compete in the information environment. Noting the value of OSINT, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) recently published a framework for the intelligence community to leverage commercially available information. Competition in the information environment among major powers is not new or unique. Today, Russia and China strategically employ information operations as part of their attempts to undermine US interests. China has actively used information operations to generate favorable strategic outcomes in Africa. Russian and Chinese messaging is also aligned in exploiting how the Israel-Hamas conflict is characterized. In this competition space, the distinction between signal and noise is more heightened than ever. As the volume of data increases, so does the challenge of identifying what matters — the relevant information that can be synthesized into actionable intelligence. This makes OSINT crucial for tracking and analyzing security threats as well as for monitoring the ebb and flow of online narratives that can influence public opinion and shape national security policy. Derived primarily from online content published by malign actors, narrative intelligence (NARINT) is an increasingly critical tool of OSINT analysis. It refers to the study and analysis of disinformation and propaganda surfaced on social media platforms, news sites, internet forums, blogs, and the dark web. By thoroughly assessing these materials, analysts can gain a clearer understanding of the narrative tactics foreign entities are using to create hostile divisions and erode basic trust in the nation’s institutions. NARINT is particularly critical to detect, analyze, and compete against adversarial information operations that attempt to undermine US national security interests. It can parse through news, blogs, forums, social media, the dark web, digital broadcasts, and other sources to provide insights that are critical for early indications and warnings. Moreover, it can show how narratives shift and affect public sentiments and opinions about conflicts. Fig. 1: Examples of Russian and Russia-aligned sources amplifying articles about internal division within NATO over its support of Ukraine. We can illustrate all this by examining how Russia and China have employed sophisticated information operations to manufacture and amplify divisions about how NATO members support Ukraine against the Russian invasion. Figure 1 shows how AI-powered content aggregation and enrichment can detect and surface Russia-aligned sources amplifying and propagating narratives about internal division within NATO. We can see how Russia has strategically employed information operations to exploit and amplify divisions between NATO members. For instance, Russia has amplified narratives of dissent and disagreement among NATO allies over military aid, economic sanctions, and long-term strategy in Ukraine. Russia attempts to weaken the unified front that has been instrumental in countering its advances. Fig. 2: Theme tracing locates media items that contain similar thematic emphasis, and places them along a timeline with SCAME-rich information about the sources amplifying them. China has emerged as an opportunistic supporter of Russia’s information operations, amplifying Russian narratives that serve both nations’ interests in diminishing Western influence. Figure 2 shows how Chinese state media, other official platforms, and their affiliates often echo Russian positions on the conflict, presenting a united front that undermines Western policies. The alignment of Chinese support with Russian information operations intensifies the challenge for NATO to maintain a cohesive strategy and public support for Ukraine. It also undermines popular support for NATO’s efforts by creating the impression that the bloc is rife with internecine dissent, and too disorganized to unite effectively around its support of Ukraine. Figure 3 illustrates a theme trace from 11 May to 20 May 2024 that shows how Chinese outlets amplify similar stories to Russian propaganda. Fig. 3: AI-powered text vectorization allows analysts to search for articles that amplify similar themes, and track the spread and evolution of narratives over time. Given the volume of content on social media, it’s impossible to be comprehensive, but the evidence speaks for itself. According to one study, nearly 20% of all search results on TikTok lead to some form of disinformation. In one recent survey, 65% of users said they had encountered some form of disinformation on TikTok. Those who push false narratives tend to package them in such a way as to manipulate audience emotion, meaning relatively small volumes of fake news items often gain considerably more traction than legitimate coverage. Online audiences, it seems, prefer galvanizing disinformation and confirmation bias over more objective news, which they often find ‘boring.’ On Telegram, the situation may be even more dire. A 2020 study conducted at Oxford University claimed that 'Out of the top dozen news sources examined, 33% of all views go to junk news sources.' Given that Telegram has over 400 million users worldwide, its significance as a source of disinformation isn’t in doubt. It doesn’t help that consumers of junk news tend to be considerably more engaged than mainstream news audiences, meaning they are far more inclined to amplify false narratives than others are to share valid ones. And with much of Telegram’s content originating in Russia and Iran, it seems likely that the amount of disinformation on the platform will only increase over time. As noted above though, social media is not the only means by which malign actors distribute propaganda and disinformation. They also rely on state-run media outlets, as well as proxy publications that operate independently but contribute to official narratives all the same. A cluster of Russian newspapers has been working to deepen the tension between NATO members over how best to aid Ukraine. These include TASS, Sputnik, and RT (formerly Russia Today). Assisting them in this effort are various other entities, among them South Front News, Global Times, and The People’s Voice. In addition to social media and news sites, malign actors often employ other means for pushing false narratives. One of these include internet forum sites, such as Reddit, where anonymous manipulators sometimes make false claims in the hopes of garnering engagement from other users. Beyond online forums, there are also a number of video-sharing sites that manipulators use to spread disinformation. The best-known of these is YouTube, but Odysee and the Canadian-based site Rumble are frequently used as repositories of false propaganda as well. A number of entities have used these and similar sites to push the theme of disunity between the US and the EU over how best to aid and equip Ukraine. One such entity, the Hindustan Times, an Indian-based news outlet, often amplifies pro-Kremlin narratives. In mid-April it published a video reporting on a disagreement between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne. In approximately one month’s time, the story has garnered 35,000 views and 185 comments. Similarly, the India-based Firstpost, also a Russia-friendly publication, posted an item in mid-2023 depicting a bitter divide between the EU and NATO over the same question. One year later, it has garnered 872,000 views, 14,000 positive reactions, and 5,973 comments. Russia leverages a broad network of media outlets — often spearheaded by state-controlled media entities — to disseminate targeted misinformation and disinformation aimed at political groups within NATO countries. These efforts are designed to stoke anti-war sentiment by emphasizing the human and financial costs of the conflict. By magnifying isolated incidents of friction among NATO allies, such as disputes over the levels of military aid or the enforcement of sanctions, Russia attempts to foster a narrative of disunity and inefficiency. The Kremlin’s aims appear to be to weaken international resolve and try to diminish domestic support for Ukraine within these countries, thereby obstructing the collective defensive measures critical to Ukraine’s resistance against the Russian invasion. Fig. 4: Narrative mapping can show geographic locations of amplifiers, and the targets of the narrative items they’re amplifying. This narrative shows Russian and Russian-aligned influencers amplifying articles about internal division within NATO over its support of Ukraine. Russia has recently amplified a narrative claiming that Volodymyr Zelensky is no longer the legitimate president of Ukraine. Using georeferencing and enriching metadata, we entered a simple description of the claim — 'Zelensky no longer legitimate president of Ukraine' — and the system’s vector analysis techniques initially surfaced over 450 narrative items. Figure 5 illustrates how these AI models can rapidly surface and visualize who is amplifying this false narrative and how they are aligned over time. Adjusting the narratives’ similarity threshold to 84.7% (a relatively tight setting), we zeroed in on 89 items containing thematically similar content. Predictably, the amplifiers were predominantly Russian and Russia-aligned publications, but no small percentage of them are from Australia and Canada, and are not publishers at all but rather sources active on social media who are more akin to 'influencers,' an indication that Russia understands the importance of having western social media users co-amplify the narratives pushed out by the Kremlin and its state media mouthpieces. Fig. 5: A vector-based theme trace on the Russian-generated narrative that Volodomyr Zelensky is not the legitimate president of Ukraine reveals dozens of items published by Russian state media outlets, and amplified by a number of social media influencers, including a number from Australia and Canada. As strategic competition continues to intensify, the necessity of detecting and understanding adversarial narratives has never been more critical. Information warfare does not pause or discriminate. Russia and China are both adept at crafting and rapidly propagating narratives that promote their national interests and undermine those of their rivals, but based on the past few years’ analysis of their respective efforts, there are, generally speaking, some noticeable differences between Russian disinformation campaigns versus their Chinese counterparts. From what we see, Russian disinformation campaigns are sometimes coordinated by the Kremlin and pushed downward through state media outlets. Sometimes these campaigns are amplified by media-savvy oligarchs networks, members of which range from organizations behaving much like small- to medium-sized media outlets, to individuals operating inside Russia, throughout Europe, and often in the US and Canada. The Kremlin appears to leverage loosely coordinated networks The Kremlin and the oligarch media appear to work together. Sometimes oligarch media put their own spin on the official Kremlin line, simultaneously amplifying it while getting their own message out in the process. Russian information operations show a generally higher level of familiarity with US culture, regional differences, and political factions, leading to more effective content that typically resonates better with their target audiences. Like Russia, the Chinese government also pushes its disinformation campaigns downward through its state media outlets and affiliates, but absent the kind of oligarch media network in Russia, its content appears more centrally controlled by the upper echelons of the CCP media apparatus. However, China has begun to leverage regional and local outlets to amplify its messages. For the time being, China does not seem to have the familiarity with, or depth of understanding of, US culture as their Russian counterparts, which further hampers their campaigns’ effectiveness. That said, the effectiveness of these campaigns in shaping international perception and influencing policy decisions should not be underestimated. Developing robust mechanisms to identify and counter these narratives is crucial for maintaining strategic advantage and ensuring national security. The integration of AI into these endeavors significantly enhances intelligence capabilities. AI-based technologies can analyze vast amounts of data, detecting patterns and shifts in narratives at scale and at speeds that far surpass the capacity of human analysts, and with a degree of accuracy that continues to improve extremely rapidly. By employing AI-driven tools, intelligence professionals can quickly identify emerging adversarial narratives, assess their potential impact, and alert decision-makers in real-time. This approach allows for timely and informed responses, enabling the discovery of aligned narratives and actors and the crafting of effective aligned narratives that support US interests. Narrative intelligence that combines comprehensive publicly-available information with AI has become critical to effective competition in the information environment. Given how malign actors exploit the openness of the information environment, it is imperative that the US leverage OSINT and AI to compete in the cognitive domain. Narrative intelligence plays a critical role in enabling first-move advantage in the information environment.

The Price Of Eggs: Why Harris Lost To Trump – OpEd	It takes some skill to make Donald J. Trump look good. Two Democrats have succeeded in doing so: Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Kamala Harris in 2024. The conceit of both presidential campaigns, and the belief that attacking a staggeringly grotesque moral character for being such, was laughable. (When a Clinton mocks groping philanderers and creepy molesters, one must reach for, well, the Starr Report?) In certain countries, abominating and execrating your political adversary for being a moral defective might work. In the United States, such figures can draw benefit from being outside the constraints of law-abiding society. They are quite literally outlaw spirits that still speak of that nebulous notion called the American Dream while encouraging everyone else to come for the ride. Realising it involves treading on toes and breaking a few skulls on the way, but that’s the expectation. From the start, the Democrats had tied themselves in knots by convincing President Joe Biden that he could not only last the tenure of his office but run against Trump. Doing so, and deriding those wishing to see a change in the guard, created a needless handicap. Throughout late 2023 and early 2024, it became clear that the party worthies were doing their best to shield Biden’s cognitive decline. The sham was cruelly exposed in the June 27 debate with Trump. Panic struck the ranks. With little time to regroup, Vice President Harris was close at hand, selected by Biden as the appropriate choice. But Harris landed with a punctured parachute weighed down by the crown of presumptive nomination. There were to be no opponents (the 2016 challenge of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton which annoyed the party mandarins would not be repeated), no primaries, no effective airing of any challenge. It was easy to forget – at least for many Democrats – that Harris’s 2019 bid for the nomination had been spectacularly poor and costly. An ailing president would also keep his occupancy in the White House, rather than resigning and giving Harris some seat warming preparation. While the change caused the inevitable rush of optimism, it soon became clear that the ghost of Hillary’s past had been working its demonic magic. The Harris campaign was unadventurous and safe. All too often, the vice president hoped that messages would reach the outer reaches of the electorate from cocooned comfort, helped by a war chest of fundraising that broke records ($1 billion in less than three months), and a battalion of cheerleading celebrities that suggested electoral estrangement rather than connection. Then there was the problem as to what those messages were. These, in the end, did not veer much beyond attacking Trump as a threat to democracy, women’s rights and reproductive freedoms. They tended to remain unclear on the issue of economics. From foreign to domestic policy, Harris failed to distinguish herself as one able to depart from the Biden program in her own right. Instead, it was hoped that some organic coalition of anti-Trump Republicans, independents, Black voters, women and American youth would somehow materialise at the ballot box. In a September 16 meeting with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, longtime allies of the Democratic Party, Harris failed to convince its leaders that she would protect the livelihood and jobs of workers better than Trump. Within a matter of days, the union publicly revealed that it would not be endorsing Harris as Democratic presidential candidate, the first since 1996. Her interviews were minimal, her exposure to the outside treated with utmost delicacy. The Republicans, on the other hand, were willing to get their hands dirty with an extensive ground campaign that yielded electoral rewards in such battleground states as Pennsylvania. The Early Vote Action effort of conservative activist Scott Presler proved impressive in encouraging voter registration and increasing absentee and early vote counts. His efforts in securing votes for Trump from Pennsylvania’s Amish community were strikingly successful. Trump, in sharp contrast to his opponent, was so exposed to the point of being a potential assassination target on two occasions. He showed the electorate he was worth the tag. He personalised with moronic panache. He babbled and raged, and made sure he, as he always does, dominated the narrative. Alternative media outlets were courted. Most of all, he focused on the breadbasket issues: the cost of groceries, housing and fuel; the perceived terrors of having a lax border policy. He also appealed to voters content with reining in the war making instincts so natural to Harris and neoconservatives on both sides of the aisle. Fundamentally, the Democrats fell for the old trick of attacking Trump’s demagogy rather than teasing out their own policies. The Fascist cometh. The inner Nazi rises. Misogyny rampant. Racism throbbing. This came with the inevitable belittling of voters. You cast your ballot for him, you are either an idiot, a fascist, or both. Oh, and he was just weird, said the unknown and already forgotten ear-scratching Democrat vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, whatever that means in a land where weird is so frequent as to make it its most endearing quality. It is remarkable that Trump, a convicted felon, twice impeached in office, a person so detached from the empirical, the logical, and the half-decent, would be electable in the first place. Even more remarkable is that such a figure has won both the Electoral College and the popular vote. The glorious Republic likes its show and treats elections like marketing exercises. Its defenders often pretend that those reaching its highest office are not mirrors but transcendent figures to emulate. Trump – in all his cocksure hustling and slipshod approach to regulation and convention – shows many in the electorate that the defect and the defective can go far. A few final lessons. The Democrats would do best to listen to those who would otherwise vote for them. Focus on the economy. Talk about the price of eggs and milk. Ditch the lexicon on ill-defined terms of supposedly useful criticism such as fascism, a word the users almost always misunderstand. And always be careful about pundits and pollsters who predict razor small margins in elections. Polls, and people, lie.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy2TOWeedvPHp	2024-11-06T17:25:07-08:00	
India And China Vie For Leadership Of Global South – Analysis	By Ronak Gopaldas The rivalry between China and India, both BRICS members, extends to their bid to lead the global south. As Western dominance wanes, both Beijing and New Delhi are advancing distinct yet globally influential agendas, each leveraging unique strengths that shape global alliances and institutions. For African nations, where development and decision-making sovereignty are key, the choice between China and India as global south leaders is significant. Each offers advantages and challenges with implications for Africa’s future. Although neither has officially declared a bid for this leadership, their actions and statements signal intent. India’s role in pushing for south-south cooperation at forums like the G20, and advocating for more equitable representation in global governance, align with its leadership vision. China’s assertive diplomacy, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and its increasing investments in African and Latin American infrastructure projects, highlights a claim to leadership rooted in economic influence. The rivalry is stoked by narratives in each country’s foreign policy community and think tanks, which see India’s democratic alignment and China’s developmental success as competing models for the global south. Officially, both countries underscore their solidarity with developing nations but avoid overt declarations of competition, instead positioning their respective approaches as solutions to developing countries’ needs. India, as the world’s largest democracy, resonates strongly in Africa, where democratic governance is often seen as a path to stability and growth. India’s commitment to democratic values and its policy of non-interference align well with Africa’s emphasis on political sovereignty and diversity. Many African nations also share historical ties with India, rooted in the Non-Aligned Movement and anti-colonial solidarity, which reinforce India’s appeal as a trusted partner. This is further strengthened by the influential role of the Indian diaspora in Africa. China’s strength in infrastructure and financial investment provides immediate support India’s development approach centres on human capital and technology transfer, often through private sector initiatives. This model, focused on skills building, matches Africa’s need for sustainable, locally adaptable solutions. India’s experiences with its own diverse population enable it to respond effectively to Africa’s varied needs. Through public-private partnerships, India has achieved progress in healthcare, education and digital access, which could provide scalable models for African countries facing similar challenges. On the global stage, India has played a leading role in minilateral and multilateral groupings like the Quad and G20, and by fostering ties with the United States, Europe and BRICS countries. India’s role as a bridge between the global north and south has proven advantageous, as seen in its push to include the African Union in the G20. India’s assertive stance on issues like the Ukraine conflict has also resonated with African nations seeking an independent global voice. This context has bolstered India’s standing in the global south, with African countries increasingly viewing India as representing their collective interests. India’s ability to balance relations with both Western and non-Western powers appeals to African nations navigating similarly complex geopolitics. However, India’s limited financial resources compared to China, pose challenges in scaling its influence across Africa. Domestic issues like poverty alleviation and infrastructure development may further limit India’s capacity to prioritise Africa consistently. The lack of an India-Africa Forum Summit since 2015 also raises questions about India’s long-term commitment. India’s focus on skills, technology transfer and democratic governance provides for long-term growth China’s economic might makes it a compelling global south leader, especially through its infrastructure projects that meet urgent needs. Africa’s vast infrastructure deficit – in transport, energy and telecommunications – finds an eager partner in China’s BRI, which has made a visible impact across the continent. BRI projects help African economies integrate with global trade routes, enhancing export potential and fostering regional connections. China’s achievements in poverty reduction – viewed by many African countries as a model for economic transformation – add to its appeal. China’s stance on non-interference aligns with African leaders’ preference for sovereignty, and African countries wary of Western conditionalities often find China’s approach refreshing. Further, China’s creation of alternative global institutions – such as the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative – presents African nations with options beyond Western-led frameworks, appealing to those who seek diverse partnerships. China’s technological prowess, particularly in 5G, digital payments and artificial intelligence, offers transformative potential for African economies. The country’s involvement in telecommunications provides affordable digital infrastructure necessary for economic development. However, China’s authoritarian government raises concerns among Africa’s democratic nations, and financial dependency on China has cast a shadow on its image. Transparency issues, contentious labour practices, and the environmental impacts of large-scale projects have also sparked criticism. These factors lead some African leaders to question whether China’s transactional approach aligns with their long-term goals. China’s reputation is also affected by controversies around COVID-19, espionage allegations and assertive foreign policies, potentially diminishing its appeal as a global south leader. By engaging both, Africa can build a diversified development approach that minimises dependency on one partner Some argue that China’s inclusion in the global south is convenient but contrived, compromising its leadership credibility. Critics point to China’s high GDP, robust trade, investments and military power, which align more with great power status than the global south. Beijing, however, maintains that solidarity with developing countries is the foundation of its foreign relations. For Africa, the choice between China and India as global south leaders depends on the continent’s priorities and values. India’s democratic credentials, development model and trust-based partnerships are appealing, as is its growing role as a bridge-builder between north and south, especially among African countries seeking sovereignty in their partnerships. Conversely, China’s financial strength, rapid infrastructure development, and non-interference approach make it a vital partner, particularly for nations facing immediate development needs. Yet concerns about debt sustainability and China’s authoritative approach limit its appeal as a long-term leader. Ultimately, the choice need not be one or the other – both offer complementary roles that African countries can strategically leverage. China’s strength in large-scale infrastructure and financial investment provides immediate, transformative support. Meanwhile, India’s focus on capacity building, technology transfer, and democratic governance offers a pathway to sustainable, locally adaptable long-term growth. The recent rapprochement between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit could be a positive sign – though analysts remain sceptical given the substantive tensions. A more cooperative relationship could allow BRICS to consistently support Africa, addressing infrastructure and human capital development while promoting a more cohesive global south. By engaging with both China and India, Africa can build a balanced, diversified approach to development that minimises dependency on a single partner. This dual engagement allows African nations to draw on China’s resources to meet urgent infrastructure needs while benefitting from India’s people-centred initiatives that foster skills and independence. In doing so, Africa can assert its agency on the global stage, using the strengths of both to advance its interests.

A Disenchanted Japan Punishes The LDP – Analysis	By Kuniaki Nemoto Japan’s House of Representatives election on 27 October resulted in a hung parliament. Having ruled Japan since 2012, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lost 68 seats, winning only 191. For the first time in 15 years, it failed to win the 233 seats required for a majority. The LDP’s long-term coalition partner, Komeito, also saw its seat count drop to 24, with the surprising defeat of its party leader. With a combined seat count of only 215, the LDP–Komeito coalition is short of the majority required to stay in power. Most of Japan’s fractured opposition is gaining momentum. The largest winner is the centre-left Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), with 148 seats — an increase of 52 seats. The centrist Democratic Party for the People (DPFP) quadrupled its seat count to 28. The Japan Innovation Party (Ishin), a right-wing regional party based in Osaka, secured 38 seats. Minor leftist parties retained their Diet presence, with Reiwa Shinsengumi and the Japanese Communist Party holding nine and eight seats, respectively. Two scandals drove voters’ punishment of the LDP. The first is the LDP’s collusion and close relationship with the controversial Unification Church, which was revealed after the assassination of the former prime minister Shinzo Abe. According to police investigations of Abe’s assassin, the Unification Church, which was closely associated with Abe, financially ruined the assassin’s family. Some ministers tied to the Unification Church were sacked and the government initiated the church’s dissolution process. Yet the LDP failed to do anything beyond disclosing a list of 121 members with some ties to the church. The second scandal related to misconduct surrounding the financing of the LDP’s internal factions. Many LDP members, especially members from Abe’s faction and the former LDP Secretary-General Nikai’s faction, did not report revenues from their factions’ fundraising parties in their financial reports. They then received these revenues as kickbacks as secret funds. The Abe faction, one of the largest factions inside the LDP, distributed 675 million yen to its members between 2018 and 2022. Prosecutors failed to indict most of the suspects though, since they could not find evidence and factions shifted the blame to their treasurers. Japanese citizens considered the long-ruling party’s reaction as lukewarm at best, as suggested by former prime minister Fumio Kishida’s plummeting approval rating. The LDP’s Party Ethics Committee decided to punish a mere 39 members, even though over 80 members were involved in the slush-fund scandal. The parliament held a Council on Political Ethics to question LDP members, but only 10 members appeared, since attendance is voluntary. Even those who attended offered no satisfactory answers. The Diet passed a revised Political Funds Control Act to increase transparency, despite the opposition’s criticism that it was insufficient. As a very unpopular Kishida finally decided to give up his party’s leadership, the LDP chose to hold a new party leader election — likely in an attempt to call a snap election when its new leader’s popularity was high. Nine candidates scrambled for the election, though no candidate was willing to restart a thorough investigation into the slush fund scandal. The Unification Church issue did not get wide attention, either. The newly elected LDP leader, Shigeru Ishiba, decided not to give LDP endorsements to 12 scandal-tainted politicians in order to regain the public’s trust in the party. In addition, though the LDP endorsed other scandal-hit members on their single-member district contests, it decided to ban dual candidacies. These moves did not help Ishiba’s popularity, with his approval rating falling to below 30 per cent a week prior to election day. A final blow to the LDP came just days before the end of the campaign. Akahata, the daily newspaper of the Japanese Communist Party, scooped the fact that the LDP allocated 20 million yen to local party chapters headed by LDP members, including ones running without LDP endorsements. Opposition parties heavily criticised this as covertly supporting scandal-hit members. On 27 October — voting day — the disenchanted public’s reaction against the LDP was harsh. For Ishiba to stay in power, he must win the upcoming prime ministerial nomination in a soon-to-be-held special Diet session. Ishiba may not be able to secure a majority of votes in the first round of the nomination, given the hung parliament. Former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, the newly elected leader of the main opposition CDP, quite ambitiously sought government turnover by attracting the other opposition parties. But as the DPFP and Ishin decided not to vote for Noda, the CDP leader does not seem to have sufficient headcounts, either. The prime ministerial nomination is then likely to move on to the second run-off round for the first time in 30 years. Since only a plurality of votes is required in the run-off, Ishiba seems to be better positioned for now. No matter who becomes Japan’s leader, the situation will be difficult and uncertain — any coalition will likely be a minority government that faces the constant risk of a no-confidence motion. Turbulent times await. About the author: Kuniaki Nemoto is Professor of Political Science at the Department of Economics, Musashi University.

To ‘Save Democracy,’ Facebook Bans ‘Dictator’ – OpEd	Facebook notified me on Sunday morning that eight years ago, I posted a link to my Washington Times article warning of Dictatorial Democracy regardless of whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump won the 2016 election. The opening sentence set the tone: 'The 2016 election campaign is mortifying millions of Americans in part because the presidency has become far more dangerous in recent times.' Facebook always gives users the option to 'Share a Memory' link. I tapped the button to automatically send a notice on 'Dictatorial Democracy' to all my Facebook friends and followers. No such luck: Facebook notified me that they had banned sharing the piece because it violated Facebook 'Community Standards.' Maybe if I had simply howled about one of the current presidential candidates being Hitler, that would have satisfied Facebook‘s Community Standards? Facebook chief Zuckerberg recently admitted that his company massively censored Americans at federal command during covid and other times. Is suppressing any mention of dictatorship a policy designed to placate federal overseers? Or are Facebook‘s Community Standards guardians really as dumb as Tim Walz? Why was mentioning 'dictatorial democracy' acceptable in 2016 but forbidden in 2024? After Facebook blocked my repost of the Dictatorial Democracy piece, I posted the above photo mocking their decision. Facebook banned the photo, too. Facebook permitted me to request a review of that ban. The response offered a multiple choice menu of protests. I was disappointed there was not a 'You people are boneheads' option. Their 'review' process seemed as vapid as their original decree: And how does the process work? Facebook‘s AI software checks to confirm the initial decision by Facebook AI to ban a post. I sit on the edge of my chair, awaiting the verdict from Facebook software. Actually, I thrashed Facebook seven years ago in USA Today for suppressing a post I did about FBI atrocities at Waco, Texas in 1993. That piece noted the Waco fire image was not the first time that Facebook erased an iconic image that the U.S. government would be happy to see vanish. Facebook likely deleted thousands of postings of the 1972 photo of a young South Vietnamese girl running naked after a plane dropped napalm on her village. After coming under severe criticism last year, Facebook announced that it would no longer suppress that image. But Facebook was already shamelessly craven to foreign governments, including Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, and India. I warned that Facebook’s 'nonchalance about engaging in the electronic equivalent of book burning abroad' signaled that the company could do the same here. Actually, the Dictatorial Democracy ban might not be the most inane ruling I have seen from Facebook this year. In June, they blocked my posting a link to a Future of Freedom Foundation podcast because it contained the cover image of my new book, Last Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty. Facebook claimed my post violated 'community standards' because it was spam. How could it be spam if it was clearly labeled and including a video and link from a reputable organization—well, at least reputable to libertarians, anarchists, and hooligans? Facebook notified me that I could appeal their ruling. Fine—I can explain their blunder in three sentences. No such option. Instead, they offered a series of pages where I could check a box that looked like it was designed for kindergarten. 'It’s not offensive in my region'—ya, that‘s a great option to sway the Facebook Content Moderation Police in Manila. I am pretty sure that the Facebook Appellate Division never sent me their verdict on this content. Looking at that strikedown of my book cover, I wondered: Has Facebook gone full Idiocracy? Or maybe that already happened during covid? Facebook placated the Biden White House by promising to delete any posts or comments that suggested 'COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured'—even though federal agencies now admit that the virus likely came out of a US government-funded lab in Wuhan. On March 21, 2021, White House Director of Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty notified Facebook that suppressing false information on COVID was not enough. A Facebook official assured the White House that Facebook was also suppressing 'often-true content' that might discourage people from getting vaccinated. White House officials even ordered Facebook to delete humorous memes, including a parody of a future television ad: 'Did you or a loved one take the COVID vaccine? You may be entitled…' President Biden denounced Facebook for killing people because it did not mindlessly repeat the Party Line on covid. In June 2023, Zuckerberg admitted that the feds 'asked for a bunch of things to be censored that, in retrospect, ended up being more debatable or true. That stuff…really undermines trust.' A few weeks after Zuckerberg‘s comment, Federal Judge Terry Doughty ruled that the White House and federal agencies 'engaged in coercion of social media companies to such extent that the decisions of the social media companies should be deemed that of the Government.' Doughty slammed the Biden administration for committing potentially 'the most massive attack against free speech in United States history.' Unfortunately, condemnations of federal censorship by federal judges apparently did nothing to put starch into Facebook‘s spine. Or maybe Facebook would massively censor its users even if it didn’t expect any rewards from Washington? On August 27, Zuckerberg sent a letter to a congressional committee stating that 'senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured' Facebook to censor content. Zuckerberg regretted that his company cowered, more or less: 'I regret that we were not more outspoken about it.... We made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn’t make today.' But Zuck promised that Facebook would 'not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any Administration' in the future. So we should trust that Facebook will not again become a willing executioner of Americans‘ freedom of speech, except for any references to 'dictator' that might discomfit people. My 2016 piece declared, 'The United States may be on the verge of the biggest legitimacy crisis since the Civil War.' That legitimacy crisis has worsened over the past two presidential terms. But at least Facebook will be here to assure we never run out of cute kitty photos.

Grassroots Roles The Only Way To Shift US Middle East Policy – Op...	History tells us that US presidential election results mean little in terms of how the country deals with two key audiences: the Middle East, including its current and future conflicts, and the role of Arabs in America. No matter the outcome of votes like this week’s, American policy will continue to follow the same path, although it may be more nuanced and have a different tenor and tone. While the conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon and Iran are being fueled by billions of American dollars, the actual policies are being driven by Israel’s government. And in American politics, Israel enjoys Teflon-like protection from major change. Republican Donald Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s presidential election will be little more than a news story and a subject of discussion for the pundits. Meanwhile, the Israeli genocide in Gaza will not stop until Israel wants it to stop. And Israel will also decide how far it will go in its wars with Lebanon and Iran. As for Arabs in America, there will be a lot of pictures and smiles with the winning candidate. A lot of back-slapping. And maybe some jobs and appointments for some Arabs and Muslims. But this does not mean there will be a change in American foreign policy or any enhancement in their engagement with government. Fundamentally, the US’ Middle East policy did not change the last time Trump was president between 2017 and 2021. There was no recognition of a Palestinian state or easing of support for Israel. Accords were signed with several Arab countries that sought American financial or diplomatic assistance. America’s support for Israel in the UN Security Council is rock solid and the US ambassador to the organization, regardless of who holds the seat, will continue to veto any resolution that tries to significantly change the path Israel is currently taking. US ambassadors to the UN have cast 91 vetoes in the council since the world body was founded in 1945, with nearly half protecting Israel and more than 30 directly blocking Palestinian rights. These votes have been consistent under both Republican and Democratic White House administrations. American presidents do not brag about that veto record, but it is a fundamental fact that will not change just because one party or another has taken control of the White House. It did not change under Democratic President Joe Biden either. Despite press releases about engaging in a 'partnership' with Arab Americans, that relationship was dead on arrival. All the Arabs and Muslims appointed to key White House and State Department posts were muzzled. They were not allowed to engage in media interviews unless they were tightly choreographed and controlled. A Kamala Harris presidency would also not have been any different. There is only one area of American politics that can change. It is not on the national level, such as the presidency or even representation in the US Congress. It is at the local level. Despite the perception, the headlines and the news reporting, American politics starts at the grassroots level, not at the top. Only when Arab Americans change the attitudes and understanding of their neighbors in their cities, towns and counties will American foreign policy start to show a seismic shift. That is how Israel did it. It funded huge public relations campaigns, involving the news media, movies and even entertainment, to change how Americans saw the Arab-Israeli conflict. It portrayed Israelis as victims of the 'terrorist' Arab world and 'educated' (i.e., brainwashed) Americans into being sympathetic with Israel’s needs and suspicious of Arab demands. Israelis were embraced as if they were American, while Arabs were demonized, largely because of their faith — a historical remnant of the Crusades, as Christianity continues to be pitted against Islam. But who cares about facts when defending Israel? Facts mean nothing in that equation. Palestinians kill 1,200 Israelis and it is a mini version of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Israel then kills more than 44,000 Arabs and Muslims in response and it is a mere consequence of Israel defending itself. Change will not come from electing a new president. But it will come from electing Arabs and Muslims to local government offices. The lowest levels of government have the greatest power and the most direct and personal contact with the American people. Meanwhile, the offices of the highest levels of government reflect broader policies that are the result of societal perceptions. You cannot change US foreign policy by electing a new president. But you can change it by altering how American society sees the Middle East and all its issues through getting Arabs and Muslims into local government offices. Change in America happens one person at a time. But that means that more Arabs and more Muslims need to run for local political office, pursuing a less grandiose goal. Sure, serving as a congressman or senator carries much prestige and a semblance of authority and power. But a position as a trustee or alderman in a village or city in America, or even as a mayor or state legislator, has much greater weight in terms of impacting public perception in a substantive way. When our peers at the grassroots level learn to trust us and understand our history, then and only then will American politics change at the international level. It is a simple dynamic in which egos and arrogance have to be shelved in favor of pragmatism and less grandiose, less selfish personal airs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy_Lr4n4uf8L2	2024-11-06T16:55:21-08:00	
Why Lower-Income Workers Are Trending Republican – OpEd	It’s hard to be an economist and, at the same time, be a Democrat. The reason? Most left-leaning Democrats reject the main teachings of economics. Yet more than 80% of academic economists are Democrats. For every Republicaneconomist on college faculties, there are 4.5 Democrats. Consider just a few of the ways in which what economists know differs from what liberal Democrats think. President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and a slew of congressional Democrats say that corporate greed is the cause of inflation, and two-thirds of Democratic voters agree with them. Yet, there is no such thing as a greed theory of inflation in any economics textbook. The Democratic solution to the problem of inflation is typically price controls, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has actually introduced a bill to impose them. Yet there is no textbook support for general price controls—especially on the Biden-Harris team’s favorite target: the price of groceries. The Biden-Harris administration supports rent control, as do half of Democratic voters. To be fair, almost the same percent of Republicans and independents also favor it. Yet almost no economist supports rent controls because of the negative effects discovered in over 200 studies. Like Biden, Harris wants to raise the corporate income tax rate while claiming that no one earning less than $400,000 would see a tax increase under her plan. Yet, all economists know that corporations do not pay taxes. People do. Every serious look at the corporate income tax concludes that some of the tax is paid by labor in the form of lower wages. One study concludes that the entirety of the corporate tax is paid by labor! The contrast between what economists know and what liberal Democrats think does not reflect mere differences over what public policies to choose. It represents two completely different understandings of how the economy works. What is true of academic economists is also true of highly educated, higher-income people who work in the private sector and have some basic knowledge of economics. They include quite a few billionaires, such as Mark Cuban and Bill Gates. Increasingly, they are voting for Democrats, even though they have the sophistication to know that the Democratic views described above are wrong and the Democratic policies are bad. At the same time, blue-collar, noncollege graduates are trending Republican. How do we explain this realignment? High-income, highly educated people often vote for liberal Democrats for two reasons: guilt and mythology. It is not unusual for these folks to think they won the genetic lottery unfairly. They were born in the right ZIP code to the right parents and with the right genes. They feel guilty about that. As for the mythology, that is summarized by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who became almost apoplectic the other day over the thought of large numbers of blue-collar workers voting for former President Donald Trump. Krugman wrote: 'Since the 1970s our two main political parties have diverged sharply on economic ideology. In general, Democrats favor higher taxes on the rich and a stronger social safety net; Republicans favor lower taxes on corporations and the wealthy paid for in part by cutting social programs.' In other words, Republicans favor the rich and Democrats favor the poor and the middle class. The problem: Krugman’s view of the world is a myth. Republican tax cuts through the years have sought to lower tax rates and broaden the base. And just about every time they legislated, Republicans threw more and more people off the tax rolls. As a result, the bottom half of the income ladder is paying almost no income tax at all. From President Ronald Reagan to Trump, the Republicans have shifted the burden of the income tax to the rich—so much so that today, we have the most progressive tax system in the world. The second part of the myth is the idea that Democrats are friends of those at the bottom of the income ladder. In almost all large cities, low-income families are forced to send their children to the worst schools, live in the worst housing, and endure the worst environmental harms. Virtually all these cities are managed by liberal Democrats. And the more Democratic the city, the worse things are: more homelessness, more segregated housing, more segregated schools, and more income inequality. By contrast, such Republican ideas as enterprise zones, enterprise programs, and charter cities would liberate people. As for the 'safety net,' welfare-entitlement spending on those at the bottom 20% of the income distribution averaged $64,700 per household in 2022. The vast bulk of that spending goes to medical, housing, education, and agribusiness interests, however. Poor households get very little from the government in cash, which is why they stay poor. That may be why the bottom half of the income ladder is trending Republican.

New Leader, Same Old Problems For UK’s Conservatives – OpEd	By Mohamed Chebaro For the world, the UK Conservative Party’s election of a Black female as leader is something to be applauded. She is not the first woman leader of the party, since Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May and Liz Truss have all preceded her and been in government too. All have left their mark on the country, both positively and negatively, each for their own reasons. Yet, the election of Kemi Badenoch is not a surprise for the tolerant, multicultural nation that is the UK, as she succeeded Rishi Sunak, the first British Asian prime minister, who was defeated at the last general election in July. The gender barrier has long since been crossed in the UK, both at the government level and in the royal realm, as the modern world knew the legendary Queen Elizabeth II, who reigned for seven decades and followed in the footsteps of other famous female sovereigns like Queen Victoria and Elizabeth I. Badenoch will be the second person from a minority background to have a shot at the highest executive office in the country if her leadership survives until the next general election, which is due by the summer of 2029. But is Badenoch the right person to lead the Tory party? During the Conservatives’ spell in power from 2010 until July’s election defeat, the party was widely viewed as having deeply divided the country and nearly collapsed its economy, while many Tory MPs pushed the electorate to score a historic own goal by convincing them that they would be better off outside the EU, rather than being part of the economic, social and political union on their doorstep? Maybe Badenoch will do a great job managing the party in opposition. She will have to try to unify its splintered wings, ranging from the right-wing tribe that led the country in the years after the Brexit vote to the center-right forces that opposed the UK’s European exit and who were deeply marginalized as a result. The latter were the ones that built, over many decades, the reputation of the Conservatives as the country’s main 'party of government.' I am minded to think that Badenoch will be just another leader who will have a shot at bringing the party back from the wilderness it put itself in following the Brexit referendum. Time will tell if she is lucky enough to survive the internal conflicts the party has been suffering from since falling into the grip of certain unsavory, self-serving figures who evidently put themselves, their friends and their party ahead of the country. Above all, I find it hard to see in Badenoch anything more than a figure who will be used by others in the party, due to her Nigerian background, to try to whitewash the accusations of racism levelled against the party and the Tories’ anti-immigration and anti-EU stances. Many believe that the political party she now leads has been funded during recent election campaigns by rich donors who do not hide their contempt for people of other colors and creeds. Clearly, Badenoch, a Black woman and the daughter of Nigerian parents, born in Wimbledon in South London, who spent her childhood in Lagos and the US, must be tainted with the same brush as the leaders she has served under, especially Boris Johnson. The former PM was a remainer who switched to leading the campaign to leave the EU at the strike of a pen, and far from any conviction. Many believe that Badenoch is also an opportunist, having served in various ministerial roles in the Johnson government that vowed to 'get Brexit done,' despite previously being on the record as saying that Brexit would be bad for British business and particularly traumatic for the UK car industry. The question is whether she has it in her to rally voters and heal the rift between the country and the Conservative Party due to their many lies and scandals, as well as the tarnished integrity of those she served alongside in a government that was unceremoniously ejected from power. The Tory party has always had a talent for breaking the mold in politics by promoting 'different' personalities to the top jobs, like Benjamin Disraeli, the UK’s only Jewish prime minister, Andrew Bonar Law, a Canadian, and even John Major, who was seen as the boy from Brixton — a poor neighborhood in South London known for its large Afro-Caribbean community. In selecting the controversial Badenoch — a computer engineer who worked in IT publishing and banking before becoming digital director of weekly magazine The Spectator, which is known as the British right’s bible — the Conservative Party still looks far away from healing itself. In putting at the helm someone who is seen as combative and controversial and who is against 'woke,' the party is sticking to the route of far-right politics and populist forces along the lines of Donald Trump, Giorgia Meloni and Marine Le Pen. It is thought that Badenoch and her shadow Cabinet, with a total of just 121 Members of Parliament, are unlikely to succeed in effectively holding to account the centrist Labour government of Keir Starmer, unless of course Labour gives the Tories a lifeline by scuppering their own chances in government. Similarly, it is unlikely that she will shake off the taints of racism or the empty anti-migrant, anti-establishment populist rhetoric that have stuck to her party and unfortunately are not unique to the UK, as they have been making inroads in most democratic nations around the world.

How Trump Won And What Black People Should Do – OpEd	Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris must be a wake up call to Black people. The Democratic Party is a dead end and a movement killer. Our survival depends on getting that corrupt wing of the duopoly out of our lives and out of our politics. On the evening of November 8, 2016, this columnist realized that Hillary Clinton had lost. She hadn’t yet conceded, the polls were still open on the west coast, but she lost Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to Donald Trump. When he turned these formerly democratic states republican, he secured a victory in the electoral college and became the 45th president of the United States. Late that night and in the early morning hours I wrote, 'Dump the Democrats for Good' and pointed out what is still true eight years later. 'Black people are now in fear and in shock when we ought to be spoiling for a fight. All is not lost. Even the victory of the openly bigoted Trump poses an opportunity to right our political ship. Not the electoral ship, the political one. For decades black Americans have been voting for people who have done them wrong.' Trump is a political figure unlike any other in U.S. political history. He is a failed businessman who excelled only at self-promotion, who had never held public office, who differed only from masses of white people in that he was wealthier. It was often said that he 'spoke his mind' but that really meant that his every racist and ignorant utterance was on the minds of white middle Americans who felt validated by him. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, the choice of the political establishment and corporate media. He seemingly went down to permanent defeat in 2020, although he never admitted he had lost, and on January 6, 2021 his followers vandalized the capitol while attempting to stop the electoral college certification. Since that time he lost a civil trial that found him guilty of rape and he was assessed a judgement of $350 million for defaming his accuser. He was convicted of falsifying business records in New York, which is a felony. He has been indicted in Georgia for attempting to overturn election results in that state, and he may face more charges regarding the mishandling of classified documents. Yet he is poised to become the 47th president of the United States. His own determination not to give up is largely responsible for this political comeback but the democrats share a large part of the blame in allowing their nemesis to once again occupy the white house. In 2020 democrats rigged the primary process in favor of former vice president Joe Biden. Biden was not popular with voters but he was with his party’s oligarchs. The other candidates left the race when they were told to and Bernie Sanders took a dive instead of fighting for his supporters. Many observers noted Biden’s frailty even then but he still had some political advantages. Trump was seen as being responsible for all the upheavals caused by the covid-19 crisis. He won in 2016 but only in the electoral college. He lost the popular vote and his approval rating never hit the 50% mark . Covid and the months-long Russiagate story proved too much in the 2020 campaign. Biden’s victory was greeted with celebrations but he was still the old right winger and his team falsely claimed he was 'the most progressive president since FDR' even though he was nothing of the sort.They said he would 'cut child poverty in half' but he allowed covid era support programs to lapse. He had no desire to fight against the oligarchs who insisted on continuing austerity. Millions of people who had Medicaid and SNAP benefits were suddenly kicked off of these life saving programs. Stimulus payments were gone and eviction protection and extensions of unemployment insurance payments were too. While working people continued to struggle economically, the Biden administration told them that economic indicators that have nothing to do with their lives were humming along and they were just too stupid to know they were doing well. Build Back Better legislation was supposed to provide some of the missing support but the oligarchy wasn’t having it. Build Back Better died and so did Biden’s chances of being re-elected. Instead of easing him out in 2022 or 2023 as one would expect, the democrats instead reordered the primary process to help their president who suffered from low approval ratings. Then came Biden’s very public collapse during his June debate with Trump. Anyone paying attention could see that Biden was not a well man, and his stumbling effort was an opportunity to get rid of him. Wealthy democratic donors took the lead in getting Biden to end his campaign. Democrats were then stuck with Kamala Harris. It would have been awkward to pass over the vice president and such a move would offend Black voters and thus Harris was anointed. They even dispensed with proposals to have an open convention which might have given some appearance of a process which had some veneer of democracy. Harris’ weaknesses were clear. Despite years in public office including as a senator who had her own presidential campaign, she was still unable to overcome personal deficiencies such as struggling to express herself whenever she was unscripted. Her lack of self-confidence was evident with her famous nervous laughter. She was also heartily disliked, as any prosecutor should be, and earned the nickname Copmala, because of her strict allegiance to the mass incarceration system. She dropped out of the 2020 presidential election without having won a single delegate. Her campaign website, usually a repository of pandering and sloganeering, had no content at all, except requests for money, for 50 days. Her campaign spoke of joy but nothing substantive that might inspire low motivation voters to make any effort. Even after a respectable debate performance against Trump, she resorted to being the Kamala Harris of old with her bad instincts intact such as in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, and bragged about being a gun owner who would shoot anyone who broke into her home. She continued her foolish appeal to the non-existent 'never Trump republicans,' fanciful creatures akin to unicorns, because they don’t actually exist. Harris pledged to include a republican in her cabinet and form a bipartisan commission to guide her in office. None of the unrequited republican love got her any votes. It must be pointed out that her biggest campaign obstacle was handed to her by her boss. The ongoing genocide in Israel has engendered revulsion among millions of people. Israel has now killed at least 200,000 people in Gaza alone and recently invaded Lebanon where it continues to commit war crimes of collective punishment and starvation and torture and rape, all with the help of the United States. The notoriously clumsy politician tried to talk out of both sides of her mouth, simultaneously claiming to work for a ceasefire while also promising to give Israel whatever it wants. She fooled no one, although she tried to by presenting a pro-Israel message in Pennsylvania while also showing pretend concern for Palestine in Michigan, a state with a large Arab population. Voters consistently showed bipartisan support for a ceasefire but support for genocide in congress was also bipartisan. The atrocities continued and democrats gave Trump an opening, allowing the candidate preferred by the Israeli government to claim he would be the peacemaker . While Kamala struggled to connect with democrats, Trump’s people don’t care about his criminal or civil cases. They don’t care if the corporate media don’t like him or if finance capitalists prefer the democrats. Mocking them makes liberals feel superior, but Trump supporters love their guy and don’t care about the opinions of those who don’t. This realization should have kept the Harris camp from calling him Hitler or a fascist when she should have been giving voters affirmative reasons to vote for her. As in 2016, a Trump victory should be the beginning of new Black politics. It should mean the end of Democratic Party as the focus of Black voters. Even though the Republican Party has been the 'white people's party' for 60 years, it is clear that seeing ourselves solely as electoral opposition is a losing proposition. So is believing that we must vote for democrats at all. Their party is lost, existing only as a money laundering operation, which is why Kamala Harris raised nearly $1 billion , more than twice as much as Donald Trump did. It is the party of the Israel lobby, weapons manufacturers, Wall Street, and big pharma, and as such offers nothing to Black people. Even their campaign promises are more meager over time. Biden campaigned in 2020 saying he would raise the federal minimum wage, but he didn’t and that made it impossible for Harris to raise the issue, assuming she thought about it at all. That issue is but one reason that we must let the Democratic Party die. Aside from a vague Opportunity Economy offering tax credits to small businesses and maybe giving up to $25,000 for a home down payment, she offered Black people nothing. She didn’t even mention bringing back the Voting Rights Act enforcement provisions. If a candidate has nothing to offer except repeating that they aren’t their opposition, then they are headed for defeat. Black people don’t have to be defeated because the democrats are. We still have agency. We can still organize instead of hitching our wagons to failure and betrayal. When they blame the Green party, Palestinian voters, Latino men, white women, or anyone else, we must hold up a mirror to their faces and point out that the fault is their own. If we hold on to traitors and losers, the fault will also be ours. Trump again enters office with majorities in both houses of congress and this time he won the popular vote as well. Beginning on January 20, 2025 he will have a free hand to do whatever he wants. Between now and then we need clear headed thought, and any laments about the return of segregation or the end of elections or other nonsense are unhelpful. I stand by and repeat what I wrote in 2016, 'The destruction of the Democratic Party and the creation of a truly progressive political movement is the only hope for black America.' It is also the only hope for the world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiyx4bg70trmc9	2024-11-06T16:48:58-08:00	
Why Trump’s Victory Matters, And Why It Doesn’t – OpEd	By Connor O'Keeffe Donald Trump is the winner of the 2024 presidential election. After winning back states he had lost in 2020, Trump performed well in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania—states Kamala Harris needed to win. Trump has won more than enough electoral votes to win back the White House and is projected to win the popular vote. Republicans have also retaken control of the Senate. Control over the House of Representatives is still up for grabs but, so far, Republicans are on pace to take that too. Trump’s win represents another major and well-deserved repudiation of the Washington establishment. In 2016, Republican voters decisively rejected Jeb Bush—the establishment’s chosen GOP candidate—and sent Donald Trump to the White House on a refreshingly anti-establishment platform. While he largely governed like an establishment Republican in his first term, his occasionally anti-establishment rhetoric was enough to prompt a full-court press from the political class to first force him out of office and later to disqualify him from ever holding power again. In the realm of public opinion, the establishment’s chosen tactic was to label Trump a racist, misogynist, wanna-be fascist whose supporters back him simply because they hate everyone who isn’t straight, white, and male. As Murray Rothbard wrote in a controversial, but prescient essay back in 1992, the modern Washington establishment has shown a robust willingness to excuse and even side with explicit racists. They aren’t actually appalled or offended by off-color jokes and statements. They just recognize that it’s easier to get regular, everyday Americans upset about those things than the rhetoric that truly worries those in power—in this case, Trump’s honesty about how Washington screws the public over and his skepticism about the need to fight all these wars. The fact that Trump won again, after eight years of relentless demonization from those in power, is arguably an even bigger loss for the establishment than 2016. It is certainly a bad outcome for the establishment media. The Trump campaign made a very explicit choice to engage more with alternative media than any other campaign in history. Trump sat for hours-long interviews on some of the biggest podcasts and internet talk shows, bringing his message to millions of listeners in a conversational setting—the opposite of short, scripted sound bites. Meanwhile, the establishment was freaking out about newspapers not printing formal Harris endorsements. The establishment media is quickly losing relevance in our media environment, and this election result confirms that. Still, there are plenty of reasons to be worried about Trump’s second term. For one, there is clearly an effort by some neoconservatives and establishment Republicans to again co-opt Trump’s presidency. Trump, for his part, will probably be happy to bask in calling himself a winner while delegating the actual work to establishment figures who actually oppose many of the policies that make Trump popular with the American people. Trump is also explicitly bad on a number of issues—like his hawkishness toward China and Iran and his call for more government barriers to trade. And because these positions would grant more power and money to the political class, the prospect of them coming to fruition is far more likely than his better positions. There is also what has often been dubbed the 'only Nixon could go to China' effect, where nominally right-wing politicians have an easier time enacting left-wing policies, and vice-versa. For instance, Trump significantly escalated Obama’s policy and sent lethal aid to Ukraine back in his first term, in part to counter the establishment’s campaign to define him as a Russian puppet. Without vigilant, bottom-up pressure from the public, Trump could easily be worse on some issues than Harris would have been. Still, there is value in the American people again repudiating the political establishment by voting for a candidate they had clearly deemed unacceptable. If Trump can follow through on his promises to end the war in Ukraine, appoint a libertarian to his cabinet, and finally free Ross Ulbricht, and if he greenlights Elon Musk’s plan to start a government efficiency department with Ron Paul, then this election will prove to have been even more consequential. With all that said, however, it’s important to keep perspective and not get too carried away by all the focus on this one victory. The unfortunate fact is that some of the most significant issues facing the American people were not featured at all in this election cycle. The most frustrating example is all the damage caused by the Federal Reserve. As Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, Murray Rothbard, and countless other economists in the same tradition have explained, when supposedly independent central banks like the Fed print new money and transfer it to the big banks and other politically-connected groups, it transfers the public’s wealth to the political class through inflation and traps us in a never-ending cycle of recessions. Further, the federal government’s use of money printing allows them to hide and delay the cost of government programs. All the worst things Washington is currently doing to us and to people abroad are only politically possible because of the Fed. The price inflation our government forces on us is not only a blatant transfer of wealth from the poor and middle class to the politically-connected rich, it has incredibly damaging impacts on our culture. Thanks to Fed-induced permanent price inflation, people are encouraged to take on debt and be more shortsighted and reductionist in their economic decisions, firms become artificially big, the consumption of stuff takes priority over the cultivation and production of resources, the quality of our elites and leaders diminishes, and generosity recedes out of community life. As if that’s not enough, the political establishment has used its ability to conceal the cost of its programs in inflation and debt to build a massive military-industrial complex. The political class has spent the past eighty years finding and creating new enemies abroad to justify all the power centralized in and money spent on the war-making apparatus in Washington, DC. Eight decades of military engagements, proxy wars, and arming allies has been lucrative for federal bureaucrats, beltway 'national security' experts, and weapons companies. But it’s come at the expense, not only of the American public’s economic well-being, but our actual security. Today, the world is full of groups—ranging from remote bands of terrorists to nuclear-armed governments—that consider Americans their enemy thanks to foreign interventions conducted by our government that were completely unnecessary. Now, rather than admit their role in bringing about these dangerous conditions, the political class is using our perilous global moment to justify more foreign interventions. That same cycle where the government creates problems with interventions that are then used to justify more interventions is at work in countless other areas, such as the cost and quality of healthcare, the price of college, the affordability of housing, and more. And again, much of this is enabled and exacerbated by the Federal Reserve system. All of these are major issues that have serious impacts on the well-being of the American people. Yet they received little to no mention this election season. Inflation was mentioned a lot by both campaigns, but the rhetoric never touched on the true cause and only solution. Trump, to his credit, did have some good moments speaking out against 'forever wars' and promising to end the war in Ukraine. But his stance on Iran and China was often even more hawkish than the Washington establishment. The full context of the interventionist scheme creating and profiting off of the problems facing us at home and abroad was either not understood or intentionally ignored by both campaigns. The Washington establishment suffered an embarrassing defeat last night, and that’s reason to celebrate. But until the public comes to truly understand how they use central banking and interventionism to enrich themselves at our expense, the good that can come from elections remains frustratingly limited. It’s up to those of us who do to get to work. About the author: Connor O’Keeffe (@ConnorMOKeeffe) produces media and content at the Mises Institute.

COP16: A Disappointment, As Expected – OpEd	By Anusa Karki and Simone Galimberti The recently concluded COP 16 on Biodiversity held in Cali, Colombia, (21 October to 1 November) was largely a disappointment. Unsurprisingly, it was largely expected to end up in this way. Yet, despite the gloom, in Cali, an important new conversation was started, bringing biodiversity and climate negotiations closer and this should a process led by young people, especially from indigenous communities. On the downsides of the COP, first of all, no ground was made on the thorniest of the issues, the financing of the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework approved two years. The new funds pledged by a small number of developed nations, were, considering the challenges posed by the global biodiversity crisis, just symbolic and, in no way, close enough to match the gap in resources that we face for biodiversity’s preservation. There were some positive developments on the fronts of digital sequence information but, at the end, the mechanism that would propel multinational company to contribute out of their profits stemming from using genetic data from nature plants, will be only voluntary. Bridging the gap between climate and biodiversity The only ray of hope is the endorsement of a key agenda raised for years by indigenous people, the creation of a new body, within the framework of the Biodiversity Convention, that would fully represent them. It will take a lot more efforts in the coming years to define the contours and details of such body and turn it into something truly meaningful and empowering. But, before focusing on ways to make this new body strong and truly meaningful, perhaps the most important element of the COP is the fact that, the Colombian presidency was instrumental in bridging the gap between climate and biodiversity. At least, a long due discussion on converging the two, has been initiated, building on some promising developments that had happened at the COP 28 on Climate last year in Dubai. Young people, starting from youths from indigenous communities, have a special role in trying to forge ahead with this conversation on the linkages between biodiversity and climate. The long-term goal could be a radical re-design of how biodiversity and climate negotiations unfold. What we have now are two totally separated negotiating tables representing the worst of the so called 'silos approach' that, instead of unifying policy issues, it separates and divides climate discussions from the biodiversity ones. Focusing on new bottom up, democratic practices will be key factors in both securing a strong indigenous body and a new closer climate and biodiversity framework. A unified Planet Earth Convention? These are, as the President of the COP 16, Susana Muhamad, the Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development of Colombia, two sides of the same coin. Why not daring to think that one day, we will have a unified Planet Earth Convention, rather than two and, consequentially, have only one COP? Besides, we cannot forget two other important intergovernmental processes that are rarely talked about: on one hand, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)and, on the other hand, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). We believe that young people, especially youths from indigenous communities, should lead this radical rethinking through an extensive campaigning and policy making. But it is essential to invest at grassroots level in the capacity of youths. In this process, it is paramount that we must ensure that youths from indigenous communities are fully empowered so that their voices will be heard. For all this to happen, capacity building is essential. More and more young people must be fully knowledgeable of the multiple dimensions of the crisis affecting planet Earth. Effective capacity building through cutting edge technical knowledge, public speaking and advocacy, negotiations, leadership and strategic planning are essential but opportunities must be spread and accessible. The experience of creating Communities of Practitioners among youths, an experience that both authors have been involved with in Nepal, can also be a very powerful tool, where youths interested to know more, come together to develop their expertise. In addition, inclusive mentorship programs for women, youth and marginalized communities, starting from indigenous youths should be promoted. Such programs can foster a new understanding of the complex dynamics at play, in terms of policies, finance and networking. More funding availability is also crucial. Organizing programs mainly for youth, women and indigenous participants, providing orientation sessions and workshops, what it is really a long educational journey, will increase their understanding of complex issues. At the same time, sponsorship for attending the COPs is vital for these group as most of them couldn’t afford due to financial and logistical barriers. Without sufficient funding, such participation becomes a privilege that excludes more inclusive and diverse voices and knowledge that are decisive to better shape the global decision making. If young people, women, starting from those from indigenous communities, understand the COPs procedures and related international frameworks, they will be in a position to turn themselves in policy makers if allowed a chance that deliberative innovations can provide. We could also have what we call 'Planet Earth Youth Councils', where local youths, with interests on biodiversity and climate and in endangered species, can come together. We do not need a climate council or a biodiversity council but rather we need a united platform that should also collaborate with the local governments by basically aligning both climate and biodiversity with the agenda of localizing the SDGs. But how to start to allocate the resources to enhance youths ‘meaningful engagement? We need tons of creativity to promote and encourage grassroots based exercises in which young people, on the one hand, can really gain the needed cross cutting know-how and on the other hand, have local platforms to deliberate. Bottom up and participatory democracy On this regard, we believe that the ongoing wave of exercises of bottom up and participatory democracy that are being implemented throughout the world, could be useful to re-think the way power is shared not only throughout the complexity of the COP processes but also at local levels where action often lacks. There have been already many climate assemblies in which citizens talk about how to tackle the warming of the planet and its devastating effects. The problem is that, oftentimes, youths involved in climate and biodiversity campaigning and advocacy, are not aware of them. Reinventing the way democracy works seems eluding them: it is still not well understood that, only better forms of democracy, can help generate the needed consensus to ensure the viability of our planet and the one of our own species. But perhaps there is also another way. The upcoming negotiations for new body within the Biodiversity Convention, officially called the Subsidiary Body for Indigenous Populations based on article 8.J of the same Convention, could also inspire a youths led democracy awakening. In this case, to start with, what will count, is to truly have indigenous leaders, the real guardians of the most precious biodiversity still remaining on planet Earth, enabled in the decision making. Hardly the international community will seize the chance to innovate in terms of participatory governance, enabling indigenous people, especially women and young leaders, to lead. Yet, despite the odds, this new mechanism could, potentially, become a forum in which indigenous people, especially young indigenous leaders, have not only a voice but also a power, perhaps even a veto one. Such possible scenario should all premised on the principle, often forgotten, of free, prior and informed consent or FPIC, a pillar of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Indigenous people must lead regarding the future of our planet As non-indigenous persons, we believe that indigenous people must lead in any negotiations regarding the future of our planet. The latest developments from deliberative democracy, whatever its shapes and forms, could also support young indigenous leaders to propose bold ideas on how this body should work. We should keep in mind that the origins of many deliberative practices, now being exercised all over the world, are not at all alien to the cultures of indigenous people with their own unique forms of governance based on a culture of consensus. But such deliberative efforts could not only help with the future debate on reshaping the ways the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework is pursued. The potential of more democratic practices centered on biodiversity and climate, is much bigger. Let’s imagine an exercise that will end with indigenous people, especially women and youths, able to flex their influence within the Biodiversity Convention but also, a process that can also inspire changes in other different and yet complementary dimensions. First, it could engender similar discussions on rethinking the whole governance of both the biodiversity and climate negotiations, bringing them closer. Second, it could reinvigorate local bottom-up practices of decision making by injecting doses of fresh energies embedded by youths. On this, we need to be clear that local governance will be more and more centered on how we deal with climate change and biodiversity losses. Indigenous youths, by having a chance at making this new body truthfully powerful, can embolden a new generations of biodiversity leaders, in exercising power. The end outcome, we hope, would be a more coherent, unified 'Earth Commons Governance', internationally and locally that is co-led by youths.

Hurricanes And Boeing Strike Depress Job Growth, But Unemployment...	The October jobs report showed little gain in hiring, with establishments adding just 12,000 jobs. The number was depressed both by the effects of the hurricanes that hit the South last month and the loss of roughly 33,000 jobs due to the strike at Boeing. The economy has now added 15.3 million jobs since President Biden took office in January of 2021. We now have 5.9 million more jobs than at the pre-pandemic peak. (These numbers adjust for the BLS preliminary benchmark revision.) The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent as hiring apparently offset any hurricane-related layoffs. The hurricanes make it more difficult to gauge the underlying strength of the labor market, but the growth would clearly have been far more rapid without the unusual events hitting the economy in October. It is also worth noting that the response rate to the establishment survey was extraordinarily low at 47.4 percent. It is typically close to 60.0 percent, which suggests there could be large revisions when we get fuller data in the next two months. Hurricanes Likely Hit Job Growth Primarily in Construction and Restaurants The direct impact of the Boeing strike is easy to measure since we know the number of striking workers. (The indirect effect on supplier industries is more difficult.) The hurricanes would have both prevented hiring in some sectors and also led to some layoffs in businesses that were closed due to the storms. It seems clear construction employment was affected by the hurricanes, as the sector created just 8,000 jobs in October after averaging almost 20,000 jobs a month in the year to September. This weakness was driven largely by a drop of 6,600 jobs in residential specialty trade contractors Other industries likely affected by the hurricanes include restaurant jobs, where just 3,700 jobs were added compared to an average of more than 12,000 a month in the year to September. Also, amusement, gambling, and recreation which lost 7,400 jobs, and the loss of 6,400 jobs in the retail sector. Adding in these effects, it seems likely that we would have seen at least 100,000 jobs added in October without the impact of the strike and the hurricane. Healthcare Sector Again Led Employment Growth The healthcare sector added 52,300 jobs in October, slightly less than the average growth of 58,000 over the year to September. The other big job gainers were state governments, which added 18,000 jobs and local governments, which added 21,000 jobs. The government sector did not recover the jobs lost in the pandemic until September of 2023. The private sector had regained the lost jobs by April of 2022. Employment in the government sector is now 590,000, or 2.6 percent, above its pre-pandemic level. Manufacturing Lost 46,000 Jobs, Mostly Due to Boeing Strike The job loss in manufacturing was driven primarily by the 33,000 striking workers at Boeing. There was a drop in employment in the metal industries of 5,400, which was likely due at least in part to the strike. There was a decline in employment of 6,000 in the motor vehicle industry, although employment in the sector is still 31,500 higher than in October of 2023. Wage Growth Remains Solid One factor offsetting concerns about labor market weakness is that we continue to see strong wage growth. Wages have risen 4.0 percent over the previous 12 months. The pace actually accelerated slightly over the last three months, with the annualized rate of wage growth of 4.5 percent. With the rate of inflation falling towards 2.0 percent, this means that workers are seeing healthy real wage gains. Little Change in Average Hours Some of us expected a drop in the length of the average workweek as a result of businesses being closed by the storms. This seems not to have been the case. There was no change in the length of the average workweek or the index of aggregate weekly hours. There was a drop in the index of aggregate weekly hours for production workers, but this was driven entirely by a drop in manufacturing and construction; the index for the service sector was unchanged. It is also worth noting involuntary part-time employment actually fell somewhat in the month, hitting its lowest level since June. Prime Age Employment Rates Fell in October The employment to population ratios (EPOP) for prime age workers (ages 25 to 54), which had been near its all-time high, fell 0.3 percentage points to 80.6 percent. The drop was driven mostly by a 0.6 percentage point drop in the prime age EPOP for women to 74.9 percent. This is still above the pre-pandemic peak. The EPOP for men edged down 0.1 percentage point to 86.3 percent. Share of Unemployment Due to Voluntary Quits Falls The share of unemployment due to people leaving their job fell from 12.1 percent to 11.5 percent. The small number of people changing jobs is one of the anomalies in the current labor market. With an unemployment rate near 4.0 percent, we would expect this share to be above 14.0 percent. We know from the JOLTS data that layoffs are relatively low, so it doesn’t seem workers have much fear of losing jobs at present. It’s possible that with the huge round of job changes earlier in the recovery workers are more satisfied with their jobs than in the past. Also we have a relatively older workforce now, and workers are less likely to change jobs in their forties and fifties than in their twenties and thirties, but this is one of the anomalies in the current labor market. Black Unemployment Steady at 5.7 Percent The Black unemployment rate was unchanged in October. The 5.7 percent rate in October is 0.7 pp below the recent high of 6.4 percent rate in March, but still 0.9 percent above the all-time low hit in April of 2023. It is slightly above the pre-pandemic lows. The unemployment rate for Hispanics was unchanged at 5.1 percent. This is 1.1 pp above the all-time low of 4.0 percent in November of 2022. Mostly Bright Picture, but Hurricanes Make it Hard to Read This is the last major data release before the election. The economy’s performance under the Biden-Harris administration has been remarkable by most standard measures. The pandemic inflation that drove prices higher across the globe has been brought down and is now nearly back to the Fed’s 2.0 percent inflation target. With wage growth near 4.0 percent, wages are now outpacing prices by a substantial amount. Clearly much of the weakness in the establishment survey is attributable to the hurricanes. It’s also not clear how many jobs we should be creating at this point. Before the pandemic, the Congressional Budget Office projected we would create just 20,000 jobs a month in 2024, as baby boomers retired in large numbers. The surge in immigration changed that picture, but with immigration now slowed, we will surely see much slower job growth ahead than earlier in the recovery.

Securing The Skies: Why Bangladesh Needs A Multilayered Air Defen...	As the battlefield of the future keeps on evolving, an entirely new dimension of threats is unfolding across a proliferation of drones, missiles, and precision-guided munitions. The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) has become more accessible and much more capable, with adversaries in most regions now able to conduct intelligence gathering and precision strikes with minimal risk. Short-range projectiles to Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles continue to pose formidable challenges around the globe due to both their speed and destructive power. Precision Guided Munition (PGMs), designed to precisely engage a specific target with minimal collateral damage, adds complexity to any defense scheme. These developments make it critical that a multi-tiered air defense system be able to detect, track, and defeat a wide range of threats across multiple altitudes and distances. Bangladesh's air defense capability comprises short-range surface-to-air missile systems like the TRG-300 MLRS, a Turkish-made medium-range missile system, and the FM-90, presumably offering limited coverage against low-altitude, short-range threats. The Bangladesh Air Force (BAF's) fighter aircraft comprise the MiG-29 and F-7 series, which are meant for air superiority and ground attack. Yet, the absence of medium to long-range air defense systems creates vulnerability against high-altitude and long-range threats. Therefore, the offensive capacity of modern low-observable unmanned aerial vehicles and advanced missile technologies defeats or is beyond the capability of the existing systems to effectively counter. The strategic location of Bangladesh, working within the regional dynamics, urgently calls for a robust, multilayered air defense system. Geographically, it shares boundaries with states having developing air capabilities, namely Myanmar and India. Myanmar's purchase of advanced fighter jets such as the JF-17 Block II and Su-30SME and India’s acquisition of Rafale have given serious reasons for regional security concerns and allowed Bangladesh to improve its air defense in maintaining sovereignty and deterring warriors. On top of all the evolving nature of the aerial threat, ranging from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to ballistic missiles, requires an integrated defense strategy. A multilayered system, so to say, integrates short, medium, and long-range defenses, hence promising a solid shield against various threats, with enhancement in national security and regional stability. The basic constituting elements for a comprehensive multilayer air defense system, operationally and technologically required to effectively counter such diverse aerial threats:SHORAD-Short-Range Air Defense: SHORAD systems operate to neutralize low-altitude threats like drones, low-flying aircraft, and helicopters. These guarantee a fast response through the use of mobile missile launchers and anti-aircraft artillery. The systems should be highly flexible and quick to offer protection to ground forces, as well as all other critical assets. Systems such as the Iron Dome have been effective in neutralizing short-range threats and have so far intercepted over 5,000 rockets at an accuracy of more than 90%. Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missiles (MRSAM): Such systems attack targets at medium altitudes and distances, notably cruise missiles and rotary-wing aircraft. MRSAM fills in operational envelopes on the interface between short-distance and long-distance defenses, therefore providing a multi-layer protective shield. Considerably, there is the David's Sling system, developed to intercept medium-range missiles and aircraft to date, to enhance defense against regional menaces. Long-Range Air Defense: Considering the above-said, the role of long-range systems is extremely important: they are crucial for area coverage and might be highly effective in intercepting high-altitude air threats, like ballistic missiles or strategic bombers. Examples include the Arrow system, which was created for chief interception purposes of long-range missiles, including ballistic ones, that work both within and outside the atmosphere. The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, and ballistic missiles has, to a great degree, altered dynamics both in the field and in modern warfare, as was seen during the Russo-Ukraine conflict. Adversaries can easily access commercially available, low-cost drones capable of conducting surveillance, delivering munitions, and disrupting critical infrastructure. Russia, for instance, has taken to deploying Shahed UAVs targeting Ukrainian energy sites strategic predecessors for what technologies can execute. Also, ballistic missiles pose a heavy threat because they operate with a great deal of speed and potential for massive destructive power. With the increasing proliferation of such technologies, the chance of non-state actors and smaller states posing a threat to conventional defense systems is constantly growing, which is a demand for sophisticated and multilayered air defense systems capable of effectively detecting, intercepting, and neutralizing various aerial threats. Modernization is highly insisted upon in Bangladesh's air defense when the evolving nature of threats across the region is considered. The access to advanced technologies can allow an increase in the distance between detection and intercepting capabilities, hence viewed as an important strategic leverage against potential adversaries. It provides investments in radar-guided anti-air systems with enhanced detection and interception capabilities. AI-powered surveillance network architecture will improve response times and operational efficiency by facilitating real-time data analytics and threat assessment. Modernization spells not only enhanced defense preparedness but also brings Bangladesh at par with other military forces of the globe and protects its airspace and sovereignty. Even the Bangladesh Army is modernizing with a host of new technologies, robotics, and AI, evidence that modernization provides an edge in regional security dynamics. A multilayered air defense system drastically enhances national security for Bangladesh. Maneuvering a short, medium, and long-range defense against the variants of aerial threats provides multiple options, thereby further strengthening deterrence capability in the nation. The repercussions will be very well coordinated among the military branches concerning joint operations and efficiency. In essence, a critical protection system would be designed to ensure the survivability of the critical infrastructure against possible attacks to ensure economic stability and national resilience. It is thus multilayer defense that aligned Bangladesh with the rest of the world's military standards while reinforcing commitments toward sovereignty and regional stability.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy98EkQdQV3vM	2024-11-06T16:15:01-08:00	
2047 And Beyond: Can India’s Democracy Withstand Hindutva? – OpEd	India’s path toward 2047, the centenary of its independence, reveals a troubling paradox. Once celebrated for its pluralism and diversity, India is now grappling with an ideological shift that threatens to unravel its inclusive foundation. Since 2014, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the rise of Hindutva ideology, an ideology that blends Hindu identity with Indian nationalism, has reshaped India’s domestic and international reputation, challenging the very principles on which the country was founded. If this trend continues, India could face a perilous future marked by fragmentation, deepening social divides, and international condemnation. The evolution of Hindutva from a fringe ideology to a political force is at the heart of India’s transformation. Under Modi’s leadership, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promoted a vision of India as a Hindu nation, alienating minority communities and redefining national identity. This shift is meticulously documented in The Atlantic (2022), which observes how Hindu nationalism, now a political mainstream, has embedded itself into India’s state machinery, influencing policies that many argue discriminate against religious minorities, particularly Muslims. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) are two such policies. The CAA, for example, fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslim refugees from neighboring countries, signaling a shift toward an exclusionary identity framework (Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, 2023). Global human rights organizations have responded with growing alarm. In its 2023 report, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) labeled India as a 'Country of Particular Concern,' citing escalating religious discrimination and state-sponsored persecution against minorities. Genocide Watch has issued similar warnings, raising the alarm over what it sees as a gradual but consistent progression toward large-scale violence against Muslims (Genocide Watch, 2024). These warnings stem from documented incidents of hate speech, physical violence, and intimidation against minority communities, which have become disturbingly common under the BJP’s rule. According to the USCIRF report, Hindu nationalist groups have grown emboldened, often acting with impunity, as government policies increasingly reflect Hindu nationalist rhetoric. The implications of this ideological shift extend beyond religious discrimination. India’s position on international indices underscores the domestic cost of eroding democratic freedoms. India now ranks 104th out of 179 countries on the Liberal Democracy Index, reflecting a decline in political rights, judicial independence, and freedom of speech. These trends are mirrored in the 2024 Fragile States Index, where India has fallen to 75th place, categorizing it as a state in the 'Warning' zone. The Digital India laws, introduced under the pretext of regulating digital content, have exacerbated the situation by suppressing dissenting voices. By early 2024, over 130 violations of free speech were recorded, highlighting the government’s efforts to control the narrative. The World Economic Forum even identified misinformation—propelled by the BJP’s IT cell—as one of India’s top risks, indicating that state-sponsored propaganda has permeated social media, distorting public perception and stifling critical voices (LA Times, April 18, 2024). This state-controlled narrative aligns with theories of hegemonic power consolidation, which explain how nationalist regimes often attempt to construct a homogeneous identity by marginalizing dissent and diversity. This phenomenon, examined in Georgetown’s Politics of Identity and State-Building (2023), aligns with India’s current trajectory. Hindutva, as an ideology, envisions a Hindu-majoritarian state that consolidates power through cultural homogenization and exclusionary nationalism. By championing this narrative, the BJP positions itself as the 'protector' of Hindu identity, fostering a climate where minority groups are increasingly sidelined. This shift not only risks alienating substantial portions of India’s population but also undermines the foundations of a pluralistic society, potentially leading to long-term social instability. The international community has not remained silent. Scholars, activists, and human rights organizations are actively calling for interventions to prevent what they view as a looming crisis. A February 2022 summit, India on the Brink: Preventing Genocide, organized by a coalition of global civil rights organizations, underscored the need for international attention to India’s human rights situation. Participants, including former UN officials and global human rights advocates, called for urgent measures to prevent further human rights abuses and warned of the risk of violence if the current trends persist (London Story, 2024). Dr. Gregory Stanton, president of Genocide Watch, has publicly stated that the international community has a 'moral obligation' to act preemptively, citing India as an example where early indicators of widespread violence are visible but remain largely unaddressed. The BJP’s response to such criticisms has been to double down on its narrative. By casting dissent as 'anti-national' and framing critics as enemies of the state, the government has managed to stifle significant opposition. This tactic of labeling dissenting voices as 'anti-Indian' not only deflects legitimate criticism but also undermines democratic principles, as individuals and institutions hesitate to speak out. Furthermore, the digital space—a crucial platform for discourse—has become a battleground where voices of opposition are censored or attacked. The rise of BJP-affiliated social media cells has exacerbated the spread of propaganda, leaving independent media in a precarious position and restricting public access to unbiased information. India’s current trajectory is unsustainable if it hopes to maintain its democratic fabric and its foundational principle of secularism. The consolidation of power under a singular nationalist ideology risks unraveling the diverse social fabric that has been the bedrock of Indian society. While proponents of Hindutva argue that this identity-centric approach strengthens India, the reality suggests that it alienates significant populations, deepens social divisions, and could lead to instability. If India does not address these concerns, it risks reaching its centenary in 2047 as a fragmented and polarized nation rather than as a unified, democratic powerhouse.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiywZp0AWpV8ee	2024-11-06T16:06:55-08:00	
Harnessing Power Of Moroccan Diaspora: King Mohammed VI’s Vision ...	In his recent speech marking the 49th anniversary of the Green March, King Mohammed VI set forth an ambitious plan to revitalize Morocco's relationship with its global diaspora, addressing the evolving role and potential of millions of Moroccans living abroad. This is not merely a policy shift; it is a call to action for an era where the Moroccan diaspora is positioned as a central partner in shaping the nation's future. By restructuring the institutions that engage with overseas Moroccans, the King is weaving a tighter, more inclusive fabric of national unity that transcends borders and generations. The significance of this initiative goes far beyond administrative reform. It reflects a deep-seated recognition that Moroccans abroad are not just citizens dispersed across the world, but are ambassadors, innovators, investors, and cultural torchbearers. Their bond with the homeland is resilient, marked by a patriotism that has often been forged in the fires of defending Morocco's sovereignty and territorial integrity on the world stage. Yet, the King's message this year was clear: patriotism alone is no longer enough. The Moroccan diaspora must be equipped with tools, resources, and streamlined processes to become active, dynamic contributors to Morocco's progress. Central to this new vision is the restructuring of diaspora institutions into two primary entities, each with a clearly defined purpose. The first, the Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad, is designed to serve as a reflection of the diaspora's diversity, a forum for constructive dialogue, and a source of policy guidance. By pushing for rapid legislation to formalize the Council's renewed mission, the King underscores the urgency of amplifying the voices of Moroccans abroad in shaping policies that affect them. The second entity, the newly announced Fondation Mohammedia des Marocains résidant à l'étranger, will serve as the operational engine behind Morocco's engagement with its diaspora. As an institution, it will consolidate previously fragmented efforts, coordinate a cohesive National Strategy for Moroccans Abroad, and manage a mechanism for mobilizing Moroccan talent worldwide. This move is not merely symbolic; it directly responds to long-standing calls from the diaspora for better access to participate in Morocco's development. It is a channel through which talented and successful Moroccans worldwide can bring their expertise, entrepreneurial spirit, and capital back to their homeland. But the King's vision extends beyond economic contributions. His call for the Foundation to bolster cultural, linguistic, and religious education for Moroccans abroad is a powerful reminder that the preservation of Moroccan identity is as much a part of nation-building as economic development. This approach signals a profound understanding that language, culture, and faith are not just private matters—they are pillars of national unity that must be actively nurtured, especially in a globalized world where these ties can easily fray over generations. The King also pointed to one of the most pressing challenges facing the diaspora: the inefficiencies and complexities of administrative and judicial processes. Through the digitalization and simplification of these procedures, Morocco can remove a significant barrier to diaspora engagement, fostering a more seamless connection between Moroccans abroad and their homeland. If implemented effectively, this could be a game-changer, positioning Morocco as a global leader in government services for its expatriates. At the core of this vision is an imperative to bring Moroccan expatriates into the fold as drivers of economic innovation. Currently, their investments account for only 10% of Morocco's private domestic investments—a figure that is strikingly low given the diaspora's vast economic power. King Mohammed VI's call for a dramatic increase in diaspora-led investments reflects a new era of inclusion, where Moroccans abroad are seen not merely as contributors, but as co-architects of Morocco's economic future. Perhaps most significant, though, is the underlying theme of mobilization. In these times, as Morocco asserts its territorial integrity and strengthens its international standing, the support of Moroccans abroad is indispensable. The King's speech reflects the reality that Morocco's fight for sovereignty is not just a domestic issue; it is a global campaign that requires the strength and solidarity of Moroccans everywhere. King Mohammed VI's address is a blueprint for a Morocco that is more resilient, more inclusive, and more ambitious. By building bridges with its diaspora, Morocco is not only securing resources and skills for national growth but is also championing a model of unity that is adaptable, forward-looking, and deeply rooted in shared values. This is the legacy of the Green March: a call for unity that, fifty years later, is being answered by Moroccans around the world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy8Liuvyghb3b	2024-11-06T16:04:16-08:00	
European Union’s Anti-Chinese Electric Vehicles Policy: A Costly ...	The European Union (EU) advocates for a free-market economy and expects countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, along with their governments, to provide full support and platforms for European capital, industries, products, and services without imposing any form of trade restrictions. The EU asserts that the free mobility of European capital is central to its trade praxis. However, these same principles are not applied when capital, industries, and services flow from countries like China, India, or other nations in the Global South. The colonial white supremacists and EU’s policymakers consider countries in the Global South as dumping grounds for European products and services. The concept of free trade for Europe and restricted trade for the Global South is an extension of neocolonial trade practices and reflects a colonial mindset in action. The undemocratic and unaccountable European Commission has decided to impose a 35.3% countervailing duty (CVD) on electric vehicles (EVs) from China, in addition to the EU's 10% tariff. This means the EU has effectively imposed a 45.3% trade tariff on Chinese EVs, under the guise of protecting the European car industry, but at the expense of European consumers. These CVDs on Chinese EVs go against the interests of European consumers, who could have benefited from more affordable, technologically advanced Chinese EVs. However, the EU is indifferent to the interests of European consumers. Instead, it prioritises the interests of European capitalists and their car industries, with policies designed to serve car makers rather than car buyers. The EU provides subsidies to landlords, industrialists, and large corporations while undermining small farmers and small-scale enterprises. However, when China offers subsidies, it is labelled as unfair trade practice. The focus of Chinese subsidies is on consumer welfare, whereas EU subsidies are aimed at consolidating capitalist power for risk-free profit maximisation. Chinese subsidies prioritise consumer security, while EU subsidies are designed to protect capitalists, large industrialists, and their conglomerates. China’s subsidies support the growth of technologically advanced electric vehicles (EVs) to protect the environment and reduce pollution, while also making EVs affordable for its citizens. In contrast, the EU's anti-subsidy investigations and anti-dumping allegations against Chinese EVs are intended to protect corporate subsidies for European car manufacturers at the expense of European consumers. The tariffs imposed on Chinese EVs will raise prices in Europe, and EU subsidies will not reduce the production cost or selling price of EVs. These anti-dumping allegations aim to weaken the market for Chinese EVs in Europe, consolidating European capitalists' profits at the expense of consumers. Exploitation is at the heart of European colonialism, and it continues to affect European citizens today. Chinese EV brands like SAIC, BYD, Geely, NIO, and Dongfeng are leading producers of technologically advanced and durable electric vehicles. These companies not only offer high-quality EVs at affordable prices, making them accessible to consumers with low incomes, but they also ensure excellent customer service. So, why don't European EV producers create technologically advanced vehicles and offer competitive prices to consumers in Europe? The best path forward is to embrace free and open market competition, which would encourage better products and services at affordable prices. Instead of focusing on policies that benefit consumer welfare and experience, the EU is negotiating with China and the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) to set a market floor price cap, in line with the pricing mechanisms favoured by European EV producers. This policy is harmful to the interests of European consumers. Given the size of China’s automobile industry and scope of its domestic and international EV market, China and its companies can withstand the EU’s anti-Chinese market strategy. However, German and French car industries will face significant challenges, as they are highly exposed to the Chinese market both in terms of sales and production. If Chinese companies, backed by the Chinese state and government, were to stop investing in Europe, countries like Turkey and Hungary would immediately suffer. Chinese companies, such as BYD, are establishing new factories in these countries, bringing investment and generating employment. European car and EV producers, like Germany’s Volkswagen and Sweden’s Northvolt, are already facing difficulties due to the EU’s anti-Chinese policies. China’s economic and industrial overcapacity is a result of its hardworking and technologically advanced skilled workforce. It not only provides a competitive advantage but also offers a model that European states and governments could emulate for the benefit of their people. However, asking Europe to 'implement what it preaches' is a difficult task for a continent of colonial-era shopkeepers whose primary motive has always been profit at the expense of the people. This mindset remains unchanged among European capitalists and corporate elites today. Import tariffs contradict the values of a free and open market that the EU claims to uphold, yet they are imposed on Chinese EVs to protect European capitalists and their car factories at the expense of European consumers. This anti-Chinese stance exposes the EU's true priorities to the European public. The opposition of Germany and Hungary to the EU’s anti-China policies reveals the fault lines within the EU. European manufacturers are suffering due to these policies, as many EVs for Europe are built in China. Meanwhile, experts from the Atlantic Council fuel the controversy by arguing that Chinese EVs pose a security risk in terms of potential hacking and sensitive data collection. Such claims are not only unfounded but also a political strategy to discredit and undermine China and its achievements. In this context, how should China respond to the EU’s countervailing duties (CVDs)? It would be better for China not to react and retaliate by imposing similar tariffs on European products and services. Such a strategy would strengthen China’s position among the people of Europe, while undermining the anti-Chinese propaganda promoted by the European ruling elites. Instead, China should focus on creating alternative mechanisms for investment in cooperative industrial models, both within Europe and globally. These initiatives can generate employment opportunities and ensure good returns on Chinese investments. While capitalist market competition is not a strategy China should adopt, it must continue to follow its own path in service to the Chinese people and people around the world. This approach will not only help expand China’s model of development and industrialisation but also contribute to global prosperity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy-KXxmZTctP_	2024-11-06T15:58:07-08:00	
Breakthrough In Energy-Efficient Avalanche-Based Amorphization Co...	The atoms of amorphous solids like glass have no ordered structure; they arrange themselves randomly, like scattered grains of sand on a beach. Normally, making materials amorphous — a process known as amorphization — requires considerable amounts of energy. The most common technique is the melt-quench process, which involves heating a material until it liquifies, then rapidly cooling it so the atoms don’t have time to order themselves in a crystal lattice. Now, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science (Penn Engineering), the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a new method for amorphizing at least one material — wires made of indium selenide, or In2Se3 — that requires as little as one billion times less power density, a result described in a new paper in Nature. This advancement could unlock wider applications for phase-change memory (PCM) — a promising memory technology that could transform data storage in devices from cell phones to computers. In PCM, information is stored by switching the material between amorphous and crystalline states, functioning like an on/off switch. However, large-scale commercialization has been limited by the high power needed to create these transformations. 'One of the reasons why phase-change memory devices haven’t reached widespread use is due to the energy required,' says Ritesh Agarwal, Srinivasa Ramanujan Distinguished Scholar and Professor in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at Penn Engineering and one of the paper’s senior authors. For more than a decade, Agarwal’s group has studied alternatives to the melt-quench process, following their 2012 discovery that electrical pulses can amorphize alloys of germanium, antimony and tellurium without needing to melt the material. Several years ago, as part of those efforts, one of the new paper’s first authors, Gaurav Modi, then a doctoral student in MSE at Penn Engineering, began experimenting with indium selenide, a semiconductor with several unusual properties: it is ferroelectric, meaning it can spontaneously polarize, and piezoelectric, meaning that mechanical stress causes it to generate an electric charge and, conversely, that an electric charge deforms the material. Modi discovered the new method essentially by accident. He was running a current through In2Se3 wires when they suddenly stopped conducting electricity. Upon closer examination, long stretches of the wires had amorphized. 'This was extremely unusual,' says Modi. 'I actually thought I might have damaged the wires. Normally, you would need electrical pulses to induce any kind of amorphization, and here a continuous current had disrupted the crystalline structure, which shouldn’t have happened.' Untangling that mystery took the better part of three years. Agarwal shipped samples of the wires to one of his former graduate students, Pavan Nukala, now an Assistant Professor at IISc and member of the school’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) and one of the paper’s other senior authors. 'Over the past few years we have developed a suite of in situmicroscopy tools here at IISc. It was time to put them to test — we had to look very, very carefully to understand this process,' says Nukala. 'We learned that multiple properties of In2Se3 — the 2D aspect, the ferroelectricity and the piezoelectricity — all come together to design this ultralow energy pathway for amorphization through shocks.' Ultimately, the researchers found that the process resembles both an avalanche and an earthquake. At first, tiny sections — measured in billionths of a meter — within the In2Se3wires begin to amorphize as electric current deforms them. Due to the wires’ piezoelectric properties and layered structure, the current nudges portions of these layers into unstable positions, like the subtle shifting of snow at the top of a mountain. When a critical point is reached, this movement triggers a rapid spread of deformation throughout the wire. The distorted regions collide, producing a sound wave that moves through the material, similar to how seismic waves travel through the earth’s crust during an earthquake. This sound wave, technically known as an 'acoustic jerk,' drives additional deformation, linking numerous small amorphous areas into a single one measured in micrometers — thousands of times larger than the original areas — just like an avalanche gathering momentum down a mountainside. 'It’s just goosebump stuff to see all these phenomena interacting across different length scales at once,' says Shubham Parate, an IISc doctoral student and co-first author of the paper. The collaborative effort to understand the process has created fertile ground for future discoveries. 'This opens up a new field on the structural transformations that can happen in a material when all these properties come together. The potential of these findings for designing low-power memory devices are tremendous,' says Agarwal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy2X59dic3WUj	2024-11-06T15:54:41-08:00	
Mighty Radio Bursts Linked To Massive Galaxies	Since their discovery in 2007, fast radio bursts—extremely energetic pulses of radio-frequency light—have lit up the sky repeatedly, leading astronomers on a chase to uncover their origins. Currently, confirmed fast radio bursts, or FRBs, number in the hundreds, and scientists have assembled mounting evidence for what triggers them: highly magnetized neutron stars known as magnetars (neutron stars are a type of dead star). One key piece of evidence came when a magnetar erupted in our own galaxy and several observatories, including Caltech's STARE2 (Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio Emission 2) project, caught the action in real time. Now, reporting in the journal Nature, Caltech-led researchers have uncovered where FRBs are more likely to occur in the universe—massive star-forming galaxies rather than low-mass ones. This finding has, in turn, led to new ideas about how magnetars themselves form. Specifically, the work suggests that these exotic dead stars, whose magnetic fields are 100 trillion times stronger than Earth's, often form when two stars merge and later blow up in a supernova. Previously, it was unclear whether magnetars form in this way, from the explosion of two merged stars, or whether they might form when a single star explodes. 'The immense power output of magnetars makes them some of the most fascinating and extreme objects in the universe,' says Kritti Sharma, lead author of the new study and a graduate student working with Vikram Ravi, an assistant professor of astronomy at Caltech. 'Very little is known about what causes the formation of magnetars upon the death of massive stars. Our work helps to answer this question.' The project began with a search for FRBs using the Deep Synoptic Array-110 (DSA-110), a Caltech project funded by the National Science Foundation and based at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory near Bishop, California. To date, the sprawling radio array has detected and localized 70 FRBs to their specific galaxy of origin (only 23 other FRBs have been localized by other telescopes). In the current study, the researchers analyzed 30 of these localized FRBs. 'DSA-110 has more than doubled the number of FRBs with known host galaxies,' says Ravi. 'This is what we built the array to do.' Although FRBs are known to occur in galaxies that are actively forming stars, the team, to its surprise, found that the FRBs tend to occur more often in massive star-forming galaxies than low-mass star-forming galaxies. This alone was interesting because the astronomers had previously thought that FRBs were going off in all types of active galaxies. With this new information, the team started to ponder what the results revealed about FRBs. Massive galaxies tend to be metal-rich because the metals in our universe—elements that are manufactured by stars—take time to build up over the course of cosmic history. The fact that FRBs are more common in these metal-rich galaxies implies that the source of FRBs, magnetars, are also more common to these types of galaxies. Stars that are rich in metals—which in astronomical terms means elements heavier than hydrogen and helium—tend to grow larger than other stars. 'Over time, as galaxies grow, successive generations of stars enrich galaxies with metals as they evolve and die,' Ravi says. What is more, massive stars that explode in supernovae and can become magnetars are more commonly found in pairs. In fact, 84 percent of massive stars are binaries. So, when one massive star in a binary is puffed up due to extra metal content, its excess material gets yanked over to its partner star, which facilitates the ultimate merger of the two stars. These merged stars would have a greater combined magnetic field than that of a single star. 'A star with more metal content puffs up, drives mass transfer, culminating in a merger, thus forming an even more massive star with a total magnetic field greater than what the individual star would have had,' Sharma explains. In summary, since FRBs are preferentially observed in massive and metal-rich star-forming galaxies, then magnetars (which are thought to trigger FRBs) are probably also forming in metal-rich environments conducive to the merging of two stars. The results therefore hint that magnetars across the universe originate from the remnants of stellar mergers. In the future, the team hopes to hunt down more FRBs and their places of origin using DSA-110, and eventually the DSA-2000, an even bigger radio array planned to be built in the Nevada desert and completed in 2028. 'This result is a milestone for the whole DSA team. A lot of the authors on this paper helped build the DSA-110,' Ravi says. 'And the fact that the DSA-110 is so good at localizing FRBs bodes well for the success of DSA-2000.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy1EdSd4og-sX	2024-11-06T15:44:07-08:00	
Sewage Surveillance Proves Powerful In Combating Antimicrobial Re...	Waterborne diseases affect over 7 million people in the U.S. every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and cost our health care system over $3 billion. But they don’t impact all people equally. A campuswide collaboration is using sewage surveillance as a vital strategy in the fight against diseases that spread through the water such as legionella and shigella. The ones that are most difficult to combat are diseases with antimicrobial resistance, which means they are able to survive against antibiotics that are intended to kill them. A recent paper in Nature Water offers an encouraging insight: Monitoring sewage for antimicrobial resistance indicators is proving to be more efficient and more comprehensive than testing individuals. This approach not only detects antimicrobial resistance more effectively but also reveals its connection to socioeconomic factors, which are often key drivers of the spread of resistance. The paper’s corresponding author is Peter Vikesland, the Pryor Professor of Engineering in the civil and environmental engineering department. The team is collaborating across Virginia Tech with experts such as Leigh-Anne Krometis in biological systems engineering and Alasdair Cohen and Julia Gohlke in population health sciences to focus on serving rural communities where the issues are most acute. The significance Globally, low-to middle-income communities bear the brunt of infectious diseases and the challenges of antimicrobial resistance. Sewage surveillance could be a game changer in addressing these disparities. This method not only captures a snapshot of antimicrobial resistance at the community level, but also reveals how socioeconomic factors drive the issue. The study The National Science Foundation Research Traineeship focuses on advancing sewage surveillance to combat antimicrobial resistance. The work is integral to broader efforts led by Vikesland and the Fralin Life Sciences Institute program for technology enabled environmental surveillance and control to sense and monitor waterborne health threats. The study analyzed data from 275 human fecal samples across 23 countries and 234 urban sewage samples from 62 countries to investigate antibiotic resistance gene levels. Socio-economic data, including health and governance indicators from World Bank databases, were incorporated to explore links between antibiotic resistance genes and socio-economic factors. The group utilized machine learning to assess antibiotic resistance gene abundance in relation to socio-economic factors, revealing significant correlations. Statistical methods supported the finding that within country antibiotic resistance gene variation was lower than between countries. Big picture, the team's findings show sewage surveillance is emerging as a powerful tool in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. It even has the potential to protect vulnerable communities more effectively.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy942CRBqVTZL	2024-11-06T15:40:45-08:00	
Coyotes Thriving Despite Human And Predator Pressures	Research led by the University of New Hampshire sheds light on how coyotes, North America’s most successful predators, are responding to various environmental pressures, including human development, hunting and competition with larger carnivores. Surprisingly, the study’s findings suggest that human hunting practices may actually contribute to increasing the number of coyotes. 'Intensive coyote removal can obviously reduce populations in the short-term, but removal can also result in younger coyote populations with higher reproduction and immigration rates,' said Remington Moll, assistant professor of natural resources and the environment and lead author. 'In our study, we detected more coyotes in places where hunting was allowed. This trend occurred over several years, suggesting that, on average, hunting did not reduce coyote abundance and perhaps increased it locally in certain areas.' Published in the journal Ecography, the study, one of the largest-scale studies of coyote populations to date, explored the complex dynamics shaping coyote populations across wide range of diverse habitats—from rural to suburban. It used data from over 4,500 cameras set up across the country by the Snapshot USA project, a national project that collects wildlife data from coordinated camera arrays across the contiguous United States. The data was combined with satellite-derived habitat metrics and analyzed using various advanced modeling techniques which allowed the team to evaluate the effects of habitat type, competition with larger carnivores, hunting practices and suburban expansion on coyote populations—providing the researchers with a clearer understanding of how coyotes respond to varying environmental pressures. 'Our work suggests that promoting the recovery of large carnivores, especially in certain habitats, is more likely to reduce coyote numbers than people directly hunting them,' said Roland Kays, a research professor with North Carolina State University’s College of Natural Resources and study co-author. 'With this data, we can now map them out across the country to provide the first abundance map of our country’s most important predator—an effort that could help in both conservation and coyote management.' Coyotes are the most successful carnivores on the continent. Having spread throughout the eastern United States, coyotes come into regular contact with humans. However, until now, the factors influencing the number of coyotes across suburban, rural and wild landscapes have remained largely unclear. Other key findings include that the presence of larger carnivores, such as black bears and pumas, influenced coyote numbers in a habitat-dependent manner. For example, black bears had a stronger limiting effect on coyotes in forested areas, whereas pumas exerted a similar influence in more open environment. Coyote abundance was highest in grasslands and agricultural landscapes—regions that provide ample prey and shelter. And, the impact of urbanization on coyote populations varied by scale: at smaller, local scales, urban development tended to reduce coyote numbers due to increased human presence and habitat fragmentation. However, at larger, suburban scales, coyote populations thrived, benefiting from the fragmented habitats and edges that offer access to both natural and human-modified resources. The study also highlighted significant regional variation in coyote populations across the United States, with particularly high numbers in the southwestern U.S. and lower populations in the northeast, reflecting the diverse ecological and geographical factors at play.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcctDY7tCPiy_aHCNgGrPX3	2024-11-06T15:38:56-08:00	
North Korea Joins Russia In Ukraine War – Analysis	Russia’s recent mutual defence treaty with North Korea and subsequent ratification by Russia’s State Duma, the lower House of the country’s parliament, has injected a new dimension to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. This Russia-North Korea bonhomie has drawn Ukraine as a proxy battlefield for Korean Peninsula tensions. Those stakeholders working for peace are alarmed by this development as the fault-lines are showing bigger cracks. The larger implications are on issues of disruptive security, governance, and technological risks that threaten peace, growth, and opportunity in the Indo-Pacific region, with added focus on Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula. The 'comprehensive strategic partnership' treaty signed in June in Pyongyang during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit includes a clause committing the two states to providing military support 'without delay' if either is attacked. The ratification of the security treaty by the Russian Parliament has led the Ukraine crisis into a hazardous new phase. Recent intelligence reports from the US revealed that North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to aid fight against Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. As reported in the New York Times, John F. Kirby, a national security spokesman at the White House, said North Korea had sent at least 3,000 soldiers into training sites in eastern Russia between early- to mid-October 2024. These soldiers believed to have travelled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia. The soldiers then travelled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in Eastern Russia, where they are currently believed to be undergoing training. Though there is no information as of now if these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability. The participation of North Korean soldiers in Russia’s war in Ukraine, though a dramatic move, also could mean a sign of Russia’s weakness, not strength, as Russia that boasts of a mighty military power had to depend on a tiny new allay for its war in Ukraine. Viewed differently, this unprecedented level of direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is indeed a matter of worry as the security implications in Europe and the Indo-Pacific could be huge. Being concerned about this new twist as the Korean Peninsula and Inter-Korean issue has escalated further following the Russia-North Korea bonhomie, South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador and urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean soldiers from Russia. Interestingly, the Kremlin has denied the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia despite satellite pictures testify to the contrary. Since the security environment centring on inter-Korean relations in the Korean Peninsula is already fragile and volatile, the deployment of third-party ground forces risks transforming the conflict between Russia and Ukraine into even more of a global security crisis. The military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is scaled up dramatically after Vladimir Putin visited North Korea and signed a comprehensive defense treaty in June 2024. After North Korea started supplying ammunition to Russia, bilateral ties between the two developed into a more sustained partnership. South Korea’s intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported that dozens of North Korean officers and one prominent missile development expert, Kim Jong-sik, travelled to Russian frontline positions providing direct guidance on using Pyongyang’s weaponry to Moscow’s forces. The presence of these officers marks North Korea’s significant shift from arms supplier to active participant. This collaboration offers mutual benefits. Due to the prolonged war, Russia badly needed munitions and potential manpower from North Korea. In the three-year conflict, Russia has the casualty of between 100,000 and 200,000 soldiers and therefore it is expected that Russia would induct around 10,000 troops from North Korea by December 2024. Putin is aware that North Korea has a massive conventional military, with 1.3 million active soldiers and an additional 7.6 million on reserve, almost a third of its population. North Korean soldiers are experienced and serving a mandatory eight to ten years but their actual capabilities is less known since the country remains isolated. It is also believed despite bold claims, North Korea possess outdated weapons systems. This is because an estimated half of the KN-23 missiles used by Russia believed to have exploded midair. This offers crucial insights to how sophisticated are North Korea’s military technological capabilities. Pyongyang’s adversaries such as the US and South Korea are obviously aware of this. There are other adverse consequences that Kim Jong-un need to factor in. The distressed member of troops deployed to the frontlines would be more miserable now, though they continue to stay under domestic control and have no option than to suffer. Also, if some North Korean troops decide to use this opportunity to defect or claim exceptional considerations if captured as prisons of war, human rights issue can make international highlights. The world knows that the Kim regime takes defection as a serious affront and issues strict punishments, including imprisonment of family members or even execution for some returned defectors. Obviously South Korea is alarmed as it would have reason to feel that North Korea’s military involvement in Ukraine could both legitimise Pyongyang’s weapons program and provide combat experience that could threaten South Korean security. Seoul also contends that North Korean troops in Ukraine violate UN precedents, including recent UN General Assembly resolutions condemning military cooperation with Russia. There is indeed a danger that the participation of a third nation in Ukraine conflict risks triggering a global war, given the complex web of security alliances and the potential for escalation beyond Ukraine's borders. Russia however counters that the current cooperation between Russia and North Korea does not run counter to the security interests of South Korea and that such cooperation is being realized within the framework of international law. The US considers the involvement of North Korean troops in the Ukraine conflict on Russia’s behalf as a major escalation and shall have serious impact not only in Europe but in the Indo-Pacific as well. The Russia-North Korea defence deal signals a fundamental shift in global power dynamics. Japan too is concerned about the deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia as worrying, given its impact on the security of the region surrounding Japan. So, the situation is more complicated and risk threshold is feared to be breached any time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeJdce31iPFAtOquzvuSidQ	2024-11-06T09:27:22-08:00	
Trump’s Victory Seen Through India’s Eyes – OpEd	Trump's electoral politics matches Modi's in India Republican party candidate Donald Trump's decisive victory over Democrat Kamala Harris in the November 5 US Presidential election looks remarkably like Narendra Modi's sweeping victories in the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary elections in India. Both Trump and Modi won against candidates or parties which were clueless about the mood and aspirations of the people at the grassroots level, while they were clued into them. In the US, the earlier Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, was aged and infirm. His midstream replacement, Kamala Harris, was younger and fit. She also performed creditably in the debate with Trump. But her campaign lacked clear messages to the voters about her plan to tackle America's problems, other than Trump's fascistic predilections. But fighting fascism was an issue only among a section of the elite, the Left liberals, not the hoi polloi. The common man whether White, Latino, Brown or Black, was facing real life issues like unemployment and illegal immigration. On these, Harris did not have a clear or original line. In foreign policy, there was no indication that the US under Harris would not bumble as it had been bumbling under Biden. In the case of the Indian leader in 2014, Narendra Modi, he was a beacon of hope for the youth wanting India to come out the psychological rut that it had got into under the 10-year rule of the Congress party. Modi came on to the scene as a gust of fresh air. Though subsequently, his economic performance only enriched the rich, he whipped up Hindu nationalism especially after a terror act just before the 2019 elections. He reaped a good harvest of votes as a result. In the 2024 elections Modi was mauled, but not eliminated as he was able to remain in power with the help of two allies. In the 2024 elections, the Congress had exploited some of the grievances of the people, but it had not cultivated the Hindu constituency, the biggest in the country. The Congress' support base was widespread but it had no large core constituency. In the US, Trump had popular issues to exploit other than the broader issue of the Biden Administration's lacklustre performance both at home and abroad. Biden's effort to restore peace in the Middle East was insincere and ineffective. So were its efforts to help Ukraine stop the Russian war machine. Sanctions against Russia and Iran had failed to deliver results. In Asia, China could not be contained. And on top of all that, Democratic candidate Harris did not have a fresh approach to any of these issues. Trump's campaign rode on the resentment of disenchanted voters. It capitalized on the cultural fractures and tribal politics that Trump has long exploited, TIME magazine wrote after Trump's victory. His support base, which was thought to be confined to the White poor majority, had expanded to included Latinos despite his threats of mass detention and deportation of migrants. Erika Lee in her book 'America for Americans,' argues that Trump's immigration policies and statements are part of a long tradition of xenophobia-against Southern Europeans, against newcomers from Asia, Latin America and the Middle East-a tradition that has lived alongside America's self-perception as a nation of immigrants. The Whites were not put off with Trump's threat to unleash revenge against political enemies through the justice system or to use the military against US citizens. Surveys showed that men, particularly young men, were turning away from Biden the most, especially over the economy. They appreciated Trump's brashness and habit of smashing norms, TIME said. Trump's announcement of 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate helped counter Harris on the age issue. The female vote was posing a challenge because of his no abortion policy. Finally, on October1, he issued a statement that he would not have a federal policy on abortion but leave the matter to the States. This helped him get female votes. TIME pointed out that in the final weeks of the campaign, billionaire Elon Musk poured more than US$ 100 million to help Trump in swing states. 'Musk hired staffers and incentivized them with pay outs to reach voters. He personally camped out in Pennsylvania, seen by both sides as the pivotal battleground state, and handed out US$ 1 million checks in sweepstakes for registered voters who signed a petition.' In the election's final weeks, Musk used Far-Right's conspiracy theory that Democrats were 'importing' undocumented immigrants to swing states to irrevocably tilt the electoral map in their favour, TIME pointed out. 'If Trump doesn't win,' Musk warned, 'this is the last election.' Trump told TIME that he plans to use executive power to begin mass deportations of undocumented migrants. There will be a massive purge of the federal bureaucracy to weed out elements opposed to him using his control over the judiciary, the magazine further said. According to Al Jazeera, Trump will revive his 'America First' foreign policy, indicating a turn towards isolationism and less international collaboration. But he will continue to be pro-Israel. While in office, Trump had moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a move that was widely denounced. He also recognised Israel's claim to the occupied Golan Heights in Syria. But he did some good too. He brokered the 'Abraham Accords' between Israel and the Arab States. When he was President earlier, he unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 agreement that saw Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions against it. He heaped crippling sanctions on Iran and authorised the assassination of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Trump wants to stop the war in Ukraine but he may not negotiate a settlement but could stop funding NATO which will impact on Ukraine's ability to fight Russia. Trump has said that he will withdraw from NATO because its European members are not contributing enough. Trump places the US's economic relationship with China above other issues, such as human rights. He may go for a trade and tariff war with China as he did in 2018. He slapped tariffs on more than US$250 billion on Chinese imports. Nevertheless, Trump has expressed an affinity for China's strongman leader, President Xi Jinping as he said about Russia's Putin and India's Modi. Trump may also put stiff tariff barriers on imports from India, if India continues its protectionist policies. Likewise, he may not let India off the hook in the case of the attempted assassination of an American citizen of Indian origin, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, allegedly by India's agents. It is a question of America's sovereignty. The case is in a New York court. Although Trump seemed to be sympathetic to the Hindus' plight in Bangladesh, he is unlikely to please India on strategic and economic issues just as a matter of goodwill. Trump is quintessentially a transactional politician. For every favour he does to India, he would expect a reciprocal gesture. There will be no free lunches under his watch.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeJdce31iPFAggsbnJ6wvLl	2024-11-06T09:25:54-08:00	
Trump Wins US Presidential Election	Former U.S. President Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to earn a new four-year term as the country’s leader. In a tightly contested race, Trump secured at least 277 of the 538 available electoral votes in Tuesday’s election, giving him the necessary majority to become the first U.S. leader to win non-consecutive terms since the 1890s. Harris, the Democratic candidate who joined the race late after President Joe Biden dropped out in July, was trying to become the first woman elected to the U.S. presidency. Trump claimed victory early Wednesday as he thanked his supporters at a rally in Florida. 'This was a movement like nobody's ever seen before, and, frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,' Trump said. He pledged to 'fix our borders' and 'fix everything in our country.' Trump also said he would work to deliver a 'strong, safe and prosperous America.' A Harris campaign official told a crowd of her supporters in Washington that she would not address the gathering overnight but would speak later Wednesday. In the U.S. system, where the presidential election is tallied in a series of state-by-state contests, both Harris and Trump were quickly declared winners in states where their parties enjoy clear majority support, while the nation focused on roughly seven so-called battleground states that were expected to tip the balance in the direction of the winner. Ultimately it was Trump’s victories in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin that gave him the advantage. Republican success Tuesday extended to Congress, where the party won back a majority in the Senate with at least 51 of 100 seats. Control of the House of Representatives, which is currently held by Republicans, was not yet decided early Wednesday. Trump served from 2017-2021 but left office after losing to Biden in an election that Trump continued to falsely assert that he won. That denial helped fuel the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters who disrupted the official tallying of the 2020 election results. Trump and his allies also launched numerous legal challenges after the 2020 vote, with state and federal judges eventually dismissing more than 50 lawsuits. Since leaving office, Trump was convicted of 34 charges linked to hush money payments he made to an adult film actress in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Sentencing in that case is scheduled for November 26. Trump was also indicted in three other cases, including two accusing him of trying to illegally overturn the 2020 election and another alleging he took hundreds of highly secret national security documents to his Florida home. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated for a new term on January 20. A key foreign policy focus in a new Trump administration will be relations between the United States and China, including subjects such as trade, Taiwan and China’s actions in the South China Sea. Trump instituted a series of tariffs against Chinese imports amid a trade war with China during his previous administration. Vincent Wang, dean of the college of arts and sciences at Adelphi University, told VOA Mandarin that China would be less likely to take an aggressive stance than it would have been if Harris won. 'If Trump is elected, I think China may not dare, because he doesn't go through drafts, he has already said harsh words. If he wakes up today, he might say he's going to raise tariffs by 200 percent. If he wakes up tomorrow, he might want to bomb Beijing. So I think this so-called this Trump-type deterrent, on the contrary, will make them a little bit more restrained,' Wang said Tuesday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeJdce31iPFAtxN6At-sKBb	2024-11-06T09:21:00-08:00	
Central Asian Economies Are Booming As Region Builds On Energy, I...	As the war in Ukraine continues to reshape global trade routes, Central Asia’s economies are showing impressive growth, according to a recent report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The EBRD projects the region’s GDP will expand by 5.1 percent in 2024 and accelerate to 5.9 percent in 2025, fueled by rising revenues from commodities, increased infrastructure spending, and market-oriented reforms. With remittance flows surging, wages on the rise, and a boom in tourism, especially in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, Central Asia’s economies are seizing new opportunities while navigating increased scrutiny from the West. Governments across the region are ramping up investment in vital infrastructure sectors like transport, logistics, and energy to sustain growth. The EBRD also noted that 'intermediated trade' with Russia - once a major growth driver - has hit a ceiling following last year’s rapid expansion. In Kazakhstan, Central Asia’s largest economy, the EBRD forecasts 4.0 percent growth in 2024, rising to 5.5 percent in 2025 as the country pursues infrastructure projects and expands its Tengiz oil field. The country’s strategic position and energy exports make it a pivotal player in the region’s economic landscape, as it continues to balance its international trade commitments. As nuclear energy gains renewed attention globally, Kazakhstan's substantial uranium reserves - over 10 percent of the world's total – will enhance its significance as a key global supplier. Kyrgyzstan, a fast-growing hub for regional tourism, is expected to see GDP growth of 9 percent in 2024, moderating to 7 percent in 2025. While this growth is supported by hospitality and transport, some analysts argue that Kyrgyzstan’s accelerated rise stems from its possible role in helping Russia evade sanctions. Since 2022, trade with the EU has increased more than tenfold, with some reports citing 'false invoicing' practices allowing goods to be rerouted to Russia without physically entering Kyrgyzstan. In response, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned several Kyrgyz companies last year, also warning banks against facilitating trade with sanctioned Russian entities. Under mounting international pressure, Kyrgyz authorities imposed a one-year ban in September on banking transactions for import-export deals where goods do not physically enter the country. They also established the 'Trading Company of the Kyrgyz Republic,' a state-owned entity exempt from this ban and tasked with managing such trade - a move some critics have already labeled as 'nationalizing' financial flows associated with sanctions evasion. The new trading company is expected to collaborate with state-owned RSC Bank and Aiyl Bank, along with the recently registered private Asman Bank, which has ties to Russia, to facilitate transactions in alternative currencies, including cryptocurrencies, potentially circumventing Western financial restrictions. In Tajikistan, the EBRD projects 8 percent growth in 2024, driven by higher wages, a focus on infrastructure, and precious metals exports, though the country faces volatility in remittances from Russia. Tajikistan has several massive investment projects in hydropower and mining underway. Meanwhile, Turkmenistan is expected to maintain steady 6.3 percent growth through 2025, backed by public investments and streamlined customs procedures. While improved trade efficiency supports the country’s transportation sector, Turkmenistan remains highly dependent on gas exports to China, leaving it exposed to shifts in Chinese demand. Uzbekistan is also seeing strong economic momentum, with 6.0 percent growth anticipated in both 2024 and 2025, bolstered by remittances, tourism, and industrial expansion. However, a persistent energy deficit threatens to cap growth in the coming years. While Central Asia’s per capita GDP has tripled since 2000, the region still lags behind global standards of living. Nikolai Podguzov, chairman of the Eurasian Development Bank, emphasized that sustained economic progress will require more industrialization. 'If we want fast and sustainable growth, industry is essential,' he said, highlighting the need for Central Asian economies to generate high-value jobs and raise incomes to improve overall living standards.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrfGulsZuxtn_	2024-11-06T09:14:45-08:00	
Can Trump Make America Great Again? – OpEd	Allies and supporters of the United States who praise it as the champion of democracy, freedom and human rights will now be rushing to join the media queue to congratulate the incoming president. In their public messaging, they are likely to extol the outcome as yet another example of American exceptionalism and a role model for the countries of the world they regard as autocratic and necessary to bring down to uphold their definition of democracy and the western rule of law. Privately though, they will be feeling and reacting differently. They are also likely to be very afraid of what will now follow. The explanation is not far to find. Though portrayed in Western media as offering vastly different visions of the US for the next four years as well as being diametrically opposed in their foreign policy objectives, both Harris and Trump concur in adherence to the slogan made famous by Trump: that is to 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA). It is a slogan which Democrat party leaders embrace just as strongly but would rather not let the rest of the world be aware of or knowledgeable about. How Will MAGA impact US Foreign Policy? Post election, Trump can be expected to push the MAGA foreign policy agenda hard and at the expense of the interests and concerns of the rest of the world. MAGAs foreign policy impact will be felt not only by countries which the US sees as rivals and enemies - China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Serbia, Venezuela, Belarus and others. It will also inflict costs on allies including Canada, European Union nations, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and a few others such as the Philippines previously provided with generous financial and military support by a moneyed and powerful benefactor which is now relatively impoverished and less influential. Countries not hitched to the American ideological bandwagon that see themselves as independent such as Mexico, India and Vietnam will find that sitting on the fence in the next four years will be much less comfortable as the new US president will not shield or spare them from the looming policy changes in trade, economy, finance, immigration, security, climate change and wherever else he sees as important and necessary to uplift the US and stem its decline. Earlier in July, the Economist drew up a table ranking the vulnerability of various countries likely to be impacted by a new Trump presidency’s core policies. The table, The Trump Risk Index, assessed the exposure and vulnerability of America’s 70 largest trading partners to potential policy changes. No similar table was drawn up for a Harris presidency indicating that the newspaper had doubts on her possible victory. Source: Increasingly, we find that liberal and conservative American analysts - both now recognizing that the US is in an existential crisis - are converging in support of MAGA to be the focus of US foreign policy. The crisis, a long developing one, exposes not only the deep divisions within American society with equal numbers on Republican and Democrat sides of the political fence in disagreement on the domestic policy reforms that the country badly needs. It also brings to attention the current status of the US described by Trump as 'a failing country'. It is a description that some Americans have taken umbrage with but which many Democrat supporters agree on too whilst denouncing the Republican and Trumpian rhetoric and record on failing to improve the state of the nation. What is perhaps most unsettling is that the disorder and instability in the US may see the new President become more reliant on US military superiority to ensure American dominance in global geopolitics. The US military might again be called upon to underpin the foreign policy actions needed to make America great again. Is a last hurrah coming to ensure that the US continues its defence of the unipolar world that it has shaped and imposed on the rest of the world and which the western military-industrial-media complex is fixated on preserving? Leaders around the world will be hoping that President Trump will work to ensure that the US plays a key role in upholding and championing the much impaired and endangered cause of peaceful coexistence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrcQprKvkyXGe	2024-11-06T09:12:52-08:00	
Wings Of Unity: Indus Shield 2024 Military Exercise – OpEd	A landmark multilateral military exercise Indus Shield 2024 conducted by Pakistan, serves as a testament to the nation's commitment to regional stability and its growing role in international defense cooperation. This exercise, which brings together a diverse range of military forces and strategic partners, demonstrates Pakistan's evolving security posture, its commitment to peace in the South Asian region, and its expanding role in global defense networks. Indus Shield 2024 is not just a routine military exercise; it is an emblem of Pakistan's strategic vision for defense diplomacy and international collaboration. It underscores the country’s position as a significant player in the South Asian security complex and highlights its growing influence in global defense forums. Pakistan’s military is regarded as one of the most capable and experienced in the region, and exercises like Indus Shield allow the country to showcase its operational readiness, interoperability with allied forces, and commitment to maintaining peace in a region marked by volatility. The name 'Indus Shield' is symbolic of Pakistan's deep historical roots and its geographical and cultural importance. The Indus River, one of the world’s oldest civilizations' cradle, is not only a vital natural resource for the country but also a metaphor for the defense of peace and stability. By invoking this name, the exercise emphasizes the nation's resilience, as well as its role as a regional stabilizer, much like the river itself which sustains life across Pakistan’s vast plains. Pakistan’s geostrategic position in South Asia places it at the nexus of multiple security concerns. To the west lies Afghanistan, which has faced decades of conflict, and to the east is India, with whom Pakistan has had a complex and often adversarial relationship. The region also grapples with other security challenges, including terrorism, insurgency, and the broader challenge of great-power competition between global powers like the United States, China, and Russia. Given these factors, Pakistan has had to continuously adapt its defense strategy to ensure both internal stability and regional peace. This has meant not only strengthening its own military capabilities but also fostering closer defense ties with international partners who share an interest in maintaining peace and security in South Asia. The Indus Shield exercise is a key element of this broader strategic effort, emphasizing joint military training, counterterrorism collaboration, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief operations, and interoperability with allied forces. By hosting and participating in exercises like Indus Shield 2024, Pakistan sends a clear message about its commitment to countering the growing security challenges in the region. Whether it's the threat of cross-border terrorism, the need for peacekeeping missions, or the need for stability in the Indian Ocean region, these multinational defense collaborations demonstrate that Pakistan is not only a passive observer of regional events but an active participant in shaping the security landscape. One of the key goals of the Indus Shield exercise is to enhance the interoperability of military forces. Modern warfare increasingly requires coordination and seamless communication between forces from different countries and backgrounds, a necessity underscored by Pakistan’s strategic partnerships with various regional and global powers. The ability to work effectively with allied forces is crucial, particularly in the event of multinational peacekeeping operations or humanitarian crises. The Indus Shield 2024 exercise brings together a wide range of military forces from various countries, with Pakistan at the helm. These exercises involve comprehensive training in counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, urban warfare, border security, and disaster management. Such joint training programs ensure that the participating nations' forces can operate in unison during crises or conflict situations. Military interoperability is particularly important for Pakistan, as the country is an active member of a range of international security organizations, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), and the Pakistan-China military cooperation. As these alliances grow stronger, exercises like Indus Shield allow participating countries to harmonize their tactics, techniques, and procedures, ensuring swift, effective responses in the face of evolving security challenges. The Indus Shield 2024 exercise reflects Pakistan's proactive stance in expanding its defense cooperation beyond its immediate neighborhood. In recent years, Pakistan has sought to broaden its military relationships with countries across Asia, Europe, and even the Middle East, recognizing that defense cooperation is not only about countering traditional military threats but also about addressing non-traditional security concerns like climate change, cyber threats, and the rise of non-state actors. In addition to its traditional military partnerships with China and the United States, Pakistan has strengthened its defense ties with Russia, Turkey, and the Middle Eastern states. These collaborations are integral to Pakistan's broader vision of a multi-dimensional security strategy that addresses both traditional military threats and non-traditional security challenges. As a result, exercises like Indus Shield provide a platform for these countries to share intelligence, exchange best practices, and develop joint solutions to common security concerns. The growing role of Pakistan in regional and global defense cooperation is also facilitated by its increasing participation in multinational peacekeeping and disaster relief operations. The Pakistan Army, recognized for its expertise in peacekeeping, has consistently contributed to United Nations missions around the world. By hosting multinational exercises such as Indus Shield, Pakistan strengthens its position as a reliable partner for peace and stability in both regional and international forums. One of the focal points of Indus Shield 2024 is counterterrorism and counterinsurgency training. Pakistan has been at the frontline of the global war on terror, facing both internal and external security threats from various militant groups. The country has invested heavily in counterterrorism operations in its border regions, particularly in areas bordering Afghanistan and India. These operations have ranged from eliminating militant groups operating in the region to enhancing border security and intelligence sharing. By focusing on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, Indus Shield contributes to enhancing the capabilities of participating countries to deal with asymmetrical threats. These threats, including those posed by insurgent groups and terrorist organizations, require a unique set of skills that blend traditional military expertise with intelligence gathering, technology, and cooperation across borders. In this context, Pakistan’s experience in these domains serves as an invaluable resource for allied nations. The exercise also enables participants to build joint strategies for dealing with the root causes of terrorism, including economic instability, political marginalization, and sectarian violence. In addition to its military objectives, the Indus Shield exercise also emphasizes humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. Pakistan is located in a region prone to natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones, and the Pakistan Army has developed a reputation for its swift and effective response to such crises. These operations often involve not just the military, but also civilian agencies and international partners. In this regard, Indus Shield 2024 also focuses on improving the capabilities of participating forces in disaster response and management. The participation of international partners in humanitarian missions further strengthens Pakistan’s international standing. By demonstrating its capacity to coordinate and collaborate with global forces in disaster relief, Pakistan not only showcases its military proficiency but also its commitment to the welfare of humanity. Indus Shield 2024 represents a significant step forward for Pakistan in its quest to reinforce regional stability, deepen its international defense cooperation, and expand its role on the global stage. The exercise serves as a powerful reminder that security in South Asia cannot be ensured in isolation. It is a collective responsibility that demands active collaboration, trust-building, and the ability to work together in the face of common threats. As the world becomes more interconnected and security challenges grow increasingly complex, Pakistan’s role as a key player in international defense cooperation will continue to grow. The Indus Shield 2024 exercise is a clear indication that the country is committed to being a central force for peace and stability in the region and beyond, marking a new chapter in its defense diplomacy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrYL5m2tuYvIU	2024-11-06T09:11:20-08:00	
The Case For New Provinces In Pakistan: Enhancing Governance And ...	Pakistan’s administrative landscape, divided into 38 divisions across its four provinces—Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Balochistan—along with two autonomous territories, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), is a complex tapestry reflecting the country’s vast geographic and demographic diversity. As a nation of over 220 million people, Pakistan’s current administrative structure struggles to balance governance, development, and representation across varied regions and ethnicities. The creation of new provinces, proposed by many as a means of enhancing these aspects, deserves serious consideration. This shift could be transformative, fostering a more equitable distribution of resources, effective governance, and greater political representation. Proponents of new provinces argue that provincial autonomy could unlock numerous benefits, including streamlined administration, enhanced political representation, and localized economic development. At present, the allocation of resources and development funds is heavily centralized. For instance, areas like South Punjab and Hazara often feel marginalized within their respective provinces, with resources disproportionately directed toward provincial capitals and economic hubs like Lahore and Karachi. New provinces could bring local governments closer to the people they serve, fostering greater accountability and empowering residents with improved access to funds and services. Pakistan’s challenges are not unique, and there are global precedents for devolution and provincial restructuring that offer valuable insights. Kenya’s shift to 47 counties in 2013 was driven by similar goals of localized governance and resource allocation, allowing more equitable development across the country. India’s decision to carve out the state of Telangana from Andhra Pradesh in 2014 similarly aimed at empowering a region that had long felt neglected under the larger state structure. The benefits of such models are clear: decentralization can mitigate ethnic, linguistic, and political tensions while enabling smaller administrative units to address local issues more effectively. More recently, Indonesia’s plans to create additional provinces in the Papua region underscore a growing recognition of the need to accommodate regional aspirations within a framework that promotes national unity. In Pakistan’s case, the creation of provinces such as South Punjab, Hazara, and FATA could address longstanding grievances and foster a sense of inclusion among historically marginalized populations. Potential Provinces and Their Unique Needs Several proposed provinces are frequently mentioned in discussions of administrative restructuring in Pakistan, each with its own unique case: South Punjab Province: This region, which forms a significant part of Punjab, has long felt marginalized due to a perceived lack of resources and infrastructure development. A new province here would allow for a more focused approach to development in southern Punjab, enabling policies tailored to local economic needs, which are often agricultural. Hazara Province: Located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Hazara is home to distinct linguistic and cultural groups who have advocated for provincial status for years. Establishing Hazara as a separate province could improve governance by catering to its specific cultural and social needs, which are often overshadowed within KP’s broader Pashtun-majority landscape. FATA Province: Formerly a federally administered tribal area, FATA was merged into KP in 2018. However, the integration process has faced challenges, and many argue that FATA would benefit from provincial status to better address its unique development needs and longstanding socioeconomic challenges. Seraiki Province: Similar to South Punjab, the Seraiki-speaking region of Punjab has its distinct linguistic and cultural identity. A Seraiki province could empower the people of this region by giving them control over their own administrative and economic priorities, fostering a sense of cultural pride and representation. Karachi Province: Karachi, Pakistan’s economic heart, presents a unique case. Its diverse population, massive economic output, and urban challenges necessitate a governance model that can address urban planning, law enforcement, and infrastructure issues more effectively. Provincial status could enable Karachi to better manage its resources and cater to its complex demographics. Gilgit-Baltistan Province: Although GB has a certain degree of autonomy, it is yet to be granted full provincial status. This change could give its residents greater political rights and improve federal investments in critical areas like infrastructure and tourism, boosting the region’s potential for sustainable development. Establishing new provinces is a complex process that requires careful planning, particularly in a diverse and politically dynamic country like Pakistan. A gradual, phase-wise approach could help manage this transition smoothly. Rather than attempting to overhaul the administrative landscape in one stroke, the government could prioritize certain areas where the demand for provincial status is most pressing and where the potential benefits are clearly identifiable. For instance, South Punjab and Hazara could serve as pilot projects, allowing Pakistan to assess the impacts of provincial restructuring and make adjustments as necessary. The phase-wise model would also enable local governments to gradually assume control over finances and administrative responsibilities, reducing the risk of political and bureaucratic resistance. While the creation of new provinces has potential benefits, it is not without challenges. The financial cost of establishing new provincial governments, administrative bodies, and infrastructure would be significant. Additionally, the redistribution of resources and political power could provoke opposition from existing provincial administrations. Pakistan’s federal government would need to ensure that this restructuring does not exacerbate existing political tensions or encourage separatist sentiments. Moreover, the process must prioritize inclusivity and local participation. The federal and provincial governments should engage with local communities, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to build consensus and address concerns about the administrative, economic, and political implications of new provinces. The creation of new provinces in Pakistan is an idea whose time has come. With an increasingly diverse population and mounting governance challenges, Pakistan must consider administrative reforms that promote equitable development, representation, and political stability. Learning from international models, Pakistan can navigate this transition through a measured, inclusive approach that empowers its regions while strengthening national unity. By taking steps toward restructuring its administrative landscape, Pakistan can lay the foundation for a future marked by stronger governance, enhanced political representation, and sustainable economic growth	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrfZ4JDQt8owx	2024-11-06T09:09:59-08:00	
Atmanirbhar Narishakti: Concept, Components And Challenges – OpEd	The concept of Atmanirbhar Narishakti (self-reliant women’s empowerment) has evolved from India’s historical movements for women’s rights and empowerment, but it gained focused momentum under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and its origin, evolution, and development rooted within India's social, political, and economic contexts. Now, it is a key initiative in India that emphasizes empowering women to become self-reliant, independent, and active contributors to the economy and society. This concept aligns with the broader goals of the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-Reliant India) mission initiated by the Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Its key components and focus areas include: a. Economic Empowerment: Promoting women's participation in entrepreneurship through loans and financial incentives under schemes like PM Mudra Yojana and Stand-Up India. Encouraging self-help groups (SHGs) by linking them with markets and financial institutions. b. Skill Development: Initiatives to enhance women's skills through Skill India programs. Training in digital and traditional skills, such as handicrafts, agriculture, and IT. c. Health and Well-being: Focus on Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao to improve education and healthcare opportunities for girls. Promotion of menstrual hygiene and maternal health programs. d. Social Security and Support: Programs like Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and National Creche Scheme to support working mothers. Insurance schemes such as PM Jan Dhan Yojana and PM Suraksha Bima Yojana for women's financial security. e. Legal and Policy Support: Steps to enhance safety through women's helplines, One-Stop Centers, and stricter laws against domestic violence and harassment. Amendments to encourage more women in leadership and decision-making positions, such as reservation in government roles and education. The Atmanirbhar Narishakti Yojana, often announced as part of national budget measures, aims to foster inclusivity by ensuring women's active participation in achieving India's economic self-reliance. By integrating empowerment with economic policies, the movement intends to unlock the untapped potential of millions of Indian women, promoting their development alongside national growth. Origin and development In ancient India, women enjoyed considerable respect and agency in certain spheres. However, in the medieval period, women's status declined due to societal restrictions, practices like purdah, and limited education and its larger aspects include: a. Colonial Era (19th-20th Century): Social reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Savitribai Phule began campaigns against practices like sati, child marriage, and promoted women's education. The Indian National Movement also saw active female participation, with leaders like Sarojini Naidu and Aruna Asaf Ali, who advocated for women's rights along with political independence. b. Post-Independence Development: The Indian Constitution (1950) recognized gender equality and prohibited discrimination based on sex (Article 15). Over the years, the government initiated several welfare and empowerment programs. Key Policy Interventions: 1955: The Hindu Marriage Act outlawed polygamy and introduced divorce rights for women. 1975: India celebrated International Women’s Year, reflecting global awareness of gender issues. In the 1990s, liberalization led to greater focus on women’s economic inclusion. Self-help groups (SHGs) gained importance, especially in rural areas, promoting financial independence for women. c. Emergence of the Concept: Atmanirbhar Bharat and Atmanirbhar Narishakti (Post-2020): The Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan was launched in 2020 to promote self-reliance and economic resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This larger mission emphasized local production, entrepreneurship, and sustainability across sectors. Atmanirbhar Narishakti emerged as an integral part of this initiative, reflecting the recognition that achieving self-reliance for India requires empowering women as economic contributors. d. Recent Development and Focus Area: Since 2021, the Atmanirbhar Narishakti initiative has grown through targeted programs and policies. These developments highlight the evolving priorities: Microfinance and Entrepreneurship Support: Expansion of self-help groups (SHGs) to promote women-led micro-businesses. Programs like the Mudra Yojana providing loans to women entrepreneurs. Skill Development Programs: Special training under Skill India focusing on both traditional crafts and modern technologies. Promotion of digital literacy through PM Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA). Social Reforms and Welfare: Mission Shakti introduced to address safety and protection for women. Focus on menstrual health and well-being under various health programs. Legislative Changes: Enhanced reservation policies to promote women's participation in governance and politics. Reforms addressing domestic violence and workplace harassment to ensure a safer environment for working women. Atmanirbhar Narishakti reflects a modern evolution of India’s women’s empowerment agenda, moving beyond welfare to active economic participation. Rooted in historical movements and refined by modern socio-economic needs, this initiative aligns with the vision of a self-reliant India where women's contributions are pivotal to national growth. This concept's strength lies in integrating economic independence with social equality, empowering women not just as beneficiaries but as drivers of change and development. Potential challenges The Atmanirbhar Narishakti initiative, despite being ambitious, faces several challenges in achieving its goals of women’s empowerment and economic self-reliance. These challenges are rooted in economic, social, cultural, and structural issues that have persisted in India for decades. a. Economic Challenges: Limited Access to Finance: Despite schemes likeMudra Yojana, many women still face difficulties in accessing formal credit due to lack of collateral, limited financial literacy, and dependence on male family members. Women-led enterprises are often small-scale and struggle to access markets and value chains, limiting their growth. b. Structural and Institutional: Inadequate Infrastructure and Support Systems: Lack of access to childcare services, safe transportation, and healthcare facilitieslimits women's ability to participate in the workforce, particularly in rural and urban slum areas. Many women entrepreneurs struggle with the digital divide—limited access to technology and internet connectivity hampers efforts toward digital literacy and entrepreneurship. c. Safety and Legal Issues: Workplace Harassment and Violence: Women often face harassment and discrimination at workplaces, especially in the informal sector where labour laws are weak or poorly enforced. Fear of gender-based violence in public spaces limits women’s mobility and participation in economic activities. Ineffective Grievance Redressal Mechanisms: Despite the introduction of One-Stop Centers and women's helplines, many women do not report harassment due to social stigma or distrust in the legal system. d. Digital Divide and Technological Exclusion: Limited Digital Literacy: A significant digital divide exists between men and women, with women having less access to mobile phones, the internet, and digital skills. As digital platforms become central to financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, this gap puts women at a disadvantage in accessing government schemes, markets, and e-commerce opportunities. Challenges in Remote Learning and Work: Women often face difficulties balancing remote work or learning with household responsibilities, highlighting the gendered nature of time poverty. Policy and Governance Gaps: Lack of Awareness about Government Programs: Many women, especially in rural areas, are unaware of existing schemes and benefits available under Atmanirbhar Bharat and related initiatives. Bureaucratic processes and corruption further complicate access to these programs. While efforts have been made toward women-centric policies, there is a lack of gender-responsive budgeting to ensure adequate allocation of resources for women’s empowerment programs. The Atmanirbhar Narishakti initiative offers a promising vision of empowering women and promoting self-reliance. However, its success hinges on addressing the multi-faceted challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrZ6-Qp0PgOG3	2024-11-06T09:08:34-08:00	
Trump’s Return: Navigating Peace In The Israeli-Palestinian Confl...	With Donald Trump’s return, the White House is set to undergo significant shifts in both domestic and foreign policy. Donald Trump’s return to the presidency re-opens a complex chapter in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the recent intensification of violence in Gaza. The conflict, marked by devastating casualties and destruction, has brought international attention back to the underlying tensions between Israel and Palestinians, with Gaza as a flashpoint. Trump, who campaigned on promises to end 'Endless Wars' and prioritize American disengagement from foreign entanglements, now faces the challenge of addressing this crisis. In a region where diplomatic peace efforts have historically struggled, Trump’s approach to the conflict will need to evolve to reflect both his commitment to reducing U.S. involvement in wars and his strong alliance with Israel. In Trump’s first term, he brokered the 'Abraham Accords', which established diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. While these agreements marked a shift toward regional cooperation and economic growth, they bypassed Palestinian leaders, leaving unresolved core issues such as Palestinian sovereignty, the future of Jerusalem, and the right of return for refugees. While the accords generated economic opportunities, particularly in tourism and trade, they also underscored a new regional alignment focused more on countering Iran than addressing Palestinian grievances. As an armed conflict between Israel and Palestine has been taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7th 2023, Trump’s new administration may face pressure to revisit these unresolved issues. His previous strategy prioritized economic initiatives for Palestinians through a 'Peace to Prosperity' plan, which proposed billions in foreign investment in Palestinian territories. This approach, however, was criticized for offering economic incentives in place of addressing Palestinians’ aspirations for sovereignty and self-determination. For a sustainable solution, Trump’s administration might need to shift from purely economic strategies to a more comprehensive diplomatic engagement that includes Palestinian leadership, as economic development alone has proven insufficient in achieving lasting peace. The geopolitical landscape in the Middle East has also shifted since Trump’s last term. At the same time, recent normalization talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran indicate a thaw in relations that could reshape regional dynamics. Trump’s potential continuation of the Abraham Accords could include attempts to bring Saudi Arabia into formal normalization with Israel, but Saudi Arabia has maintained that resolving the Palestinian issue is crucial before it formalizes relations. Trump’s re-engagement in the region may require a delicate balance advancing the accords without sidelining Palestinian aspirations, particularly with Gaza’s instability affecting regional stability. One of Trump’s most controversial decisions during his previous term was his 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This move was celebrated by Israelis but deeply alienated Palestinian leadership, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The decision significantly strained U.S.-Palestinian relations, with Palestinian leaders subsequently disengaging from U.S.-led peace efforts. If Trump hopes to foster a more balanced approach, he might consider symbolic gestures to Palestinians, such as re-opening the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem – a move President Biden had suggested but did not fully execute. This gesture could signal a willingness to recognize Palestinian interests without retracting support for Israel, thereby re-establishing diplomatic channels with Palestinian authorities. The recent Gaza war has highlighted the urgency of addressing Palestinian grievances within any U.S.-backed peace framework. To this end, Trump’s strategy could involve pairing economic support for Palestinian communities with meaningful diplomatic engagements. Working closely with moderate Arab allies like Jordan and Egypt, his administration could create a more credible peace process, bridging economic development with political dialogue. However, Trump’s 'America First' policy and promises to end foreign conflicts mean that his administration would likely aim to facilitate peace efforts without entangling the U.S. in direct military interventions. If he is to uphold his commitment to avoid 'Endless Wars', Trump may prefer diplomatic support to military involvement in any escalation related to Gaza. Building trust with Palestinians, who have long viewed the U.S. as heavily pro-Israel, remains another critical challenge. Issues such as settlement expansion, the boundaries of a potential Palestinian state, and refugee rights remain central to any viable peace plan. The Gaza crisis illustrates how unresolved grievances can quickly destabilize efforts for broader peace in the region. For Trump to make progress, his administration may need to address these political issues alongside economic ones, acknowledging the importance of sovereignty and security for Palestinians to reduce the risk of future escalations. Trump’s second term offers him a chance to shape a new path forward in the Middle East. With the Abraham Accords as a foundation, his new administration can build on regional normalization while also considering the realities on the ground in Gaza. However, balancing his campaign promises to avoid U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts with the need for active diplomacy will be challenging. Should Trump succeed in crafting a strategy that brings together both economic and political dimensions, he could create a lasting legacy in the region. As he takes office, the international community is watching closely to see if his administration can navigate this complex terrain and achieve stability in a conflict that has resisted resolution for decades. For Trump, this may be a defining moment; a chance to leave a lasting legacy by shaping a new and more stable Middle East.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrdNrfgDu0Uzz	2024-11-06T09:07:00-08:00	
Next Up—New Supreme Court Justices – OpEd	According to the Washington Post, Donald Trump won the Catholic vote 56 percent to 41 percent. That’s a great triumph for religious liberty. As we previously documented, there were far more victories for religious liberty under the Trump administration than under Biden-Harris. He is poised to enhance his record. To do that he needs to lock in a religious-friendly Supreme Court for decades to come. Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch; the first two are Catholic and Gorsuch, who was raised Catholic, is Protestant. All are good on religious liberty. Chief Justice John Roberts, another Catholic, is mostly reliable on this issue. Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, both staunch Catholics, are rock solid on this First Amendment right. Thomas is 76. Alito is 74. Both have served with distinction. They are bright and courageous and have been subjected to incredible vitriol. Indeed, they have survived attempts to destroy them by the masters of personal destruction: those who work in the media, left-wing advocacy organizations, the entertainment industry, and education have worked overtime to smear them. The Left failed to bring them down. Halleluiah. But early next year it will be time for them to step down. If Trump can appoint two more just like them—he can’t do any better—he will secure a religious-friendly court for decades. There is nothing the Catholic bashers would like less.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ6CIMWK6BrZ7XZWGWhlJv	2024-11-06T09:05:33-08:00	
Orban And European Meetings In Budapest: ‘It’s My Party And I’ll ...	By Alexander Faludy Hungarian PM Viktor Orban will host two key meetings of European bodies in Budapest this week. Isolated among EU partners, Orban will be looking to a Trump US election win to bolster his position. On Thursday and Friday, Budapest’s Puskas Arena will play host to two important European fixtures — with much at stake for the home side. Unusually, these will be political not sporting events: the 4th meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) followed by an informal session of the European Council the next day. The EPC was founded in 2022 in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It’s an intergovernmental format for fostering European-wide cooperation beyond EU borders. The EPC comprises all European countries except for Belarus, Russia and the Vatican, but also includes Turkey and the states of the South Caucasus. The European Council is the EU’s meeting of heads of state and government. While lacking legislative power (which belongs to the EU Parliament and Council of Ministers), it is vital for guiding the bloc’s policy agenda. Regardless of the outcomes of these events, their mere occurrence in Budapest is remarkable. Hungary’s six-month stint as president of the Council of the EU, which ends on December 31, has so far faced a symbolic boycott, with many member states as well as the European Commission choosing to be represented at meetings by officials and not at minister/commissioner level. Technical legislative work has continued while the Hungarian presidency itself has been robbed of symbolic capital. To boycott or not to boycott? Orban’s government has long experienced a strained relationship with the various EU institutions and member countries, on account of a deteriorating rule-of-law situation at home and his government’s close ties to Russia. The presidency boycott, however, arose principally 'because of Orban’s unauthorised and provocative ‘peace mission’ to Russia and China in early July,' says Peter Balazs, a former EU commissioner and Hungarian foreign minister. That trip breached protocol with Orban erroneously purporting to represent the EU, not just Hungary, and occasioned a backlash from Brussels and member states. Yet in relation to this week’s Budapest summits. Balazs thinks there’s a degree of hesitation about whether to maintain the boycott. National leaders, Balazs believes, will have been 'wondering what’s better for the EU?': either to boycott and 'thereby give Orban another chance to play the victim vis-à-vis the liberal mainstream'; or to attend and 'use this important gathering to make sharp criticisms of Orban’s ‘illiberal regime’ in his own country and before a wide international audience'. Counting in favour of continuing the boycott is Orban’s trip to Georgia on October 28, where he endorsed the ruling Georgian Dream party’s victory following disputed elections, raising issues akin to July’s ‘peace mission’. EU leaders may also have reservations about attending the Budapest meetings given Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto’s appearance last Thursday at the Russia-led Minsk International Conference on Eurasian Security in Belarus. Szijjarto‘s presence undermined the EU policy of isolating Belarus because of its close ties to Russia. He was photographed enjoying notably cordial interaction with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, with whom he also met privately. Afterwards, the Hungarian foreign minister attempted to deflect criticism, telling journalists: 'We have a sovereign right to negotiate with whomever we want.' Szijjarto’s trip was preceded by a Wednesday meeting at Budapest’s US embassy of ambassadors and defence attaches from NATO countries. A US embassy statement said the meeting was convened 'to discuss the security aspects of the Government of Hungary’s recently announced policy of economic ‘neutrality’.' US Ambassador David Pressman said Hungary’s 'growing dependencies on Moscow and Beijing have security implications for the US and Euro-Atlantic interests'. Indeed, 'that a discussion about an Ally’s ‘neutrality’ policy was necessary speaks for itself', he added. Yet, as Balazs argues, fellow European prime ministers may use the Budapest meetings as an opportunity to challenge Orban over his policies and behaviour. The chance that colleagues will deploy their presence, not absence, to embarrass the Hungarian premier are raised by the recent example set by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. When Orban addressed the EU Parliament in Strasbourg on October 9 to outline Hungary’s EU presidency program, von der Leyen didn’t boycott the event, rather she used a response statement to deliver a blistering critique of Orban, accusing him of undermining Europe’s shared response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and EU solidarity. 'There are still some who blame this war not on the invader but on the invaded; not on Putin’s lust for power but on Ukraine’s thirst for freedom,' Von der Leyen said, before castigating an uncomfortable-looking Orban, seated nearby, for weakening EU security. 'How can it be that the Hungarian government invites Russian nationals into our Union without additional security checks? And how can it be that the Hungarian government would allow Chinese police to operate within its territory?' she asked rhetorically. Balazs thinks it likely that not only von der Leyen but also other European leaders will repeat this strategy in Budapest. Geza Jeszenszky, a fellow former foreign minister who has also served at different times as ambassador in Washington in Washington and Oslo, agrees. 'Orban, with his vociferous hostility to the EU – which he simply calls ‘Brussels’ – has become most unpopular among his colleagues… At the upcoming EU summit Hungary’s policies will be severely criticised,' Jeszenszky tells BIRN. Playing the Trump card As of late Monday afternoon, no draft agenda had been released for either meeting – despite such documents typically being available seven to ten days in advance. The lack of information may have reflected either, the Hungarian government’s generally restrictive approach to communication or, uncertainty for the hosts’ regarding how to populate the program. But then on Monday evening, Zoltan Kovacs, the government’s spokesperson, posted on X more details about the EPC meeting, which will begin with a plenary session, followed by discussions on two major issues: migration and economic security. 'In the migration session, we’ll address all aspects of illegal immigration, while the economic panel will examine the interconnectedness of energy, transport, IT, and global trade – key pillars of European security and prosperity,' Kovacs posted. Orban’s ultimate approach to both meetings will depend significantly on the outcome of the US election on Tuesday. As previously reported by BIRN, Orban is understood to have extended an invitation to Donald Trump (still only a candidate) to address EU leaders either online or in person. Hungary’s prime minister has also made no attempt to disguise his support for the Republican nominee. 'We will open several bottles of champagne if Trump comes back,' he told journalists in Strasbourg following his bruising encounter with von der Leyen on October 9. Orban can be expected to steer the meetings in one of two possible directions, depending on the outcome of the US vote. If Trump is victorious, he’s likely to initiate a ‘grand strategy’ discussion regarding Europe’s positioning vis-à-vis the US and the Russia-Ukraine war. In case of a Kamala Harris win, however, he’ll likely keep discussion more narrowly focused on the priorities of Hungary’s presidency like 'stemming illegal immigration' and 'promoting a farmer-oriented EU agricultural policy'. In theory, Orban could expect some support from other leaders on such issues given that attitudes both to migration and the implications of the Green New Deal have hardened considerably of late. Other governments, including those of Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, advocate tougher border controls. Yet for these governments Hungary is unlikely to be regarded as an honest broker. 'No EU member state favours illegal migration, but Hungary pretends as if that were the case, causing irritation. Actual progress at the meeting is highly unlikely,' predicts Jeszenszky. Betting on the US election is a high stakes gamble given it’s on a knife-edge. The latest polls put Trump and Harris neck and neck, both nationally and in the crucial swing states that will determine which candidate gains a majority in the electoral college. According to Garvan Walshe, formerly a foreign policy advisor to the UK’s Conservative Party and now a visiting fellow at the CEU Democracy Institute in Budapest, 'If Trump wins, Orban will use it as a moment of triumph to position himself as the one European who can command Trump’s ear'. Conversely, in the event of a Harris victory, Walshe thinks that Orban 'will struggle not to be alone at his own party'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdQxR8ou-W2fwnFCzTaAsyb	2024-11-05T16:17:07-08:00	
The Fourth Branch Of US Government Faces A Reckoning – OpEd	By Kimberlee Josephson Jeff Bezos recently released an op-ed on why the Washington Post will be refraining from endorsing political candidates and why he believes faith needs to be restored in journalism. At the start of the article, he gives an analogy to illustrate the media’s present problem: Voting machines must meet two requirements. They must count the vote accurately, and people must believe they count the vote accurately. The second requirement is distinct from and just as important as the first. Likewise with newspapers. We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. These statements are easy to understand, but the matters involved are complex. A voting machine can be made to work properly, and newspapers can go to great lengths to verify sources and situations, but as for the second part of Bezos’s statements about believing it to be true, well, that’s tricky. How deeply one believes, how long one has believed, how one came to be a believer, and what constitutes the core elements of what one believes are important factors. Moreover, understanding why some choose not to believe is just as important as understanding why some do. Boomers may claim that the news used to be a believable source, while Zoomers, having been raised in the noisy digital age, may never feel like legacy media can be trusted. It is also worth noting that conflicted feelings about what one believes can emerge at any time and can be influenced by circumstance. For instance, with the holidays drawing near, many children are questioning their belief in Santa and are adjusting their behavior after having not thought about the jolly gift-giver since last December. Similarly, as this election season comes to a close, many adults are questioning their confidence in a two-party system and are re-evaluating the role politics plays in their everyday life. When it comes to making tough decisions, or understanding that which is hard to believe, we tend to take cues from others and seek to validate our viewpoints, just like children who question their parents after hearing from friends that Santa is not real. And, with this presidential election, many are having a hard time believing the choices we’ve been given and are looking for guidance as well as reassurance. According to a poll conducted by the American Psychiatric Association, 73 percent of U.S. adults are anxious about the election. People have tuned in in high numbers for Ezra Klein’s talk with Vivek Ramaswamy, Bari Weiss’s moderated debate between Ben Shapiro and Sam Harris regarding 'Trump or Kamala?,' and Joe Rogan’s long sit-down with none other than Donald Trump. People are hungry for information and desperate to justify casting their ballot, which brings us back to Bezos’s last-minute decision to do an about-face on the Washington Post’s decades-long practice of endorsing presidential candidates. Bezos is right about the fact that a newspaper endorsement is unlikely to swing someone’s vote choice; however, many people were likely relying on it as a reference point. In fact, Bezos’s judgment call resulted in roughly 250,000 readers, about 10 percent of the Washington Post’s audience, canceling their subscriptions. And while some news outlets followed suit and others helped pave the way (L.A. Times and USA Today), other outlets have chosen to double down on their political positions. The Atlantic gave their endorsement of Kamala Harris earlier this month and re-released that endorsement in an email blast after Bezos’s announcement. News outlets have long helped to inform the populace as well as politicians of hot topics and changes in culture and public opinion—and they do so in one of two ways. A media outlet can be impartial and functional with what it covers (which is easier said than done), or it can take a stance and be transparent about it. Most outlets like to think they do the first when reporting, but in reality they’re doing some form of the second method with muddled transparency. When news outlets endorse a candidate, it serves as a spotlight for where interests and allegiances lie. For those looking to consume information from outlets on opposite ends of the spectrum, these signals help. Media bias is real, and while reporting should always be based on facts, readers should always be aware of how perspectives and preferences can vary greatly in relation to what gets reported and by whom. Thomas Sowell aptly advises that 'If people in the media cannot decide whether they are in the business of reporting news or manufacturing propaganda, it is all the more important that the public understand that difference, and choose their news sources accordingly.' The Washington Post’s readers had an expectation for an endorsement but instead found themselves facing cognitive dissonance over the paper’s position, and some subscribers as well as employees made their jaded feelings known. Even if one argues that Bezos made the right move, it undoubtedly should have been done further out from Election Day. Indeed, the rapport a newspaper has with its readers relies on communication being both timely and relevant, in addition to being true. And the timing and tone of Bezos’s op-ed clearly rattled the relationship status it had with many who will no longer refer to the Washington Post as a trusted source. Overall, the news sector must come to terms with the fact that confidence in the media is at an all-time low and while regaining trust will be an uphill battle, it is one that must be fought. Americans have access to more information than ever before, but it seems we are far from being truly informed. In his book Who Governs?, Robert Dahl notes that an informed and engaged electorate is ideal, but reality often reveals constituents to be a far cry from policy experts and apathy to be commonplace. It is for these reasons that the media matters—the media can (and should) help to educate and energize the electorate. The press has an instrumental role to play in the political realm; it is referred to as the fourth branch of government for a reason. If the fourth branch fails to live up to its role, we will all be worse off for it. As Oscar Wilde quipped, 'In America, the president reigns for four years, and journalism governs forever and ever.' The American media mustn’t shirk from its role, and the American people are right in wanting more from it. We may not trust the news, but my God, do we need it.

To Reduce Violent Conflict, Support Non-Violent Resistance Moveme...	By Dr Bryan Sims It is unsurprising that as the world entered its 18th consecutive year of democratic decline, it was also experiencing a record number of conflicts, with 2023 being among the most violent years since the end of the cold war. This year’s Stockholm Forum on Peace and Development successfully unpacked the complex intersectionality among factors driving instability and violence throughout the globe. Yet while the topic of authoritarianism was raised over and over again during the Forum, it was treated primarily as a governance problem. In fact, authoritarianism is a cross-cutting and fundamental threat to peace and security. The authoritarianism–kleptocracy–conflict nexus Addressing authoritarianism is integral to addressing peace and security challenges. A recent policy paper by the Atlantic Council and the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict reminds us that a more authoritarian world is likely to lead to more interstate warfare. In contrast, research finds that the more democratic states are, the less likely they are to wage wars against each other. But that is not the only security risk of rising authoritarianism; autocratic governments are also more likely to harbour violent extremists than are democracies. Among the drivers of the authoritarian resurgence is the growth of kleptocracy, where networks of ruling elites use public institutions to steal public funds for their own private gain. Together, authoritarian governance and kleptocracy feed vicious cycles, undermining the rule of law and delegitimizing authority, which in turn reinforces a myriad of conflict drivers, which in turn reinforces authoritarian governance and kleptocracy. As we contemplate how to resolve violent conflicts in a rapidly evolving security landscape, we need to recognize that the drivers of violence today are not just local but are driven and sustained by kleptocratic networks of autocrats and violent non-state actors who profit from illicitly gained resources. As the historian Anne Applebaum notes, these networks: control state-owned companies, across multiple countries, that are making investment decisions worth billions of dollars; are purchasing security cameras from China, bots from Russia, and spyware from Israeli companies and their subsidiaries throughout the European Union; are laundering illicit financial gains through vast networks in the United Kingdom and the United States (especially in the states of Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and Wyoming); and laundering their own reputations to make them appear to be good global citizens. These actions have weakened the domestic and international institutions responsible for maintaining peace and security. The wealth and power generated by kleptocratic networks help to put actors who drive conflict beyond the reach of these institutions. That is exactly why engaging non-violent resistance movements and the non-traditional institutions they create is critical to building sustainable peace and security. Non-violent resistance movements defend democracy and strengthen security Non-violent civil resistance movements have great, and underutilized, potential to help to secure sustainable peace by addressing the key drivers of conflict in their local and regional contexts. They are rooted in communities and led by and for people facing injustices. They use non-violent direct-action tactics to shift power. And they are twice as effective as armed struggles in advancing democratic aims. Non-violent collective action inspires dignity, agency and three ‘collectives’: collective responsibility, collective ownership and collective identity. Leveraged together, these enable non-violent resistance movements to demonstrate effective tactics that can be scaled and replicated both locally and transnationally. Change rarely happens without meeting fierce–and violent–opposition, as has been seen recently in Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Iran, Myanmar, Sudan and Syria. However, while not always successful, non-violent resistance movements do in fact incentivize non-violent pathways to peace. And they can also reduce the risk of atrocities; research shows that armed uprisings are subject to mass killings nearly three times as often as non-violent campaigns. Where to go from here Since the Stockholm Forum, I have had the opportunity to connect with many Forum participants from non-violent resistance movements, civil society, government agencies and donors across geographies and sectors. Three things are clear. First, all recognize the underlying role that authoritarianism and kleptocracy play in driving insecurity and violence in both fragile and stable countries around the globe. Second, all recognize the urgent need to think strategically and collectively to tackle this set of problems. Finally—and unsurprisingly—there is no agreement on a path forward. In my current role as a donor, I believe inclusive strategies are needed that transcend sectors, geographies and levels—from grassroots up to powerholders. Donors should try to build or support cross-sectoral and transnational relationships capable of leveraging diverse knowledge, skills, networks and proximity to power. Such partnerships enable actors with shared goals to simultaneously challenge multiple policies, processes, relationships and power structures that enable insecurity and violence. We know what these partnerships look like: they were the global anti-colonial and anti-Apartheid non-violent resistance movements, and include today’s demands for climate action and justice. Developing and implementing comprehensive strategies to support relationships linking non-violent resistance movements to one another and with other sectors is not just a possibility: collaboration among governments and philanthropic organizations is making these strategies a reality. One example is Powered by the People, a public–private partnership between the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and private foundations that is upskilling and connecting activists around the world, and building partnerships between non-violent resistance movements and key actors in areas such as transparency, anti-corruption, banking and regulation, advocacy, strategic litigation and human rights—to name just a few. Leveraging governmental and philanthropic funds allows donors to better coordinate, collaborate and exploit each other’s strengths. Access to external funding has been a key demand among non-violent resistance movements globally. As donors in the peace and security field, if we are serious about building sustainable peace in an increasingly violent world, we need to meet this demand.

No Matter Who Wins, Half The Country Won’t Believe In The Electio...	By Tho Bishop Today, in theory, will conclude the 2024 presidential election, one of the most bizarre in American political history. From inner-party coups to assassination attempts, Kamala’s Brat summer social media trend to Trump’s courting of comedian podcasts, the campaign cycle has been saturated with the unconventional. It has, of course, also seen its expected share of shallow, political, rhetorical rhetoric and general economic illiteracy, which are the cornerstones of modern democracy. The general superficial nature of mainstream political discourse, though, should not distract us from recognizing foundational truths about the state of modern American politics. No matter the outcome, the legitimacy of American democracy is broken. In 2020, this was in full display, as was the response from Donald Trump and his supporters. Fueled by the unprecedented changes to the election under the shadow of covid, President Trump refused to concede the election. Polls showed the majority of his supporters agreed with him, and from that seed of distrust grew renewed concerns over illegal voters, manipulable voting machines, and rising awareness over the security of vote-by-mail ballots. To this day, large portions of the country continue to believe the Biden administration was illegitimate. How would Democrats have reacted in the face of a similarly close race resulting in a Trump victory last election? While the counterfactual is impossible to consider in practice, hints were already publicly available before election day 2020. In Biden campaign war games, John Podesta, a long-time Democrat operative, outlined a strategy quite similar to the one Trump embarked on. As reported at the time, this included Democrat-swing state governors being pressured into promoting friendly alternative electors to vote in the electoral college under the guise of reversing Republican 'voter suppression' efforts. Unlike the Republican response in 2020, this appeal would have been strengthened by blue-state secession threats should Trump have been inaugurated. Would Joe Biden have followed through with this strategy if this alternative timeline had played out? We will never know. Nor can we know the potential effectiveness of this strategy, though it is likely such efforts would have been treated quite differently than Trump’s response. Still, as we look forward, what is clear here is that the willingness for either side to accept, without question, the basic machinery of American politics has broken down significantly. The centralization of power within Washington, which consistently elevates the stakes of national politics, coupled with significant ideological shifts (particularly on the left), and the perceived danger Trump represents to American political institutions, regardless of his demonstrated ability to follow through after 2016, has created a dynamic where the incentives to concede power for the alleged 'national good' have all but broken down. Each side is motivated by a spirit of self-preservation, not politics. This explains the response from the professional political class to Trump’s election. The intelligence agencies immediately worked to undermine his credibility with the promotion of a false narrative of Trump-Russia collusion. Selected members of Trump’s team saw themselves caught up in investigations. Military and foreign policy leadership would deliberately conceal information and ignore orders handed down from the elected Commander-in-Chief. The result is a unique era of political chaos and hysteria. But from this disruption of political norms becomes the exposure of the underlying unsustainability of the American regime. Bipartisan recklessness on spending, amplified with covid-era fiscal insanity, has manifested itself in ways that political propaganda is proving increasingly difficult to conceal. America’s interest rate payments have passed a trillion dollars, becoming one of the major line items for any future budget. The Fed’s recent significant interest rate cut actually resulted in higher treasury yields, in large part due to growing concerns about America’s long-term fiscal viability. Internationally, America’s explicit weaponization of money and banking has created new challenges as well. The Biden administration’s over-reliance on financial warfare towards Russia has elevated international interest in the BRICs and other non-US-controlled financial networks. The cracking of American global dominance will create additional stresses to traditional Washington foreign policy, particularly if a Harris-led administration doubles down on neoliberal and neoconservative figures in key strategic positions, such as her flirting with the idea of a Liz Cheney cabinet position. These hard realities create new challenges beyond the traditional calculations of political will, and partisan legislative makeup is inevitable, no matter the election’s outcome. The greater challenge to the regime will be domestic. A Trump victory will be a severe refutation of the regime’s reliable public opinion-molding institutions of the corporate press and traditional court intellectuals. A Kamala victory could represent the last gasp of these same forces, as public faith in the media and academia has slipped down to near Congressional-distrust. Replacing traditional media outlets is the rise of podcasts, social media, and other alternative forms of communication, all of which have become key aspects of political campaigns. With this decentralization of news consumption comes greater polarization in national narratives, making it harder for the regime to construct its own preferred lines. This further stresses any of the traditional means by which Washington has consolidated public support behind its leadership. Will Trump supporters accept the governance of an administration that has, over the course of the past four years, accused them of supporting a modern form of Nazism? Will Harris voters accept a president that they view as a domestic fascist threat? We know the answer because we’ve seen the reality play out over the past eight years. Only those who reside in the isolated corridors of Washington or New York can still cling to the delusional fantasy that a defeat of Trump will return the Republican Party to the control of the Bushes and the Romneys. If we accept that traditional Washington politics is mortally wounded, what can replace it? Covid provided a look at what extremely polarized state responses to a national crisis can look like. Hopefully growing distrust of the federal government will lead to more of these outcomes. Trump’s first term was dotted with significant pushback from blue states on a number of issues. Who takes the White House is likely to have a significant impact on the federal response. Democrats have already signaled that their response to the fracturing political environment will likely be an escalation in censorship efforts on alternative platforms, particularly Elon Musk’s X. Similar attacks have already been ongoing with leftwing regimes in Europe and Brazil. Additionally, methods like the de-banking of opposing political interests, and various forms of legal persecution can be expected, based on the last two Democrat administrations. No matter the specifics, it is likely a Harris victory will see escalation from DC in trying to tighten their control over fraying political trust. The direction a Trump administration takes opens other possibilities. Trump has signaled increased willingness to marshal federal forces for matters such as immigration enforcement and political unrest. What is more interesting is whether or not a broader administrative strategy will be dedicated to pushing power away from the deep state and into the hands of state and local government, such as the campaign rhetoric over abolishing the Department of Education. Alternatively, there are some on the right who cling to the hope of transforming federal control into making the Washington bureaucracy an active tool for their own preferred brands of intervention. That strategy will only fuel the very problems that have created the political environment that has allowed for populist politics to thrive. In any case, the 2024 election will provide few solutions to the underlying pressures eroding American political norms. Regardless of the outcome, half the country will feel like they live under an occupational government. In doing so, the public is becoming more aware of the true nature of the state.

Iranian Regime Experts Highlight Tehran’s Strategic Impasse – OpE...	Tehran now faces a choice. Individuals, organizations, and governments often encounter complexities when making decisions; at times, they must choose between bad and worse. In the current context… continuing the war means further blows to Iran, potentially extending beyond military strikes to harm Iran’s political standing and create fundamental issues for us.' These statements are from an analysis by a government-affiliated analyst published in Ham-Mihan newspaper on November 2, portraying the regime’s impasse. For a long time, terms such as 'deadlock,' 'stalemate,' 'quagmire,' and 'no way forward, no way back' have been frequently used in state-affiliated newspapers and media to describe the current situation of the regime. On September 11, Shargh newspaper published an article titled 'We are Checkmated,' written by Mostafa Hashemi-Taba, a former presidential candidate close to regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei. He wrote: 'All signs, both external and internal, show that we are in a deadlock. This is not related to this government or that one, and everyone knows we are stuck, but they pretend otherwise, saying ‘hopefully, it’s just a minor issue’… This deadlock is not only because of U.S. sanctions and related European and East Asian measures; even if we woo the U.S., accept the FATF, and face no trouble with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the deadlock will still continue.' A significant point in the current situation is that regime experts and officials clearly link the regime’s impasse to the consequences of its warmongering policies. They write: 'The events of the past year have shown that Iran’s power strategy is weaker and more unstable than expected… When the prolonged conflict escalated into a full-scale confrontation and parts of Hezbollah were paralyzed, it became evident that Iran’s perception of its power was overestimated' (Ham-Mihan newspaper, October 1). In this situation, Khamenei has confronted the reality that the same warmongering policy he adopted a year ago to shield the regime from uprisings and the threat of social protests has now become so entrenched that it has transferred the crisis into the regime itself. It is worth noting that after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon and Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Massoud Ali, a cleric in Khamenei’s circle, said in a speech aired on state TV on October 24: 'After Ismail Haniyeh’s martyrdom, for two months we did not respond adequately. During those two months, the media and social networks were filled with questions! Commanders of the IRGC, General Bagheri, General Salami, General Hajizadeh were accused of political impotence. The term ‘political impotence’ was widespread, with questions like why are you hesitating, why don’t you retaliate? Severe mistrust had set in!' Another significant point from the admissions of regime theorists and officials is what a government analyst in Ham-Mihan newspaper on November 3 called an 'existential problem.' He emphasized that at the end of the warmongering policy, the regime is not choosing between 'bad and worse,' but 'worse and the worst.' He explained, 'It may go beyond military strikes, affecting Iran’s political standing and even leading to an existential problem for us.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdQxR8ou-W2f-HkcjPNb2VG	2024-11-05T16:10:27-08:00	
Complex Systems And The US Election – OpEd	With the US presidential election mere days away, American citizens first and foremost – but also people in other countries, given what is at stake – need to reflect on the gravitas of the situation. It is no exaggeration to say that the outcome of this election will determine further developments, not only in the US but in the world at large. The choice facing American voters is reminiscent of Robert Frost’s famous poem: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth;Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back.I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference. -- The Road Not Taken What is the upshot of Frost’s poetic reflection on choosing a path between two beckoning to him? That choices are sometimes difficult because one cannot, with certainty, tell where one’s chosen ‘path’ will lead to; not even if indications suggest that one of the options facing one has been decided on more often than the other one. In fact, most people are likely to select the one that more people appear to have chosen than the other. The final stanza of Frost’s poem suggests, however, that having decided on the less popular alternative turned out to have been the better choice; it ‘has made all the difference.’ Analogous to the poem, it appears that, if the ‘popularity’ of the alternatives facing the American people were to be determined by the sheer media space occupied by memes, discussions, articles, surveys, and reports favouring one candidate over the other, Kamala Harris would be the favoured contender. If media exposure were the deciding factor, and people – like Frost facing the two paths – had to judge which candidate seemed the more popular, Harris would be it. But, again judged by media popularity, choosing in favour of the ostensibly less attractive (because less conspicuous in the legacy media) candidate may indeed ‘make all the difference’ because, like the path ‘less travelled by,’ this person may have as-yet hidden (or deliberately covered-up) qualities or potential only discoverable if one chooses in his favour. This is partly the case because, as many people would agree, the prominence enjoyed by Harris in mainstream media space is misleading, to say the least. It does not factor in the comparative prominence of Donald Trump in alternative media, which, although largely invisible to those Americans still dependent on the likes of CNN, Fox, ABC, CBS, and so on, may actually outweigh that of Harris. Like Frost’s path ‘less travelled by,’ Trump may have qualities that belie the signs of its lesser ‘prominence’ in the space of media power (or powerful media). Moreover, if the sheer complexity of the situation is taken into account, it would appear that Donald Trump actually has a huge advantage over Kamala Harris. It may well be that he features ‘less prominently’ in mainstream media than Harris as far as the explicit statement of her preferability as future president is concerned, but when prominence is measured in terms of mainstream demonisation of Trump, his mainstream media presence probably exceeds hers. Why is this significant? In a word, because of the complexity involved. Consider this: Trump is one man, and on reflection, it would appear highly unlikely that one man could hold the destiny of the world in his hands, as it were, even if there are probably millions of his supporters who would claim just that. The point is that we have not yet learned to ‘cut off the head of the king,’ as Michel Foucaultfamously argued about power. As he demonstrated in his philosophical history of modes of punishment, Discipline and Punish (Vintage books, 1977), the modern age is characterised by a dispersion of power throughout society, with no centre of power, such as the king. Instead, we witness a network of ‘micro-centres’ of power, which are interconnected in a complex, non-teleological (non-purposive) manner. This contrasts with the pre-modern world of centralised hierarchies of power, emanating from the king or queen’s court, and connected with relatively few institutional positions occupied by individuals in service to the royal apex of power, such as the general of the king’s army. Hence, even if one might be tempted to perceive in someone like Donald Trump the equivalent of the pre-modern king, the comparison does not hold, which is easy to demonstrate by focusing on the complex network of constantly changing relations in which Trump (like every other person who wields power today) is inscribed. It is only because of such a person’s position in the network of forces that they can exercise power. We live as individuals whose lives cannot be isolated from these complexly evolving relationships, and what we are is determined, not by some essential centre of identity, but this ‘identity’ results from configuring and constantly reconfiguring relationships. As Keith Morrison reminds us (in Complexity Theory and the Philosophy of Education, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell 2008: 16): Change is ubiquitous, and stability and certainty are rare. Complexity theory is a theory of change, evolution, adaptation and development for survival. It breaks with simple successionist cause-and-effect models, linear predictability, and a reductionist approach to understanding phenomena, replacing them with organic, non-linear and holistic approaches respectively…in which relations within interconnected networks are the order of the day… By ‘complexity’ one should not only understand something numerical, such as a world with a total population of about 8 billion people, although this adds to its complexity. Rather, the total (and constantly changing) number of living beings in the world (including humans) are all interconnected in almost incomprehensibly complex, systemic ways, including economically and biologically, and these are interconnected, in turn, with inorganic natural elements such as air, soil, and water. The consequences of complex interconnections amount to continuing changes taking place all the time, as different elements and actors continually affect one another. For example, human industrial-economic activities affect the quality and composition of the soil, water, and air on the planet, which affect all living beings in turn, in an ongoing reciprocal process. In total, all these mutually connected subsets of elements and living entities comprise the planetary ecosystem, which is an overarching, complex system. What does this have to do with Donald Trump as candidate in the imminent US presidential election? To answer this question one has to remember that what makes complex systems so special is not only that they normally comprise a large number of components, but that they are ‘open’ in a double sense: they are open to the ‘influence’ of their environment, but in addition, every one of their constituent parts is open to changes in the system; that is, it is affected by such changes (even if no component has access to the behaviour of the system as a whole). So, for example, a social-ecological subsystem such as a family is embedded in broader subsystems such as schools, urban, suburban, or rural areas, which are (in turn) situated in certain socioeconomic contexts and specific kinds of culture. An individual in a family will unavoidably be affected by all the differences and changes in the broader subsystems in which they live. Urie Bronfenbrenner’s well-known ecological theory for human development (so-called ‘develecology’), which focuses on the kind of relations involved in social systems and subsystems like the ones referred to above, enables one to comprehend the intricate interrelations involved. Bronfenbrenner’s theory shows how everything in (and ‘surrounding’) an individual’s life codetermines his or her relative well-being in complex ways. The complexity of a person’s insertedness in these overlapping subsystems can be gauged from Shelton’s succinct account of Bronfenbrenner’s schema for understanding it (Shelton, L.G., The Bronfenbrenner Primer – A Guide to Develecology, New York: Routledge, 2019: 10): Bronfenbrenner’s scheme is a system of concepts: the person exists in a system of relationships, roles, activities, and settings, all interconnected. Individual development takes place as the developing person ages, constructs an understanding of his or her experience, and learns to act effectively within the system in which she or he is participating. Simultaneously, the development of the person changes the system. The system changes because as a person develops, his or her actions change, and other people in the system therefore respond differently to the developing person. At the same time, the settings the person participates in are interrelated with each other and with other settings. As well, the settings are part of the culture in which the whole system of settings and the roles, relationships, and activities within them are embedded. It is not difficult to grasp the concept of the virtually untraceable, constantly changing and increasing, number of interactions (and their effects) among people and settings that this involves. Bronfenbrenner’s account of complex social conditions implies that every individual action in a social context has an effect on the actions of others, which, in turn, changes the social context, and the latter, again, influences the future actions of people involved. In the case of Donald Trump it is no different. I wrote earlier about the manner in which mainstream media demonise Trump, and suggested that this enhances his media presence, and therefore his conspicuousness in America’s social and political space. Furthermore, given the unavoidably complex relations involved, such negative portrayals of Trump are not necessarily bad for the latter. Take President Biden’s recent remark that Trump supporters are ‘garbage.’ Fed into the complex web of communication, and interpersonal relations in the US, one might expect that this would only serve to reinforce the polarisation that already exists in the American political field. But it is not that simple: sure, it would make dyed-in-the-wool Democrats snigger with delight, and confirmed Trump supporters foam at the mouth, but – as might have been expected – when Kamala Harris responded to Biden’s thoughtless remark by saying that she would ‘strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,’ another twist was registered in the grid of consequential linguistic utterances – one that might cause some Democrats to feel a twinge of shame at Joe Biden’s folly, and correspondingly, warm to Kamala Harris’s show of political ‘decency,’ as well as to Donald Trump as a target of such an unfair comment. It is not beyond the realm of the possible that some people might even change political allegiance, prompted by Biden’s comment, given that, in an already complex set of interrelations, few things are as complex as the human psyche. This is why human beings are not conclusively predictable. With great perspicacity, Brent Hamacheck casts more light on the reasons for Trump’s candidacy for the presidency being so complex – something that some would claim makes it impossible to predict the outcome of the election, but others (including myself) would understand as being in Trump’s favour. Hamacheck comments on ‘the three reasons people hate Trump,’ and divides Trump haters into three groups – Silly, Subconscious, and Sinister – the first two of which, he claims, are susceptible to being rationally persuaded about the error of their feelings, while the last group should be regarded with justified suspicion and disapproval. The ‘sillies’ hate Trump because of his brash, sometimes vulgar personality, which, Hamacheck avers, has nothing to do with his capacity to govern well and formulate sensible policies. This is why they could be convinced that they should change their attitude towards Trump as potential president. Those who hate the ‘orange man’ at a subliminal level, on the other hand, do so – according to Hamacheck – because of the inner conflict he causes in them through his unapologetic love for America. The conflict, explains Hamacheck, obtains between guilt (for living in a prosperous country like America), shame (brought about by Trump telling them America is great), and altruism (linked to the virtue of self-sacrifice, which is undermined by Trump advocating precisely the opposite). Both of these groups can, according to Hamacheck, be cured of their redundant hatred for Trump. In fact, there are already people like this who have stated their intention of voting for the Republican. The last group – the ‘sinisters’ – however, are not conflicted over what Trump represents, but are ‘vehemently opposed to it,’ says Hamacheck. They are the globalists for whom the valorisation of a country’s unique spirit and value is totally anathema because they want to dissolve all national boundaries and dilute all sense of national identity, both of which stand in the way of their globalist ambitions. It should be clear why Hamacheck’s analysis is pertinent to what I have written above about complexity. It reveals just how difficult it is to predict with certainty where and how the sentiments of individuals concerning a prominent personality like Trump would take them when it comes to voting.

All That Glitters May Not Be Gold For Japan’s Semiconductor Reviv...	By Joseph Negrine In the new age of industrial policy, advanced economies are driving public–private partnerships and abandoning notions of laissez-faire competition. As of September 2024, the Japanese government has spent over US$25 billion on subsidising semiconductors, the ‘new oil’ integral to civilian and military technologies. While the potential economic gains from Japan’s semiconductor manufacturing revival are colossal, Japan must not overlook the potential negative economic and security externalities. Semiconductor dominance is a crucial aspect of geopolitical and economic superiority in the US–China ‘technological cold war’. Global disruptions like the Russia–Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic have underscored the need for resilient supply chains. In 2021, chip shortages that increased semiconductor lead times cost the global automotive industry over US$200 million. The United States is attempting to stifle China’s semiconductor industry through coordinated export controls with the Netherlands and Japan. Both countries are crucial because they specialise in producing lithography equipment and associated materials that are chokepoints in China’s chip supply chain. Japan, which dominated semiconductor markets in the 1980s, seeks to regain strategic autonomy. Its subsidies between 2021–23 accounted for 0.71 per cent of GDP — a higher proportion than all other countries. The potential gains, much like the subsidies, are not insubstantial. The semiconductor market is projected to be worth US$1 trillion by 2030. Japan can capture significant parts of industry revenue by providing superior products. A successful semiconductor strategy could be very good for Japan. Japan’s Economic Security Promotion Act, passed in May 2022, recognised a stable semiconductor supply and domestic industry as urgent national tasks. This is being achieved by coordinated onshoring and offshoring efforts that promote public–private collaboration. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s Domestic Investment Promotion Project subsidises companies to domestically relocate, while its Overseas Supply Chain Diversification Project is expanding production facilities across Southeast Asia. But the economic gains from subsidising semiconductors are far from a done deal. Successful industrial policy at the frontier, where Japan’s Rapidus intends to produce, is fundamentally different to the historic use of industrial policy for ‘catch-up growth’ in developing countries. Subsidies that fail to ignite breakthrough technologies sacrifice government resources without providing a long-term benefit. Industrial policy is economically justifiable where interventions in international oligopolies lead competitors to retrench production. But Japan’s competitors show no signs of scaling back their semiconductor ambitions at the frontier. Despite having the largest semiconductor subsidy to GDP ratio, Japan’s investments pale in comparison to the US$52.7 billion in subsidies over five years under the 2022 US CHIPS and Science Act. China’s state-led semiconductor subsidies, while hard to calculate due to a lack of public data, are estimated to exceed US$150 billion. A compounding issue is that, in a constantly evolving environment, companies may demand further government support to maintain technological leadership. Given its dreams of fiscal consolidation, Japan must clarify whether its subsidies will be timely and temporary in this dynamic area. Game theory indicates that retaliatory policies that further distort economic efficiencies lead to worse collective outcomes. International Monetary Fund analysis points to a ‘tit-for-tat dynamic’ in the new era of industrial policies. Whether a subsidy arms race will avoid a ‘race to the bottom’ then becomes a question of whether these industrial policies have positive cross-border effects. The OECD suggests that tit-for-tat policies could magnify negative international spillovers and undermine the rules-based trading system. Due to the billions of dollars being invested into semiconductor manufacturing, major countries are at risk of a deepening talent shortage. Though Japan’s labour markets are beginning to mobilise, its semiconductor strategy will be buffeted by an expected shortage of 40,000 semiconductor engineers. Whether the United States can successfully disable China’s advances in AI may be neither possible nor desirable for Japan. Even with significant cooperation, there are criticisms that these efforts ‘can only slow China, not stop it’. Attempts to alienate China may intensify its commitment to developing semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, as it leads to stronger commercial partnerships within China. It is also doubtful that Japan desires to stop China’s AI developments. The government has emphasised the importance of diversifying supply chains beyond China. But this does not mean a complete decoupling from the nation’s largest trading partner and the world’s largest semiconductor consumer. In May 2024, then Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida made a joint declaration with China and South Korea at the Ninth Trilateral Summit Meeting, reaffirming a commitment to ‘strengthening supply chain cooperation and avoiding supply chain disruption’. Japan’s position in the US–China conflict is somewhat paradoxical. Its incoherent engagement with China is also seen in discussions concerning regional economic integration. The relative positions of the three nations in this economic security dilemma may fluctuate amid the election build-up in Japan in late October 2024 and the United States in November 2024. Japan’s semiconductor strategy is just one part of an interdependent system. Beyond questions of economic efficiency, the subsidies raise concerns about backsliding free markets, US–China tensions and regional stability. In this setting of considerable uncertainty, Japan must take a serious look before it leaps into further investments in its semiconductor revival.

Thailand: Ruling Party Has Lost Credibility After Reneging On Lès...	By Nontarat Phaicharoen Thailand’s ruling Pheu Thai Party has lost its trust with citizens by breaking with an electoral promise of including royal defamation cases in a proposed amnesty bill for political prisoners, analysts said. In late October, the party reversed course by announcing it would now exclude so-called lèse-majesté cases in its version of the bill. During the 2023 campaign, Pheu Thai, then a party in the opposition, had pledged that it would appeal to the courts to show leniency in the cases of people imprisoned for or charged under the draconian royal insult law, saying its use had been politicized. Pheu Thai’s decision to exclude such cases in the proposed amnesty legislation shows the party’s true character, political analyst Olarn Thinbangtiao told BenarNews. 'Pheu Thai has now gone bankrupt in terms of credibility,' said Olarn, a political science associate professor at Burapha University. 'They have repeatedly broken their promises, exposing that their democratic ideals and justice are merely fictional narratives.' For instance, Pheu Thai reneged on its promise to join forces with the now-disbanded Move Forward Party to form the government. The lèse-majesté law, framed under Article 112 of the country’s criminal code, carries a maximum jail term of 15 years for each conviction. At least 27 people are currently imprisoned under the lèse-majesté law, according to the group, Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. And 274 people face 307 royal defamation cases from 2020 until September this year. Pheu Thai probably took a lesson from the Move Forward Party, which was disbanded in August for 10 years for promising to abolish the royal defamation law, said Sunai Phasuk, a Thai advisor to Human Rights Watch. Pheu Thai itself faces the specter of disbandment, with the election commission announcing on Oct. 21 that the party was being investigated for an alleged political violation. 'Pheu Thai has chosen to break its promises, possibly calculating that this reduces political risk, especially after seeing the Move Forward Party dissolved for proposing Article 112 reforms,' Sunai told BenarNews. View from the street Among Thai citizens, there appears to be an age divide on how Pheu Thai’s turnaround on the amnesty bill is being viewed. Peerawat Veeraviriyapitak, a student in Bangkok, said that the party had gone back on its promise. 'Right now, it seems like Pheu Thai is going back on what they previously said,' Peerawat told BenarNews. 'If some people didn’t actually commit a crime, they should be granted amnesty too.' But retiree Teerasak Kambannarak agreed with Pheu Thai’s decision. 'Article 112 should not be included in the amnesty bill, as the monarchy is an institution we should protect and uphold,' Teerasak told BenarNews. While campaigning before last year’s general election, Pheu Thai said that Article 112 cases ought to be included in an Amnesty Act. Then-party leader and now-Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra had said that royal defamation cases were problematic because anyone could file charges – a fact that has allowed the law to be used as a political weapon. Paetongtarn’s father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, also faces Article 112 charges. He was charged in May for comments about the monarchy he made during a 2015 interview in South Korea. Parliament is considering four amnesty bill drafts, which include pardoning actions seen as provoking periods of political unrest in the Southeast Asian nation since 2006. All four target politically motivated offenses. These include violations of articles 114, 116, 117 and 118. They are related to sedition, actions aimed at changing laws, incitement to strike for political change and activities against national symbols. Two of the four drafts – one by the main opposition party People’s Party (formerly known as Move Forward) and a public initiative – called for the draft law to include Article 112 cases. Parliament is set to review the amnesty bills next month. Historical precedent Article 112 has fundamentally become political, said Kitpatchara Somanawat, an assistant professor at Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Law. 'Over the past 5-10 years, questions have arisen about the monarchy’s political involvement,' Kitpatchara told BenarNews. 'Academic works have suggested connections, leading some to view political expression about the monarchy as an active citizen’s duty. Therefore, Article 112 violations are inherently political crimes, not ordinary ones.' Thailand has a historical precedent for such an amnesty measure. In 1978, the government granted amnesty to those arrested after the October 1976 protests in which 40 people were killed and 3,000 others thrown behind bars. Ironically, several of those former students given amnesty now hold positions in Paetongtarn’s government. They include Phumtham Wechayachai, deputy prime minister; Prommin Lertsuridej, the prime minister’s secretary-general and Pheu Thai MPs Adisorn Piengkes and Chaturon Chaisang. Thailand’s political divisions will never end if the government decides to exclude Article 112 cases under the proposed amnesty law, political analyst Olarn of Burapha University warned. 'Pheu Thai’s decision may affect future democratic discourse and reform efforts in Thailand,' he said. 'These political issues will remain dormant until the next development because we’re just hiding problems under the carpet.' Ruj Chuenban in Bangkok and Wanna Tamthong in Chiang Mai contributed to this story.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc1Olt81YM2ZlnDZfY58bKN	2024-11-05T15:47:44-08:00	
Decoding Africa’s Interest In BRICS – Analysis	By Samir Bhattacharya From 22 to 24 October, Russia hosted the 16th annual BRICS Summit in Kazan under the theme 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security.' Attended by 36 country leaders along with the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, the event’s success underscored a growing interest in multilateralism led by Global South. This success is also evident in the increasing number of developing countries from Africa queuing up to join the group. So far, South Africa has been the only African member of BRICS. However, following the latest expansion in 2023, Egypt and Ethiopia have participated as members for the first time in the recent BRICS summit. During the summit, the BRICS alliance officially announced the addition of 13 new nations as partner countries, including three African nations: Algeria, Nigeria, and Uganda. The continent’s increasing interest in joining BRICS underscores the emergence of new global powers and multipolar world order, creating significant opportunities for African nations to lessen their traditional reliance on Western powers while forging stronger alliances with emerging economies. This shift also allows African countries to redefine their global engagement. As the 2024 BRICS summit concludes, this article examines the motivations that African states have to join the organisation. Economic implications: BRICS as Africa’s economic ally Recognising their current low levels of development, African leaders have been strengthening ties with external powers while expressing their frustrations with economic exploitation by their traditional partner countries, stringent conditions set by Western-led financial institutions, and overall Western dominance in the global order. Instead of depending solely on lenders like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, many African nations have started prioritising economic cooperation with BRICS. For instance, several Junta-led governments in Africa, who came to power unconstitutionally by coup, are banned from accessing the IMF and the World Bank. New financial alternatives such as the New Development Bank (NDB) present a viable alternative for these countries to reduce their dependence on the US dollar and lessen their vicious burden of debt and sanctions. While African states are working to create alternative economic and governance structures to challenge the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and the IMF still have a significant presence in Africa. For instance, BRICS members Egypt and Ethiopia rely on IMF funding. Egypt recently secured a US$8 billion bailout amid economic challenges, and Ethiopia has received a US$3.4 billion extended credit facility (ECF),to help with financial pressures. This indicates that moving away from dollar reliance and existing financial institutions remains a distant goal. Nevertheless, African nations are optimistic about securing concessionary loans and funding through the BRICS NDB. The NDB aims to strengthen economic partnerships within BRICS Plus and improve access to diverse markets, enhancing trade and investment opportunities in emerging economies. At its ninth annual board meeting in South Africa from 29-31 August 2024, the NDB emphasised its commitment to a more inclusive and flexible financing approach better aligned with the long-term development goals of BRICS members and other developing countries. Additionally, BRICS’ initiatives to introduce new financial payment systems that work towards de-dollarisation are garnering admiration from many developing countries in the Global South. While having a common currency anytime soon seems premature, countries like India and China have started promoting trading in local currencies. This will help Africa dodge the uncertainties related to dollar fluctuations, giving them more choices and unlocking their full potential. BRICS and Africa's security landscape Although African countries pursue a multi-alignment strategy, engaging with both the US and other major powers has inherent challenges. With shifting geopolitical dynamics, the African Union (AU) and other individual African countries seek to realign with BRICS to help tackle peace and security challenges. BRICS’ support for the AU in promoting the peace process in South Sudan and for regional organisations like the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in counteracting the security threats faced by the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mozambique emphasises BRICS’ endorsement of a collective African approach to shared challenges. This endorsement of homegrown solutions that highlight Africa’s role in promoting regional stability may result in increased resources for the continent. Furthermore, BRICS’ backing for African peace initiatives could foster greater collaboration among BRICS nations, ultimately providing Africa with enhanced resources for peacebuilding and security. BRICS and Africa’s quest for leadership Africa seeks a new brand of leadership, requiring statesmen who understand the fundamentals for future global collaboration, particularly in economic matters. Many African countries aim to emulate the leadership of India, China, and other BRICS members as champions for the Global South who promote political equality, respect for sovereignty, and fairness in cooperation. However, Ethiopia and Egypt’s status as rival countries has raised concerns about internal cohesion among African members of BRICS. This was evident when BRICS foreign ministers abruptly ended a meeting in New York on 26 September 2024, due to disputes between Egypt and Ethiopia over a UN Security Council reform. BRICS and Africa’s Grain Exchange Amid climate change, fragmented markets, and food insecurity, the BRICS Grain Exchange could be a game changer for much-required agricultural investment in Africa. Creating a grain exchange could revolutionise Africa’s agricultural landscape by stabilising grain prices. With BRICS facilitating a more structured market, price volatility for producers and consumers would be significantly reduced. A BRICS-backed exchange market would help Africa diversify its export portfolio, boosting foreign exchange earnings. The way forward For Africa, BRICS underscores a significant opportunity to enhance its role in global governance and development. The BRICS Youth Summit and the establishment of a BRICS Youth Council present crucial avenues for African youth engagement. The BRICS project of inter-parliamentary cooperation provides a platform for African countries to connect with emerging economies on issues of governance, political stability, and policymaking. This exchange of ideas has the potential to ultimately strengthen Africa’s political institutions and promote improved governance practices. However, before joining BRICS, African countries must address their internal instability and set their policy priorities. In parallel, the current group members should focus on reviewing their foundational instruments rather than rushing to expand. Undoubtedly, the diverging political, economic, and cultural interests among its members would hinder the group from reaching its objectives. Clearly, despite the growing interest in BRICS, practical challenges exist. The way AU collectively addresses these challenges will ultimately determine its success.

Moscow Likely To Trigger Outrage If It Forces Protesters To Fight...	Moscow has used a variety of measures to fill the ever-depleting ranks of its army in Ukraine to avoid the declaration of a new mobilization (see EDM, July 30, August 7, October 10). Many in Russia fear that a new mobilization could spark massive protests and even threaten the current regime, given what happened after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a partial mobilization in September 2022. These measures range from paying enormous bonuses to pardoning violent prisoners and even releasing those charged but not yet convicted of crimes (see EDM, September 18, 2023; Verstka, July 24). Now, it appears set to take another step in this direction by forcing protesters into the Russian military, regardless of the issues animating their demonstrations. The Kremlin has compelling reasons to send protesters to fight. While protests against the war have been small and scattered, protests regarding other issues have been growing despite the rising tide of repression, especially in non-Russian republics. The risks, however, of taking such a step are significant, including a dramatic increase in anti-war attitudes and larger and more impassioned demonstrations. Most importantly for the Kremlin, it could also lead to a decline in support for Putin himself, potentially prompting a move against him and his regime (see EDM, March 8, 2021, April 13, 2023, July 30;TRTRussian, February 10). The first indication that the Kremlin may soon draft protesters comes from Dagestan, one of the poorest, most Islamic, and most restive regions in the Russian Federation. Dagestan, however, also has the potential to be the region where such a change in policy is most likely. The North Caucasian republic was the site of some of the most dramatic protests against Putin’s partial mobilization two years ago and has often been considered a bellwether for policies Moscow frequently goes on to extend to the Russian Federation as a whole (Vedomosti; RBC, February 8, 2018; see EDM, September 29, 2022). Recently, a group of Dagestani veterans of Putin’s war in Ukraine called on the republic’s leadership to send those protesting land transfers to veterans to fight in Ukraine (Kavkaz Realii, November 4). This issue could easily intertwine with complaints about the war, especially where regional leaders have been forced to use more forceful means to meet the state-imposed recruitment quotas because they lack the funds to pay the bonuses other, better-off regions can afford (Sibir Realii, April 27; Window on Eurasia, April 29). As the war continues, this fundamental reality is likely to intensify in Dagestan and spread to other poorer republics and predominantly non-ethnic Russian regions as well—precisely the places where Putin has drawn for the soldiers to fight in Ukraine (Window On Eurasia, September 29, 2022). Despite this, two other issues Dagestan faces attract more attention and obscure this reality even as they exacerbate it. These include the growing land shortages due to the republic’s burgeoning population and unresolved conflicts arising from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin’s deportation of nationalities and their return. Both of these problems are behind the call by Dagestani and ethnic Avar veterans of Putin’s war in Ukraine for the impressment of ethnic Chechens resisting the transfer of land to said Avars. The Chechens are opposed to this because they believe—with support from Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov—that the territory is theirs and should become the nucleus of a restored Chechen district in Dagestan or even transferred en bloc from Dagestan to Chechnya. (On this complicated history and its current manifestations, see EDM, February 27, 2020; Window on Eurasia, March 8, March 13). The Avar veterans are outraged by this Chechen resistance, which has taken the form of challenges to the deeds given to the Avar veterans last summer and the removal of border markers between the two republics. The former forced the Dagestani authorities in Makhachkala to meet with the Avars at the end of October to reassure the veterans that their rights will be respected (RIA Dagaestan, August 6; Administration of the Municipality of Kazbekovsky Region, October 31). The ethnic Chechens in Dagestan, for their part, show no signs of backing down and insist that the land transfers to the Avar veterans are a violation of Makhachkala’s program to restore the Chechen Aukh district in Dagestan by 2025, claiming that they will continue to engage in protests against any moves by the Avars or anyone else that threatens that goal (Kavkaz Realii, March 4; VK.com/che_fighters, August 15; Window on Eurasia, October 20). The Avars, however, insist that the land Moscow and Makhachkala have given them is beyond the borders of the promised Chechen district (Kavkaz Realii, April 27). Neither the Chechens in Dagestan nor the Chechens in Grozny accept this, and more protests are likely in the coming weeks and months. Given Moscow’s concerns about an explosion in the most Islamic republic of the Russian Federation, as well as about Chechnya’s increasing support for ethnic Chechens in Dagestan, the Kremlin has been drawn into the disagreement. Most commentators have focused on the ethnic and religious aspects of the situation, but as important as these are, Moscow is more focused on the needs of the army for Putin’s war in Ukraine. Any question of dragooning protesters into the Russian army, even from a single republic, is likely to cast a far larger shadow in the short term. Forcing protesters in Dagestan to serve in the army will raise the specter that something similar will soon happen elsewhere, intimidating many and outraging others, creating new problems for Moscow. Kremlin officials understand that, but they also know that if Moscow fails to compel demonstrators to serve, it will not be able to maintain, let alone grow, the size of its military force in Ukraine. Putin certainly believes that he can keep things quiet by increasing repression to focus on his immediate goal. That likely means he will give the green light to drafting protesters first in Dagestan and then elsewhere. This may be a good bet in the short term, but it looks to be a losing one in the longer term. Consequently, what appears to be on the verge of taking place in Dagestan now could soon cast a large, dark, and fateful shadow on the Putin regime.

Iran Sentences 3 To Death Over Assassination Of Nuclear Scientist	(RFE/RL) -- Iran's judiciary says three people have been sentenced to death by a lower court over the killing in 2020 of Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in what Tehran says was an Israeli-orchestrated operation. 'The sentencing of these three people was carried out in the Revolutionary Court of Urmia, and they were sentenced to death in the initial stage, and the case is currently in the appeal stage,' Asghar Jahangir, a spokesman for Iran's judiciary, said at a news conference in Tehran.Urmia is a town In Iran's northwestern province of West Azerbaijan close to the border with Turkey.The sentencing of the three, who have not been named, comes at a time of rising tensions between Iran and Israel amid the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel has been blamed for the assassination of at least four other Iranian nuclear scientists suspected of working on Tehran's military nuclear program. Fakhrizadeh, known as the father of the Islamic republic's nuclear program, had been under U.S. sanctions for his role in Iran's nuclear research and Israel accused him in 2018 of being the architect of Iran's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.'After some investigations, three out of eight people arrested in West Azerbaijan province were accused of spying for the occupying regime of Israel,' Jahangir said, adding that the case is now in the 'appeal stage.'The three were also accused of bringing unspecified equipment from abroad into Iran for the attack 'under the guise of smuggling alcoholic drinks.'Jahangir said the case against the other defendants is still ongoing.Fakhrizadeh was assassinated in a brazen ambush of his vehicle in the town of Absard, near Tehran on November 27, 2020, which Iran at the time blamed on Israel while suggesting the United States also had an indirect or direct role.The circumstances of the attack remain unclear. Initial reports immediately after the killing suggested Fakhrizadeh was targeted by a truckful of explosives, several gunmen, and a suicide attacker.Just days later, the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) offered a different account, saying a machine gun equipped with a 'satellite-controlled smart system' that employed 'artificial intelligence' was used in the pinpointed killing of the scientist that left his wife, who was traveling with him, unharmed. Israel has not commented on Fakhrizadeh's killing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc1Olt81YM2ZidY27SclBTg	2024-11-05T15:39:18-08:00	
Cambodia: Former Adviser To Hun Sen Jailed Following Bribery Conf...	A former adviser to Senate President Hun Sen who was accused last month of soliciting bribes has been arrested after confessing in a six-minute video that he defrauded millions of dollars from people who sought favors and government positions. Ly Sameth said in the video, which was posted on Hun Sen’s Facebook page on Monday, that he had 'made the most serious mistake that affects the honor and dignity' of Hun Sen, who served as prime minister for more than three decades before stepping down last year. Hun Sen retains power as Senate president and as head of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party, or CPP. As party president, Hun Sen appointed Ly Sameth as his personal adviser on Feb. 22, 2022. 'Yes, I used the Samdech’s name to get other people’s money,' an emotional Ly Sameth said in the clip, using an honorific to refer to Hun Sen. 'This is true and this is not the first time, and not only that, I even said that all the money was handed over to Samdech.' Authorities arrested Ly Sameth in Sihanoukville on Monday. A detention order from the Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s investigating judge described him as 'a businessman with no education or illiteracy.' He was transferred to Prey Sar prison on the outskirts of Phnom Penh on Tuesday. Hun Sen wrote on Facebook last month that Ly Sameth had defrauded several Cambodians over the last two years, including one incident in which US$10 million was paid. That post was apparently prompted by a video message he received from Kan Sok Kay, the recently appointed governor of Kandal province’s Lvea Em district, which is located across the Mekong River from Phnom Penh. Kan Sok Kay said he gave US$30,000 to Ly Sameth to get the appointment, according to Hun Sen. 'I have signed, appointed and promoted tens of thousands of civil servants and members of the Armed Forces,' Hun Sen wrote. 'I never accepted intervention from anyone, no matter what request or bribe.' Ly Sameth’s assets should be frozen, and Phnom Penh court officials should issue an order to return money he accepted from people, Hun Sen wrote at the time. He assigned his lawyer, Ky Tech, to investigate the various complaints. Other apology videos RFA was unable to reach National Police Commissioner Sar Thet and Phnom Penh Municipal Court spokesman Ey Rin to ask about the timing of Ly Sameth’s arrest. Ly Sameth’s confession video, which was posted before his arrest, was similar to various public apologies and in-person appeals for forgiveness made to Hun Sen in recent years. Last month, a prominent overseas opposition activist announced in a video that he was switching his allegiance to the CPP, two months after his brother was arrested on incitement charges while trying to flee the country. Journalist Mech Dara also posted an apology video last month, several weeks after he was jailed and charged with incitement related to social media posts he made in September. Lawyer Kong Sam Onn, who has represented defendants in many high-profile criminal cases, told Radio Free Asia that authorities should further investigate to see who else was involved in the bribery solicitations. 'The person who bribes, and the person who takes the bribe, are both equally guilty and have the same penalty under Criminal Code and Anti-Corruption Law,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWez1Vr8dDjXG569GrtU_Ua2	2024-11-05T15:36:15-08:00	
Officials: Bomb Threats Against US Voting Locations Coming From R...	By Jeff Seldin A series of Election Day bomb threats sent to polling locations across the United States appears to be coming from Russia, according to new assessments from federal and state officials. The initial bomb threats early Tuesday put a temporary stop to voting at some locations in parts of the southeastern state of Georgia. State officials quickly determined the threats were not credible. 'We identified the source, and it was from Russia,' Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told reporters. 'They're up to mischief, and it seems they don't want us to have a smooth, fair and accurate election,' Raffensperger said. 'They think if they can get us to fight amongst ourselves, they can count that as a victory.' Only the effort to disrupt the U.S. election appears to be much broader. The FBI Tuesday said it is 'aware of bomb threats to polling locations in several states,' adding that many of the threats 'appear to originate from Russian email domains.' A U.S. official confirmed to VOA that in addition to Georgia, bomb threats were sent to polling locations in the Midwestern swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin. 'None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far,' the FBI said. 'We will continue to work closely with our state and local law enforcement partners to respond to any threats to our elections and to protect our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote.' The suspected Russian ploy builds on other last-minute attempts to disrupt the U.S. election. Earlier Tuesday, as many U.S. voters prepared to cast their ballots, the FBI warned voters of at least two efforts to use the bureau's name and likeness to promote false narratives. In one case, FBI officials pointed to faked news clips urging Americans to 'vote remotely' because of the increased threats of a terror attack. In the other, the FBI cautioned that social media accounts were spreading video of a fabricated news release about five prisons across the country involved in a vote-rigging scheme. The bureau said both videos are 'not authentic.' The FBI did not say who was responsible for creating the videos, which began to circulate just three days after two other fraudulent videos purporting to be from the FBI began circulating on social media. The earlier videos falsely stated the bureau had apprehended three linked groups for ballot fraud and made false claims about the husband of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. In recent days, U.S. intelligence officials have assigned responsibility for other videos, not referencing the FBI but claiming to show voting irregularities to Russian influence actors. Russia has denied any involvement. The latest incidents are part of what some U.S. officials have described as a 'firehose of disinformation' and follow a warning from U.S. intelligence agencies late Monday that Russia, and to a lesser extent Iran, were likely to intensify their influence operations on Election Day and in the days and weeks that follow. 'Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences,' according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, in coordination with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks after polls close,' the CISA statement said. 'These efforts risk inciting violence, including against election officials.' But CISA, which helps oversee the security of U.S. election infrastructure, said Tuesday the election was running as smoothly as could be expected. 'At this point, we are not currently tracking any national level significant incidents impacting security of our election infrastructure,' CISA Senior Adviser Cait Conley said during a briefing with reporters. Conley said earlier that CISA has been tracking some disruptions related to weather and other issues such as equipment failures, describing them as 'really routine and, honestly, expected types of disruptions.' CISA officials have warned that informational websites and infrastructure related to the election could be targeted by ransomware or distributed denial-of-service attacks. But they have emphasized that while inconvenient, such attacks would have little impact on the ability of Americans to cast ballots, since none of the country's election systems are connected to the internet and because 97% of voting precincts have paper backups. Still, there are concerns U.S. adversaries may try to seize upon any disruptions to incite panic and even violence. 'We know our foreign adversaries see this window of time, both Election Day and the days immediately following, as an opportunity to stoke further division and undermine American confidence in our democratic institutions,' Conley said. 'And that is regardless of who wins.' Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog and advocacy organization that has election observers stationed across the country, said Monday there has been tension at some polling places. 'We're seeing instances of folks being yelled out at the polls,' Suzanne Almeida, the group's director of state operations, said during a call with reporters.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWez1Vr8dDjXGy8uCzcBC_y3	2024-11-05T15:34:22-08:00	
2024 Presidential Election In The US And Its Implication For Myan...	We do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate.' As quoted by Thomas Jefferson, U.S. citizens are participating in a historic turnout in the 60th quadrennial presidential election to choose between two contrasting candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. This significant election highlights stark policy differences that could impact both domestic and foreign affairs. While the economy is the top issue among voters, a large majority (69%) cite at least five of the ten issues surveyed by the Pew Research Center as very important to their vote. Among Trump supporters, the leading issues are the economy (93%), immigration (82%), violent crime (76%), foreign policy (74%), and healthcare (55%). For Harris supporters, issues such as healthcare (76%), Supreme Court appointments (73%), the economy (68%), abortion (67%), and foreign policy (54%) are of top importance. While current foreign policy has focused heavily on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Middle East, and China, strategic competition with China—now one of the world’s two largest economies, alongside the United States—will be one of the most consequential foreign policy challenges confronting the next presidential administration. It will face an increasingly contentious relationship with Beijing on both trade and security issues. Focusing solely on Taiwan and overlooking Myanmar would be a missed opportunity in crafting a strategic policy on China. Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are essential components in diverse industrial and high-tech applications. China, the world’s largest producer of REEs, accounts for 70% of global annual mine production, while the United States (14%), Australia (6%), Myanmar (4%), and Thailand (2%) make up the rest. China sourced 72% of the U.S.'s rare earth imports in 2022, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Ironically, China imports REEs from Myanmar, with a 52.1% year-over-year increase in imports, reaching the highest level in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence's Global Trade Analytics Suite. A shortage of REEs would be considered a significant national security threat for the United States, which heavily relies on imports, primarily from China. This dependence could be used as leverage to disrupt vital military and technological applications, such as advanced weaponry, aircraft, and renewable energy systems—essentially creating a potential chokepoint for U.S. national security. On February 1, 2021, Min Aung Hlaing and the military ousted the democratically elected Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government in a coup. The coup was met with strong resistance through widespread, peaceful demonstrations and the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM). The brutal crackdown by the military led to the formation of armed resistance across the country, marking the beginning of a violent new chapter known as the Spring Revolution. This involved genuine nationwide resistance by all ethnic groups, brought together into a unified front with aligned political objectives and military cooperation. The Myanmar crisis was the first foreign policy challenge for the Biden administration. The U.S. immediately condemned the coup and the violent suppression of peaceful demonstrations, as well as the atrocities committed by the military. However, the administration became passive in dealing with the crisis. Unlike the United States, which has been largely sidelined, China has played an important role as the most influential foreign actor in Myanmar. China is the largest investor in Myanmar, which is also strategically important for China’s access to the Indian Ocean, providing a critical alternative route from the South China Sea through the Strait of Malacca. Additionally, the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor is a key component of China's Belt and Road Initiative. China seeks to use its influence in Myanmar to encourage a stable environment that can boost Chinese investments and secure perpetual stability along its 1,250-mile border. Despite Beijing’s preference for state-centric diplomacy, China initially conducted backdoor diplomacy through various groups and special envoys, as long as U.S. involvement remained minimal. As Myanmar’s junta loses its grip on power, China still seeks to maximize its influence with all parties in the civil war. However, China opposes the collapse of the junta. China is also concerned about the rise of rebel groups that have built an alliance with the National Unity Government, which Beijing fears could be influenced by the West due to their engagement in humanitarian assistance and advocacy for democracy. The passage of the Burma Act in December 2022, which provides a framework for U.S. engagement and support for democracy in Myanmar, has further complicated China's position. Shortly after the collapse of the Northeast military command center in Lashio, China became more proactive, shifting its posture by pressuring rebel forces for a ceasefire, blocking imports, and tightening border controls. Myanmar remains a diplomatic and security headache for China: the same situation as before the coup, where different actors will listen to China only to an extent and act according to their own interests, sometimes surprising China. The ongoing civil conflict and the rise of anti-junta forces have complicated China’s approach. Additionally, Beijing is uncomfortable with the junta’s close military ties to Russia. The next U.S. administration, regardless of which candidate wins, will face several critical considerations. Supporting Myanmar’s democratic forces could serve as a counterbalance to China’s regional dominance. If Kamala Harris wins, the Harris administration should address the shortcomings of the current administration’s symbolic support, which has inadvertently led to paradoxical effects, particularly regarding China’s influence over the resistance forces fighting against the military dictatorship—the perpetrators of regional instability. If Donald Trump prevails, the national security-focused Trump administration must adopt a fresh outlook on Myanmar, which might seem like an unimportant spot in Southeast Asia, but is, in fact, a potential source of essential resources for national security, particularly rare earth elements. The Myanmar situation presents an opportunity for the next U.S. administration to demonstrate leadership in promoting democracy while addressing strategic interests in Southeast Asia. By engaging more actively with Myanmar’s pro-democracy forces and working with regional allies to articulate clear, strategic policies on Myanmar that align with broader U.S. interests in Asia-Pacific stability, human rights, and economic security, the U.S. can potentially influence the balance of power in this critical region. For the citizens of the U.S., 'the ballot is stronger than the bullet,' as quoted by Abraham Lincoln.

In Middle East, EU Is An Economic Giant But A Political Dwarf – O...	By Osama Al-Sharif The EU has seen its geopolitical influence decline throughout the world in recent years, but no more so than in the Middle East, a region historically, economically and culturally closer to it than the US. The Europeans have been losing political influence for decades, especially after endorsing the US-sponsored peace accords between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. Exclusive US oversight of the Oslo process sidelined the EU as a block, as well as the UN and Russia, although these three entities remain members of the Quartet — in addition to the US. But Washington has made it clear that it will neutralize any meaningful role of the Quartet to avoid laying any serious pressure on its ally and proxy, Israel. But the EU’s political influence on parties to the Israel-Palestine conflict has also declined in recent years. In this case, it suffered a fatal blow following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing brutal Israeli war on Gaza, which is ongoing and has now stretched to Lebanon. The Europeans, including the British after leaving the union, are divided when it comes to exerting meaningful pressure on Israel to cease its assault on Gaza. Following the Oct. 7 attacks, European leaders flocked to embrace Benjamin Netanyahu and to declare that Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against the aggressor, meaning Hamas and Islamic Jihad. But they soon realized that Netanyahu had unleashed an indiscriminate blitz whose aim was not to decapitate Hamas, as he has claimed, but to kill civilians, destroy infrastructure and eventually drive more than 2.2 million Palestinians toward death, either by direct bombing or by starvation and disease. It became clear that Netanyahu had other plans as he waged what nongovernmental organizations, UN rapporteurs and even the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court have described as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Still the EU has vacillated, as members like Hungary and Austria have rejected calls to bring collective punitive measures against Israel. The leading critical voice of Israeli atrocities in Gaza is foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, who has been banned from entering Israel, Gaza and the West Bank by the far-right Israeli government because of his bold statements. Europe exhibited such divisiveness and lack of a coherent foreign policy when three European states — Spain, Ireland and Slovenia — decided to recognize a Palestinian state in May. The UK, which is widely recognized as triggering the decades-long conflict and causing the Palestinians’ historic injustice, has made no such move. France sat on the fence on this issue as it battled the rise of the pro-Israel far right at home and the decline of its economic influence within the EU. Germany, the EU’s economic and political powerhouse, remained loyal to its blind support of Israel and denial of its war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank. Italy and France took the step of stopping all military shipments to Israel. But at no point was the EU able to initiate a dialogue with the Biden administration about reining in Netanyahu and preventing his doubling down on what is now clearly a crime of ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza. The EU has become dependent on Washington’s support of its policy on Ukraine, the most crucial geopolitical challenge to the bloc since its inception. Yes, the EU and its members remain the biggest donor to UNRWA and other UN agencies working for the welfare of the Palestinians. Brussels is also the biggest financial supporter of the Palestinian Authority. However, such financial support is undercut by its inability to produce a decisive political stand that would influence the trajectory of events in the Occupied Territories. The EU and individual member states have imposed sanctions on Jewish settler groups in the West Bank, as has the US. But that has not prevented Netanyahu’s far-right government from unleashing a settler-led wave of terror and mayhem against West Bank Palestinians. And when South Africa brought what has become a seminal charge of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice, Germany and, at one point, the UK moved in to defend Israel and attempt to throw out the case, despite the tens of thousands of Palestinians who have so far been killed. Historically, the EU has been a progressive entity when it comes to addressing the plight of the Palestinians and how the conflict should be resolved. In 1980, it issued the famous Venice Declaration, which recognized the Palestinian right to self-determination and the concept of the two-state solution based on UN Security Council resolutions. Aside from the US’ dominant role in managing peace talks between Israel and the PA, which have been nonexistent for almost 15 years now, the EU has gone through significant internal transformations that have eroded its role in the international arena, especially the Middle East. While the EU remains the third-largest economy in the world in terms of gross domestic product, its economies have been suffering from slow or negative growth, rising inflation, immigration, both legal and illegal, too many regulations, Donald Trump’s first-term tariffs policy and pressure to increase defense spending, NATO challenges and, finally, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The last of these has depleted the EU’s resources and, together with the immigration issue, allowed the far right to make historic gains in local, national and EU-wide elections. Euroskeptics like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni now want to 'change' the EU from within, extracting benefits while hollowing out its real spirit of unification. The UK’s influence in the Middle East is also waning. The Gaza war has singled out the US as the only player that is capable of stopping the massacre of Palestinians and preventing a regional spillover. But it is Israel’s pivot to becoming a rogue state — its parliament last week voted to abolish all agreements with UNRWA­­ — that is putting the EU and its fundamental value system under pressure. The group does not influence Israel, while several state members continue to defend Netanyahu’s genocidal war. Its economic support of the Palestinians does little to change the needle as far as a political settlement is concerned. Moreover, the rise of other global and regional powers, such as China, Russia and the Gulf states, has created new diplomatic channels and alliances, reducing Europe’s relative importance. One should add that Europe’s responses to various other Middle Eastern crises, including the Syrian civil war and the so-called Arab Spring, have been criticized as slow and ineffective, damaging its credibility. And unlike the US, the Europeans have a modest military presence in the Middle East, thus limiting their diplomatic options when it comes to intervening in the Israel-Palestine conflict. While the EU as a group is still an influential economic power, it has proven to be a political dwarf when it comes to addressing geopolitical challenges, not only in the Middle East but in the Southern Mediterranean as a whole. This has been most evident in France’s failure to intervene in the Israel-Lebanon showdown, despite Paris seeing itself as a guarantor of its former colony’s stability.

The Search For Happiness – OpEd	By Jonathan Power Want to be happy? Even if Trump wins? Read on! Sigmund Freud, the great psychiatrist, said that people can never be fully happy. But most people are reasonably happy, according to numerous surveys. Even in the slums of Calcutta a majority are. Read 'The City of Joy' by Dominique Lapierre. According to one survey Nigerians are the happiest. (But other surveys say it is Denmark, a country with a cradle to the grave welfare system where one doesn’t have to worry so much about one’s health or old—falling in love, doing well in an exam, having a child born, being rescued at sea and so on. These are called by psychologists 'peak experiences'. They don’t last long. Georgio Armani, the fashion designer, who seems to have everything—a job he loves and is very successful at, a couple of beautiful houses, a nice car and a gorgeous looking wife—says you can’t get hold of happiness. It is there and then it’s gone. For most people happiness declines from the time of their youth until they are around 40 and then turns a corner and increases until they are 70 and over. Presumably it takes that long to get on top of life, answer or accommodate to its demands and find a measure of peace. Divorce or separation from a partner one has loved immensely can wreak havoc with happiness. The death of a child even more so. Indeed, people say that in many cases parents never recover from that. A survey According to a survey in Switzerland comparing cantons, the more democratic cantons have a happier population. But no one knows if this applies to countries. But we do know that democracies don’t go to war with each other, creating untold misery and broken families. A strong religious belief also works as a boost (even if non-believers are content that they are more rational). Acts of charity and joining a club of like-minded people also bring happiness. In Aldous Huxley’s novel 'Brave New World' the following conversation takes place between a young man, nicknamed 'the Savage', and an official. 'Don’t you want to be comfortable?', enquires the official. 'I don’t want comfort', the Savage replies. 'I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want goodness, I want sin.' 'In fact', the official observes, 'you’re claiming the right to be unhappy' 'All right then,' says the Savage, 'I’m claiming the right to be unhappy.' A small minority of us are like that, but not many. In the middle class Most of us in the middle class seeking more happiness and a more comfortable life by buying a car, a new computer, a set of furniture or going on a luxury holiday will be disappointed to find that after the initial pleasure happiness wears off. But if we didn’t seek these things national income would go downhill – the hospitals and schools would decline as taxation revenues from sales taxes fell. Then, of course, unhappiness would set in. It seems in capitalism we do need the majority of us to be selfish and acquisitive (even if we make some room for those who reject materialism as long as they are a small minority). John Stuart Mill was wrong when he wrote that he looked forward to a stationary state 'where economic growth and ceaseless economic striving would end with the realization of abundance'. The greatest economist of them all, John Maynard Keynes, wrote: 'The time is not far off when economic problems will take a back seat where they belong and the heart will be occupied by the real problems, the problems of life and human relations, of creation and behaviour and religion.' But this goes against what we know: society at large has to stay on the economic treadmill, or it will fall apart. (But that is no excuse for bankers’ salaries or a debilitating distribution of income.) All of us will lose happiness if we become unemployed, retire on too modest a pension, get depressed, are discriminated against or suffer ill health. Extreme pain is probably the worst thing imaginable. With the right medicines 90% can be helped, but many hospitals won’t give pain priority and some pain-relieving drugs are banned, such as in the US morphine-based drugs because they are subject to abuse by drug addicts. Doctors are under-trained in medical schools to deal with pain. The American constitution talks about the right to 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'. We have some way to go. For 17 years, Jonathan Power was a foreign affairs columnist for the International Herald Tribune.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeYDkt2YLl9-o83ZgXm-4UF	2024-11-05T15:29:22-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Region’s Prospects – OpEd	A little over a century ago, the region was always a net exporter o f goods and services to the outside world. Today, it is a net importer of most of what it consumes. This should pose an important question mark for the leaders of the region. How has the region changed from a net exporter of goods and services to a net importer in just over a century? It is not an easy issue to address in a short article such as this represents but one should note that the Horn of Africa States region needs to work hard. The trend we see is not comfortable and especially when we know that the region could do much better than it currently does. This is a severe drain of the meagre resources it receives through its exports and from its migrant populations outside the region. The aid and grants which is received from some helping hands cannot and will not sustain the growing population of the region. They usually take them back, these helping hands, whatever they provided through different channels including employment of their own personnel at the expense of local qualified people. As Macrotrends, a premier research platform for long term investors reports, the region continues to import more than it exports. As of 2023, the region imported some US$ 40 billion (2022: US$ 38 billion) while it exported only half of that at about US$ 20 billion (2022: US$ 18 billion). The following are compilation tables by the author of the data Macrotrends has given on the exports and imports of the Horn of Africa States. The institution does not have any information on Eritrea, but which in any way is small and would not change the trends of the region as a whole. The exports of goods and services, according to Macrotrends, 'represent the value of all goods and other market services provided to the rest of the world. They include the value of merchandise, freight, insurance, transport, travel, royalties, license fees, and other services, such as communication, construction, financial, information, business, personal, and government services. They exclude compensation of employees and investment income (formerly called factor services) and transfer payments.'

They include the value of merchandise, freight, insurance, transport, travel, royalties, license fees, and other services, such as communication, construction, financial, information, business, personal, and government services.

The run into BRICS as seems to be the case on the part of Ethiopia is not the answer to the dilemma of the growing negative differential between exports and imports and should this trend continue, the region will remain to be always, as is presently the case, at the mercy of others. The region is required to correct this growing negative trade balance. Most of the imports include food imports when the region can produce more than it needs and can even export, as it used to do in the past. The region can re-initiate the old manufacturing industries and in particular, its clothing industry, its gold industry, its leather industry, and its implements industries at least to reduce the import content of these commodities and more. Energy is a substantial bill which adds to the deficit and the region is substantially endowed with local energy sources such as wind, geothermal, solar and hydropower, which it can deploy to reduce the energy import bill. Although it is easily said than done, the oil and gas reserves also offer another opportunity, which the region should emphasize on despite the trend to do away with fossil fuels. This would, however, stay with us over the next hundred some years and the region should not wait long to explore all the possibilities in this regard. Somalia already seems to be working in this respect and the other countries of the region should do the same. A positive change can only occur when there is the right attitude and the right environment. Currently the continuing civil wars and the instabilities they entail, the drifting apart of the countries of the region, and the continuing interference of foreigners in the affairs of the region are not helpful. The interference of some countries of the region in other’s internal affairs of the same region are not helping either. The Red Sea and Gulf States dynamics have also negatively impacted the region, and it is where the necessity for the region to collaborate and cooperate is needed. Apparently most foreign parties deal with each country separately and hence play on the weaknesses of each country against the other which weakens the region. A common approach of the region would have done better for the region and would have lessened the issues upon which the foreign interfering parties play. It is where an economically integrated platform for the region would have helped most, allowing for the movement of labor, capital, goods, and services to move easily between the countries of the region. Could this ever happen – an economically integrated Horn of Africa States region? It is a million Dollar question but the prospect we see, nevertheless, and it is our hope the regional leaders would revisit their books and work towards that goal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeYDkt2YLl9-ry51QE7HLhO	2024-11-05T15:27:09-08:00	
India On The Edge: Fractures And Fragile Relations – OpEd	As India approaches its centenary of independence in 2047, it faces a landscape fraught with both external challenges and internal discontent, revealing unsettling fractures in national unity. The inauguration of the high-altitude Sela Tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh, opposed vehemently by Beijing, exemplifies the increasingly strained ties with China, as well as the precariousness of India’s regional diplomacy. This infrastructure project, intended to solidify India’s presence in a strategically sensitive zone, has intensified China’s unease. Chinese officials have openly criticized the development, viewing it as New Delhi’s attempt to assert military advantage in disputed territory (CNN, 2024; Business Today, 2024). According to South China Morning Post (2024), the Chinese response highlights Beijing’s perception of India’s border policy as overtly aggressive, a stance that could escalate beyond diplomatic protests. Such infrastructure-driven displays of strength suggest that India’s actions are not solely aimed at national security but also reveal its aspiration to dominate the region. This approach is not limited to the Sela Tunnel. India’s maneuvers on the Doklam plateau, where New Delhi stepped in to counter Chinese infrastructure projects on Bhutanese soil, underscore a growing willingness to confront China and assert its sphere of influence (The New York Times, 2024). By involving itself in Bhutan’s affairs, India not only drew China’s ire but also sent a message to smaller states that it remains a dominant power in South Asia. However, this assertive posture risks alienating its neighbors. Scholars have suggested that such a dominance-based approach aligns with the theory of hegemonic power, which posits that a state often masks its control as stability-seeking behavior but in reality undermines the sovereignty of its smaller neighbors (The Diplomat, 2019). In India’s case, Bhutan, Nepal, and even Bangladesh may perceive these moves as less about regional security and more about consolidating New Delhi’s influence at their expense. India’s strained relations with Nepal and Bangladesh further illustrate the ramifications of this hegemonic stance. With Nepal, a long-standing border dispute has fostered diplomatic friction and anti-India sentiment within Nepalese borders, reflecting broader concerns over sovereignty. In Bangladesh, relations have fluctuated, with recent tensions questioning India’s commitment to regional cooperation (BBC, 2024). For a country striving for leadership in South Asia, such rifts undermine India’s claims of being a unifying force, leaving a troubling void that could destabilize the regional order. As South China Morning Post (2024) notes, these issues exemplify the paradox of India’s regional ambition: the more it seeks to assert control, the more it risks creating a zone of instability. While these international issues challenge India’s image as a stabilizing power, internal fractures hint at an even more profound threat to its unity. Societal divisions have grown more pronounced, reflecting deep-seated grievances among various communities across the nation. As tensions rise between different groups, the potential for conflict increases, exacerbating the fragility of India’s social fabric. The central government’s focus on a majoritarian agenda, coupled with inadequate attention to the needs and rights of minority communities, has led to growing disillusionment. The result is a country where the promise of unity in diversity is increasingly called into question. The push for regional autonomy and recognition of diverse identities must be understood within the broader context of India’s federal structure, which has historically accommodated diversity through linguistic and cultural recognition. Yet, as The Diplomat (2019) observes, the increasing centralization of power under the current administration threatens to erode this delicate balance. A governance model that prioritizes regional identities over centralized control could offer a path to cohesion. But if the central government continues to dismiss these concerns, it risks widening the fault lines across different regions. India’s approach to its internal divisions must therefore become as nuanced as its diplomacy, or the calls for autonomy may evolve into a full-blown crisis of identity. Looking toward 2047, the sum of these challenges paints a picture of a country at a crossroads. India has the option to pursue a more cooperative approach, both internally and externally, that respects the aspirations of its citizens and neighbors. Externally, India would benefit from recalibrating its approach to regional disputes—pursuing dialogue and trust-building with Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh rather than asserting dominance. Domestically, it must engage constructively with all communities, acknowledging their cultural and economic needs. Through proactive measures that uphold unity within diversity, India could indeed achieve a stable and unified statehood in its centennial year. However, if these challenges are met with rigidity and indifference, India’s future may indeed hold a disquieting turn. The implications are profound: failing to mend these fractures risks a future where 2047 marks not a century of unity but the unraveling of India’s fragile cohesion—a somber reflection on a path that could have been one of resilience and unity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeYDkt2YLl9-tZq1YHa6Gi2	2024-11-05T15:25:34-08:00	
King Salman Invites Najib Mikati To Attend Arab-Islamic Summit Ai...	By Najia Houssari The caretaker prime minister of Lebanon, Najib Mikati, received an invitation on Tuesday from King Salman bin Abdulaziz to participate in the extraordinary joint Arab-Islamic summit scheduled for Nov. 11 in Riyadh. The summit will address Israeli assaults on the Palestinian people and Lebanese territories, coinciding with an increase in Israeli drone strikes in Beirut, southern Lebanon and Bekaa, resulting in further civilian casualties. Mikati received the invitation from Waleed Bukhari, the Saudi ambassador to Lebanon. The invitation stated that participation in the summit is a 'reaffirmation of Arab and Islamic solidarity in efforts to halt Israeli aggression and to promote the pursuit of a just resolution to the Palestinian issue, ensuring the rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.' Israel’s ground war in has completed its 44th day, and the toll since Hezbollah opened the southern front 13 months ago exceeds 3,000 dead and more than 13,000 wounded. As the assaults diminished in the southern suburbs of Beirut, residents had the chance to inspect their homes and retrieve whatever belongings they could. However, the confrontations remained intense in the southern regions, and airstrikes continued in the south and in the Bekaa region. Two Israeli airstrikes targeted the Jiyeh area, 28 km south of Beirut, killing a woman and wounding seven people — who were taken to Sibline Governmental Hospital. Airstrikes hit a building near Sheikh Ragheb Harb Hospital in Toul, and a shop in Jwaya. An airstrike on the outskirts of Bazouriyeh caused injuries, while four people were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the town of Baflieh in the Tyre district. An elderly woman, Ghadia Al-Suwaid, who had insisted on staying in her home in the border town of Al-Dhayra Al-Fawqa, was suspected to have been kidnapped by Israeli soldiers. The woman’s relatives told the National News Agency that 'they entered the town in the morning and did not find her.' Meanwhile, a Red Cross convoy, in coordination with UNIFIL, headed to Wata Khiam, also on the border, to complete the recovery of 15 bodies from rubble after airstrikes hit their home eight days ago. The Red Cross retrieved five bodies two days ago, but larger machinery was needed to continue clearing the rubble. An airstrike on the town of Deir Kifa killed two people and wounded several others. Israeli military vehicles were seen advancing at the Shebaa Farms toward Al-Sadana heights and Shebaa Gate, where clashes were reported between Israeli forces and Hezbollah members. On Tuesday morning, Israeli forces tried to infiltrate Rmeish but were forced to retreat after clashes with Hezbollah fighters, while in Haris an unknown motorcyclist was killed in an Israeli airstrike. In Bekaa, an Israeli drone targeted a car on the road between Hortaala and Talia, carrying a displaced family from Baalbek. The raid killed three siblings, Nathalie, Raed and Mohammed Naji Dandash, and wounded their mother, Iman Fawzat Habib, who was transferred to Dar Al Amal University Hospital. Hezbollah claimed to have struck 'a gathering of Israeli soldiers in Doviv and Ma’ale Golani barracks, and another … in the hills of Kfar Shuba. We bombed an explosives factory in Hadera, south of Haifa, with a salvo of qualitative missiles.' Israeli army spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, meanwhile, claimed that Israeli forces had destroyed 'an underground infrastructure of about 70 meters long and confiscating weapons and rocket launchers in rugged and underground areas in southern Lebanon.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf7XJI3zoaLRFpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-05T15:23:39-08:00	
Iran’s First Privately Developed Satellites Launched Into Orbit O...	In a milestone for Iran’s private space sector, satellites 'Kowsar' and 'Hodhod' were successfully launched into orbit aboard a Russian Soyuz launcher, marking the country’s initial private effort in satellite production and space deployment. Iranian satellites Kowsar and Hodhod were sent into space as part of a payload carried by the Russian Soyuz launcher, which delivered 53 satellites to orbit. This launch represents a significant advancement for Iran, highlighting the first satellite manufacturing and launching attempt from its private space sector. The Kowsar satellite, weighing 30 kilograms, is a high-resolution sensing satellite designed for applications in agriculture, natural resource management, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. With a resolution capability of 3.45 meters, Kowsar surpasses Iran's goal of producing satellites with 10-meter ground sample distance (GSD) cameras by 2025. Kowsar has a lifespan of 3.5 years in orbit, positioned at an altitude of 500 kilometers, and is capable of capturing six frames per second over a 15-kilometer range. Its imaging is achieved using an RGB camera with 3.45-meter resolution and an NIR camera with 5.5-meter resolution, supported by a maximum platform weight of 35 kilograms. The satellite’s orbital period is 5,677 seconds, with pointing and stability accuracies of 1 degree and 0.05 degrees per second, respectively. Power is sustained by its 44 watt-hour production capacity, and it consumes 29 watt-hours to operate its payloads. Meanwhile, Hodhod serves as a small communications satellite intended to create satellite-based communication networks and enhance Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. Targeted at regions with limited terrestrial communication access, Hodhod offers communication solutions in remote and inaccessible areas. Built to the CubeSat standard, the satellite operates in a 500-kilometer orbit and supports precision agriculture, transportation, logistics, and environmental monitoring. Its primary mission focuses on expanding IoT capabilities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf7XJI3zoaLREAjpzy0NvCI	2024-11-05T15:21:00-08:00	
Haiti: Convent Founded By Mother Teresa Burned Down In Continued ...	By Madalaine Elhabbal In an escalation of violence, an armed Haitian gang has looted and burned down a Missionaries of Charity convent, which had been founded by Mother Teresa herself in 1979. According to a report by Zenit news, the devastating attack took place on the night of Oct. 26. The group of attackers was led by one of Haiti’s most infamous gang leaders — ex-police officer Jimmy Chérizier, also known as 'Barbeque.' Chérizier heads up the Revolutionary Forces of the G9 Family and Allies, a coalition of nine gangs based in the capital city, Port-au-Prince. He has been a principal agitator in efforts to topple the remnants of Haiti’s government. Chérizier and his men looted the convent and its adjacent aid dispensary before leaving the property in flames. None of the nuns were injured, as police had asked them to vacate the property a month before the attack, according to a Vatican report. The Missionaries of Charity has provided free medical care to vulnerable members of the surrounding community since its establishment, serving approximately 1,500 inpatients and 30,000 outpatients per year, according to the report. 'Stolen items are now openly sold in the market near the San José school,' Sister Paësie, founder of the Kizito Family — a religious community located in the largest slum in Port-au-Prince — told Zenit.

At the beginning of the year, six nuns belonging to the St. Anne’s congregation were abducted by gang members. Widespread chaos and violence from gangs have been rampant throughout the country since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse by a group of mostly foreign mercenaries in July 2021. Moïse had refused to vacate office after his term ended in February 2021 and had faced calls from opposition parties to step down on account of his alleged corruption and incompetence. Then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry assumed office, which provoked further aggression. Chérizier has threatened civil war if Henry does not resign. 'The situation in Port-au-Prince is unacceptable, intolerable, and inconceivable,' Father Baudelaire Martial, CSC, of the Congregation of Holy Cross told CNA in August. 'We live in very precarious conditions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf7XJI3zoaLRJp-cVEvAVVq	2024-11-05T15:19:18-08:00	
Dance Of Electrons Measured In The Glow From Exploding Neutron-St...	The temperature of elementary particles has been observed in the radioactive glow following the collision of two neutron stars and the birth of a black hole. This has, for the first time, made it possible to measure the microscopic, physical properties in these cosmic events. Simultaneously, it reveals how snapshot observations made in an instant represents an object stretched out across time. The discovery was made by astrophysicists from the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen and is published in the international scientific journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. New method of observation shows the creation of heavy elements The collision of two neutron stars has created the smallest black hole yet observed. The dramatic, cosmic collision resulted in, apart from the birth of a black hole, a ball of fire, expanding with nearly the speed of light. In the following days it shone with a luminosity comparable to hundreds of millions of Suns. This luminous object, aka a kilonova, shines this bright because of the emission of large amounts of radiation from the decay of the heavy, radioactive elements created in the explosion. By combining the measurements of the kilonova light, made with telescopes across the Globe, an international team of researchers, led by The Cosmic DAWN Center at the Niels Bohr Institute, have closed in on the enigmatic nature of the explosion and come closer to the answer of an old, astrophysical question: Where do the elements, heavier than iron, come from? Observatories all over the Globe took part in the observations 'This astrophysical explosion develops dramatically hour by hour, so no single telescope can follow its entire story. The viewing angle of the individual telescopes to the event are blocked by the rotation of the Earth. But by combining the existing measurements from Australia, South Africa and The Hubble Space Telescope we can follow its development in great detail. We show that the whole shows more than the sum of the individual sets of data' says Albert Sneppen, PhD student at the Niels Bohr Institute and leader of the new study. The explosion resembles The Universe shortly after the Big Bang Just after the collision the fragmented star-matter has a temperature of many billion degrees. A thousand times hotter than even the center of the Sun and comparable to the temperature of the Universe just one second after the Big Bang. Temperatures this extreme results in electrons not being attached to atomic nuclei, but instead floating around in a so-called ionized plasma. The electrons 'dance' around. But in the ensuing moments, minutes, hours and days, the star-matter cools, just like the entire Universe after the Big Bang. The fingerprint of Strontium is evidence of the creation of heavy elements 370,000 years after the Big Bang the Universe had cooled sufficiently for the electrons to attach to atomic nuclei and make the first atoms. Light could now travel freely in the Universe because it was no longer blocked by the free electrons. This means that the earliest light we can see in the history of the Universe is this so-called 'cosmic background radiation' – a patchwork of light, constituting the remote background of the night sky. A similar process of the unification of electrons with atomic nuclei can now be observed in the star-matter of the explosion. One of the concrete results is the observation of heavy elements like Strontium and Yttrium. They are easy to detect, but it is likely that many other heavy elements which we were unsure of the origin of, were also created in the explosion. 'We can now see the moment where atomic nuclei and electrons are uniting in the afterglow. For the first time we see the creation of atoms, we can measure the temperature of the matter and see the micro physics in this remote explosion. It is like admiring three cosmic background radiation surrounding us from all sides, but here, we get to see everything from the outside. We see before, during and after the moment of birth of the atoms', says Rasmus Damgaard, PhD student at Cosmic DAWN Center and co-author of the study. Kasper Heintz, co-author and assistant professor at the Niels Bohr Institute continues: 'The matter expands so fast and gains in size so raidly, to the extent where it takes hours for the light to travel across the explosion. This is why, just by observing the remote end of the fire ball, we can see further back in the history of the explosion. Closer to us the electrons have hooked on to atomic nuclei, but on the other side, on the far side of the newborn black hole, the 'present' is still just future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID7bxGkpaS-gs	2024-11-05T15:16:55-08:00	
Small Reductions To Meat Production In Wealthier Countries May He...	Scientists and environmental activists have consistently called for drastic reductions in meat production as a way to reduce emissions and, in doing so, combat climate change. However, a new analysis concludes that a smaller reduction, borne by wealthier nations, could remove 125 billion tons of carbon dioxide—exceeding the total number of global fossil fuel emissions over the past three years—from the atmosphere. Small cutbacks in higher-income countries—approximately 13% of total production—would reduce the amount of land needed for cattle grazing, the researchers note, allowing forests to naturally regrow on current pastureland. The return of trees—long known to effectively absorb, or sequester, carbon dioxide (CO2)—would drive significant declines in fossil fuel emissions, which the study’s authors estimate would roughly equal three years’ worth of global emissions. 'We can achieve enormous climate benefits with modest changes to the total global beef production,' says Matthew N. Hayek, an assistant professor in New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies and the lead author of the analysis, which appears in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). 'By focusing on regions with potentially high carbon sequestration in forests, some restoration strategies could maximize climate benefits while minimizing changes to food supplies.' The analysis found that pasturelands, especially in areas that were once forests, hold immense promise for mitigating climate change. When livestock are removed from these 'potential native forest' areas, ecosystems can revert to their natural forested state, capturing carbon in trees and soil. The paper’s authors see high- and upper-middle-income countries as viable candidates for reduction in beef production because they have some current pasture areas that do not produce very much grass per acre, exist where grass grows only during a short growing season, and are in areas that could, instead, grow vast, lush forests with deep soils that work to sequester carbon. This differs significantly from other regions, including sub-Saharan Africa and South America, where much more pasture can grow year-round, producing more feed for animals per acre than northern countries. In addition, the research team sees ways lower-income regions could increase the efficiency at which cattle are fed and raised on grass as a way to offset the minor loss in production from higher-income countries. 'This isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution,' Hayek emphasizes. 'Our findings show that strategic improvements in the efficiency of cattle herds in some areas, coupled with decreased production in others, could lead to a win-win scenario for climate and food production.' The study reveals an even more dramatic potential for climate mitigation if the scope of restoration was expanded. The researchers found that removing cattle, sheep, and other grazing livestock from all potentially natively forested areas globally could sequester a staggering 445 gigatons of CO2 by the end of this century—the equivalent to more than a decade of current global fossil fuel emissions. 'Importantly, this approach would still allow livestock grazing to remain on native grasslands and dry rangelands, which are places where crops or forests cannot easily grow,' says Hayek. 'These areas support more than half of global pasture production, meaning that this ambitious forest restoration scenario would require cutting global cattle, sheep, and other livestock herds by less than half. These findings underscore the immense potential of natural forest restoration as a climate solution.' The PNAS study used remote sensing technology to track pasture productivity—the amount of grass produced annually that livestock can consume—in order to estimate the climate benefits that reductions would yield. 'Even if two different areas can regrow the same amount of carbon in trees, we can now know how much pasture, hence beef production, we would have to lose in each area to grow those trees back,' explains Johannes Piipponen, a doctoral candidate at Finland’s Aalto University and coauthor of the study, who led this technical advance. 'For many consumers in high-income regions, like Europe and North America, reducing excessive meat consumption benefits both their health and the environment. However, until now, it has remained rather unclear where the required decreases in production could begin.' Maps produced by the team’s research can identify areas where policies could be prioritized for reducing beef production and hastening forest recovery—for instance, by offering forest land conservation incentives or buyouts to beef producers. The authors acknowledge that ecosystem regrowth is not a substitute for efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions. But, it can serve as a powerful complement to combat climate change. 'In many places, this regrowth could occur by seeds naturally dispersing and trees regrowing without any human involvement,' says Hayek. 'However, in some places, with especially degraded environments or soils, native and diverse tree-planting could accelerate forest restoration, giving regrowth a helping hand. This long-term regrowth would benefit the climate for decades to come, with significant regrowth and carbon capture beginning within just a few years in many areas, and lasting for 75 years or more until forests nearly mature.' The authors also emphasize that while the findings do not call for extreme changes to global food production and trade patterns, swift action is necessary in order to meet climate goals. 'Within the next two decades, countries are aiming to meet critical climate mitigation targets under international agreements, and ecosystem restoration on converted pasturelands can be a critical part of that,' observes Hayek. 'Our study’s findings could offer paths forward for policymakers aiming to address both climate mitigation and food security concerns. As countries worldwide commit to ambitious reforestation targets, we hope that this research can help identify and prioritize the most effective areas for carbon sequestration efforts while considering global food needs.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID3FkfDZIGQ90	2024-11-05T15:14:39-08:00	
Limited Political Choices In Capitalist Democracies – OpEd	The advanced capitalist countries—including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, and several Western European nations—have failed to offer their citizens a genuine range of choices in terms of availability and accessibility of multiple political parties, different ideologies, alternative policies options, and visions for the future. Despite relative prosperity and established democratic frameworks within these countries often present limited, binary options within their political systems. These dominant options based on two party system shape political discourse with policies and ideologies that are often indistinguishable. This lack of choice is not accidental; it is a deliberate design to protect the economic interests of both ruling and non-ruling elites within a capitalist framework. Although multiple political parties officially exist and registered in these advanced capitalist countries, they often exist in name only or work as interest groups. These smaller parties are frequently marginalised within mainstream political discourse, particularly in the media and in electoral democracy as elections are too expensive in a market led society. As a result, they struggle to gain visibility, which limits public awareness of diverse perspectives and reduces the influence of alternative ideas on issues crucial to both citizens and the country. This media emphasis on dominant parties narrows the spectrum of political choices available to citizens, reinforcing the status quo and restricting meaningful ideological and policy choices which are confined within two party system. This bipolarisation of politics hinders the deepening of a democracy that serves both people and the planet. The advocates of capitalism have long argued that capitalism is not only necessary condition for freedom but also essential for democracy. Such ahistorical arguments frame capitalism as the foundation upon which democracy and freedom rest. It suggests that economic liberty under capitalism naturally leads to political and social freedoms. The idea is to reinforce capitalism as central to every democratic decision-making processes, political institutions and structures of governance. Such an ideological foundation gives capitalism upper hand and weakens the foundations and functioning of democracy. The primacy of capitalism as an ideological project weakens diversities of decision-making processes within a democratic set up. Therefore, the single window systems of decision making emerged to facilitate interests of capitalism. Work and starve is not freedom, it is another form of slavery. Developed economy with deprived people in an alienated society is not ideal for human lives. The democratic systems within capitalist societies neither provide genuine freedom nor uphold true democratic values. Instead, they restrict political choices, limiting the availability of alternative political perspectives, as it is easier to manage a few elite classes than to address the needs of the working masses. Subsequently, capitalist democracy shapes society and promotes policies that align with the interests of a select few dominant elites. The dominance of two-party systems—such as the Democrats and Republicans in the USA, Labour and Conservatives in the UK, and similar polarising duality of political trends in France, Australia, and Japan—illuminates how capitalist democracies offer only limited, binary options in their electoral processes. These two dominant parties ultimately represent two different facets of capitalist interests, offering minimal choice to citizens while maintaining the status quo. Capitalism and its political cultures are incompatible with democratic diversities. It stands in opposition to fundamental democratic values, particularly freedom of political choice, which is essential for a thriving democratic society. Capitalism inherently creates cultures of democratic deficit, making true political diversity nearly impossible to realise. By streamlining political processes and consolidating decision-making, capitalism safeguards its own interests, which are threatened by democratic decentralisation. Capitalism often forms alliances with authoritarian, reactionary, feudal and religious forces and ensures their electoral victory with the help of mass media and propaganda. Therefore, capitalism often undermines robust democracies with multi-party systems, advocating for 'efficiency' as a justification for limiting political plurality and centralising power. The two leading capitalist democracies, the UK and the US, exemplify how democracy can be undermined by the bipolarisation of politics, where two dominant parties offer only two different versions of capitalist interests. This system effectively erases alternatives, even within existing democratic frameworks. Leaders like Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Bernie Sanders in the United States encountered significant obstacles, as the entrenched capitalist political structures suppressed even minimal progressive, liberal, and democratic ideals. Capitalism, at its core, is fundamentally opposed to the values of democracy, prioritising the protection of property, property owners, and their interests under the guise of democratic principles. Bipolarisation of politics with two dominant political parties are concomitant with requirements of capitalism. Radical democracy can only be achieved through the political mobilisation of working people, whose struggles have the potential to deepen democracy and embrace a diversity of ideals, policies, and visions for an egalitarian society free from inequality and exploitation. It is impossible to uphold the interests of working people without continuous struggle for radical democracy. In essence, working class struggle is not only merely a fight to preserve democracy itself but also a movement to protect people from the exploitative nature of capitalism. Working class struggles are inherently struggles for democracy. It is time to embrace and celebrate the ideals of working-class struggles ensure the democratic politics and policies of peace and prosperity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID2SGgqUU2Ifs	2024-11-05T15:12:06-08:00	
Bio-Based Fibers Could Pose Greater Threat To The Environment Tha...	Bio-based materials may pose a greater health risk to some of the planet’s most important species than the conventional plastics they are designed to replace, a new study has shown. Such materials are increasingly being advocated as environmentally friendly alternatives to plastics, and used in textiles and products including clothing, wet wipes and period products. However, microfibres of the materials are emitted into the environment through the laundry cycle, the application of sewage sludge as fertilisers, or the simple wear and tear of textile products. Despite increasing quantities of bio-based products being produced and sold all over the world, there has been little research to assess their potential impact on species and ecosystems. To address that, a new study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology tested the effects of conventional polyester fibres and two bio-based fibres –viscose and lyocell – on earthworms, a species critical to the health of soils globally. The study found that in high concentrations of fibres, 30% of earthworms died after 72 hours when exposed to polyester, while those exposed to the bio-based fibres experienced much higher mortality of up to 60% in the case of lyocell and 80% for viscose. A second experiment, using environmentally relevant concentrations of the fibres, indicated that earthworms housed in soils containing viscose fibres exhibited reduced reproduction compared to those exposed to polyester fibres. Earthworms in the soils containing lyocell fibres showed reduced growth and also higher rates of burrowing within the soil compared to exposure to the other types of fibre. The researchers say the study highlights the complex nature of global efforts to reduce the threat of microplastic pollution, and the importance of testing new materials being advocated as alternatives to plastics before they are released on the open market. The study was carried out as part of the BIO-PLASTIC-RISK project, led by researchers at the University of Plymouth and the University of Bath, and supported with £2.6million funding by the Natural Environmental Research Council. Dr Winnie Courtene-Jones, lead author on the new study and now a Lecturer in Marine Pollution at Bangor University, said: 'Over 320,000 tonnes of bio-based and biodegradable fibres were produced globally in 2022 and research shows that substantial quantities of that will end up in the environment. However, evidence of their ecological impacts has been lacking. Our study has shown that bio-based fibres have a range of adverse effects on earthworms – animals which are critical to the functioning of the environment. It highlights the importance of gathering further evidence before alternatives to conventional plastics are made available even more widely.' The new study follows research published earlier in 2024 which highlighted that being exposed to the materials used in biodegradable teabags can result in earthworm populations experiencing up to 15% greater mortality, and have a detrimental effect on earthworm reproduction. It has been published just a few weeks before the United Nations gathers world leaders meet in Busan, South Korea, for the final round of negotiations regarding a possible Global Plastics Treaty. Professor Richard Thompson OBE FRS, senior author on the new study and Head of the University of Plymouth’s International Marine Litter Research Unit, will be at those discussions along with policy makers, scientists and other delegates from across the world. He added: 'It is clear that along with recycling and re-use, tackling plastic pollution will require a reduction in the quantities of plastics used and produced. There is increasing interest in alternative materials that could be used as substitutes for plastic, but this publication further emphasises the importance of testing new innovations in relevant environmental settings prior to widescale adoption. I firmly believe it is possible to tackle the plastic pollution crisis, but independent scientific evidence will be critical in helping us avoid unintended consequences as we look for solutions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWesDGXoQBkID9aJOktci3qz	2024-11-05T15:10:44-08:00	
NATO Secretary General Hails Italy’s Contributions To Euro-Atlant...	Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Italy today (5 November 2024), where he met Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and President Sergio Mattarella. He underscored the importance of continuing to strengthen deterrence and defence, and step up support to Ukraine. 'Keeping our one billion people safe is NATO’s most sacred duty, and that is why we are ramping up our defence industrial capacity,' the Secretary General said, adding that 'we need to go further and faster, for our own deterrence and to support Ukraine.' The Secretary General underlined that Italy is 'a staunch and reliable Ally, contributing in many ways to Euro-Atlantic security.' He highlighted Italy’s lead of NATO’s new battlegroup in Bulgaria, its contributions to NATO’s deployments in Hungary and Latvia, and the deployment of Italy’s jets to protect Allied airspace and ships to keep crucial seaways open. 'Italy is once again leading our peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, KFOR, helping to foster stability in the Western Balkans,' he added. The Secretary General thanked Prime Minister Meloni 'for being such a strong supporter of Ukraine.' He underscored that Allies and partners 'will continue to stand by Ukraine, because Ukraine’s fight is our fight,' and welcomed Italy’s strong support for the action plan adopted at the Washington Summit for a stronger, more strategic and results-oriented approach towards NATO’s southern neighbourhood. During his visit, Secretary General Rutte also visited the Italian facilities of the defence manufacturing group Rheinmetall.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeexzagsbNYtyM1cUzeEsby	2024-11-05T09:24:23-08:00	
Beyond Russia-Africa Summits: Unlimited Opportunities And Unprece...	Under the aegis of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Roscongress, the Russia–Africa Partnership Forum will host its highly anticipated first Ministerial Conference from 9th–10th November 2024 at the Sirius Federal Territory in the southern coastal city of Sochi. According official reports, this two-day conference will be under the patronage of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the programme includes a plenary session to be attended by officials, and also round tables and discussions focusing on aspects of declarations from the first and second summits respectively held in 2019 (Sochi) and in 2023 (St. Petersburg). The programme architecture released for the first Ministerial Conference would enhance building on the strategic decisions taken both at the first and second Russia–Africa summits and bring together the heads of ministries of foreign affairs of Russia and African countries, the African Union Commission (AUC), as well as the executive bodies of regional integration associations from Africa. The heads of African regional organizations as well as representatives of government agencies, financial institutions, Russian and African businesses, public and scientific communities, and the media are part of the conference. It would be an opportunity to review the culmination, within the context of geopolitical shift at a critical stage, the evolving relations between Russia and African countries, which is high level of cooperation in several areas: from the collaboration and implementation of economic projects, energy and food security dimensions, the development of bilateral trade and investment partnerships, and scientific-technical, healthcare, tourism and education. These would broadly be discussed with special attention to cooperation between countries of the African continent and the Eurasian Economic Union. In addition, the business programme includes a presentation of the English-language version of the Africa 2025. Prospects and Challenges policy brief prepared by a team of experts at the HSE Centre for African Studies with the support of Uralchem Group, which aims to provide guidance for African experts, scientists, and decision-makers. Reviewing Sochi Summit (2019) Russia has a long time-tested relationship with Africa. After the symbolic Russia-Africa summit in the Black Sea city of Sochi in October 2019, both Russia and Africa adopted a joint declaration, a comprehensive document that outlined the key objectives and necessary tasks that seek to raise assertively the entire relations to a new qualitative level. That official document shows there has been a great interest in the further development of relations between Africa and Russia. Until the 2023 summit, priority areas of economic cooperation in which concrete results could be achieved. Documents showed 92 agreements, contracts and memoranda of understanding were signed at that first Russia-Africa summit. The agreements signed there worth a total of $12.5 billion. Reviewing St. Petersburg Summit (July 2023) The socond summit renewed the commitment to support the struggle for the eradication of colonialism and the establishment of independence of African States, and strengthening their national sovereignty. The 74 point-declaration pointed out explicitly the growing sustainable collaboration in mechanism for dialogue partnership, political and legal cooperation, strengthen cooperation between States to counter new challenges and threats, strengthen trade and economic cooperation, as well as engage Africa in comprehensive spheres including scientific and technical, humanitarian, educational, cultural, sports, health, youth and information cooperation. Joint inter-governmental Commissions Long before holding the two historic summits, there are joint commissions handling matters on trade and economic between Russia and a number of African countries. According to the official documents of Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 28 of such joint commissions were created and have been functioning admirably these several years. The primary responsibility is to coordinate projects and oversee its implementations in Africa. Until today, none has reported any completed infrastructure projects undertaken, completed and handed over to any African country since Soviet's collapse in 1991. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have never, throughout the post-Soviet history of relations between Russia and Africa, cut white ribbons marking the completion of any projects in Africa. Provision of Nuclear Energy In the nuclear power sector, here are a few developments. Russia pledged to thrash out energy deficiency which has affected more 800 million of Africa's 1.4 billion people. Energy shortage negatively affects both domestic and industrial use, and has made provision of nuclear energy its policy priority across Africa. Under an official authorized license from the Egyptian regulator and under the signed intergovernmental agreement, Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation has started the construction of the planned four power units at the El Dabaa nuclear power plant in Egypt. The bilateral agreement was signed as far back in November 2015. Research shows that Russia granted a loan $25 billion for the construction of the nuclear power plants which covers 85% of the work. The remaining expenses be covered by the Egyptian side by attracting private investors. The NPP design envisages four 1200-MW power units with VVER-1200 reactors. Construction is expected to be completed by 2028-2029. Late February 2020, Chairperson of the Federation Council (the Upper House or the Senate), Valentina Matviyenko, headed a Russian delegation on a three-day working visit aimed at strengthening parliamentary diplomacy with Namibia and Zambia. According to an official release from the Federation Council, the visit was within the broad framework mechanism of parliamentary consultations between Russia and African countries. The key focus were on political dialogue, economic partnership and humanitarian spheres with Namibia and Zambia. The delegation held talks with President Edgar Lungu at the State House in Lusaka, Zambia. Matviyenko said: 'Now the start of the construction of a center for nuclear science and technology has been suspended due to financial issues.' According to her that request was submitted to the Russian president and was being carefully considered by the ministries and departments. And it was expected to jointly find options for funding to roll out the construction of a center for nuclear science and technology. More than thirty years, Russia has been pushing for post-Soviet relations. Russia and South Africa are BRICS members. South Africa has also had nuclear contract signed with Russia back from 2015 under Jacob Zuma, at the time of his presidency. According to research sources, main reason why the 2015 nuclear power agreement thrown out by the South Africa's parliament, it attributed to the fact that the agreement was an opaque unilateral deal with Moscow. South Africa's parliament did not discuss and approve the mega-project for the country. According to analytical reports, African countries which signed agreements for such construction of nuclear plants by Russia as follows: Algeria (2014), Ghana (2015), Ethiopia (2019), Republic of Congo (2019), Nigeria (2012, 2016), Rwanda (2018), South Africa (2004), Sudan (2017), Tunisia (2016), Uganda (2019) and Zambia (2016). Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) were signed with Kenya in 2016 and Morocco in 2017. A simple 'memorandum of understanding' on nuclear with Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali in July 2023 in St. Petersburg went viral world-wide as part of Russia's information propaganda, to show its preparedness to support their development initiatives of these French-controlled African states. Sustainable Food Security Russia also has a full-fledged ambitious interest to guarantee sustainable food security by supplying grains across Africa. Russia is a leading producer as well-known. But a critical examination of this corporate deal reveals that Russia's grain supply would still remain as a soft bait (i) to reinforce the existing time-tested relationships with Africa and (ii) to earn revenue from exports to Africa. Notwithstanding that Africa is blessed with huge expanse of land and climate for agricultural production to feed its population. Some experts and international organizations have also expressed the fact that African leaders have to adopt import substitution mechanisms and use their financial resources on strengthening agricultural production systems. Establishing food security is important for millions of people facing hunger in Africa and is crucial for sustainable economic development and long-term prosperity of the continent. A few African countries have adopted import substitution, agricultural policy and strategically working towards self-sufficiency. Interfax reports indicated that Russia expected to export up to 70 million metric tonnes of grain in the 2023-2024 agricultural year. In the previous season, Russia shipped 66 million tonnes worth almost $16.5 billion. Besides that, Russia plans to earn estimated revenue amounting to $33 billion by exporting food to African countries. Military-Technical Cooperation Russia has an indivisible security relationship with many African countries. Notably, Russia's military influence has been increasing in Saharan-Sahel region, an elongated landlocked territory located between North Africa (Maghreb) and West Africa, and also stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. Quite recently, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have withdrawn from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and, more significantly have also created their own military bloc, the Alliance des États du Sahel (translates in English as the Alliance of Sahel States), citing reasons as fighting frequent militant attacks and against indiscriminate manipulation by foreign governments. For better or for worse, by creating their own Alliance of Sahel States (AES), it exposes ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) powerlessness, weaknesses and its long-term inability and incompetency to deal with regional problems, particularly rising insecurity in the region. Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned this security issues during his opening and closing speeches at St. Petersburg summit and even previously, indicating its importance on Russia's agenda with Africa. At the end, both Russian and African leaders reaffirmed their collective stance to deal with the persistent ethnic conflicts and militant threats among the magnitude of wide range of priorities. In fact, there were five key documents and one of them focuses on ‘Strengthening Cooperation to Combat Terrorism’ which neatly relates to this theme under discussion. Often said that Russia has rich experiences as in developing an effective set of measures to counter terrorism, curtail illegal activity, and provide dependable protection for citizens. Therefore, Russia's Ministry of Defense together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs express profound readiness to coordinate in sharing their experiences with African partners, particularly in the Saharan-Sahel. Revisiting the first summit declaration which says in part, 'firm intention to fully contribute to achieving peace and security' points to the principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity on these countries in the region. The first primary step is implementing joint programmes to build the necessary capacity of the requesting African States and train African peace-keeping personnel at specialized educational institutions of the Russian Federation and inside African States. It has to be noted clearly that Russia works for its revenue from increased exports. Therefore, several agreements signed would allow Russia a full access to exploring natural resources in exchange for its military assistance. Updatedly, Russia has signed bilateral military-technical cooperation agreements with more than 20 African countries. Notable Quotes – Federation Council Deputy Speaker Konstantin Kosachev told a roundtable on Russia's strategic interests in Africa at Valdai Discussion Club, that Russia's Western opponents are trying to prevent African states from taking part in Russia-Africa summits. In Senator Kosachev's opinion, several meetings, conferences and summits have been successful, 'but, in many respects, its results remained within the dimension of politics' and were not translated into additional projects in trade, economic, scientific or humanitarian cooperation. 'Trade turnover speaks for itself. Roughly, the European Union’s trade with Africa stands at around $300 billion, China's – at around $150 billion, and the United States – approximately $50-60 billion. Despite the tendency to grow, our current turnover is around $20 billion,' Senator Kosachev added, quoting trade figures to illustrate his argument. – Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Jacob Mudenda, during the conference on Russia-Africa, organized within the framework of International Development on Parliamentarism forum in March 2023 said: 'participation in the conference is another opportunity to discuss many issues, compare positions, develop solutions and give impetus to further cooperation, but it is important to turn words into concrete actions.' He further argued that it was distinctively evident from the large number of African delegations that had been invited, so far, to Moscow over the past few years, and that marked a new chapter to re-activate relations with Africa. But, Russia's influence might not take roots anytime soon if the conference declarations are not vigorously and promptly implemented. Russia-African Interactive Symbolism The history of Russia–Africa Summit is the highest-profile and largest-scale event in Russian–African relations, aimed at bringing about a fundamentally new level of mutually beneficial partnership to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The goal of the event is to promote efforts to strengthen comprehensive and equal cooperation between Russia and African nations across all areas of society including politics, security, economic relations, science and technology, and the cultural and humanitarian spheres. The first Russia–Africa Summit took place on 23–24 October 2019 in Sochi under the motto of ‘For Peace, Security and Development’. This was the first time such a large-scale event had been held in the history of modern Russia, and was unprecedented in Russian–African relations. The second Russia–Africa Summit was held in July 2023 in St. Petersburg under the the same motto of ‘For Peace, Security and Development’. This was the second time such a large-scale with participation of high-level government delegations from both sides, and was described as unprecedented in bilateral relations. At both Summits the participants identified priority areas of economic cooperation where concrete results could be achieved in subsequent years. At the closing in Sochi and St. Petersburg, declarations were adopted outlining the approval of goals and objectives for the future development of Russian–African cooperation across politics, security, economics, science and technology, culture and the humanitarian sphere. Logical and Final Words Much time has elapsed, but meetings, conferences and summits are consistenly organized to review the past and current stage of relations. Russia and Africa are the new centers of the emerging multipolar world. But more admittedly, Africa has become competitive but still continues attracting external players to significant sectors. In this context, Russia undoubtedly needs to adopt its approaches and mechanisms necessary for driving effective cooperation in order to take the relations to the next level in this new changing conditions of global politics and economics. Basic questions, often and simultaneously asked are: what steps are needed to give a new impetus to bilateral economic relations? What are the key initiatives and competencies that can create a deeper strategic partnership between Russia and Africa? Regardless of the fact that the continent has enormous reources both natural and human, Africa's development issues are still very lamentable, and leaders are excited at Africa being described as poorest in the world. In a nutshell, African leaders pay lip service in pursuit of working towards attaining their own economic sovereignty. In fact 80% of Africa's population still live in abject poverty. The Global Development Index shows that African governments continue to pursue trivial development questions, poor governance and deep-seated corruption. In practical terms, Africa has rather exposed the collective weaknesses, inability to sharpen development priorities, gross mismanagement and incompetencies of Africa leaders. It is shameful and incredible for characterizing being used as pawns in geopolitical reconfiguration, but instead African leaders essentially have to take cognizance of the key necessity and acknowledge the popular hyperbolic saying ‘African problems, African solutions’ and/or alternatively the ‘Africa We Want’ within the framework of the Agenda 2063 as widely propagated by the continental organization - the African Union.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeexzagsbNYtzK9wBhb35rc	2024-11-05T09:22:28-08:00	
One Person, One Vote, One Joke…On Democracy – OpEd	As Americans, we hold dear several core democratic values, none more basic than 'one person, one vote.' But our contemporary economic realities have essentially obliterated this core value’s essence. 'One person, one vote,' we’re relearning this year, simply cannot exist in an America where a single individual can hold 1.4 million times more wealth than the typical American household. That particular single individual, Elon Musk, currently holds a personal fortune worth over $260 billion. The net worth of America’s median family, according to the latest Federal Reserve data? Less than $200,000. How much of Musk’s fortune — and the fortunes of his fellow super rich — is going into the 2024 presidential and congressional elections? A just-released report from Americans for Tax Fairness has found that 150 of America’s wealthiest have already contributed $1.9 billion to the candidates they find most friendly to how our richest see the world. That $1.9-billion total, Americans for Tax Fairness points out, will most likely run well over $2 billion by the time this year’s election dust has settled. But that same $1.9 billion has already surpassed, by a stunningly wide margin, the $1.2 billion that over 600 billionaires spent on electing presidential and congressional candidates in 2020. Who’s benefiting from all this billionaire loot? Nearly three-quarters of this $1.9 billion — 72 percent — is going to support Republican candidates. The Democratic Party candidate share: 22 percent. And how much wealth will the 150 billionaires that Americans for Tax Fairness has been tracking have left in their personal fortunes after subtracting their hundreds of millions in 2024 political contributions? Plenty. The $1.9 billion these super rich have laid out so far amounts to a mere 0.07 percent of their collective $2.67 trillion in wealth. Musk himself had at last count poured at least $133 million into electing his favorite candidates, with Donald Trump by far and away the biggest beneficiary. That sum almost certainly understates what Musk is actually spending on campaign 2024. Billionaires like Musk, analysts at Open Secrets note, can also contribute anonymously to political campaigns through 'dark money' groups that need not reveal their donors. Let’s assume for a moment that Musk’s overall outlay for Trump’s election ends up in the vicinity of $200 million, less than 1 percent of his personal net worth. In backing Trump, he could hardly be making a more profitable investment. With Trump once again in the White House, Musk could look forward to lower tax bills, better access to lucrative federal contracts for his SpaceX, and fewer regulations on the rest of his sprawling business empire. He would be richer than ever. And so would the rest of his super-rich peers. Should we fear for our democracy at that prospect? We most certainly should, as the New Yorker’s Charles Duhigg makes frighteningly clear in his just-published analysis of Silicon Valley’s enormous new political power. Back in 1982, the year Forbes began annually publishing a list of America’s 400 richest, Big Oil dominated the upper ranks of America’s richest. Nine of our wealthiest 15 on that initial top 400 list owed their good fortune to the oil industry. High-tech now dominates the Forbes 400. On the 2024 Forbes 400, billionaires who owe their fortunes to high-tech occupy 10 of the top 15 slots. Like their Big Oil predecessors, today’s high-tech rich haven’t just accumulated great wealth. They have gained enough of a political punch to make elected leaders think twice before getting in the way of anything Big Tech wants to see happen. The most brazen of today’s Big Tech punchers now come from the highly speculative cryptocurrency sector. Silicon Valley venture capital firms have invested billions into crypto. These same investors have invested mega-millions in super PACs, with the prime goal, the New Yorker’s Duhigg details, 'of convincing politicians that the political consequences of being anti-crypto would be intensely painful.' The crypto crowd chose the California U.S. Senate primary this past March as a high-profile opportunity to get that message across. That primary drew a host of candidates, all seeking to become one of the top two finishers who would square off against each other in the November election. This broad field included Rep. Katie Porter, a nationally known consumer champion. Crypto’s movers and shakers decided to go all-out in the primary against her. Porter, for her part, had never devoted much attention to crypto. But that didn’t matter. For the crypto crowd, getting into the California Senate race against Porter, a popular member of Congress, would be an ideal opportunity to intimidate other politicians, 'to warn anyone running for office,' as an industry insider told the New Yorker, 'that, if you are anti-crypto, the industry will come after you.' Crypto’s top super PAC would go on to deluge California’s airwaves with ad spots that blasted Porter as a 'bully' and a 'liar,' never mentioning anything about crypto at all. Porter ended up finishing third with a mere 15 percent of the primary vote. Message delivered. 'Candidates in New York, Arizona, Maryland, and Michigan,' notes the New Yorker’s Duhigg, soon 'began releasing crypto-friendly public statements and voting for pro-crypto bills.' Crypto-related super PACs have so far spent over $100 million on 2024 political races. Donald Trump, predictably, has now emerged as an exuberant crypto champion, and crypto dollars have played key roles in the primary defeats of two high-profile congressional progressives, New York’s Jamaal Bowman and Missouri’s Cori Bush. The sort of billionaire muscle-flexing that Big Oil and now Big Tech have inflicted upon American politics, we need to keep in mind, has an impact that goes beyond the political fates of individual politicians. That muscle-flexing serves to keep off the table any serious discussion of America’s fiercely unequal distribution of income and wealth. Ever notice one of those pre-election polls that ask the American public to rate the importance they give to the 'issues' facing the nation. The Pew Research Center, for instance, this past spring did extensive polling on what the Center deemed 16 'top problems' facing the United States, everything from inflation and illegal immigration to domestic terrorism and the affordability of health care. Nothing on that Pew list directly highlighted any aspect of our deep-seated economic inequality. The Pew 'issues' list made no reference whatsoever to concerns ranging from billionaire political influence to the vast gap between CEO and worker pay. And that should not surprise us. Inequality-avoiding 'issue' lists reflect the logical consequence of what happens in modern societies where wealth sits explosively concentrated. That wealth funds the think tank reports that shape the nation’s ongoing dialogue over what issues matter. That same wealth owns our nation’s most influential mass media and can strike fear, as the crypto political saga demonstrates, in lawmakers who don’t toe the plutocratic line. In the 2024 election cycle, that concentrated wealth has, by and large, gone unchallenged. We can’t afford to let that happen again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeexzagsbNYt9YhHtUTRrHG	2024-11-05T09:20:06-08:00	
The Jerusalem Temple And Its Older Brother: The Ka’ba – OpEd	Narrated Abu Dhar: I said, 'O Allah's Messenger, which mosque was first built on the surface of the earth?' He said, 'Al- Masjid-ul-,Haram (in Mecca).' I said, 'Which was built next?' He replied 'The mosque of Al-Aqsa ( in Jerusalem) .' I said, 'What was the period of construction between the two?' He said, 'Forty years.' (Sahih al-Bukhari 3366 In-book reference : Book 60, Hadith 45 USC-MSA web (English) reference : Vol. 4, Book 55, Hadith 585) The Jerusalem Temple (Beit HaMikdosh) and the Ka'ba, the House of God (Baitullah) in Mecca are the two most well-known sites for monotheistic pilgrimage in the world. The Islamic Hajj to the Ka'ba in Makkah, and the Jewish Hajj to the Temple in Jerusalem, have been alternate swings of a single sacred pendulum connecting earthly humans to one monotheistic Divine source in the heavens. The Ka'ba was the original site of the Islamic Hajj. Destroyed in the days of Noah, it was later rebuilt by Abraham and his son Ishmael. After several centuries it was desecrated by later generations of idol worshipers. During the centuries while the Ka'ba was desecrated, Prophet Solomon built a Temple in Jerusalem for Jewish Haj on the site where Abraham bound his son Isaac as an offering to God. Four centuries later the Temple of Solomon was destroyed in 587 BCE by the Babylonians. Then the Temple was rebuilt with the support of Cyrus the Great, King of Persia, and lasted for almost six centuries. As Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE) states; Jewish pilgrims came to Jerusalem from the ends of the earth, and from all the compass points. But with the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 CE, the pilgrimage Hajj aspect of the week-long harvest festival of Hag Sukkot, began a gradual decline in the spiritual consciousness of the Jewish People. The first time Hag/Hajj is mentioned in the Torah is in that famous scene when Prophets: 'Moses and Aaron told Pharaoh; 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go into the wilderness, that they may hold a feast (Hag) for me.'' [Exodus 5:1]or better: 'And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh; 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a Hajj/pilgrimage feast for me in the wilderness.'' But that one-time Hajj never occurred because Pharaoh refused to free the Jewish People thus incurring Divine wrath. The normative annual two Jewish Hajj week-long pilgrimages was the liberation celebration of Haj Passover; and especially the gratitude celebration of the harvest festival of Haj Sukkot. The Torah declares: 'Celebrate Hajj Sukkot for seven days after you have harvested the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress. Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns...Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at the place He will choose: at the Hajj of Matzah (Passover), the Hajj of Weeks, and the Hajj of Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 16:13-16) Hajj Sukkot was so important during the centuries when Solomon's Temple stood that the holy week of Sukkot was often called simply 'the Hajj' because of the very large numbers of Jews who came up to the Temple in Jerusalem. Hajj Passover is also celebrated as a weeklong pilgrimage. The third Hajj of Weeks is similar to Islamic Umrah, the non-mandatory lesser pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca, which may be performed at any time of the year. Although they share common rites, Umrah can be performed in less than a few hours; while Hajj is more time-consuming and involves many more rituals. The third Jewish Hajj of Weeks, like Umrah, is much simpler than Hajj Passover and can be performed in less than a few hours; on any one day during the seven weeks following Hajj Passover. The Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) is the largest mosque in the world and it surrounds one of Islam's holiest places, the Ka-ba. Unlike other mosques which are gender segregated, men and women can worship at the Al-Masjid Al-Haram together. The Holy Temple (Beit ha-Mikdash) of Jerusalem had two successive Temples on the Temple Mount where there now stands the Dome of the Rock. The Jerusalem Temple complex was separated into different areas where male priests, men, women and non-Jews could all come to worship the one God. Why is the Ka'ba the older brother of the Jerusalem Temple? Prophet Abraham is connected to both sacred sites. Prophets Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the destroyed Ka'ba; and 40 years later, Prophets Abraham and Isaac were tested on the hill where the Jerusalem Temple would someday be built by Prophet Solomon. Since Islam is the last of the Abrahamic religions it is the most universal of them. Since Judaism is the first, and for over twelve centuries the only ongoing monotheistic religion, it is the least universal and the most pluralistic and tribal of the three Abrahamic religions. For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent thousands of prophets to thousands of tribes and nations on the earth, and not one of them were able to establish an ongoing imageless monotheistic community. So Allah decided to do things in a different way. Allah decided to make a covenant with a small tribe, and send six hundred of his prophets to this small tribe, and worked continually for more than a dozen centuries with the people of this tribe until they were able to establish an ongoing community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal believers. Prophet Abraham, the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) was the first, and only prophet, to successfully establish, through the descendants of his own two sons, three ongoing monotheistic religions, that have lasted into the 21st century: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; that now make up about half of the world's population. Judaism discourages people who are interested in converting to Judaism because Judaism is the only true religion. Indeed, most non-Jews who become Jewish do it to unify a marriage or because they have a Jewish ancestor even if they do not yet know it. Judaism is not a missionary faith and so doesn't actively try to convert non-Jewish people (in many countries anti-Jewish laws prohibited converting to Judaism for centuries). However, the modern Jewish community increasingly welcomes would-be converts. A person who converts to Judaism becomes a Jew and is just as Jewish as someone born into Judaism. As Prophet Micah (4:5) states: 'For all the (other) peoples walk each in the name of its god; and we (Jews) will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.' Five hundred years before the birth of Prophet Muhammad Rabbi Yishmael, one of Judaism's most important rabbis was recorded as saying: 'In the future, the sons of Ishmael (the Arabs) will do fifteen things in the Land of Israel ... They will fence in the breaches of the walls of the Temple, and construct a building (the Dome of the Rock) on the site of the (ruined by the Romans) sanctuary'. Prophet Zechariah even includes those who were previously Israel's enemies: 'Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem, will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate Hajj Sukkot.' (Zechariah 14:16) There is vacant land on the Temple Mount, and a three dimensional virtual reality broadcast station could be erected adjacent to the Dome of the Rock fulfilling the vision of Prophet Micah (4:1-3) 'In the end of days the mountain of the Lord's Temple will be established as the highest mountain; it will be exalted above the hills, and (monotheistic) peoples will stream to it. Many (not all) nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. who will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. Torah will be broadcast out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.' provided that Muslim leaders would cooperate. Just as the Ka'ba has always welcomed all Muslims who answer the call: 'Call upon the people for Hajj. They will come to you on their bare feet, or riding any weak camel, and they come to you from every far desert. (Qur'an 22:27). When all those, both near and far, who revere this place as a standard, share it in love with everyone else who reveres it, then I will do as Prophet Abraham requested, and 'Make this a land of Peace, and provide its people with the produce of the land'. (Qur'an 2:126). Then will all the children of Prophet Abraham live in Holiness, Peace and Prosperity. The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation-community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 'On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBpWgqOMKUrZz	2024-11-05T09:18:38-08:00	
The Rise Of Political Extremism In Pakistan: A Test For Democrati...	As Christophe Jaffrelot observed, 'Pakistan has been branded by scholars as, among other things, an ideological state (like Israel) because of the political interpretation of Islam by its founding father.' Quaid-e-Azam promoted Islamic ideology not to stir up extremism, but to bring about unity and progress. However, the scenario at that time turned out to be quite different. He was firm in his beliefs until his death in 1948. His ideology never gave way to extremism. Today, the legacy of religious symbolism has shifted, often taken advantage of for political gains, and is now chipping away at the democratic foundations of Pakistan. The Political Utility of Religion Successive Pakistani leaders have learned to wield religious sentiment for political advantages. For example, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (1971-77) jumped on the bandwagon of Islamic socialism. General Zia-ul-Haq (1977-88) laid down strict Sharia law. Benazir Bhutto (1988-1990, 1993-1996) was not as overt as Zia, but she played the religious card to curry favor with conservatives. The Sharif family (1990-1993, 1997-1999, 2013-2017, 2024-present) kept up the tradition of using the religious card to win over public support. Imran Khan, the so-called Oxford graduate, went even further to win hearts and minds locally. In this regard, the U.S. president Ronal Reagan once said, 'If we ever forget that we are One Nation under God, then we will be a nation gone under.' He stressed the connotation of recognizing the role of a higher power in guiding and unifying a nation. His objectives were to bring together the nation. However, the religious misinterpretation has widened the gap among Pakistanis. Addressing these issues requires us to look into the roots of the problem, stand up to extremist ideologies, reach out to different communities, break down barriers, and set aside differences to build a more inclusive society. Extremism’s Challenges to Democracy Religious radicalism has taken a firm hold in Pakistan's political mainstream. Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which entered the political mainstream in 2015, has garnered massive public support. They have staged massive sit-ins in Punjab until their demands were met. They wield strong public support and can bring the whole of Punjab to a standstill. If this issue is not nipped in the bud, it could spiral out of control. The empowerment of religious extremism tarnishes Pakistan's international standing. Evidence of this is Pakistan's placement on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list due to terror financing concerns. Economic Hardship as Fertile Ground for Extremism On the economic front, Pakistan is weathering the storm of the toughest period in its history. The lack of employment is adding fuel to the fire of misery. With a population of 220 million, more than 40 percent live below the poverty line. Inflation is on the rise with each passing day. In early 2023, inflation skyrocketed to nearly 38%, placing immense strain on lower- and middle-class households. As Aristotle said in this regard, 'Poverty Is the Parent of Revolution and Crime.' Poverty is the mother of crimes. Indeed, it can even lure in the educated class, who are like navigating a storm without hope of return. The lack of economic opportunities and high unemployment rates open the door for the youth to fall under the spell of extremist leaders, who are wandering like lost falcons. This creates fertile ground for the young population to soak up extremist ideas because they have too much time on their hands. It's essential for the government to step up and address these issues to turn the tide and curb the spread of extremism. The Role of Political Polarization The democratic history of Pakistan is rife with ups and downs. Political instability has become the norm. Leaders put their vested interests first, leaving the common people to bear the brunt of the consequences. Recently, the political rivalry between Imran Khan and the Democratic alliances has reached a boiling point, where it does not seem likely to return to normal. This widening gap further erodes the common will and their belief in democracy. Regional Security Implications The rise of extremism threatens the very fabric of South Asia's socio-economic stability. The resurgence of the Afghan Taliban in 2021, can embolden extremist organizations. The long, porous border cannot be properly monitored and sealed as it requires extensive resources, time, and effort. The government should keep a close watch on extremist ideology before it creates fertile ground for terrorism, like the TTP, to sink deeper roots in Pakistan. If this issue is not addressed promptly, it could snowball into an unmanageable crisis. In this scenario, the Kashmir issue paints a unique picture. For decades, Pakistan has been playing the religious card to rally massive support for the cause of Kashmir. Tension over the Kashmir issue creates a space for ultra-religious groups to push their narrative and gain traction. Pakistan leverages extremist ideology to drum up support and generate freedom fighters against India. In this regard, when the state nurtures extremism, there should be a proper cost-benefit analysis. Does this extremism provide short-term gains, or does it pose more challenges to the democracy upon which Pakistan was founded? Policymakers should tread carefully to ensure this does not pose a threat to the democratic values that are the bedrock of Pakistan's foundation. Strengthening Democratic Institutions as a Path Forward Countering extremism requires a multi-pronged approach, putting political differences aside and recognizing the urgency of the moment. Before the nation faces another wave of terrorism, it’s crucial to take action. Extremism plants the seeds of ideologies, which later morph into terrorism. First and foremost, economic reforms are the need of the hour. Poverty initiative programs like the Ehsaas program need to be ramped up and get to the bottom of the real causes of poverty. With a population of 220 million, more than 40 percent live below the poverty line. This sows the seeds of threats to democratic norms and values. When democratic societies are built on extractive politics, it shakes the very foundations of peace at the grassroots level. Unfortunately, Pakistan's education expenditure is in a miserable state. The outdated curriculum churns out degrees instead of skills. According to the World Bank report in 2022, Pakistan spends only 1.97 per cent of its GDP on education, whereas the tiny island of Maldives forks out4.58 per cent, Bhutan pumps in 4.7 per cent, and Nepal allocates 3.2 percent of their GDP. The meager investment in education means more illiterates will come out of a population of over 220 million. The more illiterate people there are, the more prone to extremism the nation becomes. Education can lay the groundwork for tolerance. Conclusion Political extremism is one of the biggest threats Pakistan is grappling with today. If it remains unchecked, it will not only threaten peace and stability at the domestic level, but also tarnish the nation's reputation on the international stage. It is high time for leaders to get to the root of the issue before the curse of extremism takes deeper root. Leaders should ramp up investment in education and bolster democratic institutions. By eradicating the curse of high illiteracy rates and tackling the root causes of extremism, the nation can secure its democratic future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBiCPTXDW2KOw	2024-11-05T09:16:48-08:00	
The ICC Case Against Hasina Wajid – OpEd	The recent downfall of Sheikh Hasina's regime in Bangladesh has opened a Pandora's Box of allegations against her government. As the dust settles, international attention has turned to the darker side of her 15-year rule, marked by widespread human rights abuses, political oppression, and a systematic dismantling of democratic norms. A plea filed at the International Criminal Court (ICC) accuses Hasina Wajid of crimes against humanity, reigniting a debate on her government's brutal tactics to suppress dissent and consolidate power. The ICC plea against Hasina Wajid revives longstanding grievances about her alleged involvement in suppressing dissent, which her opponents claim echoes her father’s controversial legacy. Sheikh Hasina, during her back-to-back 15-year rule, had decimated the opposition and shut all safety valves, resulting in a volcanic eruption of public anger. Her opponents claimed her government had indulged in corruption, extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. In addition, the administration, along with supporters of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League, had fought pitched battles with demonstrators. At least 300 people were reportedly killed. This was the build-up to her eventual departure, which was followed by the Bangladesh army chief announcing an interim set-up. The unceremonious departure of the 'Iron Lady' marked the end of a governing paradigm that is best characterised as a competitive authoritarian regime, which, without the protests, may have transitioned into a one-party autocracy. While the immediate cause of her toppling stems from protests against the quota system, Hasina’s authoritarian tendencies and sense of invincibility had been creating structural conditions for eventual reckoning. Bangladeshi voices have consistently accused Hasina of targeting Islamic scholars and opposition figures, highlighting a deep-rooted concern over freedom and democracy under her rule. The recent deaths of students during protest intensify fears about human rights violations, fueling speculation that this violence stems from political motives backed by influential foreign allies. Since 2009, Hasina had ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist. Systematically, she clamped down all political opponents. Her main political rival, Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who served twice as prime minister, was caught in a web of legal cases and sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2018. The leaders of the Jamaat-i-Islami also faced brutal persecution; many of them were convicted and executed by a so-called international crimes tribunal. In the final days before her unceremonious end, Hasina had exhorted Awami League supporters to fight the demonstrators, which brought the country to the brink of a civil war. Indian intelligence agency RAW’s support of Hasina raises concerns among Bangladeshis who fear that foreign interference is destabilizing their nation’s sovereignty. Allegations of Hasina’s involvement in the genocide of Bengali Muslims in prior decades have resurfaced, with many citing these claims as part of a larger pattern of state-led repression. The global community has turned a blind eye to Hasina’s government actions, calling for international accountability to prevent further bloodshed. The current charges bring an unprecedented spotlight on Bangladesh’s history of authoritarianism, raising questions about democratic erosion in South Asia. Hasina’s crackdowns on Islamic scholars were attempts to consolidate power by marginalizing voices she perceives as threats to her political ideology. The ICC plea serves as a critical test for Bangladesh’s judicial independence, as many question whether local courts would have pursued these charges under political pressure. Calls for justice are echoing beyond Bangladesh, with rights organizations urging the ICC to address these alleged crimes and set a precedent for protecting human rights in the region. India provided covert support to Hasina, enabling her to create a parallel military force within Bangladesh, which some claim has roots in the Mukti Bahini—an alliance viewed as an extension of India’s influence within the country. Hasina’s close ties with India have enabled her to control Bangladesh’s security forces, allegedly using a network reminiscent of the Mukti Bahini to silence dissent and enforce pro-India policies under the guise of national security. India’s backing allowed Hasina to cultivate a 'shadow army' that operates with little accountability, reviving fears of a Mukti Bahini-like entity acting as a tool of intimidation against political opponents and Islamic groups. As South Asia’s longest-ruling authoritarian leader, Hasina spent her entire politics controlling all the unknowns through authoritarian approaches. Ironically, it was these very approaches that ultimately cemented her downfall. Only time will tell if justice will prevail in Bangladesh. The ICC case against Hasina Wajid marks a pivotal moment in the nation's history, raising hopes for accountability and a brighter future. As the world watches, the outcome of this legal battle could have far-reaching implications for the region and beyond.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBmLfZrvquG-s	2024-11-05T09:15:17-08:00	
Kamala Would Be A Great President, One Of the Best, And Trump Doe...	The name of the president of the most powerful countries in the world will soon be known. I hope that Kamala will be named president of the US, a country that, contrary to what is not recognized by ungenerous critics, has led a unique cultural leadership in the history of the planet. And this is the fact to be celebrated while waiting for the appointment of the next president. And this is one of the greatest contributions that we could expect from a Kamala victory. Knowledge is democracy. Knowledge is the highroad to the end of discrimination, the real virus of life’s desease. Respect of law is democracy. We should remember that in the contest between Kamala and Donald. With America we have entered the democracy of knowledge era, departing from a time of unlimited masses of individuals historically ignored by the development of knowledge and kept at levels of total and perennial inferiority. Never in the cultural history of humanity has there been anything comparable to the democracy of knowledge in terms of numbers, produced by the Internet and now by AI. Thank you America! We owe you gratitude for this unparalled democratic achievement in all parts of the world. Again, knowledge is democracy. The passage of writing from symbols and ideograms to letters made it possible to transcribe possible knowledge. This was a great step in democracy. The introduction of movable type made knowledge available to all who could read. An even higher step in the democracy process. Certainly the institution of the Justinian code was a incredible cultural revolution because for the first time the public power was considered as a citizen and obliged to respect the laws, and this was made available in writing to the courts. Again a giant step forward for democracy. The persistence of common law instead of codified law is a cultural legal delay that opens the way to discrimination and arbitrariness. In substance, all great cultural achievements made with regard to democracy were linked to knowledge. That is why the Internet and AI revolutions are one of the largest planetary democratic revolutions for the masses to have ever occurred. America has made it possible. Today all of us, in the Western and Eastern worlds, North and South, are indebted to the USA for this spectacular democratic revolution of knowledge, a revolution that is improving production, the quality of health and above all favors access to knowledge without national or caste limits to billions of individuals of any nation, ethnicity: this is the most phenomenal gift of the democracy of knowledge produced by America. Let’s not forget this, and it should be remembered for whatever one might say about say about politicians, including Trump, that this gigantic step forward for democracy is the result of private initiative, of the market, of business, not of the government. The merit of the American government is that it has not conditioned private initiative, but even promoted it for security reasons, That is a matter of fact. Of course, there are downsides to American politics that should not be ignored in terms of democracy in foreign states. Often it protects leaders who aren't democratic, say for instance in South America, but as the old American saying goes, 'there is no such thing as a free lunch.' But what does this introduction on knowledge and democracy have to do with the electoral outcome that is expected? It has everthing to do with it because the United States is, and remains, the driving force of modern progress in the entire world -- and those who benefit from this in the rest of the world must recognize this beyond the differences between the two candidates. For me, Kamala is a fantastic candidate who would bring back the role of law to American society. She would do it, because she is an intelligent woman in her own right, she is not the result of media manipulations. She would certainly make possible a phenomenal cultural leap in gender equality that Obama was unable to produce due to racaial discrimination. We would have expected Obama to take a historic step in this fight against discrimination - an area in which instead he failed. Obama as the first black president should have eradicated racism from America, betraying just expectations. Just as we would expect from a Jewish American president a definitive eradication of religious reasons from political discrimination, as did Kennedy as a Catholic president. Today, or rather yesterday in 2020, no one cared that Biden was Catholic, just as nobody should care if XY president were jewish. There are cultural political expectations that non-Americans expect from America. Those same reasons that lead us to condemn in no uncertain terms the racist and disriminatory policy of Benjamin Netanyahu who is succeeding in the epic enterprise of alienating Israel from the favor of those who consider the Holocaust a heinous tragedy to be remembered continuously. Kamala is a special person. If she wins the election, I believe she will be an exceptionally good president. However, Kamala has also failed to understand that there are two elements in the Trump campaign of enormous significance for the United States and for the world. That is in the area domestic politics and the other in international politics. With respect to domestic politics, we must condemn the tax exemption of the super-rich that Trump will promote, whether they are individuals or companies. But we must not forget that they constitute the most powerful engine of American development and that as such must be protected and safeguarded. The American dynamo is one of innovation and entrepreneurial culture, small and large. Trump defends this, but he is does so in the wrong way. On the international level, the fact that the Ukraine war was heavily funded against Russia with NATO aggression through the increasingly stringent encirclement of that country is a resounding diplomatic error. There is a historian of economics of great value who teaches at my alma mater, Columbia University, Jeffrey Sachs who makes this magnificently clear. Ukraine is a sharp thorn in Russia's side that NATO, ignoring Secretary of State Baker's commitments to Gorbachev, and violates a total absence of historical sense and diplomatic vision. The Ukrainian war, certainly fostered even if not justified, by efforts to bring NATO a stone's throw from Moscow, has caused a strengthening of Russia and China relations, which a diplomat like Zbigniew Brzezinski would have judged to be one of the greatest possible diplomatic mistakes in American history. Trump says he will correct this situation and that is a very good thing. As I said above, I believe Kamala will be a phenomenal president if she is elected. But if the next president is Trump, with all his blatant flaws, he has good points in the vast area of things we don’t like. Let's expect from him two great policies worthy of the best cause that must be respected in the best interest of Europe itself. Pushing for entrepreneurship in America is good, very good, and solving peacefully Ukraine’s war is even better. Both goals are worth pursuing not only in the interest of America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcSvPrLvGVtBpkqqfhnNjbd	2024-11-05T09:12:34-08:00	
Beyond The Revolution: Building A New Bangladesh – Analysis	By Rimon Tanvir Hossain (FPRI) -- Once touted as the 'Iron Lady' of Asia, Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was both the longest-serving Bangladeshi head of state and the world’s longest-serving female. However, on August 5, 2024, her reign came to an unceremonious end as a student-led revolution, which started after the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh reinstated a quota system for government jobs on June 5, 2024, forced her to flee to India and resign from office. Today, 'July 36' refers to the date of Hasina’s resignation and subsequent collapse of her Awami League government, which has also been heralded in pop culture as Bangladesh’s 'Second Independence.' According to a report by the Human Rights Support Society, more than 30,000 people were injured and more than 875 were killed in the collective unrest, 77 percent of whom died from gunshot wounds. While Nobel laureate and social entrepreneur, Dr. Muhammad Yunus’s appointment to lead the fifty-three-year-old nation—born after a revolution celebrated and strongly supported by Western capitals to provide Bangladesh a fresh start—was positively received at home and abroad, his task of assuring that the country’s institutions regain public trust, once captured by Hasina’s fifteen-year electoral autocracy, is daunting. The growing challenges ranging from Islamist parties, communal tensions, surging inflation, and inability to hold perpetrators of the revolution’s victims accountable seem distant from reaching the solutions the Yunus-led interim government promised: establishing reforms in the election commission, civil administration, and implementing judiciary and security forces in time for the upcoming elections. The Roots of Unrest: The Quota Reform Movement The student-led protests, initially known as the Quota Reform Movement, sought to change the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) quota which was done away with in 2018 but brought back with the June 5, 2024, High Court decision. The BCS Quotas have a deeper connection to the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, due to the fact that 30 percent of the 56 percent of reserved civil service positions were reserved for descendants of Bangladeshi Freedom Fighters ('Muktijuddhos'). The Muktijuddhos fought against the Pakistan Army and helped win independence in the nine-month war with Indian and Soviet support. Over the years, the fact that the biggest quota—relative to the 10 percent of positions reserved for women, 10 percent reserved for people from underdeveloped districts, 5 percent for indigenous people, and 1 percent for people with disabilities—went to families strongly associated with the Awami League for their role in winning the 1970 Pakistan General Elections (which led to full-scale war) became increasingly perceived as a base forconsolidating the Awami League through entrenchment in the state bureaucracy. The BCS positions offered stable, lifelong employment with government-provided cars, housing, and other benefits, which the students leading the protests argued was designed to favor Awami League supporters. Rising youth unemployment, which has gone from 8 percent when Hasina came to power in 2008 to 16 percent, coupled with bias in the state bureaucracy to provide loans and other benefits to private-sector leaders associated with the Awami League, further added to the intensity of this Quota Reform Movement. Behind the quota was the even larger electoral autocracy operated by Hasina and her Awami League party, who after winning her electoral mandate in 2008, continually crushed the opposition and repeated this every five years through ballot stuffing, strong-arming the media, and voter intimidation. The US State Department issued stern warnings ahead of both the 2018 election and prior to the most recent January 2024 election. Deputy Assistant Secretary of South and Central Asian Affairs Afreen Akhter offered Hasina an ultimatum to allow for a caretaker-run election in October 2023, which the Awami League abolished in 2011. In the lead-up to the most recent January 2024 election, the Awami League also faced US and E.U. scrutiny and even sanctions with regard to their domestic security forces—namely, their elite paramilitary force, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). On December 10, 2021, the US Treasury Department placed sanctions on RAB as well as its former and current leaders for human rights abuses. Sweden-based investigative and public interest journalism platform founded in 2019 by exiled Bangladeshi journalist Tasneem Khalil, Netra News, also reported how RAB ran a secret prison for dissidents and other opponents to the Hasina regime called 'Aynaghor' (House of Mirrors). This was followed by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s May 24, 2023, announcement of visa restrictions on former and current pro-Awami League and opposition officials for undermining democracy ahead of the January 2024 elections. A statement issued by the US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller mentioned 'these individuals include members of law enforcement, the ruling party, and the political opposition' and that 'their immediate family may be found ineligible for entry into the United States.' Ultimately, Hasina evaded all these carrots and sticks to allow a free and fair election on January 2024, while the main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), boycotted the election. This timeline of sanctions and other disciplinary measures made by the United States was put into perspective within the Biden administration’s wider democracy promotion campaign, of which Bangladesh was a clear target for its strong people-to-people ties, business and trade interests, and diaspora-lobbying with respect to human rights. The Quota Reform Movement in the perspective of this wider US democracy promotion agenda proves that the Hasina regime was unwise not to heed warnings and shot itself in the foot by relentlessly capturing institutions and leveraging their resources to crush any sign of opposition. A Slow Start to a Quick Fix: Yunus’s Interim Government Yunus received much fanfare after being sworn in as Chief Advisor to the Bangladesh interim government on August 8, 2024, only three days after Hasina’s resignation and flight for refuge in India. The eighty-four-year-old Nobel Laureate was invited to lead the new transitional government after the student advisory board picked him as their leader, but received the more requisite support of Bangladesh’s only surviving institution—the Bangladesh Army. Immediately upon Yunus’s swearing-in, lawlessness, communal tensions, difficulty for the country’s rapidly growing economy, and accountability for revolution victims were all on the agenda. Hasina and the Awami League were notorious for summoning all arms of the state’s security apparatus on protestors and civilians alike. These forces included not only the RAB but also the Bangladesh Border Guard forces as well as the student wing of the Awami League, the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL). The Chhatra League in particular has earned much notoriety, as their coordination with government security forces since their 2019 murder of Abrar Fahad—a dissenter whose Facebook post expressing concern over a water deal with India led to him being killed in a Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET) dorm—was on full display during the Quota Reform Movement. While the country underwent internet shutdowns during the Quota Reform Movement and protestors were subject to 'shoot-on-sight' orders by Hasina, the Chhatra League was provided arms, ammunition, and access to the internet to better coordinate their efforts in stopping the protests. Following Hasina’s ousting, the estimated 100,000 members of the Chhatra League have been abandoned as targets for retribution after the Yunus-led interim government declared BCL a 'terrorist organization' under the 2009 Anti-Terrorism Act and banned it on Wednesday, October 23, 2024, for their serious misconduct during the July unrest. Even though the Yunus-led interim government has overseen Dhaka University banning the activities of political party student wings on September 19, 2024, which also includes the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami student branches, Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chhatra Dol and Bangladeshi Chhatra Shibir, clashes between these groups continue. Additionally, Washington has expressed much concern over the need to contain the Islamist elements operating within Bangladesh, which Hasina’s Awami League and successive Indian governments were keen on clamping down on. On August 28, 2024, still within the month of Hasina’s ousting, the Jamaat-e-Islami party, the country’s main Islamist party which has never earned more than eighteen out of the Bangladeshi Parliament’s three hundred seats, had their 2008-imposed ban lifted on them. Additionally, the day before on August 27, 2024, the leader of the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) leader, Jashimuddin Rahmaani, was freed by the Yunus-led interim government. Rahmaani was originally jailed on August 2, 2013, for his role in murdering an atheist blogger and since his release has requested Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of the neighboring West Bengal state of India, to 'declare independence from India,' further suggesting to hoist 'Islamist flags in their capital of Kolkata.' These recent developments have led to a perception in New Delhi and Western capitals that Yunus is allowing free reign to the most dangerous elements of Bangladesh’s Islamist cadres, who are actively preparing for the upcoming elections which have yet to be given a date. Of immense concern to both India and its transnational diaspora has been the extent of communal violencethat has rocked Bangladesh after Hasina’s ousting. According to the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist ChristianUnity Council, there have been over 2,010 attacks on Hindus or their properties in fifty-two districts out of the country’s sixty-four districts, and five Hindus have been killed in these attacks, two of which were confirmed as Awami League members. Due to the Awami League’s close ties to India, performative commitment to secularism, and an iron-fist policy towards Islamists, the Hindu minority in Bangladesh votes in majority for the Awami League and is also perceived by Islamists as a key constituency that lobbies for pro-India policies. Many Bangladeshi, Indian, and Western analysts, journalists, and commentators alike have argued that the Yunus government has done a generally decent job in addressing the communal tensions, with visits to temples and urging students and the common citizen to protect minorities themselves. On August 6, 2024, Congressmen Raja Krishnamoorthi and Shri Thanedar wrote separate letters to Blinken, advocating on behalf of the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh. On the same day, the Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, US Senator Ben Cardin, released a statement urging Bangladesh to form a responsible caretaker government 'that will promptly organize inclusive democratic elections. The people of Bangladesh deserve a government that honors their voices, respects their will, and upholds the dignity of their nation.' On September 20, 2024, US Senators Cardin, Murphy, Van Hollen, and Merkley issued a letter to Yunus directly, urging reforms and accountability in Bangladesh. The letter stated: 'While many celebrate this new chapter in Bangladesh, a concerning volume of those celebrations have turned violent, with documented reports of reprisals targeting police as well as minority Hindu communities and those perceived to be supporters of Hasina’s government. As a result, the country has witnessed gaps in law enforcement and a lack of protections for those facing violent attacks, including members of the Hindu community and Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazaar.' Four days later, Yunus met with US President Joe Biden at the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), where Biden congratulated Yunus and affirmed a close partnership between the United States and Bangladesh rooted in democratic values and strong people-to-people ties. Yunus gifted Blinken, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Italian Prime Minister GiorgiaMeloni with a book of paintings known as the 'Art of Triumph,' capturing scenes from the July 36 student-led revolution. The gesture of gifting these Western heads of state photo books was in line with trade and education diplomacy interests as roughly 10,000 Bangladeshi students study in Canadian universities, making Canada a 'study destination of choice' among Bangladeshi students, and the European Union’s role as Bangladesh’s largest trading partner, accounting for 20.7% of Bangladesh’s trade. At the General Assembly, Yunus also met with Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif on the sidelines, where they reaffirmed their commitment to expanding the two countries’ bilateral cooperation. The long-held demand by the Awami League government for the Pakistani government to apologize for its genocideduring the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War and Pakistan’s unwillingness to do so has held back bilateral ties according to Foreign Policy columnist and South Asia Brief writer Michael Kugelman. However, while steps were made in regard to this longstanding issue in 2021 with an exchange of letters between former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Hasina, Yunus’s willingness to engage Pakistan without mention of the 1971 chapter suggests this grievance in bilateral relations may not be as much of a constraint in Bangladesh-Pakistan relations post-Hasina. While some of the Awami League ministers were detained—some on their way out of the country—many fled during the month of the student-led revolution. Bangladeshi news sources like the Daily Star and Prothom Alo have documented how a total of thirty current and former Awami League ministers weredetained and are currently being subject to proceedings. Meanwhile, Hasina’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, who served as an advisor on Information and Communications Technology affairs to Hasina, has hired a former Trump lobbyist and actively operates as the de facto leaderof the Awami League in an attempt to make a comeback for the upcoming election. On the day of Diwali, Thursday, October 31, 2024, US presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted that he 'strongly condemned the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh,' further stating that it would have 'never happened on my watch,' before tying these developments to Ukraine and the Southern border. In the same tweet, he promised to 'also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left' and 'also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Narendra Modi.' This timely statement by Donald Trump signals both a nod to the Indian American vote as well as Hindu Nationalist and Awami League lobbies, attempting to undercut Kamala Harris’s appeal to Indian Americans by explicitly claiming that she 'ignored Hindus,' while also signaling a preference for the Awami League. Viewed within the backdrop of US electoral politics, Bangladesh is a partisan issue, and given Yunus’s former criticism of Trump back in 2016, the interim government can expect a less supportive White House if Trump returns to the White House after the 2024 US general elections. In Between Rising Powers: Bangladesh in the Eyes of New Delhi and Beijing The collapse of Hasina’s regime was a strategic failure for the Awami League’s long-time and premier supporter—India. Since the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, where India played a leading role through covert support to the guerilla war, India has sustained a favorable trade imbalance, security cooperation, political alignment, and common cause over the containment of Islamist elements within Bangladesh. However, recent developments and the trajectory set for the next Bangladeshi election seem to swayagainst New Delhi’s favor, as anti-Indian sentiments have reached all-time highs and the Awami League has very little legroom to launch a comeback, given their reputation from their bloody crackdown on the Quota Reform Movement. Another key supporter of Hasina’s regime was the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Bangladesh is the second-biggest destination of Chinese military imports according to the Stockholm Peace International Research Institute (SIPRI). Between 2016 and 2020, Bangladesh bought 17 percent of all Chinese military exports and two-thirds of the Bangladesh Air Force weapon arsenal is currently made up of Chinese weapons. In line with the 2002 Defense Cooperation Agreement signed between China and Bangladesh, making China the only country with a broad defense agreement with Bangladesh, Dhaka has also inaugurated a Chinese-built naval base for the Bangladesh Navy at Pekua in Cox’s Bazar in 2023, BNS Sheikh Hasina, where two Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) officers were in attendance. According to a CSIS report entitled 'Submarine Diplomacy,' published in November 2023, commercial satellite imagery revealed significant progress on this naval base, which both signaled Beijing deepening its influence in the Bay of Bengal while also attempting to strengthen ties between Bangladesh and Myanmar, aimed at undercutting New Delhi’s influence in its neighborhood. Since 2010, half of Myanmar’s and two-thirds of Bangladesh’s arms imports have come from China. However, Bangladesh’s military still conducts annual bilateral exercises with the Indian military, most recently in October 2023, showing how Dhaka balances India and China even as it actively courts Beijing. Over a fourth of world trade passes through the Bay of Bengal each year, with ports located in the bay that handle 33 percent of global trade and half of the world’s container traffic. Additionally, the Bay of Bengal is located at a strategic chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, connecting the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea. This chokepoint is vital because it controls maritime access to the Far East and is used by a large amount of international shipping. Upon Hasina’s ousting, in one of her first statements from her refuge in a military base in India, she stated that she could have remained in power had she acquiesced to a US demand for a military base in Bangladeshi territory — St. Martin’s Island. The Padma Bridge, inaugurated in February 2022, is Bangladesh’s largest bridge, standing at 3.88 miles in length and 60 feet wide, able to carry 10,000 tons, and projected to boost the country’s GDP by 1.2 percent. Proposed in 1998, the bridge had many setbacks in construction due to the withdrawal of support by the World Bank in 2015 after allegations of corruption. A Chinese engineering firm, China Major Bridge Co., hadtaken over construction of the bridge following the World Bank exit. The Padma Bridge is the largest bridge built by a Chinese company outside of China and was dubbed the 'dream bridge,' by the Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh, Yao Wen. Ambassador Wen further stated that not only will the bridge 'contribute to the connectivity in South Asia,' but also that whenever China’s President Xi Jinping 'mentions Bangladesh, he will mention the Padma Bridge.' Additionally, a much-needed $12.65 billion dollar nuclear power plant in Rooppur is pledged to be 90 percent financed by Russia as of 2023. Putin has also made inroads in Dhaka, helping the country shift away from energy dependence on India, while also benefitting from Bangladesh abstaining from a recent 2023 UN vote to cease the war in Ukraine. Washington’s Approach for Bangladesh’s Role in the Indo-Pacific Bangladesh plays a tough balancing act in the Indo-Pacific due to its immense population, resource endowments, and strategic location in the Bay of Bengal. This was played to Hasina’s hand, who sought to balance neighboring Beijing and New Delhi while maintaining Bangladesh’s role as an important trading partner to the United States and European Union. Her capture of state institutions, momentum for turning the country into a one-party state, and ability to navigate the trail of Western sanctions, all while maintaining consistent economic growth at a 7 percent annual rate, attests to this small-state-leverage playing larger powers off one another. Ultimately, mass rebellion and inability to provide effective governance and economic opportunity succeeded where coercive US measures could not. With Yunus at the helm, Bangladesh is under a transitory governance scheme where Washington has a more receptive head of state. However, commitment to free and fair elections that releases far-right Islamist elements, while committing to deepening Western and Indian interests, presents a conflict of interest. More pressing, the Chinese inroads made in Bangladesh with BNS Sheikh Hasina, military imports, and the Padma Bridge have distanced Washington as a strategic competitor in the region. The steps Washington takes next with Bangladesh must account for the need to assure an effective democratic framework for elections, state security and law and order for the regime that assumes power after the interim government holds its election. The announcement that Yunus would not run himself and the momentum gained by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Islamist parties has raised alarms in New Delhi and Western capitals, with Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh recommending at the Indian Air Force Commanders’ Conference to be ready for 'new challenges' in response to the changing posture of the incumbent and coming regime in Dhaka. In response, the former Bangladesh Army Chief of Staff, Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan, has led the Bangladesh military to assess putting the country on war footing under a model of the French levée en masse—referring to the French Revolution’s policy of requiring all able-bodied men to serve the military to defend the nation. Washington is uniquely poised to help Dhaka deter any confrontation with New Delhi, while also reeling the strategically-located country from China’s embrace ahead of the 2027 projected Chinese invasion ofTaiwan. Diplomatic overtures and economic cooperation can collectively aid in preventing Bangladesh from becoming another autocratic regime, as well as from becoming a vassal for Beijing’s interests in the Indo-Pacific neighboring its regional rival, India. However, Yunus must hold the line against Islamists, as Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh, Yao Wen, recently praised Jamaat-e-Islami as a 'well-organized party.' Yunus must also continually court the United States and European Union in order to reel Bangladesh from the crosshairs of China’s grand strategy in South Asia. While the Yunus-led interim government’s decision to lift the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami was rooted in ending the Awami League’s one-party governance, Beijing’s open embrace of Islamist forces who have historically antagonized Washington, New Delhi, and European capitals has raised alarms for the country’s trade, people-to-people ties, and defense posture. A Bangladesh where institutions are captured by the anti-Awami League axis of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami will allow Beijing unprecedented leverage in Bangladesh, given both their anti-Indian and anti-Western track record, ongoing rhetoric, and overall platforms. The Yunus-led interim government is Washington’s last window ofopportunity to chart a prosperous and democratic Bangladesh for decades to come, or it can serve as a missed opportunity that offered China and Russia an indefinite foothold.

Iran And Russia Seek To Reshape Global Hegemony With New Bilatera...	Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian met in Kazan, Russia, during the latest BRICS (a loose political economic grouping originally consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) summit, held on October 22–24 (Kremlin.ru, October 23; see EDM, October 28). This follows an earlier meeting between the two leaders on bilateral ties in Ashgabat on October 11 (Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, October 11). Given that Iran has recently inaugurated a new president who seeks to improve foreign relations, the bilateral agenda was quite expansive, accounting for both countries’ interest in developing closer ties in light of their respective conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Both sides have found themselves in a similar position—isolated by the West, targeted by sanctions, and eager for new allies—and look to establish closer political and military cooperation. Moscow and Tehran are motivated to introduce an agreement that would reflect their changing preferences and underline their shared opposition to the collective West. Cooperation between the two countries has seen incremental improvement across various fronts since 2022 despite mutual distrust. This trend is expected to culminate in the signing of a comprehensive agreement that promises to redefine the scope of their strategic partnership (Amwaj, September 19). Although an exact date for such a signing has not yet been established, both Moscow and Tehran will likely look to ratify some sort of treaty by the end of the year, as both sides are eager to quickly sign an agreement, demonstrated by their ambitious designs in bilateral ties (see EDM, September 18). The exact contents of what would be in this agreement are unknown. Compared with a previous treaty signed by the two countries more than twenty years ago, the expected agreements will likely involve much more extensive political, economic, and cultural ties (Russian Council, July 22, 2021). A heavy emphasis will likely be placed on military and security cooperation, as this is the cornerstone of their expanding relationship (see EDM, July 22, December 12, 2022, March 6, 2023, February 22). More precisely, drone and missile production is sure to top Moscow and Tehran’s agendas, given that their respective conflicts with Ukraine and Israel have proven to both the importance of such weapon systems (see Terrorism Monitor, November 4, 2022; see EDM, July 22, 2022, September 14, 2023, October 16). The two sides are also likely to double down on greater training assistance and Iran’s purchase of Russian Su-35 fighter jets and potentially S-400 missile systems (Euronews, October 25; Kyiv Post, October 27). Outside of defense, the new agreement is also set to extend collaboration into areas such as trade, media, education, space exploration, cultural exchange, and a common payment system (see EDM, December 13, 2021, May 1; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, August 10, 2022; Iran International, December 15, 2023; The Moscow Times, November 4). Moscow and Tehran will also be eager to resolve disagreements impeding the construction of major gas pipelines in Iran, implementing liquified natural gas projects, and undertaking swap operations involving natural gas and oil products (Iran International, October 14, 2023; The Moscow Times, October 1). Infrastructure will be a critical topic of discussion. Moscow and Tehran have tried to improve and expand the vital International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) (see EDM, June 7, 2023, March 6; Tehran Times, September 17). Running along the Caspian Sea and connecting Russia with Iran’s southern ports, creating access to the Indian Ocean and South Asian markets, this corridor has been a historic trading route between Russia and Iran since the sixteenth century, used by both to bypass Ottoman influence and access distant markets across the region. While Iran and Russia have been historical adversaries more often than not—having vied for influence in the Caucasus and Middle East throughout the imperial era—their cooperation does have historical roots. In the late sixteenth century, Safavid Iran and the Russian Tsardom joined forces to counter Ottoman expansion. Similarly, in today’s context, Russia and Iran’s warming relationship is driven by shared grievances against the West and their common desire to challenge the world order. Tehran’s support for proxy regimes throughout the Middle East and Moscow’s support for the Syrian regime have both been viewed as examples of their efforts to counter Western influence in the region (see EDM, July 31, 2017, February 5, July 29, October 7; Anadolu, September 28). For Iran, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and its subsequent isolation from Western diplomatic institutions acted as a defining moment that pushed Russia into closer relations with the Islamic Republic. Isolated from Western trade and facing heavy sanctions, Russia’s pivot to the Middle East and Asia has made Iran an indispensable partner. Iran has supported Russia with advanced weaponry, and these budding ties even extended to proxy conflicts, such as Moscow’s alleged support for the Houthis in Yemen, even at the risk of damaging Russia’s relationships with other regional powers such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have traditionally opposed the Houthis (see EDM, August 8, October 7). Moscow’s shift to a more pro-Iran stance has become much more pronounced in recent years. Even so, direct military support in Iran’s conflicts, particularly with Israel—which harbors a large Russian population— remains unlikely. Nevertheless, leaders in Iran and Russia envision a multipolar world premised on challenging Western geopolitical and economic hegemony. This fits into a more comprehensive continuum of countries, China being the principal actor, looking to create alternative alliance networks and key geopolitical leaders globally. The rise of transnational organizations such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization marks a new era in global geopolitics, with Russia and Iran positioning themselves as ascending powers (see EDM, July 15, October 16; see China Brief, July 12).

China’s Expanding Role In The Middle East – Analysis	By Mauricio D. Aceves Extensive discourse is taking place regarding the power vacuum in the Middle East following the waning presence of the U.S. In this frame, regional actors have increased their influence over the specific issue of stability. Hence, it is crucial for all countries to diversify their ties when seeking a new balance, beyond their familiar stakes of economic interest and energy security. In this scenario, China offers an alternative, furthering its early strategic engagement around investments, bilateral and multilateral cooperation and geopolitical calibrations, to fit smoothly alongside a new, multipolar order narrative. The echoes of this strategy are also heard in other latitudes. In parallel, China has also increased its presence in Latin America, primarily through investments in communications, technology, and infrastructure for connectivity. The role of China in the Middle East can be categorized into a troika of domains—the economic and geopolitical scope includes the supply chain, financial systems, investments, technology and technical knowledge transfers, trade and energy security. The second refers to bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, including the convergence inside organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), BRICS, and the many displays of diplomacy, from the cultural to the military. The third reflects the political approach with non-state actors and the open communications channels through the political labyrinth of the region. China does not aim to control regional dynamics or guarantee security. China’s policy is to be the master of economic dialogue and the use of incentives while avoiding direct involvement in conflicts and creating adversaries. Economic development is the sword, and pragmatism the road. The Middle East has historically stood at the crossroads of geopolitics, even for China’s vision. The Persian Gulf provides China with over a third of the oil it imports;[1] Qatar is China’s most significant source of imported gas, and Turkmenistan is the second.[2] Nowadays, China is the largest trade partner of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia.[3] The region became an essential destination for Chinese exports and services linked with infrastructure, communications and information technologies. More than 60% of maritime trade between Europe and China[4] crosses the many seas of the region: the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Oman, the Bab al-Mandeb and Hormuz Straits. Beijing has invested in Oman’s Duqm Port and has built oil pipelines to the Port of Fujairah and facilities at Khalifa Port in the UAE. It holds stakes in at least 20 port projects in the Middle East and North Africa. Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen remain potential sites for further Chinese port development. This intensifying web of possibilities and realities is the first step of a growing China presence in the Middle Eastern supply chain and mirrors the world’s geopolitical priorities. However, conflicts compromise the transit through these chokepoints between the Indo-Pacific and the Mediterranean waters. The Houthis’ reactivity in the Gulf of Aden, the instability in the Horn of Africa or even the chapter of the stuck Evergreencontainer ship in the Suez, show how vulnerable these areas are. Avoiding exposure has been China’s central policy, but in the foreign domain, China has certainly been active and visible. The Chinese military base in Djibouti at the entrance of the Red Sea and the naval presence close to Hormuz, ostensibly aims to deter piracy and more easily participate in joint military exercises. So far, these cards have not been used to interfere in ongoing conflicts, but only to protect Chinese assets and guard commercial routes. Military engagement is for Beijing, the last option when threats to overseas national interests are imminent. Nor does China perceive military non-state actors or ongoing regional conflicts as direct threats. This fact conditioned its approach to relying on diplomacy rather than military engagement. But this strategy has limits. Scalations and the spread of conflict might involve different approaches. Providing technology and components for dual purposes, civil and military, or supporting the development of the military industry[5] [6] have been small but significant steps toward military involvement through business means. The SCO, BRICS, the Digital Silk Road and the Global Security Initiative show that China’s presence deep inside the arteries of the Middle East have entered a new stage of engagement. The comprehensive strategic partnerships with Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE demonstrate the accurate calibration of diplomacy, navigating the political differences. Even considering the long-lasting support to Palestine and the condemnations of military actions of Israel in Palestine and Lebanon, China has developed economic ties with Israel and simultaneously reinforced relations with Saudi Arabia and Iran. China is the top trading partner for Iran and Israel.[7] China’s 25-year cooperation agreement with Iran signed in 2021, and the mediatory role played by Beijing in the Joint Trilateral Statement with Iran and Saudi Arabia, gives China legitimacy and reduces the perception of China as a rival. Earlier this year, Chinese envoys met Hamas’ political leaders in Doha; concurrently, China attended talks with top Israeli diplomats and the Palestinian Authority, and later in July, China hosted a summit with representatives of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in Beijing. These interactions seek to maintain communication with all actors, even when political and warfare conditions make mediation efforts an unviable task. However, diplomatic inertia over the Middle East appears to be taking root, especially with the devastating situation in Palestine and the multiple fronts opened by this Pandora’s box. Other actions could be analyzed if the conflict spreads and harms global stability. China’s ties with the Middle East are traversing into uncharted seas. The weight of China has grown in the Middle East. Nowadays, it’s easy to find banks with China’s flag in the region’s leading cities. China’s embassies in Riyadh, Cairo, and Tehran are more influential than ever. China’s ability to understand partners’ motivations has resulted in a foreign policy that is a mix of incentives and defined consequences; it is aware of the importance of establishing a transparent set of geopolitical priorities in a long-term frame. A new version of the 'Great Game'[8] has started in the Middle East, and its inner powers are in the leading roles, but China will be that player always on the chessboard with more pieces and moves in hand, than ever.

Government Efficiency Is A Tall Order For Musk – OpEd	Former president Donald Trump says Elon Musk may serve as the 'Secretary of Cost-Cutting,' and Musk foresees a Department of Government Efficiency under his command. The SpaceX boss might dial it back to a previous attempt during the Carter Era. The victor over Gerald Ford in 1976, Carter tackled inefficiency in the federal bureaucracy with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. According to Office of Personnel Management, the 'keystone' of the Act was the Senior Executive Service, (SES) established to 'ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality.' SES leaders 'possess well-honed executive skills and share a broad perspective on government and a public service commitment that is grounded in the Constitution.' The SES bosses also 'serve in the key positions just below the top Presidential appointees. SES members are the major link between these appointees and the rest of the Federal workforce. They operate and oversee nearly every government activity in approximately 75 Federal agencies.' Taxpayers had a right to wonder how it worked out. 'When Jimmy Carter set up the Senior Executive Service nearly three years ago, it was touted as the ideal place for the government’s top managers, an elite niche where Uncle Sam’s best and brightest would toil at greater risk but with the promise of greater rewards,' wrote Karlyn Barker of the Washington Post in October, 1981, 'but it hasn’t worked out that way.' Many SES members complained about pay, promotions, and the bonus system. On the other hand, Barker provided little assessment of SES job performance that would merit higher pay. The SES represented less than one percent of the federal workforce but between 2008 and 2011 SES bosses received more than $340 million in bonuses, on top of annual salaries that ranged from $119,000 to $179,000. The bonuses were not subject to budget cuts and SES influence continued to surge. According to a 2015 report, the SES boasted 217 members in the army, 318 in the Navy, 179 in the Air Force, 473 in the Department of Defense, 594 at Homeland Security, and a full 786 at the Department of Justice. 'All other' federal agencies accounted for 1,785 SES members, with a grand total of 7,791. In his 2015 executive order, 'Strengthening the Senior Executive Service,' President Obama set out to 'facilitate career executive continuity between administrations.' By May 31, 2016, agencies with 20 or more SES positions were to develop a plan 'to increase the number of SES members who are rotating to improve talent development, mission delivery, and collaboration.' And so on, all without any long-term assessment of job performance. For all but the willfully blind, the SES had become another bureaucracy, but hardly the only evidence of government waste, fraud, and abuse. John C. Beale, once the highest-paid employee at the Environmental Protection Agency, told his bosses he was a CIA spy working in London, India, and Pakistan when he was actually holed up at his vacation home. Beale pulled off this ruse for 20 years, performing little if any work. The fraudster continued to draw his government paycheck and retention bonuses even after he retired. SES Employees Are Still Government Workers Like government employees in general, SES bosses enjoy an array of special protections against dismissal. Elon Musk would have a hard time firing them, but the SpaceX mogul may not get the chance. Donald Trump would have to win the election, hardly a done deal, and there’s more to consider. The SES operates in 75 government departments including the Department of Homeland Security, which now controls the United States Secret Service, before 2003 part of the Treasury Department. As it turns out, the SES also deploys personnel in the Secret Service, responsible for protection of the president, and since the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, presidential candidates as well. At a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Secret Service failed to prevent a 20-year-old with no tactical experience from scaling a rooftop and unleashing eight shots, one wounding former president Trump, and other shots killing one attendee and wounding two others. Not much SES efficiency was on display, but government agencies have succeeded in making the election season more exciting.

US Nuclear Defense Should Not Be So Costly – OpEd	After a decades-long post-Cold War halt to designing, manufacturing, and testing new nuclear arms, the United States is implementing a three-decade-long, $1.7 trillion program to modernize and increase its already sizable arsenal of nuclear weapons, according to a recent New York Times report by W. J. Hennigan. This program, which is already over budget and behind schedule (as most weapons programs tend to be in the Pentagon’s uncompetitive procurement environment), is also an overreaction to other nuclear weapons powers. It should be pared back significantly. During the nuclear insanity of the Cold War, during the late 1980s, the world had around 70,000 nuclear warheads, up from roughly 3,000 in 1955. As a result of arms control and the end of the Cold War, the number now stands at about 12,000 globally. The United States currently has about 5,748 warheads in its nuclear arsenal compared to Russia’s 5,580. Together, both arsenals contain more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads. When New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), which limits long-range nuclear warheads and delivery systems, expires in early 2026, the United States is considering adding warheads to its arsenal. China currently possesses 500 warheads, is on schedule to double that number by the turn of the decade, and may build up its force further by 2035. Russia has also overhauled its nuclear arsenal. Hennigan seems to accept that nuclear and conventional military activities by Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran should govern the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Nonetheless, he laments that the 'future of arms control appears bleak' after forty years of progress in reducing the number of nuclear warheads; appears to blanch at the staggering cost of U.S. nuclear modernization; and argues that although Congress decided the United States needed to modernize its nuclear arsenal more than a decade ago, the American public is still woefully uninformed about the nature of a program slated to cost nearly double each year ($57 billion) what the entire World War II-era Manhattan Project did. However, Hennigan comes up with few solutions to what seems to be an incipient nuclear arms race. He is correct in three of his four assumptions, but the solution can be found by correcting the erroneous remaining one. Hennigan is correct that the program's cost is already astonishing and growing, that most of the American populace is entirely ignorant of it, and that the prospect for bilateral or multilateral arms control is gloomy. That gloom stems from the impression that China plans to break out of its previously astute posture of maintaining only a nuclear force for minimum deterrence. With China unconstrained in its nuclear modernization, the United States (and maybe Russia, too) is leery of continuing the constraints of the New START Treaty. Yet even if other countries continue their nuclear refurbishment or buildups, is it smart for the United States, which has a debt held by the public of $26.3 Trillion(about 98 percent of the GDP), to do so on such a grand scale? Currently, the United States is modernizing (and maybe augmenting) all three legs of its Cold War-era nuclear triad. The triad consists of land-based long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) based in silos in the Western states, long-range bomber aircraft that can deliver nuclear weapons, and stealthy, and therefore invulnerable, ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) that can now deliver nearly 1,000 powerful warheads. During the Cold War, the United States could afford such overkill in its massive destruction capability. The American people should now ask whether the United States could adopt a less costly but adequate minimum deterrent strategy, such as China did in the past, to use the savings to help facilitate an economic miracle. Two legs of the triad are vulnerable to an adversary’s nuclear first strike. New ICBM (Sentinel) missiles deployed into stationary and easily targeted land-based silos are not likely to get any less vulnerable to an enemy first strike than the existing Minuteman III missiles. New long-range, nuclear-capable U.S. bombers (the B-21 Raider) would be vulnerable to a surprise attack on the ground before takeoff or, if they do get airborne, vulnerable when trying to penetrate very capable Russian or Chinese air defenses. The United States (and other great powers) really only need a nuclear force surviving an enemy’s first strike that can hit all major targets in the attacking country to deter other great powers from launching nuclear attacks on it in the first place. If there are 500 major targets in Russia or China and two warheads are needed to destroy each target, the United States could take out those targets by creating a survivable but powerful, minimum nuclear deterrent with about 1,000 warheads placed aboard twelve invulnerable undersea Columbia-class SSBNs. (Any small nuclear arsenals of North Korea and Iran are lesser included cases). Thus, the ICBM and bomber modernization programs could be scrapped. Building only those twelve submarines would cost $130 billion instead of the $1.7 Trillion to modernize the entire triad force, according to the Times report. Critics will label this nuclear 'monad' unilateral disarmament, but it is really just eliminating the costly and wasteful massive overkill in our current nuclear forces. The foolish nuclear arms race among the great powers may continue, but the United States safely can unilaterally choose to opt out of it.

Markets Made Of Glass: How The Fed Destroyed Economic Resilience ...	By Artis Shepherd Central to any good investor’s decision-making process is determining the degree to which the target of investment is 'robust to the downside.' Can the investment maintain its value—or even continue to provide sufficient return on capital—in the event of a pullback in the broader economy or a specific sector? Warren Buffett has aptly referred to this feature as 'margin of safety.' While critical to rational decision-makers, margin of safety seems quaint in today’s era of speculation and central bank front-running. Rather, in place of acquiring expertise and performing rational due diligence, speculators in capital markets rely on perpetually loose monetary policy and periodic bailouts. Markets worldwide, but particularly in the US, now exhibit a profound lack of robustness. Central banks—the Federal Reserve foremost among them—have become enablers of the political and crony classes, responding to any material drop in asset prices with swift jawboning, followed by enactment of loose monetary policy until speculators’ nerves are settled. The problem is that easy money entails a constant behind-the-scenes destruction of what’s truly important to an economy—sound money, low time preference, personal productivity, and quality of life—while emphasizing the frivolous and absurd. The Greenspan-Fed Put A put option or 'put' is a contract that allows the holder to sell a security or asset at a specific price ('strike price'), regardless of the current price ('spot price') of the underlying security or asset. Put options are actionable when spot prices decline below the strike price, allowing holders to exercise their put at the higher strike price, thus limiting their downside. While the Federal Reserve had been acting as a backstop to capital markets for decades prior, the genesis of the Greenspan Put was 1987. October 19 of that year, now known as 'Black Monday,' saw a single-day 20 percent drop in the US stock market. Invoking the familiar rationale of 'systemic concerns,' newly-appointed Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan swiftly opened the monetary floodgates and lowered interest rates, reversing the prior trend of rate hikes. Perhaps more importantly, Greenspan issued a statement the day following Black Monday in which he expressed the Fed’s 'readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.' Despite the 'systemic concerns' canard, the stock market crash was the only noteworthy event on Black Monday. Credit markets did not seize up and the US Main Street economy was unimpacted. Greenspan’s Fed reacted exclusively to the drop in the stock market. Actions taken by Greenspan’s Fed led to an immediate rebound in stock prices, and all-time highs were reached soon after. Similar actions were taken by Greenspan multiple times during his tenure, including the absurd Fed-supervised bailout of Long Term Capital Management—a hedge fund comprising too-clever-by-half bond traders, academics, and other Wall Streeters who attempted to leverage and arbitrage their way into financial stardom but ended up losing billions. Over the years, the Greenspan Put has morphed into the Fed Put, with successive Fed chairmen employing the same techniques as Greenspan in propping up stock prices, namely, loosening monetary policy at any hint of a downturn by injecting liquidity and lowering interest rates while jawboning the markets so as to settle nerves and allow institutional speculators to front-run such policy. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is of course guilty of this, even before the hyperbolic actions taken during the covid panic of 2020. In 2018, shortly after his appointment, Powell suggested he would raise interest rates and embark on a path of quantitative tightening—taking liquidity out of the banking system by selling off the Fed’s treasury portfolio. The stock market responded with a 20 percent decline, at which point Powell immediately reversed his position. Sensing the continuation of the Fed Put indefinitely, stock markets soon reached valuations not seen since the dot-com bubble of 1999 and capital markets across the board bid up valuations to all-time highs. A study published in 2020 determined that not only does the Fed respond directly to stock market declines—particularly since Greenspan’s tenure in the 1990s—but such concerns are explicitly discussed in FOMC meetings. The authors of the study state: We show that since the mid-1990s the Fed has engaged in a sequence of policy easings following large stock market declines in the intermeeting period.… The structure of the Fed documents allows us to measure how frequently actual decision makers at the FOMC…mention the stock market…these mentions are strongly predictive of future policy and do so in an asymmetric way: mentions of stock market declines predict monetary easing, whereas there is no relationship between mentions of stock market gains and tightening. We verify the robustness of these findings using the FOMC transcripts. The authors note further: The statistical fact is that, since the mid-1990s, the Fed has tended to lower rates by an average of about 1.2 percentage points in the year after a 10 percent stock market decline… Fed actions since the publication of this study in 2020—including the massive liquidity dumps of the covid panic era—only confirm these conclusions. Zombie Companies One result of permanently loose monetary policy is a profusion of 'zombie companies'—those that can only survive in an environment where interest rates are artificially lowered. As evidence, consider the share of Russell 2000 companies (publicly-traded small-caps) with negative earnings, and notice how the percentage peaks shortly after each bubble burst, when interest rates are temporarily increasing. Despite decades of loose monetary policy, nearly half of these companies have negative earnings today. This phenomenon is not isolated to publicly-traded small-cap stocks. Myriad types and sizes of companies that shouldn’t exist—because they can’t provide sufficient value to compete in the free market—are propped up by cheap debt and other forms of subsidy. The existence of zombie companies is one concrete reminder of the profound weakness prevalent in our markets. Higher rates and a cessation of easy money policies would kill them all. Contents are Fragile Recently, the Japanese stock market index experienced a one-day drop of 12.4 percent, marking its worst day since Black Monday in 1987. The reason? A few days earlier, Japan’s central bank raised benchmark rates from 0.10 percent to 0.25 percent! Soon after this stock market tantrum, bashful and shamed Japanese bureaucrats reversed course and pledged to nervous investors that no more big, bad rate hikes would be forthcoming. The index recovered immediately. If Japan is a dysfunctional and fragile zombie economy, the US is hardly better. After decades of coddling stock market speculators, crony bankers, and politicians greedy for asset bubbles to appease their voter base, the Fed is now stuck with an economy that lacks durability, to put it mildly. Real earnings and productivity growth through the free market have been sacrificed for increasing asset prices measured in a dollar that is rapidly and constantly losing value. Combined with record amounts of leverage in the system, this state of affairs can only devolve into chaos. There is no politically viable way out, only the hard road back to sound money and fiscal discipline where interest rates are set by the market, not a central bank—a likelihood on par with pigs flying. Unlike bubbly asset prices propped up by a continually inflated dollar, robustness to the downside is a sign of genuine economic well-being. The ability of a market to tolerate downturns with resilience is what underlies its true strength. By that standard, the US economy is made of glass.

In Fencing China Out, Is Washington Fencing Itself In? – OpEd	As Washington doubles down on its semiconductor embargoes, a troubling paradox emerges: in trying to stymie China’s technological advances, the United States might just be fencing itself in. Each successive restriction aims to choke off China’s progress, specifically in artificial intelligence and high-performance chips. Yet these measures risk isolating the United States from global tech supply chains, harming its own industry and allies. Take the new U.S. Treasury rule, effective January 2025, which tightens restrictions on American investments in Chinese semiconductors and quantum computing. Although the Biden administration’s objective is clear—to kneecap China’s semiconductor ascent—this gambit is not likely to work. The complexity of today’s tech landscape, with its entangled supply lines and 'gray channels' of unofficial trade, underscores the futility of isolating China. Chinese firms continue advancing, with the support of both local innovation and resilient demand for tech alternatives. Despite escalating sanctions designed to strangle China’s chip industry, the true costs of these measures ripple far beyond Beijing. American allies find themselves isolated, and domestic companies feel the sting of lost revenues. Take Nvidia, for instance. The American AI chip giant introduced its groundbreaking Blackwell architecture in March but offered a downgraded version to maintain ties with the Chinese market, a reluctant acknowledgment of a complex interdependence that persists despite Washington’s aspirations. These efforts to stem China’s progress are as much a commentary on America’s anxiety over competition as they are on Beijing’s resilience in pushing forward, innovating, and navigating the geopolitical minefield. Even American firms like Semianalysis, which advocates for the strictest sanctions, concede that China is now advancing past the United States in achieving intelligent computing capabilities. The 'wall' designed to keep China out is riddled with gaps. China’s resourcefulness exploits these gaps. With substantial clean energy reserves to power vast computing clusters, where the United States often struggles with shortages, China is less beholden to America’s chip arsenal. Although its H20 chips fall short of Nvidia’s H200, innovative local firms are rapidly narrowing the gap. Meanwhile, U.S. attempts to regulate global trade through restricted entity lists has proven little more than a game of 'whack-a-mole,' where new avenues emerge faster than they can be closed. Perhaps the most significant gap in Washington’s strategy is China’s capacity to manufacture advanced chips domestically. Semiconductor giants SMIC and TSMC illustrate this shrinking technological divide, with China trailing the United States by an estimated five years. By 2024, as Huawei and local giants like Changxin Storage join forces, China’s investments in wafer equipment will propel it to the world’s second-largest buyer, outpacing all American firms. The United States can tighten its grip, but innovation continues to slip through its fingers. Calls are growing within the United States not just to restrict the export of advanced equipment but to clamp down on components that enable the manufacturing of these technologies. This, however, demands that allies join the United States in constructing an even taller wall. But such a strategy would ultimately require Washington to compensate its allies, effectively paying a steep diplomatic toll for a policy that isolates more than it secures. While the U.S. may dominate advanced semiconductor technologies, China holds critical leverage in other parts of the supply chain, particularly in rare earth elements essential to chip production. China supplies 60 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals and controls over 85 percent of their processing. In response to American export controls, China has restricted exports of gallium and germanium—key materials in chipmaking—and has hinted at further action if pressures persist. While these controls aim to hinder China’s tech ambitions, they could have substantial repercussions for the United States too. American chip companies, deeply reliant on the Chinese market, face looming financial losses. U.S. firms could lose up to $83 billion in annual sales and 124,000 jobs, with semiconductor equipment companies especially exposed since 30–40 percent of their sales depend on China. Meanwhile, Chinese firms like SMIC have pivoted sharply, now producing 80 percent for domestic use compared to just 40 percent five years ago. A prolonged restriction may curtail U.S. R&D, weakening its competitiveness in a market shaped by shifting alliances and growing interdependence. There’s increasing talk of an emerging 'American island,' a scenario where the United States, in its quest for dominance, finds itself hemmed in as other nations gravitate towards the Chinese supply chain. This trend, already visible in connected cars, is making inroads into the semiconductor sector. Since 2018, China has skillfully maneuvered around these restrictions, using strategies like 'design-out' (substituting U.S. technologies with Chinese or third-country alternatives) and 'design-around' (innovating to bypass controlled technologies entirely). The U.S. strategy to contain China’s tech industry has spurred an unexpected transformation. Chinese companies, supported by the government, are choosing local suppliers more assertively, aiming to reduce reliance on an unstable supply chain. This shift is creating a robust local market and a fortified tech ecosystem within China. Meanwhile, foreign companies, fearing the loss of access to China’s vast market, are moving away from American technology and components. Third-party nations and their companies, unburdened by these geopolitical tensions, are stepping in to fill gaps left by restricted American firms. With revenues and R&D investments shifting to non-American firms, U.S. leadership is in jeopardy. American firms may face diminished market share as they are overtaken by agile competitors less constrained by Washington’s restrictive policies. Once focused on replication, Chinese companies are now emphasizing original technological advancements. With expertise in packaging technology and close integration into the global supply chain, China has boosted its investments in hybrid bonding and advanced substrates, fields where U.S. companies are lagging. Data from the first half of this year highlight China’s impressive strides. While global semiconductor equipment revenues held steady, China’s top equipment manufacturers achieved a 50 percent year-over-year revenue increase, reducing their gap with global giants from 24 to 15 times. As the contest between China and the United States deepens, third-party players will continue to leverage this shifting dynamic, optimizing their own interests amid the rivalry.

Will America Elect The Unknown Or The Unpredictable? – OpEd	By Alistair Burt The world this week awaits the verdict of its most important democracy. This US presidential campaign, astonishing in so many ways, reaches polling day on Tuesday with the outcome still uncertain, a contest between the unknown and the unpredictable. It is not an enviable situation either for the US or for the UK, EU, Middle East and others, which will be watching with perhaps greater anxiety than ever before. It could still be the case that the most consequential decision in the campaign remains that of those who persuaded President Joe Biden to opt for a very early TV debate with Donald Trump. Shrewdly but secretly gambling that exposing the president’s frailty would allow for a replacement candidate, it immediately shifted what had been gathering momentum toward Trump. It refocused the issues of age and capacity squarely on the man who was now the oldest candidate. While that gamble to replace Biden may have worked, it remains to be seen if it has swayed the election itself. Whatever the real or imagined preferences of foreign countries as to the outcome, the truth is that they will respect the decision of the American people and get to work with the new incumbent in the White House. They will deal with the specific differences in policy about which they already know, while recognizing there are generic issues that either can bring to the table. Kamala Harris is still largely an enigma. If she were to win, we all assume there would be a degree of continuity in foreign policy, such as clear support for NATO and Ukraine, but probably also keeping with a rather more ill-defined approach to the Middle East. The Israel/Gaza/Lebanon policy of the Democratic incumbent seems to please no one. Whoever you talk to feels abandoned. Benjamin Netanyahu feels he is not being supported strongly and unquestioningly enough, while Palestinians and the Arab street are outraged at the degree of catastrophe being inflicted on innocent civilians and which remains unimpeded, even actively supported, by the US. Regional powers will probably be assuming that the US under Harris will continue to prioritize the Far East and they will be left on their own to deal with long-unresolved issues, such as the future of the Palestinian question and what to do with Iran. Trump brings a whole new suite of baggage — much of it terrifying. Europe and the world worry about climate change commitments, while Trump is a climate change denier, calling it a 'hoax.' International consensus and agreements would either fall or need drastically reworking. Europe and the free world are engaged in confronting the first invasion of a sovereign country on the European continent since 1945 (allowing some license for Soviet actions against client states in the past) and the loss of US support in terms of aid or arms, as hinted at by Trump, would likely be decisive in Russia’s favor, opening up the question of 'where next?' Trump has already threatened not to assist NATO states if they have not paid what he considers appropriate amounts to the alliance’s funds. He said in February that he would encourage Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' toward 'delinquent' NATO members, though in the current atmosphere of defense uncertainty both candidates will want to ensure greater defense commitments from Europe. Europe will fear being caught up in a Republican trade war, with tariffs imposed on itself and further pressure on China. And while some in the Middle East may prefer Trump to the Obama years and the mixed messages from the Democrats, the region will not know quite what it is getting from a new Trump presidency. Israel may or may not get unqualified support, even to the point of annexation of the West Bank. A deal with Saudi Arabia may be seen as the answer to everything, but the terms of such a deal in relation to Palestine are now very different. Will renewed 'maximum pressure' on Iran — the policy that tore up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal and gave the region more and better quality enriched Iranian uranium — be accompanied by actions? Or will the opposite be the case to deliver on Trump’s promise to the US people not to become militarily engaged in the Middle East again? Apart from these specifics, there are deeper worries. What damage has the election already done to a polarized American people and political system? What is this fear of malevolent retribution, which has stopped major US newspapers from endorsing Harris? Will the result be contested, as seems certain if Trump is not declared the winner, and what may ensue? Authoritarians the world over would get a renewed boost. Can a united US emerge, with clarity in its foreign policy, if still divided by the election? And how will the international order, creaking with a dysfunctional UN, be affected by a US that might turn in upon itself, consumed by domestic bitterness? None of us can affect the outcome, but most would settle for a clear winner, an absence of bitterness, signs of reconciliation among the American people and a renewed commitment to their place in the world.

Violence In America: When Ballot Boxes Burn And Poll Workers Face...	Historical patterns of electoral intimidation have reemerged in contemporary American democracy with troubling institutional implications. During Reconstruction, systematic campaigns targeted election officials who protected universal suffrage; today's data from the Brennan Center for Justice reveals an analogous institutional vulnerability, with 38% of local election officials reporting threats, harassment, or abuse in their official capacity. Institutional analysis of this 8 percentage point increase from previous year's findings suggests a coordinated pattern of democratic destabilization. The Department of Justice's Election Threat Task Force data reinforces this institutional pattern, documenting over 1,000 incidents of harassment targeting election workers, with 58% concentrated in contested jurisdictions. Mounting pressure has begun to crack the foundations of election office stability. Survey data indicates that 27% of election officials now report knowing colleagues who have departed their positions due to safety concerns, a significant increase from 18% in the previous year. Perhaps most concerning for electoral stability, 25% of local election officials will be working their first presidential election in 2024, indicating an unprecedented loss of experienced personnel at a critical juncture. This mass exodus of experienced election workers threatens to destabilize voting operations across the country, particularly in areas already struggling with resource limitations. The departure of seasoned officials creates a dangerous void in institutional knowledge, increasing the likelihood of administrative errors and potentially undermining public confidence in electoral processes. The intensity of threats against election workers has escalated from intimidation to physical confrontation and infrastructure attacks. In Orangeburg County, South Carolina, a poll worker faced physical assault during early voting when enforcing basic election laws prohibiting campaign apparel at voting sites. The worker was struck on the head after asking a voter to remove a political cap, demonstrating how routine enforcement of election rules now puts workers at risk of violence. Meanwhile, in the Pacific Northwest, authorities are investigating a series of coordinated attacks on ballot boxes in Oregon and Washington state, where an experienced metalworker systematically targeted multiple jurisdictions with incendiary devices, destroying hundreds of ballots and forcing election workers to implement emergency protocols. Within the legal system, courts have begun to recognize the urgent need for stronger protections. The recent $148 million judgment against Rudy Giuliani, requiring the surrender of his Manhattan residence to Georgia election workers, demonstrates the judiciary's recognition of institutional harm. However, these remedies address only the most prominent cases among thousands of documented incidents nationwide. The October 2024 attacks—from direct physical confrontations in South Carolina to the destruction of ballot boxes in the Pacific Northwest—reveal how quickly threats can escalate from intimidation to violence. These incidents demonstrate the urgent need for enhanced security measures to protect both election workers and the physical components of our voting system they maintain. Across the country, state legislatures have begun responding through increasingly robust action, recognizing the urgent need to protect election workers. Washington state has taken the lead by classifying harassment of election workers as a felony carrying up to five years' imprisonment, while Maine and Vermont have introduced similar protective measures to safeguard their election personnel. At the federal level, a bipartisan initiative led by Senators Susan Collins and Joe Manchin proposes doubling penalties for threatening election officials, demonstrating growing recognition of the need for coordinated national response. These legislative efforts represent necessary first steps, but their effectiveness will depend on consistent enforcement and coordination between state and federal authorities. Behind the statistics lies a cascade of challenges that threaten the integrity of future elections. The Orangeburg County assault illustrates how even routine election administration now carries risks of physical violence, while the Portland-Vancouver ballot box attacks demonstrate the sophisticated nature of coordinated threats against electoral infrastructure. The erosion of institutional knowledge in election administration creates vulnerabilities in procedural integrity and operational capacity. Analysis of staffing patterns indicates that consolidation of polling locations disproportionately impacts historically marginalized communities, replicating patterns of institutional discrimination. These operational disruptions compound existing structural weaknesses in electoral administration. Moving forward requires treating election worker protection with the same gravity we afford other threats to national security. The institutional framework must expand to include National Guard activation and enhanced law enforcement presence, particularly in jurisdictions facing acute threats. Recent violent confrontations and infrastructure attacks demonstrate why enhanced security isn't merely precautionary—it's essential for protecting both physical infrastructure and the election workers who face direct threats while performing their duties. Comprehensive security protocols, enhanced worker privacy protections, and systematic training programs represent essential components of institutional resilience. Just as we deploy resources to protect critical infrastructure and respond to natural disasters, defending our electoral system from organized intimidation demands a similar commitment of security personnel and resources. With the 2024 presidential election, the stability of our electoral system hangs in the balance. The protection of election workers has become inseparable from the preservation of democratic processes themselves, requiring immediate and sustained attention from policymakers at all levels of government. This crisis demands a unified, bipartisan response that recognizes the essential role of election workers in maintaining democratic stability. The future of American democracy depends on our ability to protect those who safeguard our most fundamental democratic processes, ensuring they can perform their duties free from intimidation and harassment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqCiBJ-uV0kw1	2024-11-04T15:48:27-08:00	
Ruthless Settlements: BHP, Brazil And The Samarco Fundão Dam Clas...	The BHP Group, as with other mining giants, has much explaining to do in the way it has approached the environment. It has become a master of the greenwashing experiment, an adept promoter of sham environmental responsibility (take, for instance, its practice of merely selling its oil and gas business to Woodside Petroleum in 2021 rather than retiring them); and, it transpired recently, a ruthless negotiator and litigant over contentious claims. After nine years of negotiations and attritive legal proceedings, BHP has reached a settlement with Brazilian authorities regarding its role in the Fundão tailings dam collapse in Mariana, Minas Gerais. Taking place on November 5, 2015, the results were catastrophic to human life and nature, leaving 19 people dead and spilling toxic sludge over some 700 kilometres of land. The Samarco-owned facility, which held something like 26,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools’ worth of tailings (50 million cubic metres), was a joint venture between BHP and Vale. In addition to killing 14 company employees and five residents, the released tailings rapidly reached Bento Rodrigues, and part of the communities of Paracatu de Baixo and Gesteira and, for good measure, flooded the centre of the town of Barra Longa. The catastrophe merely compounded, turning the Rio Doce Basin a filthy brown and affecting dozens of municipalities and hundreds of communities reliant on the Rio Doce for drinking water. The pollution also destroyed wildlife, fishing stocks, farmland and churches, and affected various Indigenous communities, including the Krenak, Tupiniquim, Guaranis and Quilombola. In response to the collapse, BHP, Vale and Samarco established the Renova Foundation, intended to compensate individuals and small businesses for losses and ostensibly ameliorating environmental impacts. This was hardly a concession on BHP’s part of guilt. 'Conveniently,' write the authors caustically in a Nature Conservation study on the disaster in August, 'the company creates its foundation to repair its own damages. Through the dense patchwork of multiple lawsuits filed in Brazil, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, BHP has repeatedly denied any central culpability in the collapse. Compensation payments to victims from the fund, to date, have also been scandalously tardy. The BHP 2024 annual report notes that R$17.5 billion (US$3.5 billion) had been paid to 430,000 people as of June 30 this year, with R$12.2 billion (US$2.5 billion) forked out to 110,000 people under the Novel system, or 'court mandated simplified indemnity system'. The company praises this arrangement as one that enabled 'informal workers' (cart drivers, sand miners, artisanal miners and street vendors) to receive compensation despite having 'difficulty proving the damages they suffered'. What BHP fails to underscore is that those under the Novel system had to wait for seven years after the dam collapse to receive any cash, with 40% of those only paid in the last two years. Of the 430,000, some 290,000 received a pitiful R$1050 each for a disruption to their water supply for seven to 10 days following the dam collapse. And just to add to the nastiness of it all, the replacement housing for victims has been of questionable quality. Little wonder that Thatiele Monic, president of the Vila Santa Efigênia and Adjacências Quilombola Association, is suspicious of the efforts of the Renova Foundation. The UK leg of proceedings, commenced in November 2018, is positively Dickensian in legal gyrations. It began as a High Court lawsuit against BHP involving 240,000 plaintiffs, including Brazilian municipalities and Krenak indigenous communities. In November 2020, the court dismissed the lawsuit, with Justice Turner making a memorable remark: 'The task facing the managing judge in England would, I predict, be akin to trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel.' Various impediments, not least the size and scale of the claims, including 'jurisdictional cross-contamination' and an abuse of process, were cited. In March 2021, the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision, arguing that the plaintiffs were already seeking legal redress in Brazil. In July, the London court of appeal reversed the decision, granting permission to appeal on grounds that the case had a 'real prospect of success'. To not do so would risk real injustice. In July 2022, a Court of Appeal ruled that English courts could hear the case, noting that, 'The vast majority of claimants who have recovered damages have only received very modest sums in respect of moral damages for interruption to their water supply'. An April 2024 date was set for the commencement of trial proceedings. In March 2023, the scale of the class action burgeoned further, with the addition of 500,000 claimants. Attempts by BHP to delay the lawsuit till mid-2025 were rejected by a London court in May 2023. On October 21 this year, the trial finally commenced. It would last all but a few days. The settlement agreement signed on October 25 includes BHP, Vale, Samarco and some half a dozen Brazilian authorities. Of the 42 civil claims against BHP, the October 25 agreement covers the most monumental and contentious. Its value – R$170 billion (US$31.5 billion) – is deceptive. Brazilian authorities can have reason to cheer the result, as it comes close to the R$175 billion sought in civil claims in 2016. BHP’s Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry, also seemed suspiciously satisfied, claiming that the agreement would deliver a laundry list of benefits including 'expanded and additional programs for the environment and for the people, including designated funding for the health system, economic recovery, improved infrastructure and extensive compensation and income support measures, including for farmers, fisher people and Indigenous and Traditional communities.' A sharp analysis from Tony Boyd of the Australian Financial Review, hardly a forum known for its humanitarians and bleeding hearts, offers a rather different reading of Brazilian efforts and the tactics employed by the mining giants. It was evident to Boyd 'that over the past decade, BHP and Vale have outplayed the Brazilian federal government, and statements of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo as well as the federal and state Public Prosecutors’ and Public Defenders’ Offices.' Much of this has to do, as Boyd remarks, on the time value of money. Some 60% of the final R$100 billion settlement is payable over 20 years. Taking that time frame into account, the nominal amount comes to a net present value of R$48 billion. Using the net present value analysis also means that the R$32 billion commitment to cover the cost of removing tailings from the Rio Doce and R$30,000 compensation awards to individuals and small businesses who opt into the arrangement, is R$25 billion. The financial burden arising from BHP’s compensatory undertakings has also been lessened by the near decade process of dispute resolution, allowing the reopening of the Samarco iron ore mine to take place in the meantime with healthy annual returns of US$750 million. Even now, BHP’s mild description of the catastrophe is given a coolly confident assessment. The company’s website notes that since the dam breach, Samarco operates 'with a strong focus on safety and sustainability.' Alleviating the use of dams has been possible because of the implementation of a 'new filtration system', while 80% of the tailings arising from the operations 'are now dry stacked, with the rest deposited in a confined rocky pit.' Feeble assurance to those hundreds of thousands affected that fateful November in 2015.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqNvZ7qDHkLeF	2024-11-04T15:45:22-08:00	
How Do Asia’s Authoritarian States Pick Leaders? – Analysis	By Paul Eckert In a world bracing for a close U.S. presidential election result this week, a large swathe of Asia picks its leaders without suspense -- and mostly with little popular participation. Chinese leader Xi Jinping was confirmed by the National People’s Congress in March 2013 with 2,952 votes for, one against, and three abstentions. Last year the rubber stamp parliament voted unanimously to give him a third term, putting him on track to stay in power for life. North Korea’s leaders have inherited their power from father to son for three generations. They are technically 'elected' – but there is no choice. In 2014, Kim Jong Un was elected to the Supreme People’s Assembly without a dissenting vote with 100% turnout. A leadership succession that played out in Vietnam this year saw a serial purge of political rivals and the death of an ailing top leader propel To Lam, a wily career security policeman to the top of the Communist Party, where he is maneuvering for a key intra-party vote in early 2026. In U.S. elections, the president and vice president are not elected directly in a popular vote by citizens. Instead, they are chosen through the Electoral College process, in which electors equal to the total number of representatives and senators a state has in Congress cast that state’s votes. These electors vote according to the majority of residents in that state. Members of Congress – 100 in the Senate and 435 in the House of the Representatives – are elected directly by residents of each of the 50 states. How do the Communist-ruled countries in Asia choose their leaders? Of the six countries covered by Radio Free Asia, whose mission is to provide independent media to territories that lack it, four – China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam – were founded and organized on the Marxist-Leninist party-state model copied from the Soviet Union. Some countries call themselves 'democratic,' but in practice the people have little or no say in choosing their leaders or governments. NORTH KOREA The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was founded in 1948 by Kim Il Sung, who had been cultivated by Moscow as a Cold War ally in the northern half of Korea. North Korea describes itself as an 'independent socialist state' with universal and compulsory suffrage at 17, and holds elections for the Supreme People’s Assembly, the national legislature every four-to-five years, and for local People’s Assemblies every four years. In practice, each candidate is pre-selected by the North Korean government and voters are allowed to vote either 'yes' or 'no' in ballots that are not private. Nearly all elections report 100% support for the government. CHINA The People’s Republic of China, founded in 1949 by Mao Zedong, describes itself as a 'socialist democracy and a people’s democratic dictatorship.' Xi-era slogans describe it as 'socialist consultative democracy' and 'whole-process people’s democracy.' China has universal suffrage from age 18, with voting at five levels of People’s Congresses, from local townships to cities and provinces, to the parliamentary National People’s Congress. Higher-level Congresses are indirectly elected by delegates of lower-level Congresses. Technically not a one-party state, China has eight non-communist parties, including the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association and the China Association for Promoting Democracy. However, as the U.S.-based Freedom House notes, 'the CCP effectively monopolizes all political activity and does not permit meaningful political competition.' The noncommunist parties serve in an advisory role, 'but their activities are tightly circumscribed, and they must accept the CCP’s leadership as a condition for their existence.' VIETNAM The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, founded in 1975 after Ho Chi Minh’s Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) overthrew the U.S.-backed Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), likewise followed the Soviet template of one-party politics. Suffrage is universal at age 18, and direct elections are held for local People’s Councils and the National Assembly -- but all candidates are pre-approved by the ruling party. 'Vietnam is a one-party state, dominated for decades by the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam,' says Freedom House. 'Although some independent candidates are technically allowed to run in legislative elections, most are banned in practice.' In the May 2021 elections for 500 National Assembly seats, the Communist Party of Vietnam took 97.2% of the vote, while non-party candidates got 2.8%. The next election is in early 2026. LAOS In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, a Communist protégé of Vietnam also founded in 1975, 'is a one-party state in which the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party dominates all aspects of politics and harshly restricts civil liberties,' says Freedom House. Laos has universal suffrage, and its president, vice president, and prime minister are elected by the National Assembly. These elections, however, have been deemed not free or fair, and in the most recent 2021 poll, the ruling party took 158 of the body’s 164 seats, with the rest going to pre-approved independents. 'The electoral laws and framework are designed to ensure that the LPRP, the only legal party, dominates every election and controls the political system,' says Freedom House. CAMBODIA Radio Free Asia’s other target countries are Cambodia and Myanmar, more pluralistic states that have held competitive, if flawed elections. Cambodia has been holding elections since 1993, as mandated by the 1991 Paris Agreements, which ended the country’s civil war and mandated democratic elections under a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. In practice, however, Cambodia’s political system has been dominated by the Cambodian People’s Party and its leader Hun Sen. A strongman who violently refused to share power with coalition partners in the 1990s, Hun Sen ruled the country for more than three decades until handing power last year to his son, Hun Manet, but still wields great influence. 'While the country conducted semi-competitive elections in the past, polls are now held in a severely repressive environment,' says Freedom House, noting Hun Sen’s penchant for banning popular opposition parties. The July 2023 National Assembly elections, held just a month before Hun Manet took over from his father, were condemned by the United States, the European Union and the United Nations as neither free nor fair. MYANMAR In November 2020, the country formerly known as Burma emerged from only its third semi-competitive election since its independence in 1948, a vote that delivered a strong majority to the National League for Democracy, or NLD, of de facto national leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The multi-party election, which observers widely deemed credible despite flaws with conflict zone voting cancellations and registration, delivered 86 percent of the seats in the Assembly of the Union to Suu Kyi’s NLD, routing the army-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party. On Feb. 1, 2021, Myanmar’s military, citing baseless claims of election fraud, deposed State Counsellor Suu Kyi and President Win Myint in a coup d’etat, later jailing them. The junta annulled the results of the 2020 vote, and pledged to hold elections in 2023 – but has repeatedly delayed this and extended its emergency rule as the nation became more deeply embroiled in a civil war that has killed thousands and destroyed wide swathes of the country. The military regime has committed to holding a general election late next year, with voting to be staggered because of security concerns, but has continued to extend a state of emergency across the country and brought in tough new registration laws that disqualify many parties from standing. TIBET Chinese-run 'autonomous' regions such as Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang largely follow mainland practices. But Tibetans who followed the Dalai Lama when the spiritual leader fled into exile in India and other countries around the world in 1959, and their descendants, have been choosing their leaders. In 2021, Tibetans living outside of their China-ruled homeland held their third election since 2011, to seat a new political leader, or sikyong, for their India-based government-in-exile called the Central Tibetan Administration. Penpa Tsering won the CTA’s leadership in a vote among the Tibetan diaspora, a community of about 150,000 people living in 40 countries, mainly India, Nepal, Europe and North America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqGBvg9t5Ng9W	2024-11-04T15:41:41-08:00	
At UN, US Confronts Russia Over North Korean Troops For Ukraine	By Margaret Besheer Russia refused to confirm its plans for North Korean troops it reportedly plans to deploy in its fight against Ukraine, during a confrontation with the United States Monday at the U.N. Security Council. 'I heard the statement [of the Russian envoy], as did others in this room, but the one question still remains that that statement does not address, and that is whether there are DPRK troops on the ground in Russia,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood told council members, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name. 'And my question still stands, and I hope that the Russian Federation will answer that simple question,' he said. Wood was referring to intelligence indicating that an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia for training and deployment to fight alongside the Kremlin’s troops in Ukraine, with some of the North Koreans believed to be heading to Ukraine in the coming days. 'We're not in a court here, and the question of the United States, in the spirit of an interrogation, is not something I intend to answer,' said Russian Deputy Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva. U.S. officials estimate that more than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022. Russia, they say, is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. Ambassador Wood said the Russians have trained the North Koreans in artillery and drone operations, and basic infantry operations. 'The nature of the training Russia is providing to these forces, to include trench clearing, indicates Russia intends to use these forces in front line operations,' he said. South Korea’s envoy said Pyongyang is acting in a 'more desperate and dangerous' way recently, including the blowing up of rail and road links between the two neighbors. 'And now the desperate DPRK is demanding more sacrifices from its own people by dispatching troops to Russia,' said Ambassador JoonKook Hwang. William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA Monday that it is unclear how experienced and professional the North Korean troops are. 'And we don't know how they will react when faced in combat positions. They have not been basically in a war for a long time,' he said. 'So, whether the North Koreans have the ability and the equipment to maintain, to keep in the battlefield, is an open question.' Western nations have questioned what the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will get in return from Moscow for its troops. There are concerns it could include advanced military technology, possibly for its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs, in addition to economic or other support. 'North Korea could benefit politically or diplomatically,' Naoko Aoki, a political scientist at RAND Corporation told VOA. 'And this is a little bit more vague than the other more tangible support, but it is nevertheless important, because Russia, as it has been doing, can shield North Korea in the U.N. Security Council so that North Korea is not faced with further sanctions for its nuclear and missile development, for example, and also basically help [it] over the long run.' She said that would support the Kim regime’s goal of remaining in power and increasing its influence on the Korean Peninsula. On March 28, Moscow took one such step to shield Pyongyang, using its Security Council veto to shut down the panel that monitors implementation of the council’s sanctions on North Korea — sanctions that Russia previously voted for. Ballistic missile launch The Security Council met Monday to discuss Pyongyang’s October 30 missile launch of a solid fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 'The latest ICBM is estimated to have landed in the waters near Japan, around only 200 kilometers from the island of Hokkaido,' Japan’s ambassador, Yamazaki Kazuyuki told the council. 'This ICBM launch is more threatening than ever, as it reached a height of over 7,000 kilometers and a flight time of about 86 minutes — the highest and longest length trajectory of any missile that North Korea has launched to date.' He said its estimated range capability of 15,000 kilometers covers three quarters of the planet, making it the gravest threat yet from North Korea. North Korea’s ambassador dismissed the council’s meeting as 'unlawful' and interference in its domestic affairs. 'Like all strategic weapons tests we have conducted so far, the test launching of our ICBM Hwasong-19 this time, is a part of the exercise of the just and legitimate right to self-defense to reliably safeguard security of our state as well peace of the region involved,' said Ambassador Kim Song. Russia sides with North Korea 'The aim of convening a meeting is the same every time, to make yet another step towards demonizing the DPRK,' said Ambassador Evstigneeva. She blamed the United States for ratcheting up tension on the peninsula because of its recent military exercises with South Korea. South Korea’s ambassador questioned the timing of the latest launch and strongly condemned it. 'Its intention could be to distract the world's attention from its troops in Russia, demonstrate themselves as larger than life, or gain diplomatic leverage amid the U.S. presidential election,' said Ambassador Hwang. 'Regardless of the intention, it was clearly an attempt to advance its missile technology, which makes the launch another flagrant violation of multiple Security Council resolutions,' he said. VOA’s Kim Lewis contributed reporting for this story.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqN2XSO3H3KkE	2024-11-04T15:38:03-08:00	
Early Peace Plan Shows Russia’s Intent To Neutralize Ukraine – An...	By Yelizaveta Surnacheva and Systema (RFE/RL) -- Early in peace talks that began days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow proposed a treaty whose one-sided conditions amounted to Kyiv's surrender, according to a draft obtained by Systema, RFE/RL's Russian investigative unit. Acceptance of the proposal would have left Ukraine a neutral nation with a tiny, toothless army, no recourse to protection by NATO states, and no chance of regaining control over Crimea or the Donbas, where it would have had to recognize the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in their entirety, including the large portions still under Kyiv's control at the time. The proposed pact sheds light on Russian President Vladimir Putin's goals in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, none of which he has publicly renounced, and which he has repeatedly asserted will be achieved. It comes as the all-out war heads toward its fourth year with no clear sign of an end in sight but amid indications that peace talks could potentially be in the cards in 2025 or later. The draft -- titled Treaty On The Resolution Of The Situation In Ukraine And The Neutrality Of Ukraine -- is dated March 7, 2022, 11 days after Russia launched the invasion and a week after talks between Ukraine and Russia began.Composed in Moscow and handed to the Ukrainian delegation that day, at the third round of talks, in a town in the Belavezha forest in Belarus, it is the first known document laying out Russia's conditions for a peace deal after the start of the full-scale invasion. Systema obtained the draft from a Ukrainian source familiar with the negotiations, and a Russian source close to the talks confirmed its authenticity. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The talks began on February 28, 2022, at a time when Russian forces had seized swaths of territory in the south, east, and north of Ukraine, where they had advanced close to Kyiv after pouring across the border from Russia and Belarus. Some sessions were held in person, others online. The process petered out in late April of the same year, as the sides wrangled over major points of dispute and following revelations of atrocities committed by Russian soldiers in Bucha, a city outside Kyiv that the invading forces had abandoned as they withdrew from northern Ukraine after failing to capture the capital or force Ukraine's capitulation. 'Not Neutrality, But Neutralization' The Russian proposal sets out terms for Ukraine's neutrality, a status Kyiv appeared ready to accept at the time. But Eric Ciaramella, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that Putin seems to have been seeking 'something more radical -- not neutrality, but the neutralization of Ukraine as an independent state. Russia's goal from the very beginning was to destroy Ukraine's ability to defend itself.' A country 'can be neutral and have a very strong army and be capable of self-defense…. But that's not what Russia had in mind here,' he said. 'The document was structured as if Ukraine were the aggressor defeated on the battlefield, which, of course, did not reflect reality,' Ciaramella said of the Russian draft dated March 7, 2022, which he read at Systema's request. 'It's hard to say whether this was a genuine attempt to negotiate, as such terms would be unacceptable to any Ukrainian. They would have neutralized Ukraine to the point of making it defenseless.' The draft called for Ukraine to shrink its army to no more than 50,000 personnel, about five times fewer than it had in 2022, and would have barred Ukraine from developing or deploying missiles with a range of over 250 kilometers. Moscow would have been able to prohibit other types of weapons in the future. It also called for the removal of all sanctions imposed on Russia by Ukraine or the West since 2014, when Russia seized Crimea and fomented war in the Donbas. Ukraine would have been forced to formally recognize Crimea as Russian and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent. Kyiv would have had to pay for reconstruction in the Donbas. 'Deeply Erroneous Logic' The pact would have left a truncated Ukraine highly vulnerable, with Russian forces remaining in place and no way for Kyiv to defend itself or seek Western security support. Documents from later stages of the talks, including treaty drafts from March 17 and April 15 that were published by The New York Times earlier this year, show that the sides drew closer on some issues as the talks progressed -- and as Ukraine beat back Moscow's forces in the north. Crimea's status would have been left for future negotiations, for example, and Russian demands for changes in legislation involving languages and thorny historical disputes faded into the background. Crucially, the sides were discussing security guarantees for Ukraine that would include Western nations, though how they would work was a major bone of contention. However, Ciaramella suggested that in fundamental ways, little had changed. 'The versions discussed a few weeks later in Istanbul and at virtual sessions were still based on the deeply erroneous Russian logic that permeated the initial text,' he told Systema. 'Had the treaty been signed, its final form in April would have been merely a softer version of Ukrainian capitulation.' The subsequent drafts still included some of Russia's key demands, such as a permanent bar on NATO membership for Ukraine, something that neither Kyiv nor the Western alliance is prepared to accept. NATO has repeatedly said that Ukraine will eventually join, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been seeking a swift invitation as part of a 'victory plan' he has presented to Ukrainians and the country's backers abroad in recent weeks. In at least one way, meanwhile, Russia's stated conditions for peace have grown more aggressive than they were on March 7, 2022. In September of that year, Putin claimed that five Ukrainian regions – Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson -- were now inalienable parts of Russia. The baseless claim included the portions of those regions that remained, and still remain, in Kyiv's hands, and Putin has said that Russian control over those territories is a requirement for any peace negotiations.

India: Reviving Islamist Threat In Assam – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum Assam which for long had been threatened by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)-backed Islamist extremist groups, is once again facing renewed threats from such groupings – both operating out of Pakistani and Bangladeshi soil. Global Islamist terrorist formations also create security challenges. A majority of the Islamist militant groups in Assam were founded between 1990 and 1996 with the prime objective of safeguarding the ‘overall interests’ of the minority Muslim communities in the region. On October 5, 2024, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested 10 operatives of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) from the Goalpara and Hojai Districts of Assam, during a massive crackdown in the JeM conspiracy case. The arrests included Sheikh Sultan Salah Uddin Ayubi aka Ayubi, from Krishnai in Goalpara District. He was arrested for his role in conspiracy case RC-13/2024/NIA/DLI. During the operation, NIA seized several incriminating documents, electronic devices, pamphlets and magazines, and is examining further leads. The Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, explained that the arrests 'bring home' the reality that Islamist extremist groups are becoming a bigger menace in Assam, and that the state's indigenous population could face difficulties in the years to come if the extremist Islamist doctrine persists in Assam. According to partial data compiled by the South Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP), at least 14 operatives of different Islamist terrorist groups – JeM, 10; and Ansar-al-Islam (AaI)/Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) and Islamic State (IS), two each – have been arrested in 2024 (data till November 2, 2024). In the corresponding period of 2023, at least 11 such operatives – Popular Front of India (PFI) and ABT, five each; and one (group not identified) – were arrested. Details of the remaining arrests in 2024, apart from the incident of October 5, are given below: May 13: Assam Police arrested two operatives of the AaI – Bahar Mia (30) and Rasel Mia (40), both residents of Bangladesh – from Guwahati in the Kamrup (Metro) District of Assam. The duo was illegally staying in India without passports, had obtained Indian documents through fraudulent means, and was working to spread a terrorist network in Assam and India. March 20: The Assam Police’s Special Task Force (STF) arrested two high-ranking leaders of IS, Haris Farooqi aka Harish Ajmal Farukhi and Anurag Singh aka Rehan, in an operation in the Dharmasala area of Dhubri District in Assam. They were arrested after they entered Assam from Bangladesh. Farooqi, identified as the ‘head’ of IS in India, and Singh, his associate, were planning sabotage activities after entering India. Both were involved in recruitment, terrorist funding, and plotting attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and face charges from NIA, Delhi and Lucknow Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), and other agencies. Over the past several years, transborder Islamist terrorist groups, mainly based in Bangladesh, including Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and AaI, have been trying to establish their bases in Assam. On March 4, 2022, the Special Branch of the Assam Police arrested five people, including a Bangladesh national, Saiful Islam aka Haroon Rashid aka Mohammed Suman, for their alleged links with AaI. They were arrested from Barpeta, Howly and Kalgachia, all in Barpeta District. Saiful Islam had illegally entered India and was working as a teacher in the Dhakalipara masjid. Saiful Islam had successfully indoctrinated and motivated the four others to join the module, with a view to developing the Barpeta District of Assam as a base for jihadi activities of Al-Qaeda and its related organisations. Chief Minister Sarma had then disclosed that the militants of AaI modules arrested in the state in 2022 were using sophisticated peer-to-peer encrypted chat apps for communication. Further, he had also disclosed that during the Coronovairus-19 (Covid-19) years the AaI modules were training cadres in bomb making in Barpeta District. He had added that Assam had become a 'hotbed for jihadi activities'. Similarly, NIA arrested two operatives of the AaI module in Barpeta District, Akbar Ali and Abul Kalam Azad, on April 5, 2023, and filed a charge sheet against them on August 29, 2023, for conspiring and plotting to execute terrorist activities. NIA said that the radicalisation and mobilisation of Muslims were done through the module’s Bangladeshi handlers – Zakir and Mehboor Rahman. Islamist radical group PFI, which the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) pronounced an 'unlawful association' on September 28, 2022 for conspiring to establish Islamic rule in India by 2047, with its main roots in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka, has also paved its way into Assam. However, there were no PFI-linked arrests in 2024, though three incidents of arrest linked to the group were recorded in 2023: May 17: Assam Police arrested one PFI operative, Abdul Razzaq Ali, from the Nagarbera area of Kamrup District. April 23: Two PFI operatives, Saiful Islam and Shafiqul Islam, were arrested from the Dhubri District of Assam. The arrested operatives taught in a madrasa(Islamic Seminary), Al-Jamiatul Asia Lil Banat Panbari, of Dhubri. April 8: Two PFI operatives, Zakir Hussain and Samad Ahmed, were arrested along with one operative of the group’s student wing, Campus Front of India (CFI), Jahidul Islam Mirdha, from the Barpeta Railway Station area in Barpeta District. Zakir Hussain served as the ‘secretary’ of the Assam state committee of PFI, while Samad Ahmed was the ‘president’ of the PFI Assam State Committee, and Jahidul Islam was the ‘president’ of the CFI Assam Committee. Further, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati student, Touseef Ali Farooqui (20) – in the 4th-year at the Bioscience – was arrested on March 23, 2024, in Kamrup District, while trying to leave the country in an attempt to join IS. With the arrests of operatives from various terrorist groups, such as JeM, AaI, IS, AQIS, and PFI, it is evident that Islamist radicalisation has found some foothold in Assam. In a press release dated October 5, 2024, on the arrest of JeM operatives, the NIA observed, 'The suspects were engaged in radicalising individuals associated with JeM, and were engaged in disseminating terrorist-related propaganda, and radicalising and recruiting youth into the Jamaat outfit inspired by JeM. These suspects were involved in motivating youth into committing violent terror attacks across India.' An NIA official also informed The Assam Tribune on October 26, 2024, that terrorist groups had been using digital or online social media platforms to recruit and radicalise young people from Assam. These tactics are comparable to those used by Islamist terrorist groups based in Pakistan, as well as Khalistani groups. In this regard, an unnamed senior intelligence officer observed, 'With the inroads and improvement of information technology, terrorist outfits do not have to send their own people to India, but they can induct youths into their fold by sitting thousands of miles away.' According to official inputs, radical Islamist terrorist groups have likely increased their recruitment efforts in the aftermath of the August 5, 2024, coup and the subsequent chaos in Bangladesh. Indian intelligence agencies have reported that the Bangladesh-based terrorist group AaI may try to establish a presence in Assam and West Bengal. Reports indicate that a prominent AaI leader, Abdullah Talah, was working to spread AaI influence in northeastern India. Moreover, Jashimuddin Rahmani, another prominent AaI leader was released by the interim government of Bangladesh at a time when AaI has been attempting to create a jihadi network with the aid of sleeper cells, especially in Assam and Tripura in India. As SAIR noted earlier, a majority of the Islamist extremist and terrorist groups in Assam were founded between 1990 and 1996, with the prime objective of safeguarding the ‘overall interests’ of the minority Muslim communities in the region. According to SATP, at least 20 Islamist terrorist formations have operated in Assam at different periods. Meanwhile, the surge in infiltration attempts by Bangladeshi nationals and Rohingyas into Assam, after the coup in Bangladesh, also creates additional potential risks. Chief Minister Sarma tweeted in October that around 130 individuals, who were attempting to enter Assam illegally from Bangladesh in the preceding two months, following the political turmoil that erupted in Bangladesh, had been intercepted by the Assam Police. In a video message on his social media platforms, Sarma announced that the process of establishing 12 Border Outposts in proximity to the Indo-Bangla border was underway to bolster coordination with the Central agencies. The attempt to re-establish Islamist terrorist groups’ bases in Assam and the demographic infiltration by foreign elements, particularly those from Bangladesh, have raised renewed concerns about security in Assam in particular, and northeastern India at large.

Bangladesh: JeI’s Political Reinvention – Analysis	By Sanchita Bhattacharya Since the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina's government on August 5, 2024, the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) is back to the political forefront in Bangladesh, trying to expand its own area of influence and weigh its political options within the current chaos and instability. On October 28, 2024, at a JeI protest rally at the Public Library ground against the 'Logi-Boitha' (Boat-hook and Oar) Movement by the Awami League on October 28, 2006, on which day six members of JeI were killed in broad daylight, council member Mahbubur Rahman Belal pledged to establish a 'model Islamic society' in honour of the 'martyrs' sacrifices'. Belal stated, 'The fascist Awami League murderers established a demonic reign by killing thousands of Islam-loving people. Almighty Allah has broken their all prides by sending them abroad through the student-people mass upsurge…That case has to be revived again. Murderer Sheikh Hasina must be brought to justice and be given appropriate punishment. ' On October 24, 2024, JeI’s chief Shafiqur Rahman announced at a meeting of the central working committee that Selim Uddin had been elected chief of JeI Dhaka City north unit for the 2025-2026 session. On October 23, 2024, JeI filed a review petition with the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in order to turn down its 2011 verdict that scrapped the non-party caretaker government system. JeI’s secretary general Miah Golam Porwar submitted the petition through his lawyer Mohammad Shishir Manir seeking necessary directives to reinstate the system. On October 13, 2024, after 19 years, the Dhaka City north unit of JeI held a public conference called ‘Rukun Sammelan’ at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Center in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka, to elect its next chief, with over 10,000 Rukun (party members) voting through secret ballots. During this conference, JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman called for the trial of the Awami League under laws that were enacted during the rule of the AL regime, stating that justice must be established as soon as possible to ensure that they [Awami League] get what they truly deserve. JeI got a new lease on life when, on August 28, 2024, the Interim Government led by Muhammad Yunus lifted the ban on the group and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS). Under the powers provided in Section 18 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 2009, the Interim Government cancelled the previous circular that banned JeI-ICS. The Home Ministry issued a notification in this regard. The gazette notification read, 'Since there is no concrete evidence of involvement of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and its student organization Islami Chhatra Shibir in terrorism and violence… and since the Government believes that Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and all its affiliates, including its student body Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir, are not involved in terrorist activities.' Earlier, on August 1, 2024, the previous Awami League-led government had banned JeI, ICS, and all of their associated organisations as political entities under the Anti-Terrorism Act 2009, following nationwide unrest, citing the threat posed by the fundamentalist party to public security. According to partial data collated by South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), since the year 2000, 285 persons, including 112 civilians, 6 Security Force (SF) personnel, and 167 JeI/ICS cadres have been killed in 199 incidents of JeI-ICS linked violence (data till November 2, 2024). JeI was formed in undivided India on August 26, 1941, in Lahore's Islamia Park by its first Ameer (chief) Maulana Abul A'la Maududi, with the goal of developing an Islamic community of devout believers. After India's Partition in 1947, the party was divided into Jamat-e-Islami Hind and Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan. JeI started its activities in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) during the 1950s. The Jamaat had also been banned on two earlier occasions, in 1959 and 1964, in Pakistan (prior to the creation of Bangladesh), for its communal role. During the Bangladesh liberation struggle, JeI in East Pakistan joined forces with the Pakistan Army to participate in the genocide of an estimated three million civilians, and a range of brutal crimes, including the widespread use of rape as a weapon. Jamaat has never regretted or offered apology for its role in 1971. In independent Bangladesh, JeI resumed overt activities in 1979. Between 1981 and 1987, the number of full members of JeI rose from 650 to 2,000, while associate membership doubled to approximately two million. The rising popularity of the organization renewed its political ambitions. The party played a crucial role in Governments formed by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1991 and 2001. The JeI had 18 seats in the Jatiyo Shangshad(Bangladesh Parliament) of 1991 and 17 seats in 2001. In 1996, it had three seats. In the General Elections of 2008, it secured five seats. After the Awami League came to power in 2009, the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) was established to try those accused of war crimes. The War Crimes (WC) Trials, which began on March 25, 2010, have so far indicted 50 members of JeI. Prominent leaders of Jamaat were convicted and hanged, including JeI politician Abdul Quader Mollah (hanged in 2013), Ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami (hanged in 2016) and secretary general Ali Ahsan Mujaheed (hanged in 2015). Ghulam Azam was sentenced to 90 years in prison, while Delawar Hossain Sayedee’s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Both died while serving jail terms. Yet, it appears, the Jamaat has been thriving. As reported in June, 2023, in 2008, the number of the party's permanent members or Rukun was 23,863. That figure now stands at 73,046, a threefold rise. The Islamist party has also recorded a threefold rise in the number of its activists, which has leapt to 6.39 lakh from 2.21 lakh during the same period. Additionally, there has been a nearly fivefold rise in the party's women Rukun, and a fourfold rise in women activists. Similarly, the number of associate members has now grown to 22.9 million from 10.3 million in 2008. As expected, along with Jamaat, ICS is also demonstrating its ‘presence’ since Sheikh Hasina’s ouster from power. On October 29, ICS announced its Jahangirnagar University (JU) committee, in a statement on its Facebook page. The names of the committee’s president Harunur Rashid Rafi, secretary Mohibur Rahman Mohib, and publicity secretary Abdullah Al Mamun Saki were declared. On October 28, a Facebook post by ICS revealed that it had 2,200 active members in the Islami University in Kushtia. The post identified ICS’s university unit president HM Abu Musa and general secretary Mahmudul, as having held their posts since January 1, 2024. On October 3, ICS’s Dhaka University (DU) unit declared its full 14-member DU committee. According to the announcement made on Facebook, Mohammad Abu Shadik Kayem was appointed president, with SM Farhad serving as the general secretary. Further, on October 23, a Rangpur Court acquitted 41 JeI-ICS leaders and activists, in a case filed under the Speedy Trial Act-2002, 11 years ago. Judge Zulkan Nahim of the Rangpur Senior Judicial Magistrate Court-1 passed the order acquitting all the accused leaders and activists of Jamaat and Shibir. The case was filed for creating chaos and vandalism on February 18, 2013. The Jamaat has also been trying to extend its outreach to other countries in order to expand its organisational base, mobilise new members and raise funds. In 2022, JeI sent letters to different Muslim countries and Islamic organisations abroad, describing its current political situation in Bangladesh and branding the then Awami League government ‘anti-Islam’. The organisation wrote to the Chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood on December 8, 2022; the Malaysian Prime Minister on November 24, 2022; the Chairman of The Welfare Party of Turkey on November 6, 2022; the President of The Felicity Party of Turkey on October 24, 2022; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on October 17, 2022 and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on September 30, 2022. Since, August 5, 2024, representatives of many countries have tried to reach out to Jamaat to discuss the future course of politics in Bangladesh. On October 21, JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman met with the Ambassadors of Denmark and Sweden, Christian Brax Møller and Nicholas Weeks, along with Norway's Deputy Head of Mission Marian Rabe Navelsrud. According to JeI’s press release, the meeting discussed Bangladesh's interests, particularly its democracy and electoral system. The ambassadors shared their experiences with the numerical proportional election system used in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, offering suggestions on implementing a similar system in Bangladesh. On October 14, Acting High Commissioner Nardia Simpson, Australian High Commission Bangladesh, met JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman to discuss Australia's views on building strong institutions to ensure the protection and fulfilment of human rights. Shafiqur disclosed that they discussed how to advance relations with 'mutual respect and love,' and described the meeting as 'very friendly and successful.' Earlier, on September 2, 2024, Chinese Ambassador to Dhaka Yao Wen held a meeting with Jamaat’s chief Shafiqur Rahman at the party’s central office in Dhaka. The two talked about political changes in Bangladesh and promised closer co-operation between the people and governments of both the countries. Under the current political scenario of Bangladesh, JeI-ICS are here to stay, thrive and assert their radical political ambition. The future of Bangladesh is likely to substantially be dictated by the radical ideology of JeI-ICS cohort, as democratic and liberal voices are systematically silenced in the country.

Saudi Arabia And Iraq Sign MoU On Military Cooperation	Saudi Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman and his Iraqi counterpart Thabet Al-Abbasi signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday aimed at strengthening cooperation in the military field.

Pentagon Says 10K North Korean Troops In Kursk Oblast	By Jim Garamone There are 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk Oblast, and the Pentagon press secretary said if they enter combat, they are legitimate targets for Ukrainian soldiers. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder also said officials estimate there are now 11,000 to 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia. 'We've seen the press reports about alleged [North Korean] combat ops, and we're looking into those,' Ryder told reporters during a news conference. 'At this point, we cannot corroborate those reports. But as you heard [Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III] say last week, should these troops engage in combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets.' The North Korean troops entered Russia last month, and Russian troops are training those forces in infantry tactics, operating with unmanned aerial vehicles, artillery tactics, trench-clearing and the like, officials said. 'All indications are that they will provide some type of combat or combat support capability,' the general said. 'We would fully expect that the Ukrainians would do what they need to do to defend themselves and their personnel.' The Russians have provided the North Korean troops with Russian uniforms and equipment. 'We'll see exactly how these forces are integrated into Russian operations, and how they're committed to the battlefield, assuming that they are replacements for Russian forces,' he said. Ryder pointed to Austin's remarks last week discussing the large number of casualties Russian forces are suffering. The North Korean forces could be coming in 'to replace the massive losses that Russia is experiencing. I think that is probably a fair assessment, and I certainly would not want to be a North Korean soldier there.' Ryder also discussed the deployment of additional U.S. forces to the Central Command region. Austin ordered additional ballistic missile defense destroyers, fighter squadrons, tanker aircraft and several B-52 long-range strike bombers to the area. The B-52 bombers have already arrived in the region with the other forces expected in the days and weeks to come. 'These forces will begin to arrive as the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group prepares to depart,' Ryder said. 'These deployments are in keeping with our commitments to the protection of U.S. citizens and forces in the Middle East, the defense of Israel and de-escalation through deterrence and diplomacy.' These forces join other U.S. assets such as the terminal high-altitude area missile defense system, which has deployed to Israel, as well as an amphibious ready group, and a Marine Expeditionary Unit. These forces 'demonstrate the flexible nature of U.S. global defense posture and U.S. capability to deploy worldwide on short notice to meet evolving national security threats,' Ryder said. 'Secretary Austin continues to make clear that should Iran, its partners or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqBb3CZfNdiFE	2024-11-04T15:28:50-08:00	
Israel’s Campaign Against UNRWA Precedes Oct. 7 – OpEd	The Israeli Knesset last week adopted two bills that will effectively ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, from carrying out any activity in Israel and the Occupied Territories. Simply put, the decision is catastrophic, because UNRWA is the main international body responsible for the welfare of millions of Palestinians throughout the Occupied Territories and much of the region. Israel followed up its decision by attacking and damaging an UNRWA office in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank. This was the Israeli government’s way of demonstrating its seriousness regarding the matter. This is not the first time that Israel has pursued an anti-UNRWA agenda and, contrary to claims by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, the decision is not linked to the current genocidal war on Gaza or the unfounded claims that UNRWA supports 'terrorism.' An independent review commissioned by the UN in April revealedthat Israel 'made public claims that a significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations,' but that it 'has yet to provide supporting evidence of this.' However, Israel’s claims did a great deal of damage to the organization, as 13 countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, the UK, Germany and Italy, withheld badly needed funds that were helping Gaza stave off a horrific famine. Eventually, most of these countries reinstated their financial support, though without apologizing to the Palestinians who were adversely impacted by their unfair initial decisions. Unrepentant, Israel continued to unleash its relentless war on the organization. 'UNRWA workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable,' Netanyahu said in a statement last week. The anti-UNRWA rhetoric remains functional for Israel. Amplified by the ever-willing US mainstream media, Israel has managed to keep UNRWA’s name in the news, always associating it with 'supporting terrorism.' So, when the Knesset voted for the anti-UNRWA bills, many media outlets conveyed the news as if it was the only rational conclusion to an essentially fabricated story. Israel’s problem with UNRWA has little to do with the organization itself, but with its underlying political representation as a UN entity whose mission is predicated on providing 'assistance and protection to Palestine refugees.' UNRWA was established in 1949 by UN General Assembly Resolution 302 (IV). It began its operations on May 1, 1950, and, with time, it became central to the survival of a large number of Palestinian refugee communities in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. Many have rightly criticized the UN for failing to supplement UNRWA’s humanitarian mandate with a political equivalent that would ultimately help Palestinians achieve their right of return in accordance with UN Resolution 194. For Israel, however, UNRWA remained problematic. According to Tel Aviv’s thinking, UNRWA’s existence is a constant reminder that there is a distinct group of people called Palestinian refugees. And though UNRWA is not a political organization, the Palestinian refugee crisis and all related UN resolutions that emphasize the 'inalienable' rights of these refugees are very political. Taking advantage of the initial, albeit brief, sympathy with Israel worldwide and the massive campaign of misinformation emanating from Israel and its allies, Netanyahu used the Oct. 7 attacks as an opportunity to further demonize UNRWA. However, his campaign started much earlier. One key player in the war on UNRWA has been Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of former US President Donald Trump. Kushner, who invested much time in helping Israel, made UNRWA a key point in his plan. He vowed to carry out a 'sincere effort to disrupt' the work of the organization, a leaked 2018 email revealed. Due to international rejection and solidarity, Kushner ultimately failed. Even the withholding of funds by the US administration did not force the organization to shut down, although it did negatively impact the lives of millions of Palestinians. The ongoing war on Gaza and the push to annex large parts of the West Bank represented a golden opportunity for Netanyahu and his extremist government to increase the pressure on UNRWA. They have been enabled by unconditional US support and the willingness of various Western governments to recklessly act upon Israel’s false claims regarding the UN organization. By allowing Israel to delegitimize the very organization responsible for enforcing international law, the UN’s crisis becomes much deeper. An impassioned plea made by UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese last week reflected the frustration felt by many UN-affiliated officials regarding the growing irrelevance of the organization. In a speech, Albanese pointed out that, if the UN’s failures continue, it will become 'more and more irrelevant to the rest of the world,' especially during these times of turmoil. This irrelevance is already being felt by millions of Palestinians, mainly in Gaza but also in the West Bank. Though Palestinians continue to withstand and reject and resist Israeli aggression, they are fed up with an international system that seems to offer them only words and little action. Israel’s banning of UNRWA should represent an opportunity for those concerned about the standing of the UN to remind Israel that member states that have no respect for international law deserve to be delegitimized. This time, words must be accompanied by action. Nothing else will suffice.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqNyVu7n0dbzF	2024-11-04T15:24:52-08:00	
Sacred Artifact Dispute Reveals Japan-Korea Tensions – OpEd	By Cristian Martini Grimaldi (UCA News) -- Long-standing tensions between Japan and South Korea have reached a symbolic peak over a Buddhist statue stolen from Kannonji Temple on the Japanese island of Tsushima and transported to South Korea in 2012. This is despite South Korea’s Supreme Court recently ruling in favor of its return. Though a small group of individuals stole the statue, its fate has become a broader reflection of unresolved tensions that echo historical grievances dating back to Japan’s occupation of the Korean Peninsula. Even though both governments formally signed a UNESCO convention mandating the return of the stolen cultural property, the South Korean government’s inaction has reignited the complex debate surrounding anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea. The Buddhist statue at the center of this controversy, the 'Seated Statue of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva,' holds a special place in Japan as a designated cultural property of Nagasaki Prefecture. It was stolen by a South Korean group in 2012, marking one of many artifacts removed from Japanese temples by South Korean thieves during a time when Tsushima’s temples and shrines were under repeated assault. This theft wave led to intense anti-theft security measures across the island and fueled frustration among the Japanese population. Korean authorities recovered the religious artifact in early 2013, but Buseoksa Temple in South Korea claimed ownership, arguing that the statue had been initially looted by Japanese pirates centuries ago. In response, Kannonji Temple stated that it had acquired the statue legally during the Joseon Period to protect it from frequent iconoclasm. This position holds historical support given the extensive records of Korean iconoclastic acts in temples at that time. The dispute over the statue, therefore, represents not just a question of ownership but an ongoing struggle over the memory of Japan’s occupation of Korea and how history is perceived on both sides of the East Sea. This is far from the only point of contention between Japan and South Korea, as recent years have seen multiple diplomatic and economic disputes that underscore the fragility of their relationship: For instance, South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered Japanese companies to pay reparations to Korean laborers forced to work during World War II, a ruling Japan strongly opposed. Japan argues that all reparation issues were settled in a 1965 treaty, but many in Korea see this as insufficient acknowledgment of historical wrongs. And of course, in 2019, Japan placed export restrictions on materials vital to South Korea’s technology sector, officially citing security concerns. South Korea interpreted this as retaliation for the forced labor compensation rulings, resulting in a trade dispute that impacted high-tech industries in both countries. And the most internationally known case of comfort women. South Korea has long demanded a more formal apology and compensation for the Korean women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during the occupation. While Japan has offered apologies and financial support over the years, South Korean public sentiment is that Japan’s remorse is thus incomplete. The topic often arises on anniversaries and at international forums, fueling resentment on both sides. Let’s not forget the territorial disputes over the Dokdo/Takeshima Islands. Both countries claim sovereignty over the Dokdo (in Korean) or Takeshima (in Japanese) Islands, which are located in the Sea of Japan. This territorial dispute is another recurring issue that stirs up strong emotions, with both sides staging protests and diplomatic statements asserting their claims. The recent resistance from South Korea to returning the stolen Buddhist statue demonstrates that its national identity is still fueled by lingering resentment toward Japan. This unwillingness to fully reconcile reflects a societal perspective in which Japan’s occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 remains a defining trauma. For many South Koreans, Japan’s actions during the occupation are not merely historical facts but a reminder of a brutal period that shaped the nation’s modern identity. South Korea’s national ethos continues to be influenced by historical remembrance, which, in some ways, also shapes the political landscape. Political leaders in South Korea occasionally evoke anti-Japanese sentiment to rally public support or to divert attention from internal challenges, a tactic that has successfully resonated due to the ingrained historical narratives. The question of returning the Buddhist statue may seem like a small diplomatic matter, but it highlights the broader, unresolved issues between Japan and South Korea. While both nations are allies of the United States and share common concerns over regional security, including the threat from North Korea, their strained relations often limit real effective cooperation. In the end, the fate of the Buddhist statue remains a powerful symbol of a fractured history that, even in modern times, still holds sway over both nations’ political and cultural landscapes. The broader question is whether Japan and South Korea can move beyond symbolic disputes to focus on a future that acknowledges but is not overshadowed by their shared past. *The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official editorial position of UCA News.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqEP4yrQaDPjO	2024-11-04T15:23:30-08:00	
Lying, Sitting Or All-Fours Position?	Whether lying on their back, all-fours position, sitting upright or squatting - women adopt different birthing positions during childbirth. What has not yet been researched is how the respective final birthing position affects the satisfaction of the woman giving birth. Researchers from the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), the University of Bonn and the University of Cologne have now investigated precisely this. In particular, they also took into account whether the choice of birthing position was voluntary. The results showed that it was precisely when this was chosen voluntarily that women were more satisfied. Around three quarters of those surveyed were lying during the birth and were particularly dissatisfied if they felt that they had not made this choice themselves. However, if the expectant mothers had chosen the supine or lateral supine position themselves, the position actually tended to make them more satisfied. The study has now been published in the journal 'Archives of Gynecology'. For a long time, the supine position was the most common birth position in Western countries - this gave obstetricians unhindered access to the woman and child. In various cultures, however, upright birthing positions, such as sitting or squatting, are also widespread. Which position is best for expectant mothers and the unborn child is controversial in the literature. 'Until today, international guidelines usually only recommend that women should adopt their preferred birthing position,' explains Prof. Dr. Nadine Scholten, who recently became head of the UKB's Research Unit for Health Communication and Health Services Research and holds a professorship in psychosomatic and psycho-oncological health services research at the University of Bonn. With regard to birthing positions, the German guideline also states that women should adopt the position that seems most comfortable to them. However, they should also be encouraged to adopt an upright position in the final phase of birth. 'In reality, whether they ultimately lie, sit or squat depends on the wishes of the expectant mothers themselves, but also on the suggestions of the midwives, obstetricians and sometimes necessary medical measures,' explains Prof. Dr. Brigitte Strizek, Director of the Clinic for Obstetrics and Prenatal Medicine at the UKB. Focus on women's satisfaction A team led by first and corresponding author Prof. Scholten, who carried out the study at the Institute for Medical Sociology, Health Services Research and Rehabilitation Research (IMVR) at the University of Cologne and the UKB, wanted to find out which birthing position women were most satisfied with afterwards. Almost 800 mothers were asked about their final birthing position and how satisfied they were with the birth overall using an anonymous questionnaire. All of the data analyzed here was from women who had given birth vaginally in a hospital without the use of a vacuum extraction or forceps, and who had given birth eight to twelve months previously at the time of the survey. In their study, the researchers also asked about the satisfaction of the mothers - depending on whether the birth position was freely chosen or not. The reasons for not choosing a free position were also asked. It was found that over three quarters of mothers gave birth to their child lying on their side or on their back. Of these women, up to 40 percent stated that they had not chosen the birth position voluntarily. 'The most common reason given by respondents was instructions from medical staff,' explains Prof. Scholten. The most common position assigned by obstetricians was the supine position. It was striking that women were more satisfied with their birth if they were allowed to choose the position voluntarily - especially if they chose the supine position themselves. Women who were not free to choose their birthing position were particularly dissatisfied if the medical staff specified this and not the CTG to record the heart rate of the unborn child and labor activity or the epidural, the anesthetic to relieve pain, prevented the desired position. Self-determination not always given in the delivery room 'The number of women who did not choose the birth position themselves is particularly striking, as is the associated lower level of satisfaction with the birth,' summarizes co-author Prof. Strizek. However, the team cannot confirm whether an increased voluntary choice of birth position in the future would result in fewer women giving birth in the supine position. 'In order to increase women's subjective satisfaction with their birth experience, they should be given the opportunity to adopt their preferred position,' appeals lead author Prof. Scholten. 'The first step is to increase the awareness of medical staff and empower women to understand and better communicate their preferences.' Prof. Strizek adds: 'If a certain position would be advantageous for the woman giving birth from a medical point of view, we as obstetric teams need to explain this better to the women so that they rarely have the feeling that they have not determined the birth position themselves.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLCd0xeJdGqCOmzdtD1u__	2024-11-04T15:21:44-08:00	
Spain: Crowds Throw Mud, Insults At King On Visit To Flood-Hit Va...	By Fernando Heller (EurActiv) -- Spain’s King Felipe VI was met with hostility from residents on Sunday (3 November) as he visited Paiporta, one of the hardest-hit towns in the Valencia region, where frustration is mounting over delays in weather warnings and emergency response following last week’s devastating floods. At the moment of writing, the storm caused devastating floods that have killed more than 217 people, with many more feared missing. At least 62 people died in Paiporta, a suburb of the city of Valencia, RTVE reported. The king and Queen Letizia, accompanied by Spain’s Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, and Valencia’s regional President, Carlos Mazón, toured the flood-hit town where rescue and cleanup efforts were underway. Teams continued to search for missing people while clearing mud and water from homes. Online footage captured scenes of angry crowds booing, shouting insults, and hurling mud at the King’s entourage as they moved through Paiporta’s streets. Shouts of 'murderers,' 'shame,' and 'get out' could be heard in the footage, while a young man was seen accusing the King of a 'disgraceful' response to the disaster, EFE reported. Though Queen Letizia, the Prime Minister, and the regional president were later evacuated, the King reportedly stayed behind to continue speaking with residents affected by the tragedy. This disaster marks Spain’s deadliest flood in over a century. The floods sparked outrage over delays with weather warnings and the perceived slow emergency response time by authorities. Sánchez announced on Saturday that he had ordered 10,000 additional police officers and soldiers to assist with the rescue work. 'It is time to put all our efforts into the colossal task ahead. We have only one enemy to fight: the destruction caused by the catastrophe. We have to give it our all. And we have to do it together. Together,' the Spanish PM said Saturday. Nearly a week after the disaster struck, weather warnings for severe rain and thunderstorms remained in effect for much of Spain’s east coast.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSv_IMdCVDzTh	2024-11-03T17:28:03-08:00	
Fighting Ideologies: Lessons Learned From The War On Terror And T...	By Heather S. Gregg Introduction (FPRI) -- The United States along with its allies and partners devoted critical time and energy to countering the ideology of al Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) as part of a comprehensive strategy to defeat these groups in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). These ideologies, which were part of a larger interpretation of Islam called Jihadi Salafism, formed a critical warfighting capability for these terrorist groups that explained what was wrong with the world and who was to blame for it, an ideal state for how the world ought to be, and how to get there. Today, the United States and its allies face threats posed by strategic state competitors, especially Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. While considerable focus has been placed on these countries’ military capabilities, including their nuclear ambitions, considerably less attention has been paid to understanding and fighting their ideologies. As with AQ, ISIS, and other Salafi Jihadis, ideology plays a critical role in the warfighting capabilities of our strategic competitors, and we should be actively taking measures to undermine their ideology. Some (but not all) of the lessons learned from countering Jihadi Salafism have application to today’s fight against our strategic adversaries. Most importantly, we need to understand ideology as a warfighting capability and consider how our actions uphold or undermine these ideologies. Additionally, we need to fight both the military capacity and the ideology of our adversaries in a synergistic way where both are undermined simultaneously. And, while doing this, we need to be careful of increased apocalypticism in our adversaries’ ideologies, which could signal a willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. Ideology as a Warfighting Capability It is important to first understand the critical role that ideology plays in conflict of any shape and size. Ideologies are an important warfighting capability because they offer an overarching narrative that explains the current state of the world we live in, who is to blame for the suffering and injustice people face, and why violence is needed to right these wrongs. Ideologies perform several important functions in times of prolonged conflict. First, they encourage recruitment and retention of those supporting the fight; in fact, one could argue that since the birth of the levée en masse, ideologies have been necessary for encouraging recruitment of mass armies and sustaining their numbers. This is also true of creating and sustaining a fighting force for nonstate actors. Second, ideologies provide leaders and followers with a 'cause' that they can point back to during military setbacks and provide hope that the fight is not in vain. Powerful ideologies also situate setbacks within a wider context of victory, which may not happen in this lifetime, but will occur. The most powerful ideologies explain failures and setbacks as actual successes in the grand scenario and a better world for which individuals and groups are fighting. When considering ideology as a warfighting capability, one useful definition includes three subparts: a critique for how the world currently is, a set of beliefs for how the world ought to be, and a course of action for realizing that world. Each of these subcomponents provides opportunities to both understand the messaging of the adversary and create possible countermeasures to their worldview. Critique of the current world Critiquing the current state of the world is arguably the most important component of an ideology because it identifies the problem, explains how things came to be this way, and assigns blame for the situation people find themselves in. Critically, assigning blame also offers a target to channel one’s outrage and to begin to address the problem. The critique, in other words, draws the battle lines between 'us' and 'them' and explains who needs to be targeted and why. This part of an ideology, if constructed well, should be able to sustain minor setbacks to the war and be broad enough to absorb specific inconsistencies in facts and circumstances. It should be able to draw the widest number of supporters within the population it seeks to mobilize. As counterinsurgency expert David Galula famously noted in Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice, it is easier to get people to agree to be against something than to be for something. Most powerful ideologies, therefore, provide details on the problem but are more abstract on the solution (see below). Finally, powerful ideologies do a good job explaining the problem with history, culture, identity, religion, and other tools that personalize and emotionalize the struggle. The threat is not some distant, abstract problem, but it is here and now, and deeply personal. It requires both an individual and a collective response to defeat the threat. How the world ought to be As stated above, powerful ideologies provide more detail on their critique of the world, including especially who is to blame, than on the solution. Typically, a description of how the world ought to be is aspirational; it is light on details because specifics can divide people and therefore undermine active and passive support. The Islamic State, the Caliphate, the Worker’s Utopia, the Empire of the Sun, the Reich: these are all examples of ideal states that, while thin on details of the end state they were seeking, drew broad support from their target populations. The course of action The course of action in an ideology, like the solution, is usually broad and philosophical. It is more abstract than a specific strategy for what to do. Three approaches are particularly important for the types of political ideologies we face today: violent (including but not limited to the use of terrorism), nonviolent, and apocalyptic, which calls for the figurative destruction of the world as we know it with the hope of ushering in a new, better world in its place (the solution). Examples of each of these courses of action abound. Karl Marx’s articulation of the communist revolutionargued that the capitalist system could only be changed through violence; the system and the people that upheld it had to be destroyed by force rather than reformed. Mahatma Gandhi stated the only way to end colonialization in India was through non-violent activism against the British; this was the philosophical underpinning of the 'Quit India' movement. One strain of White supremacism aims to foment a racial holy war 'RAHOWA' with the goal of ridding the world of people of color, who bear the stain of the sins of Cain, and to usher in a new, better, racially pure world in its place. It is important to note that broad ideologies can support different courses of action to arrive at how the world ought to be. Salafism, as an ideological interpretation of Islam, supports a peaceful movement and a political approach, as well as a violent incarnation. These different approaches to realizing their ideal state provide opportunities for countermeasures that can exploit these ideological disagreements. Salafi Jihadi Ideology of AQ and ISIS Salafism is not a new ideology. Most scholars trace this interpretation of Islam back to the 19th century and include ideologues such as the Saudi ‘Abd al-Wahhāb and Egyptian scholar Sayyid Qutb. Salafism as an ideology offers a compelling critique of the current state of the world, claiming that society is in rapid decline, which is evident by the number of wars, social unrest, moral decay, and overall suffering in the world. One strain of Salafism purports that the world is in the end of times and draws on apocalyptic expectations outlined in the Qur’an, the Sunna, Hadith, and other sources as evidence that the end is near, including natural and manmade disasters. Salafism identifies two broad causes of the world’s rapid decline. The first and most important culprit is failed Muslim leadership, including the Ulama, or Muslim scholars, who have relied on past interpretations and rulings in Islam, instead of the words of the Qur’an and the example of the Prophet Muhammed to guide the community. This approach has led not only the Ulama off the true path of Islam but also society and has led to confusion and disunity in the umma, which is the worldwide Muslim community. Muslim rulers have contributed to the umma’s downfall by supporting and upholding these false teachings. The second cause of decline is the presence and influence of the West, which includes its actual colonization of much of the Muslim world, its support of the state of Israel, and its introduction of Western secularism and democracy, ideas that have led Muslims away from God’s rule. Western social influences in the Muslim world, including Western education, feminism, and homosexuality, have further led to its downfall. The Muslim world has fallen into a state of Jahiliya, ignorance, from the examples set by the West and by Muslims leaders who blindly follow these bankrupt and corrupt ideas. The solution to these problems is a return to the right path of Islam as articulated in the Qur’an and the example of the Prophet Muhammed, and to turn away from bid’ah, or any religious innovation, as well as Western ideas. Salafis further emphasize the need to recognize the indivisibility of God, or tawhid, in all aspects of life. Returning to the pure path of Islam will end divisions among Muslims, including Shia and Sunnis, and unify the umma. Ultimately, returning to what they believe is the pure path of Islam as articulated by the Qur’an and exemplified by the Prophet Muhammed’s life and the purification of the dar al Islam, the land and people connected to the faith, from foreign influence will create the conditions for the end of times, with a new world of justice and peace emerging in its place. Importantly, Salafism as an ideology is not de facto violent. According to Quintan Wictorowicz, Salafis fall into three categories of actors to realize their ideal state: what he calls nonviolent purists, politicos (those that aim to work through the state to realize Salafi goals), and jihadists, or those who see violence as the necessary path to realizing their utopic goals. Clearly, AQ and ISIS are proponents of the jihadi course of action for realizing Salafi ideology. Both movements see violence and shedding blood as necessary for realizing a unified umma, free of internal corruption and external influence, adhering to the oneness of God. Both groups also see the return of the Caliphate, the one right ruler, to the dar al Islam as a necessary state for returning Islam to the right path. Despite these similarities, ISIS and AQ also have some important differences. ISIS is deeply apocalyptic in its vision of the world and its salvation. Its messaging is steeped with symbols and references to Muslim expectations of the apocalypse, including discussions about a great battle in 'Dabiq' with 'Rome' (the West), which is an apocalyptic expectation, as are twelve righteous rulers in Islam, the eighth of which was believed to be ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (who was killed in 2019), to name a few. ISIS, in fact, justifies its mass atrocities and shedding blood as a necessary pathway to realizing the apocalypse and ushing in a new and better world. Graeme Wood’s 2015 Atlantic article 'What ISIS Really Wants'summarizes, 'In fact, much of what the group does looks nonsensical except in light of a sincere, carefully considered commitment to returning civilization to a seventh-century legal environment, and ultimately to bringing about the apocalypse.' Countering Salafi Jihadi Ideology Throughout the GWOT, the United States and its allies implemented several initiatives aimed at countering the ideologies of AQ and ISIS. Three broad efforts are particularly important: countering the message, stopping the spread of the message, and creating a new message altogether. When done together and synchronized with other efforts, including military action, these efforts began to counter the ideology. Countering the Message The United States and its allies and partners took the ideology of AQ and ISIS seriously from the earliest days of the GWOT. There was an understanding that the ideology was important—that their interpretation of Islam mattered and needed to be addressed to curb recruitment and sympathy for these groups. For example, in the first one hundred days following September 11, the White House issued a statementoutlining how the United States had responded to the attacks. Within the details of forming an international coalition to counter al Qaeda and its use of military action, it included 'respecting Islam' as one of the actions taken. The statement quoted President George W. Bush, who asserted: 'The Islam that we know is a faith devoted to the worship of one God, as revealed through the Holy Qu’ran. It teaches the value and importance of charity, mercy, and peace.' The statement included discussions about protecting Muslims in the United States and celebrating Iftar at the White House. To specifically address claims that the West does not care about Islam or Muslims, the United States took several measures aimed at countering al Qaeda’s message. In 2003, the U.S. Department of State created the YES (Youth Exchange and Study) program, which gave students from Muslim-majority countries the opportunity to study in the United States. It also wrote a booklet called Muslim Life in America, which aimed to counter the specific message that the United States was hostile to Islam. The State Department also helped to fund the P2P (Peer to Peer): Challenging Extremism project, which aimed to amplify local voices speaking out against extremism. The United States has continued to emphasize its commitment to religious tolerance throughout the GWOT. However, efforts aimed at emphasizing Western countries’ tolerance toward Muslims and support of Muslim countries have most likely fallen on deaf ears for several reasons. First, these words and programs were overshadowed by U.S. and allied military actions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond, which provided key data points for AQ, ISIS, and others of Western aggression toward the Muslim world. Second, the United States specifically lacks credibility over its support of Israel and, by extension, Israel’s actions toward Palestinians and neighboring countries. Third, key European powers, including France, Belgium, and Great Britian, lack credibility in some parts of the world due to the legacy of colonialism. In other words, the messenger has corrupted the message. Taken together, these actions by themselves were unlikely to have successfully countered the anti-Western message of AQ and ISIS. Another major effort at countering the ideology of Salafi Jihadi was deradicalization programs, which aimed to turn individuals that embraced Salafi Jihadism back into healthy members of society. Some deradicalization efforts were government-sponsored, such as Saudi Arabia’s program to rehabilitate low-level jihadis they had apprehended. Other programs were initiated by nonprofits, such as the now shuttered Quillium Foundation in Britain. While this approach to countering the message was less strategic, it was still a major effort in countering Salafi Jihadi ideology. These programs also have faced considerable criticism since their implementation. One critique is their inability to measure overall effectiveness in countering Salafi Jihadi ideology, particularly when the target of these programs was individuals. Another is that these programs unjustly targeted conservative Muslims and aimed to paint all Salafis in a negative light. Finally, in Great Britain and elsewhere, several 'rehabilitated' jihadis were released from prison and went on to perpetrate terrorist acts, including the 2019 London attack by Usman Khan that killed two and the 2020 knife attack by Sudesh Amman. These acts have raised considerable doubt on the efficacy of deradicalization programs in Great Britain. Preventing the Spread of Ideology The United States and allied powers also engaged in several efforts aimed at preventing the spread of AQ and ISIS ideology. Although controversial, one approach was to take ideologues off the battlefield. The 2011 killing of Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, a U.S. citizen, is one example of this effort. The death of ISIS media personnel is another example of this approach. Yet another approach was to disable the ability of AQ and ISIS to spread their ideology through the Internet. Task Force Ares is credited with disabling a range of Internet activities of ISIS. As with efforts to counter Salafi Jihadi ideology, measuring the effectiveness of preventing the spread of ideology is nearly impossible to do; it amounts to trying to measure something in the future that may, or may not, happen. Similarly, attributing measurable changes in behavior, like a downtick in recruitment, to one activity is difficult to do when a multitude of variables are occurring at once, what is known in academia as 'overdetermined.' Furthermore, as with most education programs, in addition to being overdetermined, changes in behavior may only be visible over time, making measuring these effects in the present difficult. Creating a New Message A third approach to countering the ideology of Salafi Jihadism has been to provide an entirely new message, as opposed to countering the ideology or trying to prevent its spread. One program, the Australian Beyond Bali Project, created a publicly available curriculum aimed at introducing peace and tolerance education in public schools. In Indonesia, the Muhammadiya School system, which was created in response to Dutch and British schools systems during colonialism, aims to reinforce the tolerant strain of Islam indigenous to Indonesia, which is distinct from Salafi Jihadism. As with the other countermeasures aimed at blunting the ideology of Salafi Jihadism, measuring precise effects of these programs is unlikely given the vast number of variables that influence why individuals and groups support a set of beliefs over another, and if those beliefs solely influence behavior. Finally, in addition to looking at various actions taken to deliberately try to undermine Salafi Jihadi ideology and change violent behavior, it is important to also address actions taken that reinforced the ideology, whether intentional or not. The full-scale military invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, while undertaken for specific reasons and with broad political and military objectives, were actions that reinforced Salafi Jihadi narratives that the United States and the West more broadly were out to destroy the Muslim world. The fact that neither of these wars went according to plan and left both countries fragile and unstable has provided evidence that supports the Salafi Jihadi narrative that the West is out to destroy Islam. One could also point to the prolonged drone campaign in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan as another example that has reinforced the messaging of Salafi Jihadis of Western intentions toward Muslims and the Muslim world. Counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen wrote in a 2009 New York Times op-ed about the negative consequences of U.S. led drone strikes in Pakistan. He summarized that 'while violent extremists may be unpopular, for a frightened population they seem less ominous than a faceless enemy that wages war from afar and often kills more civilians than militants.' Clearly, some of these military actions were necessary to fight transnational jihadis; however, it is critical to keep in mind how military actions might become examples that jihadis will use to reinforce their ideology. Applying Lessons Learned in GWOT to Countering State Ideologies While there are many important distinctions between AQ, ISIS, and state adversaries today, we can still draw important lessons from the twenty-one years fighting Salafi Jihadi ideology in the GWOT. Four salient lessons are proposed here with their application to our current state adversaries in an era of strategic competition. Ideology matters as a warfighting capability. The United States and its allies and partners took the ideology of AQ and ISIS seriously and understood it as something that contributed to the warfighting capability of the adversary. Today, the ideologies of our current strategic competitors, including Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, matter just as much. In fact, these adversaries are using some of the same themes as AQ and ISIS in their own ideologies. Take, for example, this quote from Vladimir Putin in a speech on February 24, 2022, the day of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine: '[The West] sought to destroy our traditional values and force on us their false values that would erode us, our people from within, the attitudes they have been aggressively imposing on their countries, attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature. This is not going to happen. No one has ever succeeded in doing this, nor will they succeed now.' This quote easily could have come from Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Awlaki, or Baghdadi. These are not new themes, and we have experience addressing them. As with AQ and ISIS, countering ideology is important because of its effects in luring potential recruits to the fight, both domestic and foreign, and sustaining support for the war in the long term. State actors are no different in these pursuits. Russia and China, for example, have used polarizing language about the West, including about colonialism, in efforts to draw more countries to the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) alliance and to argue that BRICS is the best way to counter Western power through alternative economic, financial, and security alliances. As with the GWOT, we need to understand which themes are resonating with whom, why, and to what effect. We need to fight the ideology and the military capacity of our adversaries synergistically. In Russia, Putin’s ideology is playing a critical role in explaining and sustaining his aggression. He has devised an ideology of nationalist imperialism, what he calls 'scientific Putinism,' which goes far beyond financial profits and includes the restoration of the Russian Empire to its former territorial, political, economic, religious, and civilizational glory, free from Western influence. This government is using education at all levels to indoctrinate the population to this vision, and it is believed to have considerable support within the Russian Federation. We should not ignore this warfighting capability and should take measures to undermine and discredit his ideology. The same goes for the ideologies of our other strategic competitors. In the GWOT, academics spent considerable time and energy trying to understand the ideology of AQ and ISIS, how it was resonating with target populations, and why. Organizations like the Pew Foundationconducted repeated surveys on a variety of topics in Muslim-majority countries to get a sense of attitudes and level of support for Salafi Jihadism. Additionally, these same efforts also considered how U.S. and allied foreign policy affected populations, their attitudes toward the West, and their views toward Salafi Jihadism. We need to consider how our actions feed our adversaries’ ideologies and, wherever possible, work to undermine the message, not reinforce it. Successfully doing this requires understanding the message, those who create and propagate it, those who believe the ideology and those who do not, and how our actions affect the message. As with the GWOT, the messenger is as important as the message itself. If Western countries are the adversary’s target of the ideology, standing up and saying how great we are, or what we are (or are not) doing, is unlikely to be effective. This is a lesson learned from the GWOT, and it applies to our current era of strategic competition as well. Additionally, if we have a good messenger, partnering closely with that individual or organization may do more harm than good, especially if we are the adversary’s target. Rather than overtly embracing these individuals and groups, it is better to partner with them silently or not at all. We need to be careful of increased apocalypticism. As with the highly apocalyptic images and language of ISIS, we need to take increased apocalyptic rhetoric from our state adversaries seriously because this message could be the harbinger of mass death and destruction. Unlike ISIS or AQ, Russia, China, and North Korea all have weapons of mass destruction, and Iran has aggressive nuclear ambitions. In other words, these states have access to weapons that could make their dreams of the apocalypse come true. We therefore should pay attention to increased messaging and symbols that have an apocalyptic tone because this rhetoric could signal efforts to prepare populations for mass atrocities, including the use of nuclear weapons or attacking nuclear facilities with the promise of cosmic victory and ushering in a new era. Dimitry Adamsky’s fascinating book, Russian Nuclear Orthodoxy, warns of such a possibility. Measuring effectiveness is difficult. Within all of this, measuring effects in efforts to counter ideologies will be plagued with challenges of overdetermination. This does not mean we should abandon these efforts. Rather, at the strategic level, it is important to keep in mind that it is the totality of efforts across multiple domains and instruments of statecraft that have an overall effect on success or failure of objectives in modern war. Focusing on things that can be easily measured, such as spent ammunition, deaths, sorties, or territory lost or claimed, in most cases will not provide a comprehensive picture of the war’s trajectory. Synchronizing these efforts toward a clear goal should be the pursuit, with macro-level indicators that help identify success or failure in meeting the war’s goal. Ultimately, as with other warfighting capabilities, including materiel, money, industrial capacity, and manpower, the veracity of an ideology will contribute to the intensity and duration of our adversaries’ warfighting capabilities. We ignore the ideology of our adversaries at our own peril. About the author: Dr. Heather S.

Japanese Politics Faces Uncertainty After Electoral Deadlock – An...	By Purnendra Jain The snap election for Japan’s Lower House on 27 October 2024 produced a hung parliament with no political party or coalition receiving a majority, throwing Japanese politics into uncertainty and potential political instability. Japan’s long-time ruling coalition, led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior ally Komeito, suffered a crushing defeat in this election. Newly minted Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had called it soon after taking office in early October 2024, hoping to cash in on his honeymoon period and catch the unprepared opposition unawares. Ishiba’s calculations backfired as voters registered their vote of no confidence in the LDP marred by a slush-fund scandal and the party’s unexplained connection to the Unification Church that had forced prime minister Fumio Kishida to resign in September 2024. Ishiba’s promises to clean up and reform the party cut no ice with most voters. A general sense of apathy towards politics and pessimism prevails among voters, resulting in one of the lowest turnout rates since the end of the Second World War. In the 465-member Lower House of Japan’s parliament, the LDP only secured 191 seats — 56 fewer than the 247 it held before the election. Komeito not only reduced its seats to 28, down from 32 seats, but its new leader, Keiichi Ishii, failed to retain his seat in the Lower House, illustrating the party’s waning electoral support and raising questions about its leader’s prospects. The main opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), won 148 seats. Although this is up 50 seats from the CDP’s pre-election strength of 98, it’s not enough to form a government in its own right. Another opposition party, the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), gained substantially by quadrupling its strength from seven to 28 seats. The Japan Innovation Party (JIP), with 38 seats, and the DPP, with 28 seats, will hold the key to forming the next government either in coalition with the LDP or the CDP. Even after one of the LDP’s worst electoral performances, Ishiba did not stand down. Instead, he vowed to continue as prime minister, reform the party, and press ahead with his reform agenda. His political survival now depends on drawing support from some opposition parties besides Komeito. The most likely allies are the JIP and the DPP, both conservative stripes, although neither has yet committed to a coalition with the LDP. A parliamentary vote to designate a new prime minister must occur within 30 days after an election. Whether Prime Minister Ishiba or the largest opposition party leader, the DPJ’s Yoshihide Noda, wins the race is unclear at this stage. Both Ishiba and Noda will be busy with horse trading and power jockeying to have the required number when voting takes place on the floor of the parliament. How opposition parties and independent members align with the two major parties will determine who forms the government and who takes the helm. All bets are off at this stage. In any scenario, the new government will stand on shaky ground. Ishiba’s position would be weak, not only because his government would depend on opposition and independent members for policymaking and legislation but also because he faces an internally fractured party and leaders waiting in the wings to unseat him. Noda, the recently elected leader of the CDP, served as prime minister from 2011–2012 and was the leader of the now-defunct Democratic Party of Japan, reconstituted as CDP. But non-LDP governments in Japan have a poor track record. In 1993, when the LDP was defeated for the first time since 1955, it was touted as a new political era. This coalition government did not last long, and the LDP returned to power with coalition partners in 1994. Similarly, when the DPJ defeated the LDP in 2009, it raised the prospect of a truly two-party system. Yet the opposition in power failed again due to internal conflict and frequent changes of leadership, with three prime ministers in three years. The party suffered a humiliating electoral defeat in the 2012 general election with the LDP under Shinzo Abe reclaiming government. While the volatile situation makes domestic politics unstable and fragile by increasing the potential for policy paralysis, a multi-party coalition government in Tokyo will be weak internationally. Japan faces significant diplomatic conundrums. In its neighbourhood, China and North Korea constantly challenge Japan through their air and sea incursions into Japanese territories, missile launches and nuclear sabre rattling. Through its support to Ukraine and NATO, Japan has also upset Russia, its northern neighbour, which has formed a triple axis with China and North Korea, making Japan’s strategic environment even more precarious. Japan’s most significant foreign policy issue is its relationship with its security ally, the United States. Who wins the presidential race and how the new Japanese leader engages with the new US president will be watched in Japan, the region and around the world. A weak leader and unstable government in Tokyo do not bode well for Japan’s domestic policy challenges of inflation and low wages with a stagnant economy or foreign affairs demands. Neither Japan nor its friends and allies want a revolving door of prime ministers and frequent government changes in Tokyo.

Why America Embraces India’s Strategic Autonomy – Analysis	By Vivek Mishra and Kashvi Chaudhary There is a strong chatter in Washington DC that the US cut India significant slack under the Biden administration by keeping India embraced despite its unwavering ties with Russia throughout the shadow of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The perspectives in Delhi are tilted in its favour in that the US needs India just as much. The answer lies somewhere in between those two strands. As such, it is important to explore the nuances that make America’s embrace of Delhi compulsively strong. India, today, practices a unique realism where it does not seek a brutal interest-oriented path to any regional or global objective. Instead, its interests are balanced by values, most conspicuously of a rising power which is not expansionist and seeks dialogues to resolve disputes, as was exemplified in the recent border thaw with China. Furthermore, India’s rise and balanced position stemming from its strategic autonomy reflect a nuanced revisionism in at least two ways: first, it has nudged the global economy in its way. In the latest World Economic Outlook data shared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India continues to lead large economies in growth. Second, as a large economy seeking a bigger role at the global stage, India’s strategic choices have enforced recalibrations upon the West. This is particularly in contrast to India’s choices in its neighbourhood, where India has shown a considerable degree of adaptation itself. In many ways, India seeks to redefine its own realistic assessment, which reflects its role as a major power driving and capitalising on shifts in the global order. An important driver of that pursuit has been its economic growth, while its military strength has grown simultaneously. India’s engagement with America is at the forefront of this shift. Arguably, this shift also involves countries striving for greater individualism. India recognises that to achieve greater economic growth, it has to stay away from the idea of a rigid alliance system, which is conventionally security-based. In large parts, India’s strategic autonomy finds its roots in its non-alignment, which prevented it from becoming a proxy state of the Cold War era. The non-aligned movement was very much a strategic choice, as is its evolved form, strategic autonomy. Today, India is unapologetically focused on economic growth and wants to ensure peace and stability in the region by stepping up and being the first responder in the region through robust HADR undertakings. Most of all, India stands in regional contrast to most other countries in Asia in its position as a solid democratic anchor in the Indo-Pacific. In the security paradigm, this has often meant how India can balance China. Besides, India’s broad spectrum of democracy and a 'trusted' global partner status have allowed the sharing of sensitive information and technology, thus permitting America to have a substantively advanced situational awareness in the Indo-Pacific. These may be some compelling reasons why America seems to embrace India’s strategic autonomy despite the absence of a total strategic lockstep. For Washington, the China question is rapidly shifting. China’s behaviour on the global stage inherently opposes the type of hegemony the US aims to project and its fundamental belief system. While in the Indo-Pacific, the US’ approach hangs in the balance with two ongoing distractions in the form of the Russia-Ukraine war as well as the war in the Middle East, China’s increasing role and influence with opposing actors may undercut Washington’s Indo-Pacific focus. Given China’s recent strides in the Gulf, with its partnerships with Iran and Saudi Arabia, China is actively looking for a larger strategic space in the region. Furthermore, China’s stance on the war ideologically undermines Israel, America’s strongest ally in the Middle East. As Saudi Arabia is negotiating a new relationship with the US, China is keen to make economic inroads in the region. With the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China also aims to drive a complex interdependence with key US allies across the Middle East, Europe, and the Pacific. It is also essential to note that China’s economic ambitions are not the core issue that America faces but the geopolitical and ideological threat it poses. There is a tacit recognition in Washington of the indispensability of India in countering China geopolitically in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, the US’ larger regional policy in South Asia has sometimes diverged from core Indian interests, as has India’s own interests in the region from those of Washington. This has allowed India and the US to keep a broad bandwidth in their bilateral relationship, which a formal alliance would not have allowed. This seeming distance has been beneficial to both India and the US. For instance, China’s state behaviour on the global stage inherently opposes the US hegemony, necessitating alternative paradigms of both engagement and opposition. India, with its revamped image in the Global South, a leading economy and a key future player in the global order, provides that dual alternative, which is required to both engage China responsibly and stand up to it when necessary. Most importantly, it replaces the unilateral prism of hostility and provides a nuance to statecraft. India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, in his book 'The India Way', aptly summed it up by emphasising that India’s goal is to grow together, not separately. For the US, one of the most reassuring things for a bet on India is the latter’s focus on a strong Neighbourhood-First Policy. It has allowed India to balance regional peace and security with growth, especially from its standpoint of the largest economy in the region. Further, India’s 'No-First Use' policy, its refusal to station troops in Afghanistan despite US pressure under the Trump administration, positions it as a non-threat to its neighbours - a key component of stable growth. Meanwhile, the trade between India and the US has provided layers of trust in the relationship. In 2023, India rose to the US’ top exporter of refined petroleum, while most of this oil was procured by India from Russia, pointing to the fact that there remains a realistic assessment of bilateral ties rather than it being ideologically driven. Any enforcement of 'values' to navigate in the new world order, which is deeply fractured in the long run, could mean a collective downfall. Coming from the non-alignment legacy, India recognises the perils of such a mindset first-hand. India has positioned itself to champion a new global order, which is more pragmatic than rigid and away from conflicts, navigating a deeply polarised world order sped by the ongoing conflicts in two continents. For America, a partner in the Global South with such a balance may be an asset, as is India’s partnership with the US in compounding its rise to become the stakeholder that it desires. Partnership with successive administrations in Washington has proven that consolidating at home by building a more self-sufficientgrowth and strengthening its strategic partnership with the US may be a diplomatic balance which can be maintained. Compelling pulls on both sides have allowed India and the US to maintain independence in decision-making and yet align on issues of long-term strategic importance.

Jeff Bezos Is Right: Legacy Media Must Self-Reflect – OpEd	I can count on one hand the times I have seen leaders of media organisations engage in anything that could be described as hard-hitting forms of self-critique in the public square. One of those times was when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg went on public record, in a letter to the Republican House Judiciary Committee (dated August 26th, 2024), that he 'regretted' bowing to pressure from the Biden administration to censor 'certain Covid-19 content.' Another was the almost unprecedented public apology in January 2022 (here’s a report in English) by a Danish newspaper that it had towed the 'official' line during the pandemic far too uncritically. We witnessed a third moment of critical introspection from a media owner the other day, when Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post and is the largest shareholder of Amazon, suggested in an op-ed in his own newspaper that legacy media may have themselves at least partly to blame for the loss of public trust in the media. In this context, he argued that his decision not to authorise the Washington Post to endorse a presidential candidate could be 'a meaningful step' toward restoring public trust in the media, by addressing the widespread perception that media organisations are 'biased' or not objective. You don’t need to be a fan of Jeff Bezos, any more than of Mark Zuckerberg, to recognise that it is a good thing that prominent representatives of the financial and political elite of modern societies, whatever their personal flaws and contradictions, at least begin to express doubts about the conduct and values of media organisations. Some truths, no matter how obvious, will not resonate across society until prominent opinion leaders viewed as 'safe' or 'established,' say them out loud. Bezos opens his Washington Post op-ed by pointing out that public trust in American media has collapsed in recent generations and is now at an all-time low (a substantial decline can be seen across many European countries as well if you compare the Reuters Digital News Report from 2015 with that of 2023 — for example, Germany sees a drop from 60% to 42% trust and the UK sees a drop from 51% to 33%). In the annual public surveys about trust and reputation, journalists and the media have regularly fallen near the very bottom, often just above Congress. But in this year’s Gallup poll, we have managed to fall below Congress. Our profession is now the least trusted of all. Something we are doing is clearly not working…Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose. Something we are doing is clearly not working. This is the sort of candid introspection we need to see a lot more of in journalists and media owners. If someone stops trusting you, it’s easy to point the finger at someone else or blame it on 'disinformation' or citizen ignorance. It’s not so easy to make yourself vulnerable and take a long, hard look at yourself in the mirror to figure out how you’ve lost their trust. The owner of the Washington Post does not offer an especially penetrating diagnosis of the problem. However, he does point out some relevant facts that may be worth pondering if we are to come to a deeper understanding of the fact that the Joe Rogan podcast, with an estimated audience of 11 million, now has nearly 20 times CNN’s prime-time audience: The Washington Post and the New York Times win prizes, but increasingly we talk only to a certain elite. More and more, we talk to ourselves. (It wasn’t always this way — in the 1990s we achieved 80 percent household penetration in the DC metro area.) More and more, we talk to ourselves. Much of the legacy media has become an ideological echo chamber, as I pointed out in an op-ed in the Irish Times a few years ago. Conversations go back and forth between journalists about things they care about, while a substantial number of ordinary citizens, whose minds are on other things, like paying their mortgage, getting a medical appointment, or worrying about the safety of their streets, switch off. While there are some notable exceptions, the echo-chamber effect is real and may be part of the explanation for the flight of a growing number of citizens into the arms of alternative media. The increasing disconnect between self-important legacy journalists and the man and woman on the street has been evidenced by the fact that so-called 'populism' was sneered at by many journalists across Europe and North America while gathering serious momentum on the ground. It was also evidenced by the fact that serious debates over issues like the harms of lockdowns and the problem of illegal immigration, were largely sidelined by many mainstream media across Europe while becoming a catalyst for successful political movements such as the Brothers of Italy, Le Pen’s Rassemblement National in France, Alternativ für Deutschland in Germany, and the Freedom Party in Austria. Perhaps part of the problem is that those working in well-established media organisations tend to take the moral and intellectual high ground and severely underestimate the capacity of ordinary citizens to think through issues for themselves, or to intelligently sort through competing sources of information. Indeed, even Jeff Bezos, in his attempt to be critical of legacy media, could not resist depicting alternative media exclusively in negative terms. 'Many people,' he lamented, 'are turning to off-the-cuff podcasts, inaccurate social media posts and other unverified news sources, which can quickly spread misinformation and deepen divisions.' While there is undoubtedly an abundance of confusion and false and misleading information on social media, it is by no means absent from the legacy media, which has gotten major issues badly wrong. For example, many mainstream journalists and talk show hosts uncritically celebrated the idea that Covid vaccines would block viral transmission, in the absence of any solid scientific evidence for such a belief. Similarly, many journalists dismissed the Covid lab-leak theory out of hand, until it emerged that it was actually a scientifically respectable hypothesis. We should thank Jeff Bezos for highlighting the crisis of trust in the media. But his complacency about the integrity of traditional news sources and his dismissive attitude toward 'alternative sources' of news and information are themselves part of the reason why many people are losing respect for the legacy media.

Harris, Trump Head To Battleground States 2 Days Ahead Of Electio...	By Ken Bredemeier Seeking to sway the remaining few undecided voters and rally their supporters to the polls, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump trekked Sunday to political battleground states two days ahead of Tuesday’s national election for a new White House term starting in January. Harris, the Democratic candidate, headed to Michigan in the upper Midwest, one of seven states where polling shows the contest is exceedingly close and the outcome uncertain. Political math shows that whichever candidate captures four or more of the seven battleground states is likely to become the country’s 47th president. Trump, the Republican candidate looking to become only the second president to serve two non-consecutive terms, headed to three other battleground states, staging rallies in smaller cities where he hopes to run up big vote counts in rural areas to offset Harris’ expected large margins in Democratic-dominated cities. Trump started his day in Lititz, Pennsylvania, before heading to Kinston, North Carolina in the afternoon and ending with an evening rally in Macon, Georgia. It was the first day since last Tuesday that the two candidates had not campaigned in the same state. The focus on the battleground states is so pronounced that on Saturday, their planes shared a stretch of tarmac in Charlotte, North Carolina, where both candidates held rallies. Harris attended a Black church service in Detroit, the hub of the U.S. auto industry in Michigan, before heading to stops in Livernois and Pontiac and a rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing in the evening. More than 76 million people have already cast early ballots by mail or at polling stations, according to the University of Florida’s Election Lab, and early voting extends throughout much of the U.S. on Sunday and Monday. The total is nearly half the 158 million who voted through Election Day in 2020. Both Trump and Harris sought in the closing days of the campaign to portray the other as unfit to govern the country over the next four years. On his Truth Social media platform, Trump told voters, 'Every problem facing us can be solved—but now, the fate of our nation is in your hands. On Tuesday, you have to stand up, and you have to tell Kamala that you’ve had enough, you can’t take anymore, 'Kamala Harris, You’re Fired!' At her rallies, Harris has sought to convince voters that she will cut the cost of living, which polling has shown to be the top concern across the country. She has also characterized Trump as dangerous and erratic and urged Americans to move on from Trump's chaotic approach to politics. 'We have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that,' she said in Charlotte on Saturday. Trump has contended that Harris, as the sitting vice president for nearly four years, should be held accountable for rising consumer prices and the tens of thousands of migrants crossing the Mexican border into the United States for the past several years. He has portrayed the migrants as a consequential political threat to the country and their presence damaging financially to state and local governments throughout the U.S. 'The only free aid they are going to get is a free ride back home,' he said at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina on Saturday. Harris made a surprise cameo appearance on NBC’s comedy sketch show 'Saturday Night Live,' where she met up with actor Maya Rudolph, her doppelganger persona on the show. Rudolph told Harris at the end of the skit, 'I'm going to vote for us.' 'Great. Any chance you're registered in Pennsylvania?' Harris asked, reflecting on the importance of the large eastern state to the national outcome. 'Nope, I am not,' Rudolph said. 'Well, it was worth a shot,' Harris replied, before the two delivered the show's signature, 'Live from New York, it's Saturday night!' Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung belittled Harris’ appearance on the show, saying, 'Kamala Harris has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity.' Trump hosted the show during his first run for the presidency in 2015. Last-minute polling shows the Harris-Trump race all but tied in the battleground states, within the margin of statistical error. ABC News polling shows Trump winning five of the seven battleground states, but The Washington Post says its aggregation of polls has Harris ahead in four. The New York Times says Trump is ahead in four, Harris two and the race tied in Pennsylvania. The importance of battleground states cannot be overstated. U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular vote but through the Electoral College, which turns the election into 50 state-by-state contests, with 48 of the states awarding all their electoral votes to the winner in those states. Nebraska and Maine allocate theirs by both statewide and congressional district vote counts. The number of electoral votes in each state is based on population, so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall national outcome, with the winner needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes to claim the presidency. Polls show either Harris or Trump with substantial or comfortable leads in 43 of the states, enough for each to get to 200 electoral votes or more. Barring an upset in one of those states, the winner will be decided in the seven remaining battleground states, where both Harris and Trump have staged frequent rallies, all but ignoring the rest of the country for campaign stops. Polling in the seven states is easily within the margins of statistical error, leaving the outcome in doubt in all seven.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSjXUzSm7OO-v	2024-11-03T16:25:49-08:00	
There’s No Market Process Independent Of Competition – OpEd	By Michael Njoku Many misconceptions about the nature of the free market system stem from an ignorance of who ultimately benefits from the market process. That the significant number of those who would benefit the most from the operations of the market—consumers—tend to also harbor much of the antagonisms against logically necessary features of the market highlights the unfortunate reality that the majority of people have yet to rightly understand how their best interests could be served by the mechanism of the market. Thus, it is not surprising that, in modern history, records abound of ambitious politicians, statesmen, and planners who have exploited this widespread ignorance in furthering utopian ends by means of eclectic and inherently contradictory policies which rational deliberation could easily expose as illusory. One of the widely criticized features of the market system is the concept of catallactic competition. Unsurprisingly, the notion of free competition within the market society is bound to attract the severest censures, given its incompatibility with the ideological pre-possessions of most people, such as compelled egalitarianism and 'social justice.' This article offers a defense of catallactic competition as an inherent feature of the social order of the division of labor and private ownership of the means of production. Through praxeological reasoning, this will illustrate the hidden effects of potential disruptions of the competitive order. Catallactic Competition vs. Darwinian Competition It is important to first make a clear distinction between competition as understood in the field of catallactics and competition as conceived in the Darwinian sense. Catallactic competition is an aspect of social cooperation, in which acting men consider outperforming fellow participants in serving consumers as a means toward the attainment of his own ends. It is not synonymous with the so-called 'law of the jungle,' or the Darwinian conception of biological struggle for survival. As such, use of combative terms or phrases as 'cut-throat,' 'conquest,' or 'crushing competitors' to describe the state of affairs in the field of catallactics are only misleading and, consequently, distract from serious deliberations on the subject matter. Put simply, catallactic competition precludes the initiation of force amongst market participants. A Series of Competition There cannot be a market independent of the process of competition. Viewing the market as a continuous process, rather than a state of equilibrium, in which there is no action, enables us to better grasp the fact that competition is always ongoing within distinct economic categories—entrepreneurs, capitalists, resource-owners, and consumers—as well as in their integrated functions. The market process is a series of competitive actions among various market participants acting to obtain scarce means which aid in the satisfaction of urgent wants. For instance, entrepreneurs—using economic calculation—embark on their buying factors. They compete based on the limit set by the anticipated prices of the marginal products. Because these resources are scarce and have alternative uses, they attempt to bid them away from other entrepreneurs who similarly evaluate and try to obtain these resources for alternative lines of production. Resource owners—through cooperating in the process—willingly offer up their resources for sale to the highest-bidding entrepreneur. Consumers are also not immune to market competition as the products which they most urgently want are simultaneously desired by other consumers in the market. Submarginal buyers become excluded from obtaining those commodities and they are directed toward more capable buyers. Thus, purchasing and bargaining power become the determining factors in competition of each consumer in the market. The Competitive Order and Monopoly It is often asserted that competition precludes monopoly. But the concept of monopoly is often undefined. Monopoly is a concept with several connotations. On the one hand, there is the connotation which implies absolute control of access to a vital resource, in which a single individual or group of individuals, through the use of force, exclude its employment by other users, whether in service of vested interests or according to arbitrary judgements. This would be the case in absolute dictatorship or a world-embracing socialist state, in which the Führer, production tzar, or some ruling bureaucracy dictates the circumstances of availability of these resources to other users. With regard to this connotation of monopoly, the above assertion can be said to be true. On the other hand, there is the connotation of monopoly which entails control of access to definite quantities of a vital resource of production as a result of original appropriation or voluntary exchange. This could occur through previous entrepreneurial alertness, foresight, and accurate anticipation of the future state of the market. This allegedly leads to subsequent charging of a 'monopoly price' for the resource in question. Before the emergence of the 'monopoly,' every other entrepreneur, in executing their buying function, was free to compete in the acquisition of the resource up to the maximum quantity obtainable for future production, however, they underestimated the potential significance of the resource in relation to future market conditions. It is important to note that this type of monopoly does not preclude free entry into the industry in question, nor does it preclude a market for potential substitutes to the monopoly good, thus, it is compatible with the competitive order. As Mises succinctly puts it in Human Action: 'It would be a serious blunder to deduce from the antithesis between monopoly price and competitive price that the monopoly price is the outgrowth of the absence of competition. There is always catallactic competition in the market.' Furthermore, any attempts to coerce the decisions of this 'monopolist'-entrepreneur into alternative actions, which—judged from his point of view—are dissatisfactory, become potentially disruptive of the competitive order. Disruption of the Competitive Order Given that the free market system is founded on the cooperation and voluntary interactions of individuals acting to satisfy their wants, it logically follows that any instance of coercive action by individuals or groups of individuals aimed at influencing the actions of other individuals become potentially disruptive of the competitive order which defines this system. The most systematic threat to the competitive order is the fallacious economic doctrine which has increasingly gained greater acceptance in virtually every country of the world today, and which has become the basis of policies which are disruptive of the mechanism of social cooperation—interventionism. Interventionism advances the notion of a compatibility between free market capitalism and violent interventions of the state in economic affairs. Interventionism is purportedly a middle-of-the-road economic system between capitalism and socialism, that is, a third economic system of economic organization. However, as Mises succinctly remarks in his book The Middle of the Road Leads to Socialism, Interventionism cannot be considered as an economic system destined to stay. It is a method for the transformation of capitalism into socialism by a series of successive steps. While disregarding the inescapable interdependence of economic phenomena, proponents of the doctrine of interventionism view the economy as a compartmentalized, loosely-coupled system in which specific actions can be tailored towards various 'compartments' of the economy in the hopes of obtaining desired outcomes. However, most policies advanced under interventionism almost always produce outcomes which, judged from the point of view of their initiators, are dissatisfactory. Most specifically, the policies directed towards the suppression of competition end up hurting the consumers whose needs would be better served in an unhampered market. Arguments against competition have been offered based on imperfections of competition that allegedly would cause more woes than if competition were suppressed. But, as Hayek puts it in the book, Individualism and Economic Order, ...the evils which experience has shown to be the regular consequence of a suppression of competition are on a different plane from those which the imperfections of competition may cause. For instance, the use of tariffs to suppress foreign competition in a domestic market usually end up raising the prices of locally-produced commodities, hurting the productivity of labor by shifting production from areas with favorable conditions to unfavorable areas, and encouraging cartelization and entrenched monopoly in the domestic market. The Ultimate Beneficiaries of Free Competition It is in the best interest of consumers—for whom every act of productive activity of the entrepreneur is directed—that the competitive order is preserved, for this would imply the possibility of better want satisfaction by accessing more attractive opportunities in the future. If consumers desire to satisfy various wants through the mechanism of the market, then they must realize that competition is an inherent feature of the market system and cannot be suppressed without hurting both their short- and long-term interests.

Kemi Badenoch And A New Era Of Leadership: Potential Opportunitie...	Kemi Badenoch’s rise to leadership within the Conservative Party signifies a crucial moment in British political dynamics, reflecting a movement towards enhanced diversity in representation while simultaneously reinforcing a steadfast dedication to conservative principles. The trajectory leading to Badenoch's current position, marked by a competitive leadership contest and significant backing from party members, underscores her growing popularity and the heightened expectations that accompany her responsibilities. Badenoch, as the inaugural Black leader of a significant political party in the UK, faces the imperative task of manoeuvrings through a complex terrain marked by ideological rifts, a difficult economic environment, and the necessity to re-establish connections with a voter base that is becoming ever more fragmented. Background and New Leadership Badenoch, born in Wimbledon on 2 January, 1980, has rapidly emerged as a prominent figure in the UK politics. Her political journey commenced with her election to the House of Commons in 2017, where she represented Saffron Walden, subsequently serving North West Essex from 2024. Badenoch swiftly attracted attention for her robust pro-Brexit position, symbolizing a profound alignment with a conception of the Conservative Party that emphasized sovereignty and British identity. Ascending within the political hierarchy during the tenures of Prime Ministers Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, she occupied significant positions, such as Secretary of State for International Trade and Minister for Women and Equalities. Her analytical approach to matters like identity politics and her resignation from Boris Johnson’s administration in opposition to his leadership style solidified her position as a politician willing to confront conventional standards within her party. The announcement of the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election took place on 5 July 2024, when the then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak articulated his decision to step down as leader of the Conservative Party in the wake of the party's loss in the General Election 2024. The leadership contest began on 24 July and reached its conclusion on 31 October, 2024. On 2 November, Kemi Badenoch emerged victorious in the members' ballot, marking a historic milestone as the first Black leader of any major UK political party. She is also the fourth female leader of the Conservative Party and the second consecutive leader of non-White descent within the party's history. Badenoch’s victory in the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election — a contest featuring prominent figures such as Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly, and Priti Patel — underscored her resonance with the party’s right-wing constituency. After a series of votes, she emerged as a leading candidate, securing victory in the final member’s ballot with a decisive margin over Jenrick, thereby garnering substantial grassroots support. This achievement has positioned her uniquely as the first Black woman to helm the Conservative Party, embodying a significant transformation within its ideological framework. Badenoch’s new leadership signifies a calculated shift towards fundamental conservative principles, with the objectives of rejuvenating the Conservative Party and reinstating public confidence. With a focus on fiscal prudence, minimal taxation, and restricted government involvement, she would likely to seek to address pressing economic challenges such as inflation and the rising cost of living. Her position on immigration and British identity highlights an emphasis on national sovereignty, demonstrating her dedication to maintaining a unique UK identity. Badenoch endeavors to challenge the prevailing trends of identity politics by advocating for a cohesive national culture rooted in meritocracy and traditional values, a stance that aligns closely with the sentiments of the party's grassroots constituents. Her vision encompasses the reinstatement of ethical standards within the government, aimed at restoring credibility and reconciling ideological divisions within the party. On the international stage, her objective is to utilize Brexit as a means to enhance the United Kingdom's position in global trade and economic affairs. Badenoch's leadership heralds a prospective transformation, characterized by a blend of traditional conservatism and a responsive approach to the prevailing political landscape. A Challenging Landscape for the New Leader The political and economic environment confronting Badenoch is characterized by complicated challenges. The 2024 general election marked a significant decline for the Conservative Party, as its representation in Parliament plummeted from 372 to 121 seats. This outcome underscores a profound public dissatisfaction with pressing issues, including inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, immigration, and the ethical standards upheld by the government. The prevailing public discontent regarding the party's management of critical issues, alongside a notable increase in support for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats, presents Badenoch with the formidable task of revitalizing the party's core constituency while simultaneously reaching out to a broader electorate. The United Kingdom is currently facing the challenge of lasting inflation, which remains elevated at approximately 6-7% as of late 2023, following a peak of 10.1% in 2022. The current inflationary landscape, exacerbated by elevated energy prices stemming from Eurasian geopolitical and geostrategic tensions/conflicts, have been placing significant pressure on household finances, thereby complicating the prevailing public sentiment. Badenoch’s leadership may be anticipated to respond to the pressing demands for tax relief, the stabilization of energy prices, and the strategic investment in sectors that promote sustainable growth. Her adherence to conservative principles — such as low taxes, free-market policies, and a reduction in state spending — may indeed find favor among her core supporters; however, it poses a significant risk of estranging those voters who prioritize immediate economic relief. Ideological Divide and Internal Dynamics The Conservative Party currently finds itself in a state of significant factionalism, characterized by deep ideological rifts that have been intensified by recent leadership transitions and public controversies. Badenoch’s triumph signifies a notable advancement for the party's populist, right-wing contingent, as evidenced by her opposition to what she describes as 'identity politics' and her contentious perspectives on matters such as maternity pay. The campaign strategically underscored a recommitment to foundational conservative tenets, resonating with party constituents eager to differentiate the party from centrist ideologies. However, this strategy prompts significant apprehensions regarding the party's overall attractiveness in a constituency that has progressively gravitated towards Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Her recent pronouncements in favor of a low-tax, limited-government paradigm, coupled with her criticisms of multiculturalism, indicate a distinct ideological shift that could potentially unify the party's core constituency. Nevertheless, this action carries the potential to estrange moderate leaders and voters who are in pursuit of stability and practical resolutions to the pressing economic and social issues at hand. Her focus on traditional values stands in stark contrast to the Labour Party's vision under Keir Starmer, who has adeptly solidified his support by clearly defining economic priorities. The dynamic interaction between these divergent ideologies is poised to significantly influence public discourse, as both factions strive to garner support in a precarious post-election environment. Vision for the Future and Party Reformation In her inaugural address as leader, Badenoch articulated her vision for reform, underscoring the imperative for the Conservative Party to 'reset our politics' and embrace a new beginning. She emphasized the imperative of restoring public confidence and reaffirming the party’s legitimacy following its recent electoral setback. Badenoch articulates a vision for the party that emphasizes a revival of foundational conservative principles, prioritizing fiscal responsibility, minimal state interference, and a strong stance on immigration policy. The emergence of her leadership may herald a transformative phase of reformation and critical self-examination within the Conservative Party, compelling it to reevaluate its policies and governance strategies in response to formidable challenges ahead. Badenoch, recognized for her forthright perspectives on social matters, may find that her position on cultural conservatism reinforces her backing from the party's right faction. Nonetheless, her efficacy as a leader will ultimately hinge on her capacity to reconcile these principles with the practical demands of a varied and evolving electorate. Conclusion The ascent of Kemi Badenoch to the leadership of the Conservative Party embodies a confluence of potential opportunities and significant impediments. Her rise represents a pivotal moment for the party, likely indicating a transition towards a more clearly articulated conservative agenda. Nevertheless, the challenges posed by economic volatility, the necessity for party unity, and the complexities of ideological fragmentation will require skilful manoeuvrings and strategic insight. As Badenoch readies herself for her inaugural significant engagements in the role of Leader of the Opposition, her capacity to connect with both her party's foundational supporters and the wider electorate will prove essential. The ability of her leadership to reconcile these divisions and restore the Conservative Party's standing in the political arena will significantly impact her legacy and the future course of British politics in the coming years.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSinfqArvWKGx	2024-11-03T16:04:01-08:00	
Does The US Really Have Just ‘One President’ During Transitions? ...	America has one president at a time.' In these last few days before the US election, we are frequently reminded of this mantra regarding the transition of power. The Democrats are warning that, if former President Donald Trump wins, he will not abide by the rules and protocols of presidential transitions, just like the last time he was elected in 2016. One of the tenets of the transfer of power in the US is that the president-elect does not undermine the outgoing president by interfering in policymaking in the period before taking office. This is especially true of foreign policy. Past presidents have historically made sure that America has only had one president at a time. Bill Clinton, for example, stressed this point in 1992, when, after his election victory, he urged 'America’s friends and foes alike to recognize, as I do, that America has only one president at a time.' Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama did it too, but in 2016 there was an outcry when the newly elected Trump made a few moves that were seen as violations of a tradition tested over time and enshrined in law. In particular, the Logan Act of 1799 forbids American citizens from unauthorized correspondence or negotiations with foreign governments that undermine the government’s position. This law, according to presidential historians, is to protect the powers of the president’s position under the Constitution, especially in dealing with foreign nations. In 2016, Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman introduced the 'One President at a Time Act,' to amend the Logan Act to 'ensure that US foreign policy is conducted only by the sitting president' and to make the law applicable to incoming presidents. Although this resolution did not go anywhere, it is understood that the Logan Act applies to elected presidents just as it applies to American citizens. Many invoked the Logan Act when criticizing President-elect Trump on two moves he made following the election in 2016. The first was his phone call in December 2016 with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen — the first by a US president or president-elect since 1979. The call angered China and raised concerns about whether America was still wedded to the One China policy. The second was his opposition to the Obama administration’s abstention on a UN Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements. President-elect Trump interfered personally and unprecedently through phone calls he made, confirmed by his press secretary, to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which reportedly he spoke about the resolution. Trump was accused of violating one of the principles of American presidential politics. According to the Center for Presidential Transition, during the transitional period, a president-elect 'traditionally engages in limited outreach to foreign leaders.' The center adds that 'it is important for the president-elect and the staff to ensure the government is always speaking in one voice, particularly on matters of national security and foreign policy.' Presidential transition experts and Democrats say that President-elect Trump in 2016 took calls from the leaders of various countries without coordinating with the State Department, which is tasked with organizing these calls and prioritizing and sequencing them to reflect the importance of the countries to America. In 2016, many in Washington were furious when President-elect Trump spoke with Middle Eastern leaders before he spoke with the prime minister of the UK, Washington’s closest ally. Trump’s critics are worried that, this time around, he will not only do the same but he will double down on making foreign policy decisions and commitments without coordinating with the Biden administration, hence undermining it. They find evidence in Trump’s recent positions and statements. This month, the Republican candidate told his supporters that he had spoken with Netanyahu about the situation in the Middle East. News stories reported that he told Netanyahu, when asked for advice on how to respond to Iran’s missile attack on Israel, 'do what you have to do.' Slate magazine considered this, if accurate, 'not only an act of diplomatic recklessness but also, quite possibly, a federal crime.' It referred to the Logan Act. Moreover, in his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump vowed to settle the Ukraine war 'before I even become president,' adding he would do it, 'if I win, when I’m president-elect.' Although Trump no doubt used this emphasis to indicate the urgency of the situation in his mind, his opponents saw it as another sign that he will flout the rules. Aaron Miller, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment, said Trump does not need to reach out to anybody, as everybody is instead reaching out to him, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Nonetheless, he expressed concern that Trump 'will create expectations and make promises and commitments he is not empowered by law to make.' Miller sees Trump as the 'president norm-breaker,' adding 'it is not a question of the Logan Act or any other act, it is going to happen and there is nothing anyone except Trump can do to stop it.' But it seems Trump is not alone in terms of breaching the rules. Jeffrey Michaels and Andrew Payne, co-authors of 'One President at a Time? The President-elect and Foreign Policy in American History' argue that this tradition 'may by a constitutional reality but it is also a political fiction, more honored in the breach than in the observance.' Miller acknowledged that presidents-elect often interfere in foreign policy, but with the approval of the outgoing administration. He gave, as an example, his participation in the 1988 transition from Secretary of State George Shultz to James Baker, when 'we helped orchestrate a dialogue with the (Palestine Liberation Organization) during November-December that was consistent with the US national interest and with the policies of both administrations.' The divisions in the US over the election and Trump’s positions are extending to every aspect of presidential transitions and power. It is not realistic to expect the upcoming transition to be different if Trump wins. Washington is holding its breath and hoping we do not have a repeat of the 2021 transition. • Dr. Amal Mudallali is a visiting research scholar at Princeton University and former Lebanese ambassador to the UN.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSiM1cUzeEsby	2024-11-03T16:01:50-08:00	
Polarization, Public Sentiment, And Electoral Dynamics: 2024 US P...	I. Introduction The 2024 U.S. presidential election unfolds in an era of unprecedented polarization and heightened public sentiment, posing significant implications for the stability of American democracy. This election’s significance lies in its potential to either deepen ideological divides or catalyze efforts toward democratic cohesion. Polarization, defined by a marked increase in ideological, cultural, and socio-economic divides, has become pervasive within the American electorate, with empirical data illustrating sharp splits along key issues such as healthcare, immigration, and climate change (Pew Research Center, 2023). These divides are not limited to partisan lines but also extend to broader attitudes about democratic norms, including trust in governmental institutions and commitment to electoral integrity. Scholars such as Larry Diamond describe this polarization as 'a fundamental challenge to the integrity of democratic governance in the U.S.' (Diamond, 2022, p. 47), underscoring the stakes of this election for the future of political representation and institutional trust. Some counter that polarization is not a new phenomenon in U.S. politics, contending that historical tensions have been equally contentious (Abramowitz, 2022). However, recent evidence suggests that today’s polarization, coupled with declining trust in institutions, may uniquely threaten democratic resilience (Hetherington & Rudolph, 2015). The primary objectives of this study are to examine the intersection of polarization, public sentiment, and electoral dynamics, and to assess the impact of these factors on democratic governance. Specifically, this research will analyze how polarization influences public sentiment and how voter behavior in turn shapes candidate strategies and electoral outcomes. Additionally, the study seeks to understand the implications of these dynamics on the broader trajectory of American democracy. Recent findings indicate that heightened public sentiment, often fueled by partisan divides, significantly affects political participation, contributing to heightened voter turnout and stronger ideological alignment (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). For instance, high levels of public engagement during the 2016 and 2020 elections exemplify how polarized sentiments can mobilize voters, leading to historically high turnout rates and intense candidate loyalty (McKee, 2021). Guided by key questions, this study examines how polarization shapes voter behavior, how public sentiment influences candidate strategies and media framing, and how the 2024 election may impact American democracy’s future. We hypothesize that high polarization correlates with increased emotional engagement, thereby intensifying both voter turnout and allegiance to ideologically extreme candidates. This hypothesis finds support in literature suggesting that 'negative partisanship'—the opposition to an opposing party rather than support for one’s own—motivates a significant portion of voter behavior (Abramowitz & Webster, 2016). Additionally, we anticipate that media framing may amplify polarized sentiment by fostering 'echo chambers' where voters consume ideologically aligned content, thus influencing campaign strategies and further entrenching political divides (Sunstein, 2017). Finally, the study considers the democratic implications of these dynamics, noting that sustained polarization without institutional redress risks eroding public trust, ultimately threatening democratic cohesion and stability (Levendusky, 2009; McCoy, Rahman & Somer, 2018). By situating the 2024 U.S. election within the context of these political dynamics, this analysis seeks to contribute a nuanced understanding of the election’s implications for American democracy. Through empirical evidence, scholarly insights, and theoretical perspectives, this study critically assesses the interplay of polarization, sentiment, and electoral dynamics, aiming to illuminate pathways that may either mitigate or exacerbate democratic tensions. II. Background and Political Landscape The political landscape leading into the 2024 U.S. presidential election is marked by two major candidates: Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Each represents distinct political platforms that reflect deeper ideological divides in the American electorate. Vice President Harris’s platform centers on progressive policies aimed at expanding healthcare, addressing climate change, and advancing social equity (The White House, 2024). Her vision emphasizes inclusive governance, promising a renewed commitment to civil rights and climate resilience. In contrast, former President Trump’s platform is founded on conservative principles, prioritizing economic deregulation, immigration control, and strengthening American sovereignty (Republican National Committee, 2024). Trump advocates for a return to 'America First' policies, positioning himself as a defender of traditional values and a counterbalance to perceived progressive overreach. This clash of visions is emblematic of the polarized climate characterizing the 2024 race, with each candidate rallying their base around highly distinct ideals that have intensified partisan divides. Historically, polarization has been escalating in American politics, particularly over the past two decades, with notable shifts observed in recent elections (Pew Research Center, 2022). Studies indicate that ideological and partisan divides have increased, evidenced by a growing mistrust between party affiliates and a decline in bipartisan cooperation (Abramowitz, 2022). The 2016 and 2020 elections marked critical points in this trend, as identity-based politics and negative partisanship—where voters are motivated more by opposition to the other party than support for their own—dominated campaign strategies and media narratives (Abramowitz & Webster, 2016). Furthermore, research highlights that such polarization is not limited to political elites but extends to the general public, affecting social dynamics and community relations (Mason, 2018). The trajectory of these trends suggests that the 2024 election is likely to be influenced heavily by deep-rooted partisanship, setting the stage for a potentially contentious political environment. In response to this polarized climate, both campaigns have adopted increasingly targeted and sophisticated electoral strategies. The Harris campaign, for instance, leverages social media and data analytics to reach specific voter demographics, particularly younger and minority groups, focusing on issues such as climate action and social justice that resonate with these populations (Democratic National Committee, 2024). By contrast, Trump’s campaign has employed narrative framing that appeals to his base’s concerns over economic security and cultural values, using platforms like Truth Social and rallies to fortify his message (Republican National Committee, 2024). The use of targeted advertisements and 'echo chambers' within partisan media channels also highlights the role of modern campaign strategies in intensifying voter sentiments and reaffirming ideological divides (Sunstein, 2017). This evolution in campaign tactics underscores how modern electoral strategies are both a product and a driver of the current polarized political environment, further entrenching divisions within the electorate. This background reveals not only the stark ideological divide but also how campaign dynamics have evolved within a politically charged atmosphere. The candidates’ platforms and strategic approaches highlight the extent to which partisan identities have become a central factor in American politics, as each campaign seeks to galvanize its base in ways that reflect and intensify prevailing societal divides. The implications of this evolution for American democracy are profound, as it challenges the prospects for achieving national unity or cross-partisan cooperation. III. Key Factors Influencing the Election The 2024 U.S. presidential election is significantly influenced by a range of factors, most notably economic conditions, swing state dynamics, and the pervasive impact of polarization and misinformation. Firstly, the economic landscape plays a critical role in shaping voter sentiment and behavior. As inflation rates have surged to levels not seen in decades, reaching 8.2% in 2022, public dissatisfaction with the current administration's handling of the economy is palpable (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). This dissatisfaction is reflected in polling data, which indicates that economic concerns have consistently ranked as the top issue for voters, surpassing concerns over social issues and foreign policy (Gallup, 2023). Furthermore, employment rates, while improving, have not kept pace with inflation, leading to heightened anxiety among voters about their financial futures (Smith, 2023). This economic backdrop creates a challenging environment for the incumbent, as historical trends show that poor economic performance typically correlates with unfavorable election outcomes for the ruling party (Cohen & Zeitz, 2022). Additionally, the dynamics of swing states play a pivotal role in determining electoral outcomes. States like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona have emerged as critical battlegrounds due to their diverse demographics and fluctuating political allegiances (Pew Research Center, 2023). The 2020 election demonstrated that these states can shift the balance of power in the Electoral College, underscoring their strategic importance (Smith, 2020). With the electoral college system remaining a central feature of U.S. elections, candidates are likely to focus disproportionately on these swing states to secure the necessary electoral votes for victory. This focus may result in tailored campaign strategies that address the unique concerns and preferences of voters in these regions, further emphasizing the importance of understanding local demographics and issues. Moreover, the current election cycle is marked by increased polarization and the spread of misinformation, which have significant implications for voter perceptions and trust in the electoral process. The rise of partisan media and social media platforms has created echo chambers, where voters are exposed primarily to information that reinforces their preexisting beliefs (Sunstein, 2017). This polarization not only affects voter behavior but also contributes to a decline in trust in electoral integrity, as many voters express skepticism about the legitimacy of the electoral process (Pew Research Center, 2022). Misinformation campaigns, particularly those targeting specific demographics, exacerbate these issues, leading to confusion and apathy among voters (Fridkin et al., 2023). The interplay of these factors highlights a troubling trend in American democracy, where voter engagement and trust may be significantly undermined by external influences and internal divisions. In conclusion, the interplay of economic conditions, swing state dynamics, and the roles of polarization and misinformation will be crucial in shaping the electoral landscape for the 2024 presidential election. Understanding these factors is essential for analyzing how they may impact voter behavior and the overall democratic process in the United States. IV. Theoretical Frameworks and Predictive Models Understanding the theoretical frameworks and predictive models is essential for analyzing the dynamics of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as they provide insights into voter behavior and electoral outcomes. One prominent predictive framework is Lichtman’s '13 Keys' model, which evaluates the likelihood of a party maintaining the presidency based on thirteen true/false statements about the incumbent party’s performance (Lichtman, 2020). This model posits that if six or more keys are false, the incumbent party is likely to lose, emphasizing the importance of historical patterns in forecasting electoral success. In contrast, Silver’s data-driven model employs advanced statistical methods to analyze polling data and electoral trends, offering a more dynamic and real-time perspective on voter sentiment (Silver, 2023). By comparing these methodologies, it becomes evident that while Lichtman’s model relies on historical precedent, Silver’s approach adapts to the shifting political landscape, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of electoral dynamics. Additionally, theoretical interpretations of voter behavior shed light on the motivations behind electoral choices. Rational choice theory suggests that voters make decisions based on a cost-benefit analysis, weighing the perceived benefits of a candidate's policies against the potential costs (Downs, 1957). This framework can explain why economic conditions significantly influence voter sentiment, as individuals may prioritize candidates promising economic stability and growth. Moreover, cultural backlash theory offers insights into the increasing polarization observed in recent elections, suggesting that voters may react against perceived threats to their cultural values, thereby favoring candidates who resonate with their identity (Inglehart & Norris, 2016). Economic voting theory further elucidates how voters’ evaluations of their financial situation impact their electoral choices, supporting the notion that economic performance is a critical determinant of electoral success (Lewis-Beck & Paldam, 2000). Cultural and social dynamics also play a vital role in shaping voter demographics and their alignment with candidates. Factors such as race, gender, and education level influence voting behavior, with certain demographic groups gravitating toward candidates who address their specific concerns and aspirations (Pew Research Center, 2023). For instance, the increasing prominence of issues related to social justice and climate change among younger voters indicates a shift in priorities that candidates must acknowledge to mobilize this demographic effectively. Furthermore, the intersection of these cultural factors with the candidates’ platforms may create complex electoral alignments, as seen in previous elections where candidates who authentically engaged with these issues gained substantial support from previously disengaged voter bases (Tucker et al., 2022). In summary, the integration of various forecasting models and theoretical frameworks is crucial for a comprehensive analysis of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. By examining Lichtman’s and Silver’s models alongside voter behavior theories and cultural dynamics, we gain valuable insights into the electoral landscape and the factors that will influence voter choices in the upcoming election. V. Potential Election Scenarios and Outcomes The 2024 U.S. presidential election presents distinct pathways to victory for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, each requiring strategic approaches to secure the necessary electoral votes. For Harris, the key to success may lie in mobilizing a broad coalition that emphasizes issues resonant with younger, urban, and minority voters, while also addressing the concerns of working-class citizens who feel overlooked by mainstream politics (Pew Research Center, 2023). Targeting swing states, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have significant urban populations and labor interests, could be crucial for Harris in solidifying her electoral base. In contrast, Trump’s route to victory likely hinges on maintaining strong support among rural voters and the white working-class demographic, which played a pivotal role in his previous election (Rosenfeld & Riffkin, 2023). By reinforcing his messaging on economic recovery and national security, Trump aims to galvanize these groups while also appealing to disaffected voters in battleground regions. The impact of key demographics and regional variations is paramount in understanding the dynamics of the election. For instance, working-class voters, particularly in the Midwest, have shown fluctuating loyalty, influenced by economic conditions and perceptions of candidates' authenticity (Pew Research Center, 2023). Urban populations tend to lean Democratic, driven by progressive values and diversity, while rural areas exhibit stronger support for conservative candidates, highlighting the geographic polarization in American politics. Additionally, factors such as race and gender will significantly shape voting patterns, with women and minority voters increasingly mobilized around issues of social justice and equity, potentially swaying the election in favor of Harris if she effectively addresses these concerns (Smith, 2024). Predicted electoral outcomes based on current trends indicate a highly competitive race. Polling data suggests a narrow margin between the candidates, reflecting heightened voter engagement and turnout, particularly among younger voters and those in suburban areas (Gallup, 2024). If current trends continue, with Harris capitalizing on demographic shifts and urban support, she could secure a substantial electoral vote count. However, Trump's stronghold on rural America and his ability to maintain loyalty among his base could present significant challenges for Harris, underscoring the unpredictable nature of the electoral landscape. Ultimately, the outcome will depend on each candidate's capacity to adapt their strategies to engage key voter blocs and respond to the evolving political climate. VI. Implications for American Democracy The implications of the 2024 U.S. presidential election for American democracy are multifaceted, particularly concerning the impact on democratic institutions and norms. Should Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump emerge victorious, the election results will likely shape public trust in governance and the resilience of democratic frameworks. For instance, Harris's administration may prioritize restoring faith in institutions by emphasizing transparency and accountability, essential for reinforcing democratic norms (Smith & Jones, 2024). Conversely, if Trump wins, there is a risk of exacerbating distrust in governmental institutions, particularly among those who perceive the electoral process as biased or flawed, which could further polarize the electorate (National Democratic Institute, 2024). The risks associated with electoral misinformation and challenges are critical to consider in this context. Misinformation campaigns, which have proliferated in recent elections, can undermine public confidence in electoral integrity, fostering skepticism toward legitimate processes (Pew Research Center, 2023). Legal challenges are also anticipated, as candidates may contest the election results, which could lead to prolonged disputes and further erode trust in the democratic system (Bennett & Sutherland, 2024). Such scenarios present significant risks for governance and societal cohesion, as public perceptions of legitimacy and fairness hang in the balance. Broader consequences for political polarization and civic engagement are also expected to emerge from the election outcomes. The increasing polarization evident in the current political landscape poses challenges for civic participation and national unity (Fisher & Smith, 2024). If the election intensifies partisan divides, it could lead to decreased voter turnout and disengagement among moderate voices, who may feel alienated by extreme rhetoric (Gallup, 2024). This potential decline in civic engagement highlights the urgent need for initiatives promoting dialogue and collaboration across party lines, fostering a healthier democratic culture that encourages participation from all segments of society. VII. Conclusion In conclusion, the analysis of the 2024 U.S. presidential election has highlighted several key findings related to polarization, voter sentiment, and electoral dynamics. It is evident that the current political landscape is marked by significant polarization, which not only influences voter preferences but also shapes the overall electoral process. Voter sentiment is deeply intertwined with economic conditions, social issues, and the pervasive impact of misinformation, leading to varying levels of engagement and trust among different demographic groups. This election serves as a crucial juncture for American democracy, reflecting broader societal divisions and the urgent need for collective discourse. As we reflect on the stakes of the 2024 election, it becomes clear that its outcomes will have profound implications for the future of American democracy. The elected leadership will either reinforce or challenge the existing democratic norms and institutions, influencing public trust and civic engagement. The potential for heightened polarization and discontent underscores the importance of fostering a more inclusive and informed electorate. To strengthen democratic processes in this challenging environment, several recommendations emerge. First, addressing polarization requires fostering open dialogue and encouraging cross-partisan collaboration to bridge divides within the electorate. Second, improving voter education initiatives is essential, ensuring that citizens have access to accurate information about candidates, policies, and the electoral process. Lastly, enhancing the integrity of democratic institutions through transparent practices and robust safeguards against misinformation will be critical in restoring public trust and promoting a resilient democracy. By implementing these strategies, we can work towards a more unified and participatory political landscape that upholds the values of American democracy. References Abramowitz, A. I., & Webster, S.

Strengthening Ties: President Prabowo’s Strategic Visit To The UK...	In November 2024, President Prabowo's visit to the United Kingdom signifies a significant advancement in the Indonesia-UK relationship. This visit underscores the renewed commitment of both nations to their advanced partnership across strategic sectors and strengthens bilateral ties amid shifting global dynamics. Prabowo's agenda includes enhancing collaboration in defence, trade, education, technology, and sustainability. By prioritizing these high-impact areas, he aims to generate long-term economic and security benefits for Indonesia while fostering shared prosperity. This thesis posits the potential for a mutually beneficial relationship, wherein targeted collaboration yields broader regional influence and strategic stability. Given that both countries are influential actors in the Indo-Pacific and European theatres, respectively, a strengthened Indonesia-UK relationship would facilitate coordinated responses to regional challenges, bolster economic resilience, and enhance global security frameworks. President Prabowo's discussions regarding defence collaboration are central to his objectives, particularly as Indonesia seeks to modernize its military capabilities in response to increasing geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific. The United Kingdom's advanced defence technology and expertise render it an ideal partner for Prabowo's aspirations to enhance Indonesia's national defence infrastructure. Both countries stand to gain from joint training programs, military exchanges, and intelligence-sharing agreements, which would improve interoperability and strategic response capabilities. In addition to these cooperative efforts, the acquisition of British defence technologies would bolster Indonesia’s maritime security and counter-terrorism initiatives, particularly within its contested maritime regions. A strategic defence agreement that encompasses technology transfers, acquisition deals, and expanded military dialogues would signify a deeper commitment to security collaboration. This defence-oriented cooperation aligns with broader UK interests in promoting stability and security in the Indo-Pacific region, thereby contributing to a balanced security environment that addresses regional threats. Trade and economic partnerships between Indonesia and the United Kingdom offer significant transformative potential for both economies. As Indonesia seeks to diversify its export markets and attract foreign investment, the United Kingdom is well-positioned to provide essential access to global markets. A primary focus for Prabowo should be the reduction of trade barriers that impede Indonesian exports, such as palm oil and textiles, while concurrently encouraging British investment in infrastructure, digital technology, and renewable energy within Indonesia. Such a partnership could entail the establishment of frameworks that facilitate joint ventures and promote investment agreements designed to incentivize participation in sustainable and high-growth sectors. Strengthened trade relations would lay a foundation for economic resilience, diversify Indonesia's revenue streams, and enable the United Kingdom to secure a more robust foothold in the rapidly expanding markets of Southeast Asia. Moreover, education represents a critical avenue for collaboration as Indonesia endeavours to enhance its human capital and cultivate a knowledge-based economy. British institutions, known for their high educational standards, could play a pivotal role in advancing Indonesian education through student exchange programs, joint research initiatives, and institutional partnerships. By encouraging British universities to partner with or establish campuses in Indonesia, Prabowo would enhance the skills and competitiveness of the Indonesian workforce. Areas of focus may include vital fields such as artificial intelligence, engineering, and environmental science, enabling Indonesia to address its technological and environmental challenges while simultaneously building expertise in these growing industries. Furthermore, partnerships in technology and innovation underscore the compatibility of Indonesian and UK priorities, as both nations aim to establish themselves as leaders in the digital and cybersecurity landscapes. With the United Kingdom’s advanced technology sector and Indonesia’s burgeoning digital economy, collaborative initiatives in technology development could foster innovation across various domains, including smart cities, artificial intelligence, financial technology, and cybersecurity. The establishment of collaborative research hubs and digital laboratories would yield mutual benefits by combining UK expertise with Indonesia’s expanding technological ecosystem, thereby creating pathways for innovation that benefit both nations. Environmental sustainability and climate change represent domains in which Indonesia and the United Kingdom can identify mutual interests. Both nations confront significant environmental challenges and are committed to attaining global carbon reduction targets. Collaborative initiatives in renewable energy—specifically focusing on solar, wind, and geothermal resources—could enhance sustainable energy utilization and support each country's decarbonization objectives. Indonesia’s resource-abundant landscape positions it advantageously to emerge as a leader in renewable energy, while UK expertise offers a robust foundation for sustainable development. Furthermore, joint efforts in conservation and sustainable tourism in ecologically sensitive areas could bolster biodiversity protection, thereby reinforcing the environmental goals upheld by both nations. Additionally, people-to-people and cultural exchanges would strengthen diplomatic relations, promoting mutual understanding and cultural respect. This foundation is essential for establishing a sustainable bilateral relationship that transcends mere economic or strategic interests. Programs aimed at promoting cultural, artistic, and educational exchanges would enhance interpersonal connections, creating a shared cultural base upon which broader diplomatic initiatives can be constructed. In conclusion, President Prabowo’s visit presents a pivotal opportunity to advance the Indonesia-UK relationship by addressing shared priorities such as economic resilience, defence stability, educational cooperation, and environmental sustainability. The establishment of regular high-level dialogues focused on Indo-Pacific stability would reinforce the strategic significance of this partnership. An Indonesia-UK alliance that encompasses multiple sectors will not only generate economic and strategic benefits for both nations but also serve as a model for inter-regional cooperation in addressing global challenges. By fostering strong foundations in defence, trade, education, technology, and sustainability, Prabowo's visit could enhance bilateral ties contributing to shared security and prosperity on a global scale.

From Dollar Monopoly To BRICS Diversification – OpEd	The pressure toward the diversification of world currency reserves intensified after 2008, escalated following 2022 and is accelerating, as evidenced by the recent BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia. In the past 15 years or so, BRICS have rapidly grown into a geoeconomic front of the Global South. Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates attended their first summit as member states in Kazan. Saudi Arabia has been invited to join BRICS. Together, the BRICS members encompass nearly a third of the world's land surface and almost half of world population. In September, Turkey officially applied to join the bloc. Numerous countries have expressed interest in joining the BRICS or have already applied membership in Africa (18 countries), East and Southeast Asia (11), Americas (7), Middle East and Central Asia (8), and Europe (4); that is almost 50 nations. Risks of US dollar Much of world trade remains invoiced and settled in U.S. dollars; many banks based outside the United States nonetheless offer dollar-denominated deposits; many non-U.S. corporations borrow in dollars; central banks hold a large share of their reserves in dollar assets; and so on. The assumption is that, a bit like diamond, US dollar is forever. In reality, no dominant reserve currency has had an indefinite life-span. It is precisely the increasing weaponization of the coercive monopoly of the US dollar – the world’s disproportionate dependency on US dollar in trade invoicing and settlement, and the dollar reliance by non-US corporate and financial giants, and dollar’s high share in central banks’ reserves – that increasingly worries not just the Global South, but an increasing number of major economies in the West. The skeptics say that the dollar has been buried many times before. Why should it die this time? But who says it would have to die. The more, the merrier. Most BRICS economies still rely significantly on the US dollar, whereas those that have been sanctioned by the US and/or its allies have significantly reduced their dollar reserves, often opting for gold instead. Weaponization of US dollar When the dollar is weaponized by the US foreign policy in the name of international community but without the broad support of international consensus, it puts trade invoicing and settlement, foreign corporates, financials and central bank reserves at risk. Worse, the weaponization of US dollar and its complicity facilitates the ongoing genocidal atrocities in the Gaza Strip, where Israel’s actions rely on US arms and financing, while turning the rest of the world – even countries that are vehemently protesting such 'wars' of obliteration – into co-conspirators of sorts. The writing is on the wall. Since the creation of the BRICS in July 2009, the value of gold has surged tripling from $953 to almost $2,740 per ounce. It parallels the failure of global recovery and the rise of trade wars since 2017/2018 and the consequent wars and crises. Dollar erosion In historical view, global currency diversification is far from a new idea. John Maynard Keynes sought even more making the case for a supra-national currency bancor (lit. French banque, 'bank gold') in Bretton Woods in 1944. But the idea was torpedoed by the U.S. negotiators, who wanted to replace the UK pound with the dollar as the world’s major reserve currency. Keynes cautioned that the dollar primacy would result in great uncertainty and volatility following the reconstruction and recovery of Western Europe and other major economies. That’s what ensued in 1971, when President Nixon ended unilaterally the convertibility of the dollar to gold. As gold no longer offered a yardstick for value, the perception of value replaced value itself. The consequent price shock reverberated across the world. With the twin oil crises, it was followed by the quadrupling of oil prices, then runaway inflation and stagflation, and eventually record-high US interest rates and massive rearmament drives. In geopolitics, the U.S. leans on major Western economies and Japan, but international economy is a different story. As a net consequence, the dollar monopoly contributed to asset bubbles in the 1980s, early ‘90s, early 2000s and finally in 2008. Amid the Great Recession, China’s central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan revived the idea and urged major Western economies to 'reform the international monetary system.' Then, great pledges were made in Brussels, Washington and Tokyo, but nothing much happened. Obviously, the economic architects of the US administrations seek to promote the advantages of the US dollar at the expense of viable alternatives. That’s very much in their economic and geopolitical interest. Similarly, the British, too, touted the blessings of their sterling pound until 1914. But that primacy ended with the overstretch of the UK economy after 1945. Unfortunately, the United States is in the same trajectory, thanks to record-high debt taking, particularly by the Trump and Biden administrations. Advantages of diversification How are the BRICS contributing to diversification? Thanks to their organizational flexibility, the bloc makes possible unilateral, bilateral and multilateral measures. Analytically, these range from gradual reforms to more unilateral individual measures. The latter, in turn, are driven by the original BRICS founder economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the new aspiring members and the coalition partners who share the basic BRICS vision and are considering membership as well. Hence, the efforts at complementary development institutions and critical infrastructure, including the BRICS New Development Bank (NBD), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Bridge and Road Initiative (BRICS), and the quest for new currency arrangements. The rising number of populous and large emerging economies make possible the kind of 'network effects' and 'positive spillovers' that will be critical to launch the new critical infrastructure for the proposed alternative global financial system. The goal is not to eliminate the dollar, as the BRICS critics claim particularly in the West. In reality, the BRICS have little to do with rogue states seeking to subvert international order. Rather, like asset managers who seek to maintain appropriate diversification in their portfolios, the BRICS’ objective is diversify and recalibrate rather than simple de-dollarization. Global currency arrangements must not reflect just the interests of Americans who account for 4.2 percent of the world population. They must also reflect the aspirations of the multipolar world economy in which global growth prospects are driven by the large emerging economies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSs44Vzs33wq8	2024-11-03T15:55:43-08:00	
What Is China’s United Front And How Does It Operate? – Analysis	By Paul Eckert Evidence is mounting of clandestine Chinese influence operations in the heart of America. Just in the last few months, a former aide to the governor of New York state and her husband were arrested for alleged illicit activities promoting the interests of China; a Chinese democracy activist was arrested and accused of spying for China; and a historian was convicted of being an agent for Beijing. The three separate cases of former Albany functionary Linda Sun, dissident Yuanjun Tang and author Wang Shujun took place in New York alone. And they were not the first cases of alleged Chinese influence operations targeting immigrants from China in the Big Apple. Those cases came to light as a detailed investigation by the Washington Postrevealed that China’s diplomats and pro-Beijing diaspora were behind demonstrations in San Francisco that attacked opponents during President Xi Jinping’s visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit last November. All bear the hallmarks of China’s 'united front' influence operations conducted by government ministries, party operatives and local proxies – but in a veiled manner. 'United front work is a unique blend of influence and interference activities, as well as intelligence operations that the CCP uses to shape its political environment,' said the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party in a report published last November. What is the United Front Work Department? Coordinating this overseas influence and interference work is Beijing’s shadowy United Front Work Department, or UFWD, set up in 1942, even before the Communists took over control of China. Headed by Shi Taifeng, a Politburo member, it seeks to promote China’s political interests through an extensive network of organizations and individuals around the world, experts say. It spares no effort trying to push Beijing’s view – and crush dissenting opinions – among people in Taiwan and Hong Kong, ethnic minorities such as Mongolians, Tibetans and Uyghurs as well as among religious groups. How does the UFWD operate? The United Front Work Department is engaged in a mixture of activities, from interfering in the Chinese diaspora and suppressing dissidents to gathering intelligence, encouraging investment in China and facilitating the transfer of technology, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, said in a report. It uses quasi-official organizations and civil society groups based overseas to blur the line between official and private, giving China plausible deniability in many cases, witnesses told the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which advises Congress on China. It funds Confucius Institutes – Chinese-language study centers on university campuses around the world – many of which have been shut down in the United States. It also funds diplomats’ engagement with foreign elites and its police force’s perpetration of 'transnational repression' – clamping down on dissidents or opponents outside China’s borders, the review commission said in a 2023 report based on expert testimony. United front groups often have innocuous sounding names, like the Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification or the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. Many appear to be ordinary overseas Chinese community organizations, and are found in business and even in multinational corporations. Lurking behind or within them, though, are government or party agencies – very often China’s powerful intelligence, security and secret police agency. 'United front groups are used – very specifically – to hide the Ministry of State Security,' said Peter Mattis, head of the non-profit Jamestown Foundation. 'This is why I like to think of the United Front Work Department as the tall grass that is sort of deliberately cultivated to hide snakes,' he told RFA. What is the history of China‘s ’united front’ work? Under the Moscow-led Comintern in the 1920s, the Chinese Communist Party adapted Soviet revolutionary Vladimir Lenin’s concept of forming a 'united front' – forging temporary alliances with friends and lesser enemies in order to defeat greater enemies. After Mao Zedong’s Communists took power in 1949, united front work focused internally on co-opting Chinese capitalists and intellectuals, who were brought to heel and persecuted in the 1950s under Mao’s vicious ideological campaigns. Xi Zhongxun, the father of current President Xi Jinping, played a key united front work role with top Tibetan Buddhist figures, trying to influence the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. What role has Xi played? While China denies meddling in the affairs of foreign nations, experts say that under President Xi, China’s overseas influence activities have become more aggressive and technologically sophisticated. In 2017, Xi famously repeated Mao’s description of united front work as a 'magic weapon' for the party’s success. But two years before that, he established a 'leading small group' to coordinate top-level united front work and carried out a major expansion and reorganization of the UFWD. 'We will build a broad united front to forge great unity and solidarity, and we will encourage all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation to dedicate themselves to realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation,' Xi told the 20th Party Congress in 2022. That congress saw Xi’s top ideological theorist, Wang Huning, who ranks fourth in the Politburo, appointed to lead the national-level united front system, the House Select Committee report said. Xi has built up the power and capacity of the UFWD, which controls 11 subordinate government agencies, including the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the State Administration for Religious Affairs, according to Australia’s ASPI. What are some examples of the UFWD’s efforts in the U.S.? In New York, prosecutors say that Linda Sun and her husband, Christopher Hu, received millions of dollars in cash, event tickets and gourmet salted duck from the UFWD. In exchange, Sun tried to remove references to Taiwan in state communications, and obtained unauthorized letters from the governor’s office to help Chinese officials travel, prosecutors say. In California during Xi’s visit in November, the Washington Post reported, the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles paid for supporters’ hotels and meals and directly interacted with aggressive actors who punched and kicked anti-Xi protesters and attacked them with flagpoles and chemical spray. U.S. stopovers by Taiwan leaders have drawn similar protests. Who are the targets of united front work? Sun and Hu represent a key demographic in the UFWD’s crosshairs: the Chinese diaspora. The activist Tang had access to the overseas Chinese dissident and pro-democracy community and its network of supporters. United front pressure and harassment tactics – including threats against family in China – are deployed against diaspora members of China’s persecuted ethnic and religious minorities: Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongolians, and members of the banned Falun Gong movement. Citizens of Taiwan have for decades been pressured by united front efforts to support unification with the Communist-controlled mainland. The recent imposition of draconian national security legislation in Hong Kong has made citizens and exiles who oppose those authoritarian steps in formerly free Chinese territory targets of united front pressure. These targets are not alone and the list is growing, with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand also grappling with Chinese influence campaigns that smack of united front work. 'There’s no clear distinction between domestic and overseas united front work: all bureaus of the UFWD and all areas of united front work involve overseas activities,' the report from Australia’s ASPI said. 'This is because the key distinction underlying the United Front is not between domestic and overseas groups, but between the CCP and everyone else,' it said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington told Radio Free Asia that the United Front’s domestic role is to 'promote cooperation between the (Communist Party) and people who are not members of it.' Outreach to the diaspora 'helps give full play to their role as a bridge linking China with the rest of the world,' the embassy spokesperson’s office said in an e-mailed statement. 'Its work is transparent, above-board and beyond reproach,' it said. 'By making an issue out of China’s United Front work, some people are trying to discredit China’s political system and disrupt normal exchange and cooperation between China and the United States.'

Moldova: Pro-West Sandu Declares Victory In Tight Presidential Ru...	(RFE/RL) -- Pro-Europe incumbent Moldovan President Maia Sandu has declared victory over Russia-friendly challenger Alexandr Stoianoglo, in balloting marred by accusations of of Russian interference and voter fraud. With 98 percent of ballots counted in the November 3 election, the Central Election Commission said Sandu had 54.35 percent of the vote to Stoianoglo’s 45.65 percent, a lead of more than 140,000 votes. 'Moldova, you are victorious!' a jubilant Sandu, who was boosted by votes in the capital, Chisinau, and from diaspora votes, said shortly after midnight. 'Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova! In our choice for a dignified future, no one lost,' she added. Stoianoglo, who has not conceded, had held the early lead, but it continued to narrow as votes were being counted from the large cities, where Sandu has most support. In addition, votes from the diaspora West could favor Sandu as they are reported. The Central Election Commission reported that turnout surpassed 54 percent, stronger than in the first round and also higher than in the 2020 presidential runoff. Sandu won the first round on October 20 with 42 percent of the vote compared to 26 percent for Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor-general who received backing from the pro-Russia Socialist Party of Moldova. In comments to reporters after casting her ballot at a Chisinau polling station, Sandu said she voted 'with Moldova.' 'Thieves want to buy our vote, they want to buy our country, but the power of the people is infinitely greater than any of their malice,' she said. 'The power of Moldova is in each of you, go out to vote with faith and hope. Heads up, Moldovans!' Following the close of most polling stations, Stoianoglo said the large turnout proved that 'Moldova is not just a point on the map with simple spectators, but a country of responsible people.' The vote came amid accusations of Russian meddling in both the presidential race and a referendum on Moldova’s potential further integration with the European Union -- a direction Sandu and her supporters strongly support. The pro-EU side scored a razor-thin victory in the referendum -- the 'yes' vote getting 50.38 percent – but Sandu quickly alleged that 'criminal groups together with foreign forces' tried to 'buy 300,000 votes,' making the final result significantly closer than pre-vote polls had indicated. Surveys also indicated that Sandu would take an easy victory in the first round of the presidential election, but Socialist challenger Stoianoglo surprised with a better-than-expected total, forcing the runoff vote. Sandu's national security adviser posted a statement to X, claiming 'massive interference' by Russia in the runoff vote. 'An effort with high potential to distort the outcome,' Stanislav Secrieru said in his post. He gave no details. Moldova has 3.02 million registered voters, including those in the diaspora. Voters in the West were credited with helping the 'yes' side eke out the narrow victory in the EU referendum and helped Sandu in the runoff election. According to the CEC, foreign voting went to Sandu by a large margin, with the incumbent winning 81 percent to 19 percent over the challenger. Votes in Chisinau also went to Sandu by a 57-43 percent margin. While the position of president is technically a ceremonial position in Moldova, holders of the office often wield considerable political influence. A president may serve for two consecutive four-year terms. Scattered irregularities were reported during the early voting hours on November 3, including incidents of purported photographing of ballots -- which voters in the past have used to prove their choice in potential vote-buying cases. Angelica Caraman, head of the election commission, said that as of 4 p.m., 18 cases of alleged electoral corruption had been officially reported, while police authorities said they had registered at least 126 complaints of electoral violations. Police authorities said in a statement that outside the country, voters were being transported in large groups to two polling stations in Moscow as well as polling stations in the Belarusian capital, Minsk; Baku, Azerbaijan; and Istanbul, Turkey, including by airplane. Moldovan voters in those countries are known to typically support pro-Russian groups. Election authorities called on citizens to report any attempts to transport voters to polling stations in an organized manner. Similar violations were flagged by independent observers from Promo-Lex, a democracy watchdog. There were also reports of apparently fake bomb threats called into polling stations in Moldova and in several countries, including in Britain, Germany, and Romania. Elsewhere outside the country, polling stations for Moldovans in Japan and China were among the first to close. In Tokyo, officials reported Sandu winning by 58-7, while in Beijing, Sandu had 59 votes out of 73 cast. Sandu, 52, is a Harvard graduate and former employee at the World Bank. She became Moldova's first female president with a landslide victory in 2020, running on a strong pro-EU message and vows to fight corruption. But her support may have slipped during her first term amid an economy that was ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic and rising tensions with Russia. As president, Sandu was instrumental in securing Moldova's candidacy for future EU membership, an achievement given extra urgency following Russia's full-scale invasion of bordering Ukraine a few months earlier. Throughout her presidency, Sandu has been criticized by pro-Kremlin political parties who have accused her of stoking conflict with Moscow. Stoianoglo, 57, from Gagauzia -- an autonomous region of Moldova with pro-Russia sentiment -- was Moldova's prosecutor-general between 2019 and 2021. He campaigned on a law-and-order theme, although critics have slammed him for what they say was a failure to address high-level corruption during his time in office. Stoianoglo has claimed he holds no political affiliation and has rejected accusations that he is 'Moscow's man.' His reaction to the war in Ukraine has been ambiguous -- expressing a 'negative attitude' toward the conflict but not directly condemning Russia for the invasion. Although he has often taken anti-EU stances, he is also a Romanian -- and thus EU -- citizen, and his daughter reportedly works at the European Central Bank. After media reports revealed that he possessed a Romanian passport, he argued that he obtained it in 2019 in an 'apolitical context,' without elaborating. Most of Moldova was part of Romania until the end of World War II and many Moldovans also hold Romanian citizenship, which gives them the opportunity to travel freely to the EU and work there. Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries with a sizeable Russian minority and a Moscow-backed separatist region, Transdniester, located on the left bank of the Dniester River.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbShEIIBtQNfNv	2024-11-03T15:48:48-08:00	
Russia-Africa Expo 2024: Evaluating Results And Achievements – In...	After the first and second summits held in Sochi and St. Petersburg, strengthening economic cooperation and deepening Russian-African business relations have taken the central stage which is especially important in the context of global geopolitical changes. Africa is a huge and rapidly developing market that can become a strategic partner for Russia, says Louis Gouend, founder of Hello Africa and founding Executive Director of the African Business Club. In this interview taken by Kester Kenn Klomegah late October, after the first international B2B business forum 'Russia-Africa Expo 2024' Made in Africa, Louis Gouend offered some useful insights into the dynamics why Russia and Africa ultimately have to forge an engagement in business and economic sectors, to expand cooperation in both regions, and further highlighted the existing challenges facing the evolving entrepreneurial initiatives in Russia and Africa. Here are the interview excerpts. Estimate the achievements and results of the historic first Russia-Africa B2B forum 2024 organized under the auspices of RusAfro Club and African Discussion Club (ABC) at the Friendship University (RUDN)? The first international B2B business forum 'Russia-Africa Expo 2024' Made in Africa was a great success, demonstrating wide interest from both Russian and African participants. The forum brought together more than 500 participants representing 15 African diplomatic missions, more than 20 African countries, about 50 business representatives from Africa and more than 150 Russian companies, business associations and investment agencies. These figures show a high degree of involvement and willingness to cooperate. The plenary session allowed Russian and African entrepreneurs to share knowledge about the specifics of the business environment in Africa and Russia, to identify the most promising sectors for investment and trade. This contributes to a better understanding between partners and facilitates the search for mutually beneficial projects. It is especially worth noting the preparation for signing several contracts for the supply of products from Africa to Russia, which is direct evidence of the success of the forum and its real business effectiveness. It is planned to make the forum an annual event and expand its program, which is a good sign for the continuation and deepening of Russian-African business relations. At the exhibition accompanying the forum, participants could get acquainted with African agricultural, cosmetic, souvenir products and tourism opportunities, which also contributed to the strengthening of cultural and business ties. Have the speakers and participating guests critically identified existing challenges, roadblocks and other factors hindering expected levels of bilateral relations in trade and economic cooperation between Russia and Africa? Discussion of challenges and obstacles to bilateral relations: During the forum, key challenges facing Russian-African business relations were identified. One of these challenges is logistics and transportation of goods, which was mentioned in his speech by the chairman of the subcommittee on logistics and supply chains Andrey Severilov. He emphasized the need to optimize the existing infrastructure, which will help make the transportation of goods more efficient and less expensive. Another obstacle is the financial instruments necessary for trade with African countries. Marina Nesterenko presented current financial instruments that can facilitate interaction between entrepreneurs on both sides. Significant points were also identified from the African side. For example, Ngo Towada Marie Caroline from Cameroon spoke about the potential of MADE IN AFRICA products for the Russian market. Such presentations help to identify and initiate discussions on the obstacles facing bilateral trade. After that admirable forum held mid-October 2024, what policy measures would you suggest or recommend, as an experienced expert, to authorities in the Russian Federation? Recommendations for the Russian authorities: 1. Specialized trade zones and investments: The establishment of specialized trade zones for African partners in Russia can significantly simplify logistics and speed up customs clearance processes. It may also be useful to create programs that support joint investment projects in strategically important sectors such as agriculture, logistics and creative industries. 2. Educational programs and consulting support: The development of educational programs aimed at raising awareness among Russian businessmen about the specifics of working in African markets will help to avoid many mistakes and speed up the process of entering new markets. A good example is specialized courses and seminars conducted with the participation of experts from both sides. 3. Diplomatic efforts: Intensifying diplomatic efforts to create a favorable investment climate and provide legal guarantees for Russian and African entrepreneurs will be an important step towards strengthening bilateral relations. The development of bilateral agreements on investment protection and prevention of double taxation will help increase trust and investment. Would these support Russia's relations with Africa, especially during this time of multifaceted collaboration with Asia and Africa as an integral part of Global South? Development of Russia's relations with Africa: Strengthening trade and economic ties with Africa will help diversify Russia's foreign economic partners, which is especially important in the context of global geopolitical changes. Africa is a huge and rapidly developing market that can become a strategic partner for Russia. Africa, as part of the Global South, offers Russia unique opportunities to intensify its foreign economic policy. Given the growth of consumption and economic development in African countries, trade between Russia and Africa has the potential to increase significantly. The Russia-Africa Expo 2024 Forum was an important step in this direction, demonstrating a high level of mutual interest and readiness for further cooperation. The B2B meetings held on the sidelines of the forum allowed for direct contacts between entrepreneurs, which is the basis for further successful cooperation. It is especially valuable that the event found a positive response among the participants, which indicates the need and demand for such platforms for dialogue and cooperation. It is important to continue to develop and deepen these relationships, turning the forum into an annual event.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSj-JSHNZ8ptM	2024-11-03T15:40:31-08:00	
UN Experts Say Houthis Collaborated With Al-Qaeda To Weaken Yemen...	By Saeed Al-Batati Yemen’s Houthi militia has armed Al-Qaeda militants, provided them with a haven, and facilitated attacks on Yemeni government-controlled areas, UN experts said. The Houthis have also made millions of dollars through sea piracy. Disclosing the strange partnership between the Houthis and Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, including Al-Shabaab in Somalia, the UN Panel of Experts on Yemen said in their report that the Houthis and Al-Qaeda agreed to put aside their differences and focus on weakening the Yemeni government by transferring weapons, coordinating attacks on Yemeni government forces, cooperating to smuggle weapons into Yemen, sharing intelligence information, and providing haven for the other’s fighters. 'That opportunistic alliance is characterized by cooperation in security and intelligence, offering safe havens for each other’s members, reinforcing their respective strongholds and coordinating efforts to target the Government’s forces,' the report said, adding that the Houthis also released incarcerated Al-Qaeda fighters convicted of terrorism and provided Al-Qaeda with drones and rockets. 'Since the beginning of 2024, the two groups have coordinated operations directly. They agreed that the Houthis would transfer four uncrewed aerial vehicles, as well as thermal rockets and explosive devices, and that the Houthis would provide training to AQAP (Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) fighters.' Citing deadly drone attacks by Al-Qaeda in Abyan, Yemeni military commanders have lately accused the Houthis of supplying Al-Qaeda with drones and other weapons, as well as sheltering Al-Qaeda militants who stage hit-and-run attacks on government troops. The 537-page report, which covers the period from Sept. 1, 2023, to July 31, 2024, described Hezbollah as 'one of the most important' supporters of the Houthis in Yemen, assisting them in decision-making, field military support through the use and assembly of weapons and fighting techniques, increasing their financial revenues, recruitment and brainwashing techniques, and managing Houthi media propaganda. The Houthis have a variety of revenue sources to support their military efforts, including selling rare and valuable antiques and antiquities abroad, minting coins and printing currencies, imposing levies on telecom companies in areas under their control, confiscating assets of companies, including Yemenia airways revenues, smuggling weapons and banned pesticides, and imposing levies on oil imports to the country. 'The Houthis have been amassing substantial illegal resources through the organized smuggling of various items such as weapons, drugs, telecommunications equipment, prohibited goods such as banned pesticides, non-permissible medicines, and cultural heritage property,' the report said. It added: 'The Panel's investigations revealed that Houthi-appointed authorities collected approximately 994 billion Yemeni rials in the name of customs duties on imports of fuel through ports under their control during the period from April 1, 2022, to June 30, 2024, under the exchange rate prevailing in government-controlled areas.' However, during the Houthi campaign against ships that the Yemeni militia claimed were in support of the Palestinian people, the Houthis have collected approximately $180 million a month from ships to allow them to sail in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden without being attacked, and a high-ranking Houthi leader facilitated the transfer of the money from the shipping agencies to the militia’s coffers. 'The sources estimate the Houthis’ earnings from these illegal safe-transit fees to be about $180 million per month. The Panel has not been able to verify this information independently.' The UN experts also accused the Houthis of recruiting and exploiting Ethiopian migrants — who arrive in the country by the thousands each year — to fight alongside them against the Yemeni government while also facilitating drug trafficking. The Yemeni government, as well as local and international rights groups, have previously said that the Houthis recruited thousands of African migrants to fight the Yemeni government. 'Other sources informed the Panel that the Houthis have also recruited mercenaries from the Tigray and Oromo Ethiopian tribes, at salaries ranging from $80 to $100. The Panel has been unable to verify that information and continues to investigate,' the experts said. The Yemeni government welcomed the findings of the UN report and urged the world to designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization and cut off their financial resources. Yemen’s Information Minister Moammar Al-Eryani said in a post on X that the collusion between the Houthis and other terrorist organizations is intended to 'weaken the Yemeni state, destabilizing security and stability in liberated areas,' thereby undermining maritime navigation security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSl62ZFRs2unL	2024-11-03T15:37:24-08:00	
IRGC Deputy Chief Says Iran Planning Retaliatory Operation Agains...	Iran will certainly carry out a retaliatory military operation against the Israeli regime, a deputy commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said. Asked whether an ‘Operation True Promise III’ against the Zionist regime is on the agenda, Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi told reporters at the Sharif University of Tehran on Sunday that the operation will definitely be carried out. 'It is not possible to comment on its details,' the general stated. On October 1, Iran responded to the Israeli assassination of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan by launching as many as 200 ballistic missiles toward the Zionist regime’s military and intelligence bases all over the occupied Palestinian territories. In the early hours of October 26, the Zionist regime attacked a number of military sites in Iran, which resulted in the martyrdom of four servicemen and a civilian. In remarks on October 27, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei emphasized the necessity of disrupting the flawed calculations of the Israeli regime regarding Iran. 'They’re making a miscalculation with respect to Iran… our officials should be the ones to assess and precisely apprehend what needs to be done and do whatever is in the best interests of this country and nation. They (the enemy) must be made to realize who the Iranian people are and what the Iranian youth are like,' the Leader added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSiBMFh7WUnkK	2024-11-03T15:34:43-08:00	
China Restricts Young Tibetan Monks In ‘Prison-Like’ Schools	(UCA News) -- Tibetans have accused the pro-Beijing authorities in the region of housing hundreds of young Tibetan Buddhist monks in prison-like conditions at government-run boarding schools, says a report. The students forcibly transferred from the Kirti Monastery schools in Sichuan province’s Ngaba county are not even permitted to leave the school grounds or meet their parents, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Oct. 31. 'Since being forcibly removed from the monastery, the students have been denied contact with their parents and receive inadequate medical care when ill,' RFA reported, citing an unnamed source. 'When parents request to meet their children, they are given various excuses about needing higher-level approval and ultimately face threats of imprisonment if they persist,' the unnamed source added. The students between the ages of 6-17 are taught exclusively in Mandarin, RFA reported. Some of the students who attempted to escape the school were apprehended and are now being treated 'like criminals' and forbidden from leaving the school grounds. Over 1,000 young Tibetan monks were transferred from the Kirti Monastery to state-administered 'colonial style' boarding schools in July. The authorities closed another school at Lhamo Kirti Monastery in Dzoge county, affecting some 600 students.x The authorities had compelled parents to sign agreements ensuring that their children would be enrolled in government-run schools, where they would undergo state-approved 'patriotic education.' Pro-Beijing authorities in Tibet cite China’s regulations on religious affairs which mandate that the students at monastic schools must be 18 or older, display patriotism, and be compliant with national laws. Tibetan critics of China’s communist-led government allege that these regulations are part of a broader policy to eradicate the use of the Tibetan language, suppress Tibetan culture, and enforce 'patriotic education.' China’s patriotic education policy mandates that the love of China and the ruling Chinese Communist Party be incorporated into work and study for all citizens. The Chinese authorities in the region have also intensified surveillance and restrictions on Tibetans in Ngaba county following the school closures. A high-ranking official from China’s United Front Work Department is permanently stationed in Ngaba for several months, overseeing control measures over both the monastery and the local community. The authorities have also unleashed a crackdown on any form of communication with the outside world, RFA reported. In October, the authorities in Dzoge seized the phones of monks and teachers of Lhamo Kirti Monastery, accusing them of sharing the news of school closures. In September, the authorities arrested four Tibetans, including two monks from Kirti Monastery, as well as two laypersons in Ngaba, accusing them of contacting Tibetans outside the region. The Chinese government has claimed that the communication between Tibetans and their family members and friends abroad undermines national unity as a reason for communication restrictions, RFA reported. Tibetans have denounced Beijing’s surveillance, accusing the authorities of violating their human rights and trying to eradicate their religious, linguistic, and cultural identity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSucLJFo2FbkV	2024-11-03T15:32:12-08:00	
Boosting Immune Cell Tolerance May Help Prevent Early Pregnancy L...	Recurrent pregnancy loss can be devastating and exert a major impact on women, their partners, and society more broadly, but currently there are few options for effective therapies. Over several years, there has been mounting evidence that a deficiency in special immune cells called T-regulatory (Treg) cells, which are essential for preparing the uterus for receptive embryo implantation, are a factor in early pregnancy loss. A new study in The American Journal of Pathology, published by Elsevier, details evidence in a pre-clinical animal model that boosting these cells improves the chance of healthy pregnancy. The work raises the prospect of evaluating this intervention in women who are prone to experience early pregnancy loss, a common condition affecting natural conception and women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Lead investigator Sarah A. Robertson, PhD, The Robinson Research Institute and School of Biomedicine, the University of Adelaide, Australia, explains, 'Previous studies have found low numbers of Treg cells in women who experienced early pregnancy loss as well as changes that lead Treg cells to have functional problems that are reminiscent of autoimmune diseases. This can impair the implantation process and suppress development of the early placenta. Therefore, Treg cells provide an attractive target for interventions to improve maternal immune tolerance and protect against pregnancy disorders caused by immune imbalance in at-risk women.' The researchers utilized a mouse model of early pregnancy loss to test a new candidate treatment intervention in which the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is combined with specific antibodies to target Treg cells. Like humans with recurrent pregnancy loss, the mice have an immune defect that arises at conception and results in later fetal loss. The researchers administered the IL-2 antibody complex (called IL-2/JES6-1) in the time between conception and embryo implantation to the miscarriage-prone mice and also in mice that have had healthy pregnancies. They observed significant changes to the number and phenotype of the Treg cells in the uterus, blood, and other tissues in both groups of mice. The expanded pool of Treg cells exhibited features that are characteristic of robust pregnancy tolerance and were effective in preventing generation of detrimental effector T cells that threaten pregnancy success. Importantly, the miscarriage-prone mice showed markedly improved pregnancy outcomes after treatment, and their miscarriage rate was consistently reduced from 30% to 11%, which is within the normal range for mice. Professor Robertson adds, 'The results show that efficacy of the IL-2/JES6-1 treatment might be achieved with lower doses, which will likely be important as we consider how to translate the findings to human application. Another notable observation was that treatment in very early pregnancy, even before the embryos commence implantation, has a profound effect on the progression of the pregnancy with lasting benefit into late gestation. This is consistent with growing evidence pointing to embryo implantation and early placental development being the turning point for pregnancy success.' The study demonstrates the potential of targeting Treg cells and provides pivotal evidence to justify human studies; however, it will be important to undertake clinical trials to assemble evidence of safety and benefit in humans before the treatment can be recommended.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSjMAmASR8tUb	2024-11-03T15:27:44-08:00	
The Changing Climate Could Increase Mobility Of Toxic Metals In S...	The changes scientists expect in the climate could cause the toxic metals naturally occurring in soils to become more mobile, destabilize ecosystems and increasingly enter the human food chain via agriculture. Such scenarios are particularly likely to occur in slightly acidic soils, which make up around two thirds of all soils. These are the conclusion of an experimental study on agricultural soils tested for the metal cadmium, which can cause cancer. The study was headed by assistant professor Marie Muehe from Plant Biogeochemistry at the University of Tübingen and the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ). The results have been published in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environment. By 2100, global temperatures are predicted to rise by two to four degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. In that time, the current carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere is expected to double. Here in Germany, the amount of precipitation could decrease slightly. Marie Muehe says the further effects are hard to predict: 'Climate change and metals each separately place stress on the microorganisms in the soil, collectively referred to as the soil microbiome. We sought to investigate the previously little-known combined effects of these influences,' she says. There are toxic metals in every soil on our planet, says Muehe, but in bound form they are of little significance for soil organisms and plant cultivation. The situation changes when the metals are mobilized. 'In our study, we examined cadmium, the classic example of a toxic metal found in the soil,' she says. Cadmium has a toxic effect on all living organisms because it inhibits physiological processes in the cells. Complex interactions In the experiment, the research team filled columns with agricultural soil provided by various farms. 'We ran these soils through a regular growing season in Germany in the laboratory, but under the assumed climate conditions of the year 2100,' explains the study's lead author Sören Drabesch, also from the University of Tübingen and the UFZ. 'We investigated the changes in the soil and soil microbiome over time.' The research team found that the mobility of the cadmium present in the soil will increase on today’s conditions by around 40 percent in slightly acidic soils in the summer temperatures of future climate conditions. 'It can then be found in higher concentrations in the pore water of the soil and influences the soil microbiome, or the activity pattern of various microorganisms,' says Drabesch. 'Certain microorganisms become more active, utilize more nitrogen and thus further acidify the soil environment.' In some soils, cadmium levels are set to rise to such an extent that the soil microbiome suffers and the ecosystem has to adapt. By contrast, no comparable problems were found in soils that were originally slightly alkaline. Even under changed climatic conditions, the cadmium was not mobilized to any great extent. The study shows how complex the interactions are between the changing climate, the substances in the soil and the soil microbiome, says Muehe. 'Ecosystems, including agricultural ecosystems, could be massively disturbed by increased amounts of mobile cadmium in the future. This could also change the greenhouse gas emissions caused by agriculture and the mobile cadmium could end up in crops which could then be harmful to human health.' These developments must continue to be monitored, the researchers say.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdNxLS2_DxbSi4bcCK3KK5Z	2024-11-03T15:23:09-08:00	
Pakistan’s Youth: Opportunities, Challenges, And The Digital Volc...	Pakistan is at a crunch moment in its history, when decisions made today will shape the country's course for future generations. With 170 million young people aged 18 to 30, the country has an extraordinary demographic advantage. This youth bulge, if properly utilised, has the potential to convert Pakistan into a financial superpower. However, the opposite side of this demographic dividend is as scary. There are 25 million youngsters out of school, 60 million on TikTok, and 70 million on Facebook. These figures reflect a technologically savvy youth that lacks access to formal education, crucial skills, and organised direction. With 230 million phones in circulation, Pakistan's youth are firmly entrenched in the digital world, absorbing information. This uncontrolled arena poses significant concerns, including the dissemination of disinformation, digital radicalisation, and societal instability. The question is, what is the government doing to solve this issue? More significantly, how can Pakistan leverage this complicated dilemma into an opportunity? Demographic Dividend or Demographic Disaster? A predominantly young population is both a benefit and a challenge. If educated and employed, this demographic may drive economic growth and social improvement. However, without access to decent education, technical skills, and jobs, these young people may become disillusioned, destitute, and vulnerable to radicalisation. History demonstrates that jobless youth in many nations have led to societal discontent and bloodshed. Pakistan is in danger of suffering the same destiny unless it takes strong action to invest in education, skill development, and digital literacy. According to UNESCO's 2022 study, Pakistan's youth literacy rate is only 72.7%, indicating a need for immediate development if the country is to properly harness its youth bulge. The government must enhance educational opportunities and vocational training programs to guarantee that young people are prepared not only for traditional employment but also for the emerging digital economy. A systematic focus on education, critical thinking, and creativity is required to prepare this generation to prosper in a rapidly changing environment. The Role of Education and Critical Thinking Education is the cornerstone of any thriving nation. However, education in Pakistan must go beyond memorisation and rote learning. It must emphasise critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities that will equip young brains to face complicated issues. These skills are necessary not just for personal growth, but also for country prosperity. In the twenty-first century, where technology and global integration are transforming the world at an unprecedented rate, only well-rounded, critical thinkers will prosper. Furthermore, critical thinking is becoming increasingly necessary in the digital age, in which young people are continuously assaulted with information from several sources. Youth are susceptible to manipulation due to their inability to distinguish between legitimate and false information. The proliferation of fake news, conspiracy theories, and extremist ideologies on platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube can have serious social and political implications. As a result, educational reforms must incorporate digital literacy and media analysis into curricula, teaching students how to fact-check material, identify credible sources, and assess content objectively. Innovation should also be a top priority, encouraging young Pakistanis to think imaginatively and build their answers to economic, environmental, and security concerns. Security Challenges and Cyber Threats The value of an educated, critical-thinking young population goes beyond economic growth; it is also crucial for national security. Pakistan's importance in fighting terrorism and supporting regional stability has long been acknowledged. However, the nature of security threats is changing, as cyberattacks, misinformation operations, and digital warfare provide new concerns. In 2023, Pakistan had a 17% rise in cyber-attacks over the previous year. In such a scenario, it is critical that the youth—who are profoundly connected to the digital world—be prepared to repel cyber threats and actively participate in public diplomacy to combat disinformation. Educated young may play an important role in national security by inventing new technologies, combating fake news, and defending the country from digital threats. What Should the Government Do? The government cannot afford to remain complacent about these difficulties. To turn Pakistan's youth bulge into a productive force, a comprehensive national approach is required. This includes: Expanding Educational Access: Pakistan must prioritise education investment by expanding the number of schools, enhancing teacher quality, and enrolling out-of-school children. Promoting Digital Literacy: To safeguard young people from the dangers of misinformation, the education system must include media literacy and critical thinking skills. The government might undertake awareness efforts to teach kids how to spot false news and check information sources. Vocational Training and Entrepreneurship: With few job possibilities in the formal sector, the emphasis must move to skill development and entrepreneurship. Government-backed initiatives can provide young people with the resources they need to start small companies, lowering unemployment. Regulating Social Media Platforms: While free expression is crucial, unchecked digital platforms may cause social and political instability. The government must implement balanced laws to control material on social media platforms, ensuring are not used to disseminate hatred, ignorance, or extremist beliefs. Engaging Youth in National Policy-Making: Giving young people a say in national policy decisions may instil a feeling of duty and belonging. Platforms for youngsters to express their concerns and ideas can also assist close the gap between government policy and public expectations. Conclusion Pakistan's youth population has a unique opportunity to shape the future. However, failing to engage in education, skill development, and media literacy risks turning this potential into a burden. With millions of young people using digital platforms, the government must take quick action to lead, control, and educate this generation before the digital volcano bursts. To give young people the resources they need to succeed, the government, educational institutions, civic society, and the commercial sector must work together. If properly exploited, Pakistan's young have the potential to drive economic growth, social advancement, and national stability. However, if allowed uncontrolled, illiterate and misguided young threaten the country's future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcsH4rcofTnjbntg0J9u_75	2024-11-03T15:01:31-08:00	
Countering The Russia–North Korea Alliance Requires A Policy Shif...	By Yeji Chung On 13 October, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that North Korea was transferring people to the armed forces in Russia. A few days later, Ukrainian intelligence announced that the first North Korean military units had arrived in the war zone in Russia’s Kursk Oblast. Intelligence estimates suggest North Korea has sent over three million artillery shells to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from 2022–24. Moscow has dispatched high-level officials to Pyongyang to tour weapons factories and assets. Anti-tank systems, rifles, rocket launchers and other assets are likely part of what are now regular container shipments from North Korea to Russia. The countries have reforged bilateral ties on the back of these transactions, marked by a new security pact signed by North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in June 2024. The treaty features a Cold War-era military intervention provision that raises the stakes for security in the Korean peninsula and beyond. But this new pact does not present particularly novel threats for the United States and its allies. Many provisions in the newly signed ‘Treaty on the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ reflect activities between the two countries that have been going on for years. This highlights the inadequate and ineffective intervention by the international community, which permitted this dangerous friendship to flourish. The part of the Treaty that has received the most attention is Article 4, which stipulates that both nations must ‘immediately provide military and other assistance by all means available’ if either faces an armed attack or goes to war. North Korea has been supporting Russia since it first attacked Ukraine, first diplomatically at the United Nations and soon after with artillery shells and missiles. Illicit arms transfers that contravene international sanctions were recorded as early as 2022 and included artillery shells and rockets from North Korea. The recent agreement between North Korea and Russia appears to do little more than reinforce the status quo. The alliance has already been built up, with few obstacles and little interference from the United States and its allies, who appear confined to rely on sanctions and financial penalties with increasingly little impact. But obstacles remain for the US–South Korea alliance and effective deterrence. Chief among them is that North Korean issues have not been a primary concern for US President Joe Biden’s administration, and international interest appears to have waned. The 2024 G7 summit in Italy focused on development, Ukraine and the Middle East, but not North Korea, as it has in past years. This inattention gives North Korea and Russia an even freer hand to strengthen their bilateral ties with little scrutiny or pressure. South Korea, for its part, is increasingly questioning the reliability of US security commitments. 76.6 per cent of South Koreans expressed the belief that the country should develop its own nuclear weapons. Former US president Donald Trump, who may return to the White House in November 2024, regularly criticised South Korea as a free rider unworthy of an alliance and engaged in extortionary tactics to try and convince Seoul to pay billions to keep US military bases open. A new administration, led by US presidential candidate Kamala Harris, would continue existing deterrence dialogues, such as the Nuclear Consultation Group and the Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group, further strengthening the alliance. But doubts about inaction on Pyongyang will likely persist, even if Harris takes office. During her acceptance speech as the Democratic Party nominee for the US presidential election, Harris said she will not ‘cozy up’ to Kim, reflecting a probable continuity of the Biden administration’s North Korea policy. It is increasingly clear that North Korea’s nuclear program is so advanced that the focus should shift to preventing its use rather than revisiting denuclearisation discussions, but Washington seems unwilling to entertain this prospect. The United States needs to move off its demand of complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation, and instead focus on ‘[disrupting] the arms tradebetween Russia and North Korea’. To accomplish this, South Korea and the United States have to strengthen alliance coordination on arms trade intelligence between Russia and North Korea. The United States reported that Russia has secured more than 16,500 containers of munitions from North Korea since September 2023, while South Korea cited a lower figure of 13,000 since mid-2022. This discrepancy in container counts points to a lack of seamless intelligence-sharing and monitoring, despite the two allies’ earlier commitment to strengthen security cooperation to counter North Korea. Washington’s strict focus on the irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea highlights a broader issue of misaligned priorities and insufficient coordination. Without this policy shift, the US–South Korea alliance risks another four years of ineffective pressure on Pyongyang as it escalates its nuclear ambitions and forges greater ties with other US adversaries. Sooner or later the United States and South Korea will need to consider concessions to reengage North Korea in negotiations. Seoul must also prepare to adapt its policies and work with new US leadership after the presidential election.

Iraqi Kurdistan’s Parliamentary Elections: Resilience, Challenges...	By Mohammed A. Salih (FPRI) -- The Kurdistan Region of Iraq finally held its long-overdue parliamentary elections on October 20, two years past the original due date. Final results announced by the Iraqi electoral commission on October 30 showed that the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) won 39 and 23 seats, respectively, out of the 100-member parliament. A relatively nascent opposition group, the New Generation Movement, won 15 seats, coming third. Islamist groups secured 10 seats, making up 10 percent of the newly elected parliament, in contrast to the Iraqi federal Parliament that is dominated by various Islamist forces. Despite the absence of significant political changes, the elections hold important implications for the Kurdistan Region’s future and broader US policy in the region. Continuity and Renewed Legitimacy The first significant takeaway from the election results is the continued dominance of the KDP and PUK, which have shaped Kurdish politics for over five decades. This duopoly, though frequently criticized for fostering corruption and nepotism, remains largely unshaken due to its entrenched patronage networks and the deep sentimental ties many Kurds have to the parties, rooted in their historical struggle for Kurdish rights. These election results suggest that these two parties will remain central players in Kurdistan’s political landscape for the foreseeable future. Second, despite these enduring dynamics, the elections mark a crucial moment of renewal for the Kurdistan Region’s executive and legislative branches which have been in a lame-duck status for the past couple of years. The Iraqi Federal Supreme Court dissolved the Kurdish Parliament in May 2023, after it exceeded its four-year term. Despite not being a sovereign state, the Kurdistan Region has been an important actor within Iraq and its surrounding region, largely due to the de facto independence it has enjoyed since the end of the First Gulf War in 1991. Moreover, Iraq’s Kurds have played a pivotal role in shaping the country’s political and security dynamics, both before and after the removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 2003. If managed effectively, this renewed popular legitimacy could strengthen Kurdistan’s hand in negotiations with Baghdad over revenue-sharing, oil exports, and confronting the threats posed by pro-Iranian factions within Iraq. Third, despite some heated and at times inflammatory rhetoric—particularly from the PUK—the election process unfolded in a mostly peaceful, civic, and well-organized manner. Although the political playing field was uneven, and some smaller opposition groups alleged vote-rigging without presenting concrete evidence, the elections were, by most accounts, largely fair and transparent, setting a new standard for Kurdish elections since 1992. This was further confirmed by congratulatory statements from US and EU diplomatic missions in Iraq, which commended the success of the electoral process. Fourth, these elections took place against a backdrop of increasing regional turbulence and the looming threat of escalation, possibly even all-out war, between Israel and the Iran-led camp. While Iraq officially remains neutral, powerful Iran-backed Shia militias, which wield significant influence over Iraq’s security and political sectors, have been active belligerents on Iran’s side, frequently striking Israeli and US targets since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza. The fact that the Kurdistan Region held elections amid such volatility signals a strong desire for normalcy and stability among Iraqi Kurds, as well as a clear declaration of their intent to remain distanced from escalating regional hostilities. US Policy and the Need for Strategic Engagement Now that the elections are over, the focus shifts to the formation of the new cabinet of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which presents both challenges and opportunities for US engagement. The United States, which has long enjoyed a strong relationship with Kurds, should play a hands-on role in facilitating dialogue between Kurdish parties to ensure a timely and effective government-formation process. Kurdistan’s ability to form a stable government is critical not only for its own governance, but also for broader US strategic interests in Iraq and the Middle East. Some policymakers in Washington might be tempted to see Kurdistan’s internal politics as a secondary concern, particularly in light of the more pressing regional crisis between Israel and Iran. However, the United States should recognize the strategic value of assisting Kurds. This moment in Iraqi Kurdistan should be understood within the broader historical context of US-Kurdish relations and the mutual benefits that have emerged and can continue to grow from this partnership. Although the Kurdistan Region is a non-sovereign, non-state entity, it has maintained a unique relationship with the United States since the 1990s—one that, in some ways, parallels the US-Taiwan relationship, albeit at a smaller scale and with less formal commitment. Since the end of the First Gulf War, Washington has served as the guarantor of Kurdish security in Iraq. In return, Kurds played a crucial role in the removal of Saddam Hussein, were instrumental in the post-2003 political process, and helped develop Iraq’s political and security system. However, since the unsuccessful 2017 Kurdish independence referendum and in the face of sustained attacks by Iran and its Iraqi proxies, there has been growing concern in Kurdistan that the United States is not as committed to the relationship as it once was. This has created space for increased interference from Iran and Turkey, often to Kurdistan’s detriment. By assisting with the government-formation process in Erbil, the United States would signal its renewed commitment to the partnership with Kurds at this juncture and strengthen the autonomous region’s stability without any cost in terms of US resources or lives. From a broader regional perspective, Washington must consider the significant role Iran and its allied groups have played in undermining KRG autonomy in recent years. As Tehran has expanded its political and military influence across Iraqi Kurdistan—especially areas under KDP control—it remains the only region resisting Iranian domination. Notably, these KDP-controlled areas also host two of the four key sites for US military presence in Iraq. Iran and its proxies, through a combination of lawfare, economic/financial pressures, and political maneuvers, have systematically attempted to erode the KRG’s economic foundation and exert control over its internal political dynamics. This interference is perhaps most visible in the Federal Supreme Court’s politicized rulings that targeted Kurdistan’s energy and financial sectors. Additionally, the Court’s redesign of the KRG electoral law have further deepened Kurdistan’s internal tensions, making it difficult for any single party to secure a majority and exacerbating instability. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that while US military presence in Iraq faces growing hostility in many regions, Kurdistan remains a steadfast ally. The United States and Iraq have agreed to withdraw most American forces by 2026, yet Kurdistan’s Harir airfield is expected to remain a key base for US troops beyond that deadline. The strategic importance of Kurdistan becomes even more apparent when considering its role in the US-led campaign to counter the Islamic State, better known as ISIS. For the past couple of decades, Iraqi Kurdistan has played a vital role in countering Sunni jihadism across Iraq and the broader region. It also serves as a crucial logistical hub for the US mission in Syria, where ISIS remains a serious and resurging threat, and continued US cooperation with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces is essential for maintaining regional security. The US mission in Syria, which also monitors and contains Iranian and Russian expansionist efforts, heavily relies on the stability and support of Iraqi Kurdistan. The unwavering Kurdish commitment to its partnership with the United States has intensified animosity from Iran and pro-Iran factions in Baghdad, as these groups have led efforts to expel US troops from Iraq. This push is part of Iran’s broader strategy to reshape the regional order and diminish US influence. To apply pressure on the Kurds, Iran and its Iraqi proxies have launched numerous drone and missile attacks on Kurdish targets, including energy fields and business figures. Kurdistan’s energy sector is crucial to Iraq’s energy independence and electricity supply—key issues driving public frustration and discontent with the government. Despite immense pressure from Iran and its allies, Kurdish parties have consistently resisted supporting or voting for the expulsion of US forces from Iraq, both in 2020 and more recently in Februarythis year. Given these dynamics, it is critical for the United States to support the timely formation of a broad-based KRG cabinet with a strong popular mandate, especially in its dealings with Baghdad. This will help ensure the Kurdish region can resist external pressures while maintaining its autonomy. In promoting dialogue and compromise, Washington should particularly urge the PUK, under its new leadership, not to obstruct the government-formation process by holding unrealistic expectations about its share of power. Weakened by internal divisions over the past decade and a half, the PUK—now with nearly half the popularity of the KDP—still expects an equal share of power in the Kurdistan Region’s governing institutions. The party’s new leaders are holding onto this maximalist stance to signal strength to their base, harking back to the party’s heyday from 1991 to 2009, despite their significantly diminished share of the votes. In an effort to compensate for their shrinking popular support and to counterbalance the KDP’s dominance, the PUK has increasingly leaned on Iran and Iran-backed actors in Iraq. This dynamic risks turning the PUK into a vehicle for destabilizing Iranian influence in the Kurdistan Region, deepening internal divisions and potentially prompting greater political intervention from an increasingly more assertive and concerned Turkey. US mediation should encourage the PUK to adopt more realistic expectations, while ensuring that the KDP remains flexible in expanding the government’s power base and accommodating meaningful participation and partnership by others, particularly the PUK, in the governing institutions. Amid escalating regional instability and a wider region becoming less amicable to the United States, it is critical to maintain the Kurdistan Region as a stable safe haven and to avoid it becoming a political battleground for regional powers to settle scores. Therefore, it is essential to prevent Iranian and Turkish intervention, which would further complicate an already challenging but still manageable situation. The US embassy in Baghdad should take an active role in mediating the government-formation process, but support and engagement from higher levels of the US government are equally crucial. This includes senior officials from the State Department in Washington, the White House, and the National Security Council’s Middle East team. For this process to succeed, Kurdish leaders must recognize the strategic value of maintaining strong ties with the United States and avoid jeopardizing the relationship for personal or factional gains. For Washington, this is a low-cost, high-reward opportunity to strengthen bilateral ties during a time of uncertainty. Ultimately, it would send a clear message to regional actors, in Baghdad and beyond, that the United States remains committed to its distinctive relationship with Kurds and will not allow the weakening of the KRG.

Trumpist Conservatism: How It Differs From Classical American Con...	Did the Republican Party sell its soul to the devil by choosing Donald Trump as its nominee for the third time? How can it support a man who defies all the safeguards of democracy and radically reinterprets conservative beliefs? The Republican Party has fully embraced Donald Trump, who has represented it in three presidential elections (2016, 2020, 2024). The last time a political figure dominated an American party with such absolute power was during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four presidential campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s. Whatever the outcome of the November 2024 election, Trump’s longevity has already had a profound effect on his party. Based on an analysis of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024 and Trump’s campaign since then, this essay seeks to define the ideological positioning of the 'Trumpified' Republican Party by situating it within the long history of conservatism in the United States. Republican Classics Trump’s rhetoric is reasonably consistent with an ideological core that upholds the Republican classics established by Ronald Reagan since the 1980s. On the economic front, promises of tax cuts and support for growth through supply-side policies clearly dominate this approach. Trump repeatedly boasts about the huge tax cuts passed by Congress during his first term (2016-2020). He often claims that these tax cuts are the largest in history, a point he is right to emphasize given that his 2017 tax reform surpasses the already impressive tax cuts implemented under Ronald Reagan (1981) or George W. Bush (2002, 2003). In a campaign where his economic agenda has been extremely ambiguous, taxes are Trump’s single unambiguous promise: 'No tax on tips!' - the goal being to exempt from taxation the tips earned by 'waitresses, golf caddies, and chauffeurs,' as he stated at the Milwaukee Convention. Another 'classic' staple of Republican electoral campaigns: the culture wars. Indeed, the Milwaukee Convention ticked all the boxes expected by the party’s evangelical base: rejection of trans gender claims (Democrats 'can’t even define what a woman is!' complained Florida Governor Ron de Santis, while Trump’s son, Don Jr, accused 'left-wing teachers' of 'teaching our children that there are 57 different genders'); the denunciation of the U.S. government’s decision, following the Black Lives Matter movement, to rename numerous U.S. military installations bearing the names of Southern generals; or the repeated promise, ad nauseam, to fight the left’s 'socialist-Marxist utopia' that seeks to replace traditional American values ('faith, patriotism, work ethic and family') with 'race, gender, sexuality and climate change.' The Republican mission remains unchanged: to save traditional America. A Renewed Corpus The Trumpian ideological framework adheres to the essential tenets of American conservatism while simultaneously instituting a significant doctrinal transformation regarding foreign policy and the connection to populism. The Republican Party had long embraced isolationist thinking, but the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the entry of the United States into the war discredited it. Later, during the Cold War, Republicans adopted an Atlanticist, interventionist vision, which explains, for example, their support for the Vietnam War and Ronald Reagan’s attack on Soviet influence in Central America in the 1980s. This legacy also explains the neoconservative wave that swept the party in the early 21st century, leading to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trumpism rejects this tradition altogether. Following in the footsteps of the George W. Bush administration, Republicans have never acknowledged the mistakes they made in the war on terror, nor have they revised their foreign policy principles. Trump has capitalized on this thoughtlessness and lack of courage to force the party to reevaluate its foreign policy principles. This has led to a remarkable resurgence of isolationism, which was evident in 2016 but has become even more pronounced in the 2024 campaign. In Milwaukee, the Iraq War that George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and all the Republican leaders of the time wanted was portrayed as a 'disaster' and a 'lie.' As for the 'America First' slogan used by pro-German isolationists like Charles Lindbergh in the 1930s, it is ubiquitous in the campaign. Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News star and close Trump ally, summed up the perception of interventionism as a betrayal of the American people during his convention speech, saying, 'I’ve seen members of Congress step over the prostrate bodies of their fellow citizens dying of drug overdoses to go to Congress to vote for aid to foreign countries.' Accusing America’s NATO members of enjoying American security without adequately contributing to the alliance’s funding, Trump has constantly criticized them throughout his presidency, building his reputation as tough in diplomatic and military circles. These sermons are even more worrying in 2024, as the situation in Europe has deteriorated sharply with the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Going down the isolationist path means knowingly abandoning European allies in favor of Putin’s Russia. Tucker Carlson makes no bones about it: 'You don’t see our commander-in-chief [Joe Biden] suggesting that we use our armed forces to protect our country or the lives of our fellow citizens. No, that’s for Ukraine!' Trump’s populism, recognized as early as his 2016 campaign and credited by American political scientists as a primary factor in his victory, is naturally reflected in his focus on elites who would betray the American people. The 2024 campaign confirms this turning point, which represents a landmark evolution for the Republican Party. While presidents like Nixon or Reagan had used conservative populism in the past to attract working-class votes, Trump’s rejection of elites takes a much more massive and insurgent turn. This is important because, historically, the Republican Party has been precisely the party of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) elites - the party known for its closeness to middle class, big business, and Wall Street. These ties persist, as evidenced by the contributions of many large corporations to Republican campaign financing. However, speeches at the Milwaukee Convention consistently denounced the 'establishment,' accusing 'wealthy elites' of 'selling out American workers' to 'big banks' and 'big technology companies. Leading Republican voices reinforce this message, sometimes creating cognitive dissonance. For example, JD Vance, a former investment banker close to Silicon Valley billionaires and now Trump’s vice presidential running mate, rails against politicians who are 'in the pocket of corporate America' and against 'the barons of Wall Street' who have destroyed the American economy. But consistency is not the priority of the Trumpified Republican Party. Instead, Trumpism resorts to an accusatory inversion in which the Democratic Left replaces the Republican Right as the enemy of the people in the collective American imagination. Trumpist Obsessions To understand Trumpism, one must take into account the obsessions that have fueled it since Trump declared his intention to run in the Republican primaries in 2015: immigration and how it affects crime in the United States. Trump frequently appears at his rallies with the slogan 'Deport Illegals Now' emblazoned in large letters on the wall behind him, and his supporters wave placards with the slogan 'Mass Deportation Now.' Terms like 'invasion' or 'occupation' are now commonplace to create the impression of a country at war with immigrants. For Trump, these millions of illegals entered the United States with the complicity of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, although it would be more accurate to speak of impotence, since the outgoing administration never found a way to reconcile humanitarian and border security policies. As a result, the number of illegal entries into the United States has increased since 2020, leading Republicans to claim that Democrats have betrayed the country. Eric, Trump’s son, made it clear in Milwaukee that the Biden administration not only sends 'illegals' to the most expensive hotels in New York, but also reduces 'homeless veterans' to 'sleeping under bridges.' Worse, once these illegals settle in, they are supposedly the catalyst for violence in small towns and big cities. Because of them, according to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, 'Americans are dying every day; they are being murdered, assaulted, and raped' and 'young boys and girls are being sold into sexual slavery. But it is to American women that these immigrants pose the greatest threat. Condemning immigration through its alleged effects on women is a particularly astute strategy for Trump and the Republicans, especially in light of the former president’s conviction in the Stormy Daniels case in the spring of 2024. Women are a highly coveted demographic in this election cycle. Framing immigrants as a formidable threat allows Trump supporters to engage with the issue without addressing their significant vulnerability to female voters, particularly their role in the Dobbs decision that led to the Supreme Court’s revocation of federal abortion rights in June 2022. Trumpist discourse conveys a very traditional vision of women as perpetual victims. Whether they are portrayed as wives (a young woman at the Milwaukee Convention explains how her husband died of an overdose), as mothers (a weeping woman comes to tell how her 15-year-old son, Weston, died after taking a fentanyl pill), or as sexual prey (a family recalls their sister, Rachel Morin, who was raped and killed by an undocumented immigrant), the underlying mechanism of persuasion remains consistent across these narratives: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have perpetuated open-borders policies that have resulted in an influx of immigrants and drug cartels permeating numerous American cities. They bear the burden of guilt. Trump, for example, has made much of the case of Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old girl who was tragically raped and strangled by two undocumented Venezuelan immigrants. If re-elected, Trump vows to 'protect women' threatened by an 'army of illegals from Third World countries' and 'rapists' whom 'American women don’t want coming into their homes.' The Republican base responds favorably to the rhetorical mechanism that combines racism, miserabilist pathos, and an obsession with sexual violence. In Milwaukee, several elected officials, just like Trump, brought up the tragic story of Jocelyn Nungaray to a crowd of activists who angrily chanted, 'Send them back!' Hence, Trump’s new flagship promise, after building a wall on the border with Mexico, is to deport the more than ten million undocumented immigrants currently living on U.S. soil. An Illiberal Drift Such rhetorical excesses have led many historians and political scientists since 2016 to analyze Trump’s success through the concept of 'illiberalism,' popularized in the United States by Fareed Zakaria in a famous 1997 article in Foreign Affairs titled 'The Rise of Illiberal Democracy.' According to Zakaria, illiberal democracies are 'democratically elected regimes' that 'routinely ignore constitutional limits on their power' and 'deprive their citizens of basic rights and freedoms'. Since 2016, a slow illiberal drift has accompanied the Republican Party’s capitulation to Trump. Despite facing numerous challenges during his presidency, including the January 6, 2021 Capitol Rebellion, the party has consistently supported Trump, with only ten elected House Republicans voting to impeachment him during his second impeachment. In 2024, Trump easily won the primaries, confirming this blind loyalty to him. Only two party heavyweights, Nikki Haley (former governor of South Carolina) and Ron de Santis (governor of Florida), dared to run against the former president. Although they were younger than him and considered to be fairly successful elected officials in their respective states, Trump defeated them rather easily. He barely campaigned against them, refused to participate in even the smallest debate, and spent months insulting them. Yet the party base didn’t hold it against him and triumphantly chose him as the Republican nominee in November 2024. The same scenario played out in Milwaukee. The Convention saw the creation of a veritable personality cult around the billionaire. Far from being a mere candidate, he has become, in the words of the many Republicans who spoke at the podium, a hero, even a superman, the 'Braveheart of our time. His success and celebrity have captivated Hollywood and sports stars for years. His golf scores impress even professional golfers. He is credited with shaping the New York skyline in the manner of a modern-day ‘Midas’ (the most famous king in Greek mythology for his ability to turn everything he touched into pure gold). He was reputedly 'one of the best businessmen in the world' before his political career. All of this is demonstrably false. Nevertheless, these compliments, culled from Trump’s pre-presidential existence as a mostly tabloid figure, reinforce the populist aspect of his candidacy, portraying the former president as both a successful man and an eternal outsider. But it was his 'miraculous' survival of the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, that gave him an almost supernatural aura among his supporters. In Milwaukee, party leaders declared that while 'the devil' had come for Trump, 'the hand of God' turned his head at the last moment and gave him the strength to stand up 'like a roaring lion. Blessed by God, Trump can join the pantheon of the greatest American presidents in his lifetime, beginning with Ronald Reagan, but also with Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated in 1865, because he understands the risks and is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. He could have lived a life of luxury on his magnificent Florida estate, but he chose to go back into battle and endure the worst of it: insults, trials, and assassination attempts. That is why today’s Republican voters firmly believe that Donald Trump is a victim and that the Democrats are 'persecuting' him. However, he bravely faces these 'vicious' attacks because he understands that his 'only crime' is simply to 'love America.' This kind of flattery may bring a smile to your face. But it points to a real erosion of certain democratic norms that, until Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party, were thought to be secure in the American political system. The first erosion of democratic norms concerns the role of violence in the political arena. The 2024 presidential campaign conspicuously avoids the Capitol Rebellion of January 6, 2021. On the rare occasions it is mentioned, it serves to reverse the burden of blame in favor of the Republicans. While Democrats, first with Joe Biden and now with Kamala Harris, continue to portray the former president as a threat to U.S. institutions, Tucker Carlson acknowledged in Milwaukee that Republicans have grown tired of the constant criticism of democracy on television. After all, the 'true definition' of democracy is 'the proposition that the citizens of a country own that country. This would mean that a country’s leaders must 'do what the people tell them to do.' But only Donald Trump 'pays attention to what the people want.' Therefore, the surest way to strengthen and save American democracy would be to vote for him. This is a bold rewriting of history, especially as the November 5, 2024 election approaches and Trump becomes more explicit about his willingness to use violence whether he is re-elected or loses at the polls. He firmly believes that his Democratic opponents pose a significant threat to the integrity of American democracy. 'We have two enemies,' Trump said to Maria Bartiromo during an appearance on Fox News’ 'Sunday Morning Futures' on October 20. 'We have the outside enemies, and we have the enemies from within, and the enemy within, in my opinion, is much more dangerous than China or Russia and all these countries, because if you have a smart president, he can handle them pretty easily … The thing that’s tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside.' Trump sees only one solution: to call out the army to prevent the 'lunatics of the radical left' from disrupting the elections. He has identified specific targets in interviews and campaign rallies, including Adam Schiff, a Democratic representative who spearheaded the first impeachment proceedings against him in 2020, Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic Speaker of the House, and her husband Paul, who was attacked with a hammer by a far-right activist in his San Francisco home in 2022. Conclusion Each step in this seemingly endless escalation of Trumpian provocations represents a quasi-ontological test for the Republican Party: should the party’s supporters accept any verbal or ideological derailment in the name of winning back the White House? Admittedly, some Republican figures, including a number of Trump’s former secretaries or advisors (Mark Esper, H.R. McMaster, Mike Pence or John F. Kelly, Dick Cheney), have strongly denounced him during the current presidential campaign. However, these voices remain a minority within the party and do not have much influence. In fact, the party expelled Trump’s main internal opponent, former Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, in 2021. The Republican Party in the Trump era is thus a monolithic body in which devotion to Trump is a condition of survival. This old party, profoundly renewed in both its ideological foundations and its leadership, has undergone an incredibly rapid metamorphosis, caught between a charismatic leader and a passionate base blindly loyal to him. Today, the mutation seems complete, and whatever the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, it is likely to affect every other actor in the U.S. political, partisan, and institutional system. For American democracy, there will be a 'before' and an 'after' Donald Trump.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1VTGikwny1Fi	2024-11-02T17:08:52-07:00	
Flashback: How Yeltsin Gleefully Drove Bill Clinton To Tears. Who...	Yeltsin grinned while Clinton cried. The Russian president had just blurted out his unfiltered reaction to American news reporting. It was October, 1995. Clinton and Yeltsin had just spoken at the United Nations 50th anniversary meeting. The next day the two presidents got together at Hyde Park, New York for a bilateral meeting followed by a press conference. It was then that Yeltsin told the media his take on his US visit. He said that when he came here that October he did not have the degree of optimism with which he was now departing. The bilateral meeting had apparently been productive. But then he dropped his brutal statement about our American press: 'Coming from my statement yesterday in the United Nations, and if you looked at the press reports, one could see that what you were writing was that today's meeting with President Bill Clinton was going to be a disaster. And now for the first time I can tell you that you're a disaster.' That's what set off Clinton's crying. But his tears were not for the press or over any danger or fear. They were tears of laughter. Both presidents had a good laugh over Yeltsin's remarks about our American news style. You can see the video in this AP archive: Today, though, Clinton would have nothing to laugh about given the present state of bilateral relations. Back at Hyde Park, Yeltsin had gone on, '...our partnership is not calculated for one year or for five years, but for years and years to come -- tens of years, for a century; that we're friends, and that it's only together, together, [that] we're going to be trying to solve not only our joint bilateral issues but issues affecting the whole world.' This was not the first time the new Russian and American friendship was mutually proclaimed. That was made clear at the presidents' April 1993 Vancouver summit. A White House press release that followed said, 'President Bill Clinton of the United States of America and President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation declared their firm commitment to a dynamic and effective US-Russian partnership that strengthens international stability.' In a follow-up phone call now declassified, Clinton told Yeltsin, 'I'm about to issue a statement in support of your policies. I want you to know that we're in this with you for the long haul. We made some significant progress in Vancouver and Tokyo. We'll keep working here to be supportive. If there is anything I can do for you here, please let me know.' It is quite obvious today, that that those past optimistic aspirations did not stand the test of time. Today we find ourselves lavishly sponsoring Ukraine as it bombs Russia and invades and occupies a small part of Russia's home territory. Our actions were seemingly as support for the beleaguered Ukraine, a victim of a brutal invasion ordered by Vladimir Putin in 2022. But any idea of friendship and partnership with Russia is long gone. Truth be known, it was even gone long before Russia's disastrous invasion of Ukraine. And ironically, it was President Bill Clinton himself who set the US and Russia on a collision course. You see, it was Clinton that put in motion NATO's eastward expansion. That ultimately advanced to talk of placing Nato forces right up against Russia's sensitive border with Ukraine. Russia considered that to be a security threat of existential proportion. Clinton had revealed his hidden agenda on this when he spoke to The Atlantic in 2022. He claimed: 'When I first became president, I said that I would support Russian President Boris Yeltsin in his efforts to build a good economy and a functioning democracy after the dissolution of the Soviet Union -- but I would also support an expansion of Nato to include former Warsaw Pact members and post-Soviet states.' Certainly it's always good to be prepared for the worst. But Clinton's plan was in abrogation of a contract made between presidents G.H.W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev. It assured Gorbachev that 'within the framework of Nato, not an inch of Nato's present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction.' This matter is often dismissed because it was never a condition of any treaty. But I've examined carefully the official sources on the matter and find present all the elements of a verbal contract. The Soviets performed their obligations in the contract, but Clinton abrogated ours. Under US law verbal contracts are perfectly legal, but difficult to enforce. Clinton apparently hid behind that in his actions regarding Nato expansion. In 1985 presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev issued a joint statement: 'A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.' That admonition seems to be freely ignored now. On September 25, 2024 Reuters reported, 'President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it was struck with conventional missiles, and that Moscow would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack. It is well known that it is Russia's military doctrine that an existential threat will be met with a nuclear response. But Russell Berman, a Stanford University professor, writing in The National Interest, April 6, 2023, proclaims that 'Ukraine must win its war with Russia.' He says, 'It is foolish and short-sighted to withhold from Ukraine the tools it needs to win.' Is Berman nuts? What's worse is that there are prominent American politicians who seem to hold the same position, i.e. that Ukraine must win not settle the war. Unless stopped these people will risk saber-rattling our way into a nuclear war, it seems to me. Europe is already preparing for the worst. On March 20, Politico ran the story, 'Von der Leyen asks Finland to prepare the EU for war.' ( On October 31, 2024 Newsweek reported, 'Europeans Told to Stockpile Food in Case of War with Russia.' ( We Americans are mostly being kept in the dark over the present danger. Our former Civil Defense structure is long gone. Could it be that too many influential people are profiting or benefiting from the military activity? President Eisenhower warned us of such a possibility in his farewell address. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in an interview by Chris Cuomo, likened Russia's present situation to that confronted by his uncle President Kennedy in 1962. That's when he brought the US and the USSR to the brink of nuclear war over the Soviet military advances in Cuba. Thankfully, President Kennedy held strong against those within our country that urged him to fight instead of negotiate. The matter was settled peacefully. Will our next president succumb to internal pressures to keep the war gravy train going? I'm writing this before the election. But I hope that voters will have checked out who the politicians are that want military victory over a peaceful settlement. The 2024 election is not just for president. House and Senate seats are up, too. Clearly nuclear war is not an issue on voters' minds. It doesn't register like more popular concerns over higher prices, jobs, immigration, abortion, and taxes. But nuclear war is far more consequential. Unlike the other important issues, it is an existential threat. Remember Clinton's tears and the Clinton-Yeltsin laugh-fest? Today's issues have truly risen to an existential threat. This is nothing to laugh or cry about. It's no time for domestic political maneuvering. It's now time that our politicians get serious and find a way to peacefully end the hostilities quickly, and in an honest and direct manner.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1Q2pXdDBPm6i	2024-11-02T17:07:33-07:00	
The Islamic Republic Of Iran Should Be Overthrown – OpEd	By Shahram Mirzaei Only four decades ago, on April 18, 1983, Iran destroyed the US embassy in Beirut through its Lebanese terrorist proxy, Hezbollah. This attack was a turning point in jihadist aggression that still regularly affects the free world today. Before the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Islamic terrorism was not well organized. Mohammad Reza Shah, Iran’s last monarch, laid the groundwork for the rapid growth and spread of Islamic terrorism by severely suppressing progressive and liberal forces in the country. With liberal and progressive forces weakened, Islamic terrorist forces led by the cleric Ruhollah Khomeini seized control of the Iranian government in 1979 in a massive coup against the inhumane Pahlavi Dynasty. With Iran’s resources at their disposal, Islamists were able to establish terrorist organizations in countries across the Middle East. Iran Supports Islamic Terrorism The attack on the American embassy and the suicide bombing on the headquarters of the US Marine barracks in Beirut on October 23, 1983, was a major turning point in how Islamists carry out terrorist operations. 241 US soldiers, 58 French soldiers, and six civilians were killed in the attack on the barracks. The culprits were affiliated with Iran. These attacks ushered in an age of unending Islamic terrorism. But who is responsible for this disaster? Inaction from Western governments regarding terrorism, especially from the US, sent a direct message to Iran’s leaders: you are allowed to establish and arm terrorist organizations. Western leaders did not have the determination and courage to respond to the new terrorist threat because they did not recognize or understand the ideological nature of the other side. After these attacks, a joint plan to attack the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah’s centers in Lebanon was planned and approved by the presidents of the US and France. However, the US Secretary of Defense lobbied against and successfully stopped it, claiming there was no clear evidence of Iran’s role in the previous attacks. The leaders of the free world, especially the US, continue to be double-minded and indecisive in dealing with Iran and its terrorist regime. This wrongheaded policy created a suitable environment for the growth of Islamic terrorism and turned our world into a less safe place. The formation of al-Qaeda and its September 11 attacks, the rise of ISIS and its assault on the Yazidi Kurds — including the abduction and sale of thousands of Kurdish women as sex slaves — numerous terrorist attacks across the West, and the profound sense of insecurity in these nations, culminating in the October 7 terrorist attack against Israel and Iran’s subsequent missile attacks against Israel in April and October 2024, highlight the consequences of failing to address Tehran decisively. The Appeasement Policy After almost five decades of appeasement toward Iran, the October 7 invasion of Israel by Iran’s proxy, Hamas, pushed Israel to take a defensive posture and cut off the arms of the Islamic terrorist regime by attacking the source of the satanic ideology: the Islamic Republic of Iran itself. Unfortunately, the international community and the free world still insist on this appeasement policy. For this reason, Israel is alone in the fight against terrorism, bearing the weight of the world in its struggle against the Islamic Republic of Iran. Poor policy choices concerning Iran’s support of terrorism do not end there. On September 28, the US announced an agreement with Iraq to withdraw American troops from parts of the country. This is likely the beginning of another global disaster produced by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The withdrawal will mean the complete handover of Iraq to Iran, providing a safe space for Hezbollah, Hamas and other terrorist organizations affiliated with Iran to hide from Israel by moving to Iraq. If this agreement is implemented, Iraq — with all its riches — will become a hub for the growth and spread of Islamic terrorism supported by Iran. This will nullify all Israeli efforts to combat terrorism supported by Iran, as well as all Western efforts to create a secure Middle East. If Western countries are not more decisive in dealing with Islamic terrorism, our future will be more uncertain. History has shown that Iran is the head of a snake. To kill a snake, you have to cut off its head. This is not an endorsement of an all-out war with Iran. Instead, free countries, especially the United States, should support liberation movements in the region. This support should be extended to the Kurds, who may be powerful enough to destroy the Islamic Republic but presently lack international support. The lack of support from Western countries for the Iranian popular uprisings in December 2017 and November 2019 and the Kurdish Woman, Life, Freedom movement that started in 2022 sent a message to the Islamic Republic that it can carry out its crimes domestically and continue its terrorist activities internationally without fear of retribution. The West must end the appeasement policy with Iran and crush the snake’s head in Tehran by supporting the progressive and liberal movements of the Iranian people, thereby ending five decades of terrorism fostered by Iran.

Ecuador’s Blackouts: The High Cost Of State-Controlled Electricit...	By Daphne Posadas In recent weeks, Ecuador has faced a severe energy crisis, with power outages lasting up to 10 hours daily, affecting millions of citizens. The main causes are a prolonged drought and a highly centralized electricity sector. The drought, which has been the worst in 6 decades, has reduced water levels at hydroelectric dams to historic lows, impacting plants that generate over 70 percent of the country’s electricity. Most of these hydroelectric plants are operated by Ecuador’s state-owned utility company, CELEC, concentrating energy provision in the hands of the government. You may wonder why Ecuador is so dependent on hydro for energy. The truth? Efforts to diversify the energy mix have stalled due to strong resistance to alternatives, a growing diesel shortage, and missed opportunities to use gas. This puts Ecuador in a risky spot, with its energy supply tied entirely to rainfall. Ecuador’s one-dimensional approach to energy is only becoming costlier as droughts grow more intense. The electricity market is traditionally divided into four segments: generation (the production of electricity, such as at hydroelectric plants), transmission (transporting electricity over long distances at high voltages), distribution (delivering electricity to consumers at lower voltages), and retail sales (providing and selling electricity to customers). In Ecuador, these areas are mostly state-controlled. The Cato Institute’s Gabriela Calderón de Burgos recently published an insightful piece on the history of Ecuador’s electricity sector. She highlights how it once operated more efficiently under a decentralized model. However, after World War II, the government began to nationalize and centralize the sector, leading to a significantly increased state control over electricity generation and distribution by the 1980s. As Gabriela shares in another piece, while private entities are permitted to invest in generating their own electricity from various sources, electricity rates remain highly politicized. Heavy state control of pricing has disincentivized private investment, all while the citizens continue to pay the price. The Ecuadorian Business Committee estimates that businesses are losing approximately 12 million USD for every hour without electricity. However, those are of course only the visible costs. The invisible losses—those that impact productivity and future opportunities—are likely far greater and impossible to measure. Ecuador’s energy crisis illustrates a broader economic principle: the risks of centralized, state-controlled systems. When vital sectors like electricity are monopolized by the state, they become rigid and less responsive to external shocks, such as natural disasters. Centralization stifles competition and innovation, restricting the ability to adapt and respond quickly to crises. (More on the inefficiency of central planning can be found in Tibor Machan’s article from our archive.) In public debates, some Ecuadorian citizens have romanticized the Socialist Correísmo era (2007–2017), arguing that power outages were rare during that administration (more accurately, a dictatorship) and attributing the current crisis to 'neoliberalism'—a term broadly used by people who oppose free markets and limited government. However, the reality is that a fully centralized system lacks the flexibility needed to tackle an energy crisis of this magnitude. And while many governments have come and gone since Correísmo, the current model is partly a legacy of that socialized view of electricity. My colleague Sergio Martínez recently highlighted on our Spanish social media platforms how countries like Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela have all suffered devastating blackouts due to government control of the electricity sector. In these nations, a lack of competition and incentives has led to inefficiencies, higher costs, and an inability to meet rising demands. By opening the energy market, Ecuador could increase its resilience against future crises, encourage innovation, and ultimately ensure a more reliable electricity supply for its citizens. A more diversified energy market could attract private actors who compete not just on price but most importantly on reliability. This would ensure a better service for consumers and better responses to crises like this one. It’s time for Ecuador to power up innovation and competition rather than being left in the dark.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer Seeks Reset Of UK Politics With Bi...	By Andrew Hammond It is relatively rare for economic events in the UK to cause big political ripples globally. However, last Wednesday’s Budget could be different. Many people, not only domestically but internationally as well, were looking closely at the most important fiscal statement by a British government in a generation. There are several reasons why the Budget is potentially era-defining, politically and economically, including the fact that, following the party’s victory in the election in July, it is the first fiscal event by a Labour government since 2010, during the final days of Gordon Brown’s administration. Given the huge majority Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government enjoys in the House of Commons, Labour might well remain in office not only until the end of the current Parliament in 2028 or 2029, but possibly well into the 2030s if a second term is secured, even with a reduced majority. This means this week’s Budget could shape the UK’s political agenda for much longer than the typical annual Budget. In her statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves launched what she described as 'a new era of public and private investment in hospitals, schools, transport and energy, as momentous as any in Labour’s history'. What she was attempting to do here was to try to draw political comparisons with the big programs of reforms that began in 1945 under Prime Minister Clement Attlee, in 1964 under Harold Wilson, and in 1997 under Tony Blair. In addition to welcoming additional private capital, the government therefore announced plans for a step change in public investment. This marks a shift from the plans Reeves inherited from the Conservative administration of the former prime minister, Rishi Sunak, under which public-sector net investment would have fallen from 2.4 percent of gross domestic product this year to 1.7 percent by 2028 or 2029. The new government wants to boost this proportion significantly, as outlined in Labour’s election manifesto, in which the party pledged to keep public sector net investment at a constant level as a share of GDP. This implies big additional investment commitments each year, especially if the economy grows significantly. To facilitate this plan, Reeves is redefining the government’s fiscal rules to potentially free up tens of billions of of pounds of additional borrowing to fund long-term investment, while still seeking to deliver on a Labour manifesto pledge to reduce debt as a proportion of the UK economy. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones, who is No. 2 to Reeves in the UK finance team, has announced that a new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority will try to 'fix the foundations' of a creaking UK infrastructure system. To help pay for this huge investment, a very significant net tax rise was announced on Wednesday and the financial markets are still digesting its likely impact. Certainly, tax hikes are far from unprecedented immediately following an election. However, the fiscal measures unveiled by Reeves this week amount to a tax take of about £40 billion ($52 billion). This comfortably exceeds the £14 billion and £13 billion, in today’s prices, of her predecessors, Gordon Brown and George Osborne, in their first Budgets in 1997 and 2010 respectively. Indeed, it is most comparable, in real terms, to Norman Lamont’s fiscal plan in 1993, which was the biggest tax-raising Budget in half a century. In the coming years, the acid test for how many people perceive the success of the Budget will be whether it succeeds in boosting economic growth. This reflects the context in which it was prepared, which dates back more than a decade and a half to the 2007/08 international financial crisis. Since then, economic growth in the UK has flat-lined compared with the era immediately before it, and many people around the world will be watching closely to see whether the country can get out of this funk. So with the No. 1 mission of the Starmer government perhaps being its attempt to rejuvenate growth, Reeves highlighted the latest economic forecast from the independent UK Office for Budget Responsibility. This indicated a modest upside in 2025, in part because of falling interest rates, but was less optimistic about the several years immediately afterwards, which will be a cause of concern for the government. Nonetheless, Starmer’s team will seize on the 2025 upside in its keenness to move the economic narrative away from fiscal 'black holes' to more optimistic mood music. This includes a focus on the UK’s long-term growth potential into the 2030s, fueled by a fresh wave of investment to deliver on goals that go well beyond tackling crumbling national infrastructure, to such efforts as becoming a 'clean energy superpower.' The fact that clean energy has become a political super-priority for Labour was highlighted at the UK Investment Summit last month. About half of the more than £50 billion in business deals announced during this big event were energy-related. One driver of this spurt of investment was the launch of Great British Energy, an investment body and publicly owned power-generation company that aims to ensure a massive expansion of clean energy to help enhance the UK’s energy security. Moreover, in July Labour overturned a nine-year ban by its Conservative predecessors on onshore wind-power construction. This was followed by one of the most successful auction rounds for renewables in history. Wednesday’s Budget was therefore the most important moment yet for Starmer’s government. The measures that were announced will help define the next few years, and potentially beyond, of his administration as it seeks to reset the UK’s political landscape by 'going for growth' to try to shift the economy out of its long funk. • Andrew Hammond is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1RD7IEgXczxi	2024-11-02T17:04:42-07:00	
Private-Sector Jobs Went Negative In October: Will The Fed Panic ...	By Ryan McMaken According to the most recent report from the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added only 12,000 payroll jobs during October. This was the smallest month-to-month employment gain in nearly four years. Moreover, total private jobs fell in October by 28,000. This is the worst employment report since 2020, and it reflects an overall downward trend in employment growth since 2022. In addition to the drop in private employment, the report also shows drops in full-time employment and ongoing stagnation in the total number of employed workers. This is an economy in which whatever lackluster growth there is in employment, it’s being driven by part-time jobs and taxpayer-funded government workers. Government Jobs vs. Private Employment Total government jobs grew by 40,000 during October, meaning total job growth for the month would have been negative were it not for the immense amounts of deficit spending that props up growth in government hiring. This has been a growing trend over the past year. Proportionally, government jobs over the year have grown one-and-a-half times more than private-sector jobs. For most of the past year, however, there were—at least according to the establishment survey— some gains in private employment. But that wasn’t the case in October meaning private employment fell in October for the first time in 46 months. But, 12,000 more people had jobs in October than in September, right? Not quite. That number comes out of the so-called 'establishment' survey which counts only jobs, but not employed workers. According to the federal government’s otheremployment survey—the household survey—the total number of employed workers in the United States fell in October, month over month, by 368,000 workers. Over time, this has led to stagnation in total employment in the household-survey numbers. Over the past eighteen months, total employed workers has gone nowhere, and as of October, there are 370,000 fewer employed workers in the United States than there were eleven months ago: Yet, over this period, total jobs in the establishment survey has grown by more than 2 million jobs. So why are there job gains in the establishment survey but job losses in the household survey? One probable explanation is that much of the job growth we see is driven by part-time jobs and by people holding more than one job to make ends meet. Not surprisingly, the household survey does indeed show that full-time employment fell in October both month-to-month and year-over year. Part-time jobs, on the other hand, continued an upward trend in growth, year over year. In fact, year-over-year full-time job growth has now been negative for nine months in a row, for the past thirty years, that has only happened when the economy is in recession: There is other bad news in the report, as well. Temp jobs continue their long march downward, and total temp work is now at the lowest level reported in more than a decade. Year-over-year, temp work has been down for two full years. For more than thirty years, this has only happened during recessions. Average weekly overtime hours remained at 3.6 hours in October. For more than 30 years, average overtime has been at this level only during recessions. The total number of permanent job losers also spiked in October, rising to the highest level reported—outside the covid crisis—in 90 months. These jobs numbers weren’t the only bad news released today, either. The PMI manufacturing index, released by the Institute for Supply Management, fell to 46.5 percent. This was the lowest reading of the year, showing 'economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted in October for the seventh consecutive month.' The report showed new orders, production, and employment were all in contraction territory during October. Will the Fed Panic Again? The question that now faces markets is this: what will the Federal Reserve do in response to the October job report? The bond markets may give us hint. Today, after the release of the jobs report, the 10-year yield rose quickly to a four-month high. Overall, the yield curve steepened today as the 5-year, the 10-year and the 30-year also all experienced significantly rising yields. This strongly suggests that bond investors expect the Fed, in the face of increasingly bad economic data, will totally throw in the towel on its alleged war against price inflation. With government debt levels at nosebleed levels, and now with this jobs report, there is every reason to believe that the Fed simply doesn’t have to stomach to do anything but lower the target policy rate in an effort to keep government debt cheap and to stimulate the job market. That points to rising price inflation, and that points to rising yields in the longer term. Thus, we now see that rise in the 10-year and 30-year bonds. The bond markets are probably right. At this point, it’s nearly a sure thing that the Fed will cut the target rate by at least 25 basis points as already expected. After all, at the September meeting, following a middling jobs report that was better than this one, the Fed panicked and chopped 50 basis points off the target rate. It may do so again. This all points to a hard pivot toward more dovish policy and more price inflation moving forward. Of course, price inflation could fall in coming months. But that won’t be thanks to the Fed, it would be thanks to recession and a collapse in demand. On the other hand, given the immense amounts of monetary inflation that has occurred over the past four years, we could get both recession and ongoing inflation. Then we’ll get stagflation and Powell will go down in history as the worst Fed chairman since Arthur Burns. The bond markets seem to be entertaining the possibility.

South Africa’s Memorial To The ICJ: More Evidence On Israel’s Gen...	The timing, as with so much in the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon, was most appropriate. The Israeli Knesset had signalled its intent on crippling and banishing the sole agency of humanitarian worth for Palestinian welfare by passing laws criminalising its operations by 92 to 10 on October 28. The attack on UNRWA also came with a contemporaneous legal effort, this time from South Africa. Pretoria had already made its wishes clear on December 28, 2023 in filing an application in the International Court of Justice alleging 'violations by Israel regarding the [United Nations] Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide […] in relation to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.' Acts and omissions by Israel, argued the South African government, were alleged to be of a 'genocidal' nature, 'committed with the requisite specific intent … to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza as part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group'. By May 10, South Africa had filed four requests seeking additional provisional measures with modifications to the original provisional measures laid down by the ICJ. The momentum, and frequency of the actions, even gave certain commentators room to wonder: Was Israel’s own due process rights regarding judicial equality and the right to be heard compromised? Israel had promised to submit written observations by May 15 to the ICJ when faced with the sudden announcement on May 12 that the court would be holding an oral hearing instead. These debates have been taking place before the concerted, dedicated, enthusiastic pulverisation of Gaza, and the ongoing killing, terrorisation and displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank. In these cases, due process remains fantasy and distant speculation, especially concerning civilians. With increasing regularity, there is chilling evidence that Israeli units have a programmatic approach to destroying a viable infrastructure and means of living on the strip. On October 22, the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem expressed horror at the sheer scale 'of the crimes Israel is currently committing in the northern Gaza Strip in its campaign to empty it of however many residents are left […] impossible to describe, not just because hundreds of thousands of people enduring starvation, disease without access to medical care and incessant bombardments and gunfire defies comprehension, but because Israel has cut them off from the world.' In a chilling overview of the exploits of the IDF’s 749 Combat Engineering Battalion written by Younis Tirawi and Sami Vanderlip for Drop Site News, a record of systematic elimination of cultural, structural and intellectual life in the Gaza Strip is evident. As members of the battalion’s official D9 company stated: 'Our job is to flatten Gaza.' In an operation that saw the destruction of the Al-Azhar University, First Sergeant David Zoldan, operational officer of Company A of the battalion, delights with fellow soldiers on seeing the explosion: 'Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, did you see?!' Statements of this sort are frequent and easily found up the chain of command. They are also uttered with ease at the highest levels of government. On October 21, Israeli Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir had told a 'settlement' conference held in a restricted military zone that Gaza’s inhabitants would be given the chance to 'leave from here to other countries'. His reasoning for this ethnic cleansing has remained biblically consistent: 'The Land of Israel is ours.' In a media statement from its Department of International Relations and Cooperation dated October 28, the South African government announced its filing of a Memorial to the ICJ pertaining to its ongoing case against Israel. The Memorial itself runs into 750 pages, with 4000 pages of supporting exhibits and annexes. (Its December 2023 application had run into 84 pages.) 'The problem we have is that we have too much evidence,' remarked South Africa’s representative to The Hague, Ambassador Vusimuzi Madonsela to Al Jazeera. Zane Dangor, director- general of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, was more practical. Israel might well inflate its dossier of bloody misdeeds, but some line had to be drawn in the submissions. 'The legal team will always say we need more time, there’s more facts coming. But we have to say you have to stop now. You [have] got to focus on what you have.' While the formal contents of the Memorial remain confidential, the clues are thickly obvious. It contains, for instance, evidence that Israel 'has violated the genocide convention by promoting the destruction of Palestinians living in Gaza, physically killing them with an assortment of destructive weapons, depriving them access to humanitarian assistance, causing conditions of life which are aimed at their physical destruction and ignoring and defying several provisional measures of the International Court of Justice, and using starvation as a weapon of war to further Israel’s aims to depopulate Gaza through mass death and forced displacement of Palestinians.' Despite that comprehensive assortment of alleged crimes, the legal commentariat wonder how far this latest effort will necessarily go in linking the decisions of Israeli officialdom with genocidal intent. That Israel is committing war crimes and violating humanitarian law is nigh impossible dispute. The threshold in proving genocide, as international jurisprudence has repeatedly shown over the years, is a high one indeed. The dolus specialis – that specific intent to destroy in whole or in part the protected group – is essential to prove. Cathleen Powell of University of Cape Town, for instance, has her reservations. 'If they can find genocidal statements from state officials and show that that directly led to a particular programme that led to the destruction on the ground, then that’s probably a very strong case,'. But making that link would be 'very difficult'. Dangor has no doubts. 'Genocidal acts without intent can be crimes against humanity. But here, the intent is just front and centre.' Suffice to say that Israeli lawmakers and officials, aided by the exploits of the IDF, are making proving such intent an easier prospect with each passing day.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1Wh_ZQEozGxt	2024-11-02T17:01:07-07:00	
Deepening Rift In India-Canada Diplomatic Relations – Analysis	The diplomatic rift between India and Canada has escalated again with accusations of Indian involvement in the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada taking a new turn. On November 2, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal condemned the Canadian claims of Indian involvement as ‘baseless’ and accused Canada of 'deliberately spreading unfounded allegations' to tarnish India’s global image. Statements from the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence alliance—the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—had already added to India’s frustration, viewing them as part of a coordinated effort to cast it in a negative light. In response, both countries moved to expel diplomats, while the Canadian media’s adversarial tone suggests that the diplomatic fallout may be heading toward an irreversible breakdown in relations. According to the latest report, India lodged a formal protest against Canada, condemning accusations targeting its Home Minister Amit Shah. During a press briefing on Saturday, MEA spokesperson confirmed that India had summoned a Canadian High Commission representative to issue a Diplomatic Note in 'the strongest terms of protest.' This response followed statements by Canada’s Deputy Minister David Morrison, who mentioned India’s Home Minister before the Canadian Standing Committee on Public Safety. India labelled these claims as 'absurd and baseless,' accusing Canada of spreading false allegations internationally to damage India’s reputation. Jaiswal asserted that Canada’s actions confirmed India’s suspicions of a political agenda aimed at discrediting it on the global stage. India’s note warned Canada of 'serious consequences for bilateral ties' if such accusations continued, viewing them as a calculated attempt to tarnish India’s image. This latest dispute adds strain to already tense relations between the two nations, as India expressed a firm stance against attempts to malign its officials. Two senior Canadian officials reportedly admitted to leaking intelligence against India to the Washington Post, revealing accusations linking India’s government to violent acts in Canada. Deputy Foreign Minister Morrison alleged that a top Indian official orchestrated plots against Sikh separatists in Canada. India dismissed these allegations as a tactic to influence other nations. The MEA official also condemned Canada’s surveillance of Indian consular officials, calling it a 'flagrant violation of diplomatic conventions.' Jaiswal stated that Indian personnel in Canada had been under audio and video surveillance, with their communications intercepted, describing these actions as 'harassment and intimidation' that hindered diplomatic practices. He emphasized that such actions worsened an already challenging environment for India’s diplomatic staff, marked by extremism and violence. Earlier, MEA spokesperson directly criticized Prime Minister Trudeau’s ‘cavalier’ approach, holding him solely responsible for the current state of affairs. Jaiswal reiterated that Canada provided no evidence to support its serious accusations against India and its diplomats, asserting that the responsibility for the damage caused to India-Canada relations lies squarely with Trudeau. Genesis of the Row The origins of this conflict go back to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and head of a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia, was a prominent supporter of the Khalistan movement, a Sikh separatist campaign advocating for an independent state in India’s Punjab region. While this movement is largely inactive in India, it has significant support among the Sikh diaspora in countries like Canada. India, however, views the Khalistan movement as a serious threat to its national security and has long pressured Western governments to crack down on separatist leaders in the diaspora, including Nijjar. After Nijjar was shot and killed outside his temple, Canada opened an investigation, which has since expanded into a full-blown diplomatic crisis. In September 2023, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly announced that his government was investigating ‘credible allegations’ that Indian agents were involved in Nijjar’s killing. This marked a low point in relations between Canada and India. India swiftly denied any involvement, calling the accusations ‘absurd’ and ‘preposterous.’ At the time, both countries began withdrawing diplomats and scaling back their diplomatic presence in each other’s capitals. India also froze some diplomatic services for Canadians, including the processing of visas. The situation flared up again in May 2024 when Canadian police arrested three Indian nationals in connection with Nijjar’s murder. This further fuelled Canadian suspicions of Indian government involvement, as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) suggested there may be links between the suspects and Indian intelligence agencies. Another Indian national was later arrested in connection with the killing, prompting Canada to officially accuse India of state-sponsored criminal activities on Canadian soil. On 14 October, India’s Ministry of External Affairs received diplomatic communication from Canada indicating that Indian diplomats were being considered 'persons of interest' in the ongoing investigation. In response, India strongly denied any involvement in Nijjar’s killing and accused Canada of smearing India’s reputation for political purposes. India announced that it would withdraw several diplomats and officials from its missions in Canada, citing concerns over their safety. Just hours later, Canada escalated the situation by expelling six Indian diplomats, including India’s high commissioner to Canada, and accusing Indian agents of engaging in activities that threaten public safety in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau further intensified the situation by stating that the RCMP had uncovered ‘clear and compelling evidence’ of Indian government agents’ involvement in a variety of illegal activities. These activities, Trudeau claimed, included clandestine information gathering, coercive behaviour aimed at South Asian Canadians, and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including Nijjar’s murder. Trudeau emphasized that this evidence had been presented directly to Indian officials in an effort to seek cooperation in addressing these issues. However, India remained firm in its denials, saying that no concrete evidence had been shared with them and accusing Canada of pursuing a deliberate strategy to damage India’s international image. This exchange of diplomatic expulsions has caused relations between the two countries to hit a new low. While the situation is currently cantered on the killing of Nijjar, it reflects broader tensions between the two countries over issues related to Sikh separatism and Canada’s handling of Khalistani groups. Sikh separatism remains a particularly sensitive issue for India, which has urged countries like Canada, Britain, and the United States to take stronger action against Sikh separatist movements abroad. Indian authorities accuse these movements of promoting violence and terrorism against India, and they view Western governments’ leniency toward these groups as a major point of contention. India’s concerns are not without historical context. Sikh separatists were involved in significant unrest in India in the 1980s, including the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984 and the bombing of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, which killed 329 people. In this context, Nijjar’s murder and Canada’s accusations against India have reopened old wounds, with both sides unwilling to back down. Changing Dynamics of Bilateral Relations Canada-India relations have experienced both cooperation and tensions, with recent developments highlighting ongoing challenges. Diplomatic ties, dating back to the 1940s, have seen significant collaboration in global affairs, economic aid, and security. However, a major rift occurred following India’s 1974 nuclear test, leading Canada to sever nuclear cooperation for decades. In the 1990s, India’s economic liberalization reignited interest from Canada, with renewed trade and diplomatic missions fostering closer ties. High-profile visits and initiatives like the 2011 ‘Year of India in Canada’ further strengthened relations, while counter-terrorism collaborations also played a key role, especially after the 1985 Air India bombing. Recent years, however, have seen renewed tensions. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2018 state visit to India was overshadowed by a diplomatic controversy involving a convicted Sikh extremist, raising concerns about Canada’s handling of Sikh separatist movements. In 2019, Canada listed Sikh extremism as a top terror threat but later removed it from official reports, sparking criticism from India. Relations were further strained in 2020 when Trudeau expressed support for India’s farmer protests, leading the Indian government to accuse Canada of interfering in its internal affairs. Despite these challenges, both nations continue to engage on trade, nuclear energy, and security, reflecting a complex but enduring partnership. While the diplomatic crisis gets underway, it has already begun to affect other areas of India-Canada relations. Trade negotiations between the two countries have been halted, and India has paused visa processing for Canadians, citing concerns over the safety of its mission staff. Despite these tensions, economic ties between India and Canada remain stable for now. Bilateral trade between the two countries actually grew slightly from $8.3 billion in 2022-23 to $8.4 billion in 2023-24. India’s imports from Canada increased during this period, while its exports to Canada saw a slight dip. These figures suggest that, at least for now, the economic relationship between the two nations has not been significantly affected by the diplomatic fallout. Canada is a significant economic partner for India, ranking as the 18th-largest foreign investor with $3.31 billion in cumulative investments from 2020-21 to 2022-23, primarily focused on services and infrastructure, accounting for 0.5% of India’s total FDI. Key Canadian investors like the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) have substantial stakes in Indian companies, with CPPIB's investments reaching $14.8 billion by 2023, and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) investing $6 billion by the end of 2022. Major Indian companies, such as Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, and Infosys, have a strong presence in Canada. Canada also plays a crucial role in remittances to India, ranking among the top 10 sources, contributing to the $125 billion in global remittances India received in 2023. The Indian diaspora, consisting largely of professionals and skilled workers, sends regular remittances, while Indian students account for nearly 40% of international students in Canada, with 427,000 studying there in 2023. Indian immigration to Canada has surged, with a 326% increase from 32,828 in 2013 to 139,715 in 2023. Trudeau’s domestic challenges The diplomatic conflict has also placed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a politically precarious position at home. Trudeau has faced declining popularity in recent months, largely due to domestic issues such as rising inflation, a struggling healthcare system, and growing crime rates. A poll conducted recently showed that only 26% of Canadians view Trudeau as the best candidate for prime minister, significantly trailing behind Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. Adding to Trudeau’s challenges, his key political ally, Jagmeet Singh’s New Democratic Party (NDP), recently withdrew its support for Trudeau’s minority liberal government, ahead of the general election scheduled for next year. Singh announced this decision in a video message, saying that the Liberals 'have let people down' and that they 'don’t deserve another chance from Canadians.' While the withdrawal of NDP support complicates Trudeau’s position, it is unlikely that his government will fall immediately. To remain in power, Trudeau will need to seek support from other opposition lawmakers in the House of Commons. Meanwhile, Conservative leader Poilievre has been pressuring Singh to call for early elections, suggesting that the NDP’s withdrawal of support could lead to a change in government. If early elections are called, the Conservatives are well-positioned to win, given the widespread dissatisfaction with Trudeau’s handling of both domestic and foreign policy issues. Meanwhile, nearly two dozen Liberal backbenchers urged Prime Minister Trudeau to step aside, fearing his declining popularity could lead to an electoral disaster. This appeal, according to the Guardian, followed a separate 'code red' petition calling for a secret leadership vote among grassroots supporters. Despite this internal unrest, Trudeau, now in his ninth year as prime minister, appeared unfazed, asserting that he has the strong backing of most of the 153 Liberal MPs and will lead the party into the next election. However, analysts suggest that this growing dissent, the most serious challenge to his leadership yet, may have left its mark. Amidst the escalating crisis, Trudeau’s handling of the situation has drawn attention from Canada’s allies, particularly the United States. Trudeau has reportedly shared evidence related to the accusations against India with the United States and other members of the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence-sharing alliance. The U.S. State Department emphasized that Canada’s allegations against India are 'extremely serious' and urged India's cooperation. The UK also expressed support for Canada’s investigation, stressing respect for sovereignty and the rule of law. Similarly, Australia voiced concerns about the case and affirmed respect for Canada’s judicial process. New Zealand, which reacted first, highlighted the seriousness of the allegations if proven, urging adherence to the rule of law. Challenges and Way Forward Looking ahead, it remains unclear how the diplomatic crisis between India and Canada will evolve. India’s Ministry of External Affairs stated that it 'reserves the right to take further steps' in response to Canada’s accusations, though it has not yet outlined what those steps might be. For now, both countries appear to be digging in their heels, with neither side willing to back down. Experts warn that the longer this dispute drags on, the more difficult it will be for India and Canada to restore normal diplomatic relations. The alleged involvement of Indian nationals in Nijjar’s killing has sparked renewed concerns about foreign interference in Canadian domestic affairs, particularly among the Sikh community, which makes up a significant portion of Canada’s population. The Indian diaspora in Canada is also worried about the worsening situation. Another major sector likely to be affected is student migration. Canada announced a 10% reduction in the intake cap for international student study permits for 2025, lowering the target from 485,000 in 2024 to 437,000. This decision is expected to have a negative impact on Indian students who plan to study and work in Canada. Diplomacy often exists in a complex terrain between what one nation perceives as ‘right’ and another sees as ‘wrong.’ It rarely deals in absolutes, as what is deemed just or appropriate for one country may be considered unjust or harmful for another. The subjective nature of national interests, values, and cultural perspectives creates a reality where diplomats must grapple with a constantly shifting scenario of competing moralities and priorities. This makes diplomacy less about moral clarity and more about pragmatism, compromise, and the art of finding common ground without sacrificing essential interests. In cases like the current India-Canada standoff, both nations firmly believe in the righteousness of their positions: Canada sees itself as protecting its sovereignty and public safety, while India views Canada’s accusations as politically motivated and harmful. For diplomacy to work in such situations, both sides often have to move beyond binary notions of right and wrong, and instead focus on managing tensions, finding areas of mutual benefit, or at least mitigating damage. In international relations, the pursuit of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ is typically tempered by practical concerns like security, trade, and global standing. The challenge for diplomats lies in negotiating these grey areas, where rigid adherence to one side’s definition of right and wrong can easily lead to deadlock or conflict. This pragmatic approach underlines the need for flexibility and, at times, a willingness to accept that both sides can have valid concerns, even if they are fundamentally opposed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1YE55-lr2y1y	2024-11-02T16:59:26-07:00	
Robert Reich: Why Musk Predicts Lina Khan Will Be ‘Fired Soon’ – ...	Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla and the richest man in the world, tweeted this week that Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan 'will be fired soon.' Musk is hardly the only billionaire upset by Khan’s aggressive use of antitrust law to limit the power of big corporations — and, hence, to limit the power of billionaires like Musk. Mark Cuban, the billionaire surrogate for the Harris campaign, has also said Khan must go. So have major Democratic donors like Reid Hoffman and Barry Diller. When a bipartisan group of billionaires agree that a government official who’s limiting their power must be fired, you have every reason to believe she’s doing her job. One of the biggest structural problems in the American economy is the size and power of large corporations, which have grown larger and more powerful over the last three decades. They can (and do) set or coordinate prices to keep them high. They can (and do) set or coordinate pay to keep it low. They can (and do) use their political clout to get lower taxes, public subsidies, and regulatory rollbacks. Antitrust law provides a means of reversing this trend and limiting the size and power of large corporations. Lina Khan at the FTC and Jonathan Kanter at the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department are using antitrust law as it should be used. Last year alone, Biden’s regulators filed a record 50 antitrust enforcement actions; mergers reached a 10-year low. Forty years ago, I was in charge of advising the five commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission what they should do. The chairman at that time was Michael Pertschuk, who — like Khan — aggressively used the power of the FTC on behalf of consumers and workers. Also like Khan, Pertschuk was targeted by big business. He was called an enemy of capitalism. But Pertschuk’s efforts helped save capitalism from its own excesses and thereby helped maintain the legitimacy of the private sector in the public’s eyes. Of course, 40 years ago corporate America didn’t have nearly the clout it has now, the super-rich weren’t nearly as wealthy, and money didn’t play nearly as great a role in American politics. Elon Musk and Donald Trump pose the greatest threats in recent history to American capitalism. If given the authority to do what they’ve said they will do — including Trump’s giant 20 percent tariff on all goods imported into the United States, which will function as a giant regressive sales tax — Americans will not only be far worse off; they will be less inclined to support the capitalist system. Musk’s pledge to remove Khan came after he stood on stage and said he would personally oversee a $2 trillion cut to the Federal budget — a cut that would cause, in Musk’s words, 'hardship.' Musk’s personal fortune is about a tenth of the cut he says he’ll oversee. That’s enough to shield him from any hardship. But most Americans depend on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other government spending that would be cut if Musk has his way. I have a better idea. If Musk is as concerned as he seems about getting the federal budget deficit under control, he should consider supporting a 25 percent tax on great wealth, starting with fortunes over $100 million.

Strengthening Ties: President Prabowo’s Diplomatic Mission To The...	A New Era for Indonesia-USA Diplomacy In November 2024, President Prabowo Subianto’s visit to the United States represents a strategic initiative to elevate Indonesia’s partnership with the world’s largest economy, to address shared economic and security challenges within the intricate geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia. Given Indonesia’s increasing influence in ASEAN and its commitment to maintaining neutrality amid U.S.-China tensions, this visit occurs at a critical juncture for both nations. The outcome of the recent U.S. presidential election introduces additional complexities, as potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy may significantly influence the dynamics of Indonesia-U.S. relations. This analysis explores how Prabowo’s diplomatic engagement is strategically crafted to reinforce economic, defence, and cultural connections while navigating the imperatives of regional stability, sovereignty, and economic advancement. Political Diplomacy: Reinforcing ASEAN Centrality and Managing U.S. Engagement President Prabowo’s diplomatic agenda is aimed at reaffirming Indonesia’s dedication to ASEAN, ensuring that Southeast Asia remains a bastion of peace and neutrality amidst escalating U.S.-China rivalry. As the most influential member of ASEAN, Indonesia seeks to establish a regional order in which ASEAN plays a proactive role in negotiation processes, rather than merely serving as a battleground for power contests. Prabowo’s dialogues with U.S. leaders underscore mutual interests concerning regional stability and prosperity, particularly through the promotion of ASEAN’s diplomatic neutrality. However, the post-election political landscape in the U.S. raises potential challenges. A Republican administration may adopt a more confrontational approach towards China, thereby exerting pressure on Indonesia to align more closely with U.S. strategic interests. Conversely, a Democratic administration may prioritise a values-based foreign policy, emphasising human rights and democratic governance. This could potentially strain relations if these values conflict with Indonesia’s domestic priorities. Prabowo’s diplomatic strategy thus seeks to affirm Indonesia’s intent to retain its strategic autonomy, reinforcing its role as a mediator within ASEAN. Economic Cooperation: Enhancing Trade, Investment, and Green Technology Collaboration A fundamental aspect of Prabowo’s visit encompasses economic collaboration, as Indonesia endeavours to augment trade and attract American investment in sectors such as infrastructure, digital technology, and green energy. With its abundant natural resources, extensive market, and strategic geographical position, Indonesia presents significant opportunities for American enterprises. Prabowo aims to bolster trade relations, decrease tariffs, and facilitate direct U.S. investments, particularly in advancing Indonesia’s renewable energy capacities. With ambitious green energy objectives, Indonesia aspires to transition away from coal dependency, necessitating U.S. support to propel renewable energy initiatives and enhance technological proficiency. Supply chain resilience constitutes a pivotal area of economic discourse, particularly in light of recent global disruptions. Indonesia and the United States are anticipated to develop frameworks aimed at ensuring reliable supply chains in critical sectors, including energy, minerals, and food, which could support the sustainable development goals of Indonesia. Nonetheless, potential challenges may arise from regulatory complexities, concerns regarding environmental sustainability, and labour standards that may come under increased scrutiny from a new U.S. administration. Prabowo’s diplomatic strategy is likely to emphasise Indonesia’s reforms designed to attract responsible investment while ensuring alignment with the nation’s sovereignty and economic imperatives. Cultural and Public Diplomacy: Fostering Mutual Understanding and Educational Partnerships Acknowledging the long-term benefits of people-to-people connections, Prabowo’s cultural agenda encompasses diplomatic initiatives aimed at fostering mutual understanding. Programs featuring cultural exchanges, tourism promotion, and heritage events aspire to enhance American public appreciation for Indonesia’s rich cultural heritage and dynamic economy. Furthermore, Indonesia seeks to expand educational exchanges with U.S. institutions through the provision of scholarships, vocational training, and collaborative research opportunities in diverse fields, including environmental science, STEM, and social sciences. These initiatives not only contribute to enhancing Indonesia’s global image but also establish a foundation for future collaboration across various sectors, ranging from academia to technology. However, visa policies and funding limitations in the United States may potentially impede educational exchanges, while disparities in cultural diplomacy priorities could emerge, contingent upon the international engagement stance of the U.S. administration. Prabowo aims to secure enduring partnerships that transcend political cycles, consequently fostering a resilient Indonesia-U.S. relationship rooted in shared cultural and educational values. Defence and Security: Strengthening Regional Stability through Maritime and Cybersecurity Cooperation Amid rising regional tensions, Prabowo's visit underscores the importance of defence and security cooperation, particularly about maritime security and the South China Sea. As Southeast Asia's waters become a focal point of U.S.-China competition, Prabowo seeks U.S. support for Indonesia's defensive efforts, which include joint maritime exercises, intelligence sharing, and technology transfers. These initiatives aim to secure regional waters while affirming Indonesia's territorial sovereignty, a critical concern given China's assertiveness in the South China Sea. In the realm of cybersecurity, Indonesia aims to enhance collaboration with the United States, particularly in light of the increasing threat of cyberattacks across the region. Joint cybersecurity training, intelligence-sharing mechanisms, and technological support are essential for strengthening Indonesia's digital defences. However, a significant challenge lies in balancing defence cooperation without compromising Indonesia's neutrality. An enhanced U.S. defence presence could be perceived as a shift in Indonesia's traditionally non-aligned stance, potentially escalating regional tensions. Global Issues: Navigating Complex International Dynamics Prabowo's visit highlights Indonesia's commitment to engaging with pressing global issues while maintaining a balanced foreign policy approach. As Indonesia seeks to bolster its role in Southeast Asia, Prabowo aims to promote collaboration with the United States on shared priorities, including supply chain resilience, economic stability, and regional peace. This objective aligns with ASEAN's vision of preserving a neutral and stable region amid evolving global dynamics. Indonesia's diplomatic stance is expected to emphasise solutions that respect national sovereignty and encourage dialogue, reflecting ASEAN's commitment to consensus-building in addressing international challenges. Prabowo's approach signals Indonesia's intent to enhance its global influence, fostering relationships that support growth and stability while circumventing direct alignment with any particular major power. This balanced strategy reinforces Indonesia's dedication to ASEAN's central role in promoting a cohesive and adaptable Southeast Asia within a complex international landscape. Challenges and Conclusion President Prabowo’s visit to the United States emphasises Indonesia’s commitment to strengthening bilateral relations amid the complexities of a shifting global landscape. This diplomatic initiative seeks to expand economic cooperation in technology and sustainable development, foster deeper collaboration in maritime and cybersecurity domains, and reaffirm ASEAN’s central role in maintaining regional stability. However, several challenges may affect the partnership. Indonesia could face pressure from the United States to adopt a more assertive stance toward China, which may potentially strain its neutral foreign policy approach. Additionally, divergences in trade policies, regulatory frameworks, and strategic priorities may present obstacles, particularly if future U.S. policies diverge from Indonesia’s economic and diplomatic goals. Prabowo's approach highlights the importance of establishing a stable, reciprocal partnership that respects Indonesia’s sovereignty and enhances its influence within Southeast Asia, striving to align mutual interests in a manner that safeguards Indonesia’s strategic autonomy.

Impact Of US Presidential Election On South Asia – Analysis	Continuity rather than change is foreseen In the post-World War II era, relations between the US and South Asian countries have been both close and growing, as the US had replaced Britain as the dominant power in Asia. Therefore, an American Presidential election is of critical importance to Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal and the Maldives. Their preferences for the next US President may be different but none of them has an option other than to engage with the US irrespective of who tenants the White House. As for US policy, experts say, it will be one of 'continuity' whether it is Donald Trump or Kamala Harris who wins. India India is the pivot of US policy on South Asia. Washington will therefore look towards further defence tie ups with India and working with it to counter China in the field of maritime security, says Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute. He told the Turkish news agency, Anadolu that in the US, there is a strong bipartisan support for close ties with India. Therefore, whether it is a Trump or a Harris Administration, there will be continuity. The US has differences with India over Russia and China, but still they will work together, Kugelman adds. Of course, right now, India-US relations are at a low ebb. To India's discomfiture, the US joined Canada in charging that its intelligence agency was plotting to kill Indian dissidents in North America. The US said that an American Sikh separatist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, had been a target of India-handled assassins. The Pannun case is in court and an Indian agent allegedly involved in the plot was extradited from the Czech Republic and brought to the US for trial. The US and Canada went to the extent of naming Indian Home Minister Amit Shah and the National Security Advisor of India Ajit Doval as persons behind the alleged assassination plots. India stoutly denied involvement. It is now in talks with the US at the National Security Advisors' level to find a way out. Kugelman said both Harris and Trump could pressure New Delhi on this issue. 'They would not let it go. They would pressure India to carry out an investigation,' he said. Though India and US are strategic partners vis-à-vis China, they have divergent interests. India is now seeking a détente with China on the border issue and also more Chinese investments. This worries the US. While Trump has been supportive of commercial ties, he has long been unhappy about India's tariff policies. However, India and the US have too much at stake in the relations to allow ties to be hampered. The arms trade between India and the US has touched USD 25 billion. In 2023, US investments in India were valued at approximately USD 49.6 billion and Indian investment in the US amounted to USD 4.6 billion. Pakistan No matter who will be in charge of the White House, Pakistan would not be a priority,' says Kamran Yousaf in Express Tribune. Trump had let down Pakistan by walking out of Afghanistan leaving behind two million Afghan refugees in Pakistan. He also accused Pakistan of playing a double game in Afghanistan, taking American aid on the one hand, and clandestinely supporting the Taliban on the other. However, both Trump and Biden had allowed Pakistan to develop ties with China and build the strategic China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Bangladesh President Joe Biden put US-Bangladesh relations on an even keel after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina who had clashed with the US on human rights and over Hasina's refusal to join the anti-China QUAD. The student movement, which ousted Hasina, had the backing of the US. The present Chief Advisor to the interim government Prof. Muhammad Yunus is sad to be the joint choice of the US, the agitating students and civil society. The US has been a strong supporter of civil liberties in Bangladesh, even sanctioning some of the top men in Hasina's brutal security establishment. Human rights cements ties between the Yunus regime and Washington. While it is clear that Kamala Harris will follow Biden's footsteps vis-à-vis Bangladesh, Trump has taken a pro-Hasina stand with an eye on the influential Indian-American constituency in the US. But this could well be an election gimmick. Greeting American Hindus on Deepavali day, Trump said on X: ' I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos. It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America.' 'Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi.' It is not clear if Trump will actually be hostile to Bangladesh as President. He could well have made the pro-Modi or pro-Hindu noises to get the Hindu-dominated Indian American vote. Given the presence of US protégé Muhammad Yunus at the helm in Dhaka, Trump is most likely to strengthen US ties with Bangladesh. Afghanistan The Taliban-ruled Afghanistan would probably like to have Trump as President. As US President, as it was Trump who planned to pull out US troops from Afghanistan. The successor Biden Administration also enforced the decision. Perhaps Afghanistan would be happy even with Kamala Harris as President. Sri Lanka As for Sri Lanka, relations with the US are unlikely to be different from the past. Though the newly elected National Peoples' Power (NPP) government is radical leftist in theory, it has indicated that it can play ball with capitalism and the US-led West. The Anura Kumara Dissanayake government in Colombo has also not said or done anything which would suggest a pro-China tilt. However, the US has a deep interest in drafting Sri Lanka into its anti-China QUAD maritime security architecture, a prospect Sri Lankan governments have dreaded. No Sri Lankan government has wanted its island home to be a battle ground for regional or world powers. Nevertheless, the US, whether under Trump or Harris, will press Sri Lanka to sign agreements on defence and security cooperation even those Sri Lanka had traditionally baulked at. The US will raise human and minority rights, irrespective of the occupant of the Wight House. Nepal Nepal is ruled by a coalition between the pro-China Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) and the pro-India Nepali Congress party. China was the first country to react to the formation of the coalition in Kathmandu. Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha visited Beijing where he held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Nepal and China signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) framework agreement in May 2017, but Nepal has been expressing serious reservations about the text, saying that it is not interested in commercial loans from China but wants only investments. Talks over the BRI projects and an implementation plan remain suspended. Tension with India continued. In May this year, Nepal announced the printing of a new Nepali 100 rupee note displaying a map showing Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani as parts of Nepal when India claimed those areas. While there is an uneasy relationship with New Delhi, the coalition government in Kathmandu has not talked about its relationship with the US. Nepal has always welcomed Western investment and had signed up for the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) pact. Maldives Little change is expected in US-Maldives relations as the Mohamed Muizzu government has completely given up its pro-China and anti-Indian character and is now heavily dependent on India financially. China has abandoned the Maldives for reasons not very clear. Since Maldives is in the care of strategic partner India, the US has little to worry about.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1Xku3DGK1llN	2024-11-02T16:55:27-07:00	
Ukraine’s Positions Deteriorate Across Front Lines; Russian Milit...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Ukrainian Drones Strike Chechnya On October 29 Ukrainian combat drones attacked the Russian Special Forces University in the Russian Republic of Chechnya. The university, founded in 2013 and named after Russian President Vladimir Putin, is a private center for modern warfare training. The institution has close ties with current and retired members of Russia’s National Guard (Rosgvardiya). Most of its instructors hail from the ranks of the Rosgvardiya or from the Alpha counterterrorism unit of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). Pro-Putin Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov’s militia, dubbed the Kadyrovites, also has strong ties to the university. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the institution has trained so-called volunteers before they are sent to the front lines. Kadyrov does not hide the fact that tens of thousands of fighters received training at the university before being sent to occupied Ukraine. Worse, Ukrainian sources report that Russian forces have sent children abducted from occupied parts of Ukraine to the university, where the abductees are trained to serve as child soldiers against their own country. As Kadyrov, Putin’s loyal ally, doubles down on his forces’ involvement in Russia’s war, Ukraine will likely continue to target Chechnya under the pro-Russian rule, while anti-Kremlin Chechen forces continue to operate alongside Ukrainian combat formations. 2. North Korean Troops Move Closer to the Ukrainian Front According to the United States Department of Defense, North Korean troops have moved to the front lines in Ukraine to prepare to enter combat operations there within weeks. Mark Rutte, the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), seconded the Pentagon’s assessment, claiming that Pyongyang has already fielded military formations to fight the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Russian region of Kursk. The White House also confirmed that since mid-October, North Korea has dispatched at least 3,000 servicemen to fight the Kremlin’s war. These troops traveled by sea from Wonsan, North Korea, to Vladivostok, and then dispersed to different training bases in eastern Russia. Additionally, South Korean sources have reported that a 10,000-strong contingent of troops is preparing to serve in Russia later this year. The Kremlin will reportedly pay $2,000 to each North Korean serviceman taking part in combat operations, revenue that will undoubtedly fill the coffers of a Kim Jong Un dictatorship that considers its soldiers to be lucrative export items. Additionally, Pyongyang’s 11th Corps special forces unit, also known as the Storm Corps, has reportedly forward-deployed troops to Ukraine. Available writings suggest that while the North Korean military’s conventional formations are often poorly equipped, the country’s special forces are highly motivated and well-trained. Formerly known as the Light Infantry Training Guidance Bureau, the Storm Corps specializes in unconventional warfare, infiltrations, and sabotage. Official reports have concluded that, of North Korea’s 200,000 special forces personnel, around 60,000 fall under the command of the Storm Corps. This will enable Pyongyang to easily rotate combat formations and supply reinforcements to the highly attritional battleground in Ukraine. 3. Battlefield Assessment Ukraine’s positions continue to deteriorate across the front lines. Russia has secured substantial territory throughout October. The Russian military has also committed a mounting number of war crimes, including executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Pinned down on multiple fronts, Ukraine is gearing up to mobilize tens of thousands of citizens to improve the unfavorable force-to-terrain and force-on-force ratios it currently faces. According to the Ukrainian General Staff, Ukraine’s positions in Kupiansk, Pokrovsk, and Kurakhove remain tenuous. In Kharkiv Oblast, the Russian military has kept up its push for Vovchansk. Clashes are also unfolding for Toretsk, and Ukrainian defensive combat operations have managed to hold the line in Siversk. In Chasiv Yar, the Russian offensive gained more territory and reached the canal on the southern edge of the town. Around the city of Selydove, the Russian military is progressing further into Ukrainian territory. And across the country, including in Kyiv, Russia’s heightened use of Iranian Shahed drones poses a significant threat to Ukrainian troops and civilians. In Kursk, Ukraine faces additional challenges in its efforts to hold Russian territory. With Pyongyang’s forces likely to enter the fray, Kyiv’s need for permission to use Western long-range weapons inside Russia grows even stronger. Weapons like the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) could hit North Korean combat formations at their assembly sites elsewhere in Russia before they are able to affect the tactical situation in Kursk.

China Honors Late General Linked To Cultural Revolution Cannibali...	By Yitong Wu and Kit Sung The ruling Chinese Communist Party has enshrined the ashes of a general who presided over a Cultural Revolution massacre that included cannibalism of those deemed 'enemies of the people' by late supreme leader Mao Zedong. On Oct. 24, officials reburied the ashes of People’s Liberation Army founding general and former Guangxi regional party chief Wei Guoqing – 35 years after his death. The full-honors burial ceremony at Beijing’s Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery – the resting place of China’s high-ranking leaders and revolutionary heroes – was attended by high-ranking guests, including the descendants of late revolutionary leaders Zhu De and Peng Dehuai. The news prompted outrage and satire on Chinese-language social media, with comments highlighting Wei’s role in the Guangxi Massacre in which members of factional gangs killed an estimated 100,000-150,000 people through beheadings, beatings, burial alive, stoning, drowning, boiling and disembowelment, according to historical research. Wei’s name is most strongly linked in the public mind with cannibalism during the massacre period in Guangxi’s Wuxuan and Wuming counties and Nanning city, after the victims were targeted as 'enemies of the people' amid the factional violence of the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. Public records cited in The New York Times in 1993 and by Radio France International in 2016 showed that at least 137 people were eaten, with thousands participating. Chinese-language comments on this week’s news story on X, which is blocked in China but still accessed by some using circumvention tools, were darkly scathing about the move. 'So the Chinese Communist Party’s running-dog butcher is now a hero for killing people,' commented @ueinhu, while @sebonesama quipped: 'Babaoshan is already packed full of demons and monsters – there’s always room for one more.' Other jibes seemed to echo those made about the fictional killer Hannibal Lecter, with one user posting a meme of Wei faced with piles of deep-fried meat and a KFC logo in the background. 'Paying tribute to a legendary gourmet,' commented @WaterMargin_10, while @akira38458278 wondered if the move was to prevent the people of Guangxi from 'digging him up and eating him' and @DingeX22503 concluded: 'Only those who are ruthless enough get to be a hero in China.' Hands ‘covered in blood’ Feng Chongyi, a professor at the University of Technology in Sydney, said Wei’s burial is politically symbolic, as it underscores Xi Jinping’s status as the heir of late supreme leader Mao Zedong, and is a tacit endorsement of the political 'struggle' tactics used by his predecessor. 'Wei Guoqing was an executioner whose hands were covered in blood,' Feng told RFA Cantonese in a recent interview. 'By giving him the honor of entering Babaoshan, Xi Jinping is endorsing the persecution mania of the Cultural Revolution, which reflects his own totalitarian resurgence.' 'It indicates that Xi Jinping and Mao Zedong have the same authoritarian nature,' Feng said. Yang Haiying, a professor at Japan’s Shizuoka University who has researched Cultural Revolution violence against the ethnic Mongolian population, said the burial of Wei’s remains seemed to indicate Xi’s unwillingness to distance himself from that era of China’s recent history. 'When Wei Guoqing was in Guangxi, his people killed and ate people, and yet he gets to be in Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery,' Yang said. 'The Chinese Communist Party has never condemned the Cultural Revolution ... just paused it temporarily.' 'Xi Jinping is now restarting it; we’re right in the middle of it now,' he said. Yang said there was a leader similar to Wei in Inner Mongolia, who presided over massacres of tens of thousands of ethnic Mongolians during the Cultural Revolution, but that the authorities had refused to criticize his actions in public. 'The Chinese Communist Party is a violent regime, and all its talk of revolution just means violence,' he said. 'So it will only reward its most violent followers.' Wei Guoqing died of illness on June 14, 1989, 10 days after the Tiananmen massacre put an end to weeks of student-led pro-democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square. His ashes were placed in storage at the Babaoshan Columbarium until the Oct. 24 burial ceremony.

Taiwan Expects Ukraine-Tested Weapons From US Amid Rising Chinese...	By William Yang Taiwan is expected to receive several weapons that have been battle tested in Ukraine from the United States over the next few years. Analysts say those weapons can help bolster Taiwan’s defense and strike capabilities amid growing military pressure from China. In the latest round of arms sales to Taiwan, worth about $2 billion, the United States plans to deliver three medium-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, also known as NASAMS. The weapons include advanced AMRAAM Extended Range surface-to-air missiles. The proposed sales will help improve Taiwan’s security and 'assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,' the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement released October 26. NASAMS has been battle-tested in Ukraine and is viewed by experts as a significant elevation of Taiwan’s air defense capabilities. Australia and Indonesia are the other countries in the Indo-Pacific region that have received the system from the U.S. Experts say that NASAMS has a high interoperation capability, and that the medium-range air defense system provides needed coverage in Taiwan’s existing air defense capabilities. 'Currently, Taiwan relies on Stinger missiles for short-range air defense while using the Patriot missile system or Taiwan’s indigenous Tien Kung for long-range air defense, so NASAMS can help fill the gap of Taiwan’s medium-range air defense,' said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. He told VOA by phone that when NASAMS is incorporated into Taiwan’s air defense system, it can improve the island’s capabilities to deal with the increasingly frequent patrols the Chinese military is conducting around Taiwan. 'As Chinese naval vessels and military aircraft increase the frequency of their combat-readiness patrols near Taiwan, the risk of abrupt missile attacks launched by Chinese vessels is also increasing, so acquiring NASAMS can further enhance Taiwan’s capabilities to deal with these potential threats,' Su said. In addition to the surface-to-air missile system, Taiwan’s National Defense Ministry said the island is expected to receive 29 sets of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, from the United States between the end of 2024 and 2026. The rocket system has been credited with helping Ukraine destroy Russian weapons or equipment in the ongoing conflict. Apart from receiving HIMARS from Washington, at least 17 Taiwanese soldiers were trained to use the rocket system at a military base in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, this past August. After a post on the military base’s official Facebook page showed Taiwanese soldiers participating in HIMARS training with counterparts from Romania and Estonia, which has since been removed, Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo said Friday that Taiwan had planned to send at least 30 soldiers to receive HIMARS training in the U.S. between February and October this year. Since Ukraine has used HIMARS to strike Russian military bases and weaken the Russian military’s momentum, some Taiwanese experts say the systems potentially can be used to target Chinese military facilities in coastal areas. 'The Taiwanese military can use HIMARS to hit some Chinese military facilities along the southeastern coast or target invading troops in different parts of Taiwan,' said Chieh Chung, a research fellow at the Association of Strategic Foresight in Taiwan. Overall, Chieh told VOA by phone, the acquisition of NASAMS and HIMARS can enhance Taiwan’s capabilities in conducting network-centric warfare and deter China from easily launching an attack against Taiwan. Other analysts say the series of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan reflects Washington’s commitment to supporting Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities, but China will interpret the latest developments as a provocation from Taiwan and the U.S. 'Beijing will interpret this as changing the status quo [across the Taiwan Strait] nevertheless,' Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told VOA in a written response. China views Taiwan as part of its territory and repeatedly has vowed to reunify with the island, by force, if necessary. In response to the latest U.S. arms sales to Taiwan last week, Beijing condemned it and urged Washington to stop what it called dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China showcases its naval capability The arms sales and training come as China’s two aircraft carriers, Liaoning and Shandong, conducted a dual formation exercise for the first time in the disputed South China Sea from late September to October. Chinese military analyst Song Zhongping told the state-run China Dailynewspaper that the exercise will allow the two Chinese aircraft carriers to 'integrate and magnify the power' and 'enable the fleet to better organize strikes and handle threats from air and sea.' Chieh in Taiwan said China is showing the U.S. it could assert maritime claims in disputed waters in the Indo-Pacific region at a time when U.S. aircraft carriers are deployed to the Middle East. 'Since the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has forced the U.S. to deploy its aircraft carrier groups to the region, China is trying to remind Washington that it can impose control over certain parts of the Indo-Pacific region amid an American absence,' he said. Nagy in Japan said that while China can demonstrate its capability to operate aerial and naval assets near areas of potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific region — such as the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait — such a formation also exposes the Chinese aircraft carriers as obvious targets for more experienced fighting forces. 'Losing one or two of China’s few aircraft carriers would have a very serious reputational cost for the Chinese Communist Party, and the U.S. and its partners understand this, so they are preparing for their scenarios,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1VpYFHaRgwmg	2024-11-02T16:49:36-07:00	
European Commission Highlights Georgia’s ‘Backsliding’	By Irakli Machaidze (Eurasianet) -- As the dispute over Georgia’s parliamentary voting results plays out, an annual report issued by the European Commission is effectively writing off Tbilisi’s chances of joining the EU any time soon. The report states that the incumbent Georgian Dream’s policies run 'counter to the values and principles' of the EU. EU officials and international observers have cited widespread irregularities connected with the October 26 parliamentary elections. Some in Brussels have called for a thorough investigation but have thus far refrained from saying the outcome was rigged. Official results show Georgian Dream winning 54 percent of the vote and gaining 89 of the 150 seats in the legislature. The EU Commission report on Georgia’s EU accession progress, issued October 30, was far less equivocal on Georgian Dream’s overall performance. The general message conveyed in the report is that Georgian Dream is taking the country in the wrong direction. 'Due to the course of action taken by the Georgian government, EU leaders stopped Georgia’s accession process. It remains on hold as long as Georgia continues to move away from the EU,' the EU’s ambassador to Georgia, Pawel Herczynski, said at an October 30 news conference in Tbilisi to outline the report’s findings. After granting Georgia EU candidacy status in 2023, Brusselsconditioned the opening of accession talks on the Georgian government’s implementation of reforms. Georgian Dream has made halting progress in several spheres, including aligning economic frameworks with EU standards. But the report notes 'backsliding' in key areas, including the judiciary, fundamental rights and foreign policy. Georgian Dream’s adoption of the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence, more commonly known as the ‘foreign agents’ law, 'impacts freedom of expression and the ability of the media to operate freely,' according to the report. The commission also states that Tbilisi has made 'no progress' over the past year in harmonizing its foreign, security and defense policy with Brussels, especially in the area of sanctions implementation against Russia, Belarus and Iran. The report notes that Georgia is now experiencing 'extreme polarization,' while blaming Georgian Dream for creating an 'increasingly hostile environment' for those who question government policies. Another area of particular concern outlined in the report was gender and minority rights. It stressed that the legal definition of rape in Georgia does not conform with EU standards. 'Gaps in prevention and response to gender-based violence remain,' the report says. It also states members of Georgia’s LGBTQ community are living in a 'hostile and stigmatizing atmosphere' that is a direct outcome of 'legislative activities and the continued prevalence of homophobic hate speech.' Regarding the just-concluded elections in Georgia, the Commission report echoes the preliminary findings of international election monitors, saying that a variety of factors, including recent amendments to the election code and the use of intimidation to influence voters, 'negatively impacted public trust in the process.' The commission’s negative assessment of Georgia is brought into sharper focus by its praise for Moldova’s and Ukraine’s progress towards accession. A statement on the adoption of the EU’s 2024 Enlargement Package notes accession talks with Moldova and Ukraine opened in June, signaling Brussels’ 'important recognition' of both countries’ 'determination to pursue reforms.' 'This year, Georgia has gone backwards while other candidate countries have advanced,' said Herczynski, the EU envoy. 'Georgia’s next government should reverse course, recommit to democratic principles and values if it wants to bring the country closer to the EU.' Irakli Machaidze is a Eurasianet editorial fellow in New York.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1UAjpzy0NvCI	2024-11-02T16:47:57-07:00	
Indonesia: Five Unexpected Things Prabowo Did In His First Week A...	By Shailaja Neelakantan When Prabowo Subianto was sworn in as president of Indonesia on Oct. 20, he was coming off of five years serving as defense minister – a performance that earned mixed reviews. How would the former general fare as president, observers wondered, especially after he had unveiled a whopping cabinet of 109 ministers and deputy ministers, carving out two or three ministries from one to accommodate positions for alliance partners. But if anyone had expected a sedate start to the new Prabowo presidency, on account of new ministers in his large cabinet finding their feet, they were mistaken. During his first week in office, Prabowo and his ministers had a packed program and took actions that surprised observers, either in and of themselves or by their timing. Here are five such things that happened during the opening week of the Prabowo presidency: 1 - Did an about-face in Indonesia seeking BRICS membership: Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, Prabowo’s predecessor, had been hesitant about the prospect of BRICS membership, saying last year he wanted to study and calculate the pros and cons, and that joining the bloc was not urgent. However, during his first official trip abroad, new Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono conveyed the opposite while attending a summit of the economic grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. 'Indonesia joining BRICS is a manifestation of its independent-active foreign policy,' said Sugiono, who goes by one name, Reuters reported. 'That does not mean we join a certain bloc, but we actively participate in every forum.' Jokowi might have been wary that joining could be seen as Jakarta tilting towards Beijing, wrote Klaus Heinrich Raditio, at the Driyarkara School of Philosophy in Jakarta, in an analysis for The Lowy Institute. 'But Prabowo does not carry that burden. ...[Indonesia's] main aim is primarily in seeking development opportunities, rather than endorsing Russia’s or China’s views on the world order,' said the analysis. 2 - Announced construction deadlines for new capital: Prabowo announced initiatives related to Nusantara (IKN), the proposed new capital on Borneo island, within seven days of being sworn in, a move that would have surprised many observers who didn't expect much new direction in the project, or certainly not so soon. Many had believed the new president was not interested in continuing with Jokowi’s pricey legacy project, because his own priority program to provide free school-lunches was wildly expensive (U.S. $53 million a day). But Prabowo 'emphasized that the IKN issue is actually very clear,' Forestry Minister Raja Juli Antoni said on X last week. 'It has been decided that [IKN] will be continued and completed. There is no need for any more questions about it actually,' Raja wrote, referring to a speech Prabowo made to his cabinet at a retreat in Central Java. 'For him, the IKN is the ‘political capital.’ Therefore, in addition to the executive buildings (which are now almost finished), in the next four years the [Nusantara Capital City Authority] must complete buildings for the legislature and judiciary,' Raja wrote, citing Prabowo's directions. 3 - Retained previous government’s finance minister: Until around a week before he was sworn in, few believed Prabowo would name as Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, with whom he had several run-ins on the nature of his defense procurements, and other issues, when they were both in Jokowi's cabinet. Mulyani’s reappointment, though, would reassure investors and markets, wrote editors of East Asia Forum, an online publication of the Australian National University, in an analysis of Prabowo’s cabinet. 'With financial markets wary of Prabowo’s instincts towards government largesse, her presence in the cabinet will ensure strong oversight of public finances,' they added. 4-Signaled assertiveness on South China Sea to Beijing: The new Prabowo administration also quickly displayed some feistiness toward China during is first week. Indonesian ships chased away from Jakarta's exclusive economic zone in the North Natuna Sea a Chinese coast guard vessel on three occasions. The Indonesian coast guard (Bakamla) said it was repelling the Chinese ship that was 'disrupting' Jakarta's oil and gas survey activities. 'Bakamla’s expulsion of the Chinese Coast Guard vessel from the North Natuna Sea’s continental shelf is a clear demonstration of our commitment to safeguarding our maritime domain,' the Indonesian coast guard said in a statement. 5 - Showcased his army roots with military-style retreat for cabinet: Prabowo, a former general in the Indonesian army’s special forces (Kopassus), raised eyebrows when he transported his entire cabinet to a retreat at a military academy. The 104 men and five women in his cabinet donned camouflage uniforms and combat boots as they took part in drills intended to build team unity and discipline, participants said. 'I struggle a bit with waking up early since my usual routine involves going to bed at 2 a.m. and waking up at 5 a.m. for morning prayers, then catching some more sleep until 7. But here, that’s not possible,' Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said. 'We go to bed at 2 a.m. and have to wake up at 4 a.m. It’s a good challenge because it forces us to maintain discipline, and we must be prepared to fulfill our duties, even if we only get 1-2 hours of sleep.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1TSrnr1-fvTf	2024-11-02T16:46:47-07:00	
Bishop Defends St. Michael’s Prayer At Mass: ‘The Devil Has No In...	By Jonah McKeown Bishop Thomas Paprocki of Springfield, Illinois, this week responded to a letter in the Wall Street Journal from a priest objecting to the praying of the St. Michael prayer at the end of Mass, asserting that the priest’s view is 'simply wrong.' In a letter to the editor published Oct. 21, Father Gerald J. Bednar, a retired priest of the Diocese of Cleveland, wrote that the Vatican 'suppressed this practice in 1964 because the prayer interferes with the integrity of the Mass.' Bednar proffered his view that praying the St. Michael prayer after Mass 'ends the liturgy with a private devotion, a petition to a saint, while all of the petitions were concluded much earlier in the liturgy and addressed to God the Father.' 'The end of Mass sends participants out on a positive mission, bidding them to expand God’s kingdom through evangelization,' Bednar wrote. 'St. Michael is known as the captain of the guardian angels and we should, by all means, ask for his help. But believers should accept the Lord’s presence in the Eucharist as their primary protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil — and respond to his call to enhance God’s kingdom, where the devil has no influence,' the priest concluded. In a response letter published Oct. 27, Paprocki disputed Bednar’s assertion that praying to St. Michael after Mass 'ends the liturgy with a private devotion.' 'The liturgy ends when the celebrant says, ‘Go forth, the Mass is ended,’ and the people reply, ‘Thanks be to God.’ The prayer, then, is recited after Mass, which the priest and people are free to do. It isn’t a private devotion when prayed publicly,' Paprocki wrote. 'The end of Mass sends participants out on a positive mission, and while Rev. Bednar is correct in saying that the devil has no influence in God’s kingdom, we aren’t there yet. Doing so together doesn’t hurt, and we pray it will help to invoke the intercession of St. Michael to defend us in our spiritual battles.' St. Michael the Archangel is one of the four principal angels and is described in the Bible as a 'great prince' who battles against Satan in defense of God’s people. Following an 1884 vision of Satan 'running riot' on the planet, Pope Leo XIII composed three prayers to St. Michael, the briefest of which he commanded should be prayed at the end of every Mass. That prayer is as follows: St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil; may God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the divine power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen. The prayer to St. Michael was a regular feature of the Mass until the Vatican II era, though Pope John Paul II in 1994 urged Catholics to make the prayer a regular part of their lives. Devotion to St. Michael is still widely promoted today, including by Pope Francis.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1aL4tGz8p_DK	2024-11-02T16:44:19-07:00	
Does Russia Want To Increase Tension In BRICS? – OpEd	Just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China announced to much fanfare a 'no limits friendship' with Russia, suggesting a future of close collaboration in trade, energy and, perhaps most importantly, security. Now, more than two years into the war, the meaning and interpretation of this 'no-limits' commitment has evolved. There has been much debate in Chinese society in recent months about Beijing’s alignment with Moscow. While some have advocated for a more formal alliance with Russia, others have taken a more cautious stance. In sharp contrast to 2022, China’s growing wariness is increasingly being discussed in the open, even among those who were previously censored. In early 2022, for instance, a joint letter by a group Chinese experts opposing Russia’s invasion was censored by the government. The scholars were also warned. Now, however, it appears the government is seeking to balance its relationships with both Russia and the West. Beijing may not want to be seen as a 'decisive enabler' of the war. For example, the once-prominent 'no-limits' friendship language quietly vanished from a Sino-Russian joint statement. And Beijing’s response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visits that month was notably subdued. Putin ingratiated himself with Xi, saying they were 'as close as brothers'. Xi’s response was more perfunctory – he called Putin a 'good friend and a good neighbor'. Scholars are also articulating their concerns about China’s political and economic investments in Russia, both publicly and privately. Shen Dingli, a leading scholar of Chinese security strategy at Fudan University in Shanghai, said China doesn’t want to be seen as collaborating with Russia against Ukraine or any other country. He also quoted Fu Cong, China’s former ambassador to the European Union, who said last year the 'no-limits' [friendship] is 'nothing but rhetoric'. And in August, after Putin referred to China as an 'ally' during a visit to far-eastern Russia, Chinese scholars promptly sought to clarify this statement to prevent any misunderstanding China wants a formal alliance with Russia. These statements carry weight. In many respects, leading Chinese scholars at the government-affiliated universities act as propagandists to convey and justify the government’s stance on issues. As a result, subtle shifts in their commentary provide insights into the strategic mindset in Beijing. WHY CHINA IS RETHINKING ITS ‘NO-LIMITS’ FRIENDSHIP? There are three elements driving this re-evaluation of the Russia-China alignment. First, there is growing skepticism of Russia’s state capacities. The mutiny by the Wagner Group last year and Ukraine’s recent incursion into Russia’s Kursk region have prompted critical reassessments in Beijing of Russia’s political stability and military preparedness, as well as the growing anti-war sentiment in Russia. As Feng Yujun, director of Fudan University’s Russia and Central Asia Study Centre, argued, the Wagner rebellion was a reflection of Russia’s internal conflicts and domestic security challenges. He noted every time Russia has faced both internal and external crises in history, its regimes have become less stable. More recently, Feng has been even bolder, predicting a Russian defeat in Ukraine. He argued China should keep its distance from Moscow and resume a policy of 'non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-partisanship'. Second, China’s sluggish economy and its underwhelming trade with Russia have further exposed how dependent both countries are on the West. The relationship heavily favors Beijing. Russia accounts for only 4% of China’s trade, while China accounts for nearly 22% of Russia’s trade. Many Chinese experts are now warning against an over-dependence on Russia, instead calling for more cooperation with neighboring countries. This echoes a recent concern Russia has been using its natural resources as a bargaining chip to extract greater benefits from China. RUSSIA’S VALUE AS A MILITARY ALLY Finally, there are rising Chinese concerns its international outlook does not align with Russia’s. Zhao Long, deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of International Relations, says there is an important difference in how they view the world: Russia wants to destroy the current international system to build a new one. China wants to transform the current system by taking a more prominent place in it. Shi Yinhong, a strategist at Renmin University in Beijing, has highlighted an unbridgeable gap preventing a stronger China-Russia alliance. He says there’s a deep mutual distrust on regional security. Russia has never promised support for China in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, just as China has avoided involvement in the war in Ukraine. As Russia’s war in Ukraine reaches a stalemate, its value as a military ally is increasingly being questioned in China. Recently, Feng Yujun warned China risks being led by the nose by Russia, despite being the stronger economic partner. He says every time China has attempted an alliance with Russia in history, it has had negative consequences for China. Consequently, it is crucial for China to maintain its long-term partnership with Russia without undermining its constructive relationship with the West. Russia has arguably benefited from the current competition between the US and China, as it has sought to exploit the rivalry for its own benefit. But this has also led to uncertainty in the China-Russia relationship. As another analyst argues, relying too heavily on Russia will leave China isolated and vulnerable. And this is not a position China wants to be in. INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER’S VISIT FOR SHANGAI COOPERATION SUMMIT IN PAKISTAN Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar travelled to Islamabad for a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, while Canada accuses six Indian diplomats of involvement in threats and attacks against Sikh separatists, and Bangladesh’s foreign secretary visits Washington. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar traveled to Islamabad for a high-level Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit—marking the first time an Indian foreign minister has traveled to Pakistan since 2015 and the first time any Indian minister has visited the country since Defense Minister Rajnath Singh since 2016. During his roughly 24-hour visit Jaishankar participated in meeting and other activities with Pakistani officials present, but there were no bilateral engagements. JAYASHANKAR VISIT SIGNALS INDIAN COMMITMENT TO SCO That is no surprise: Jaishankar’s trip was intended to signal India’s commitment to the SCO, not to strengthen ties with Islamabad. Prior to his trip, Jaishankar said he wouldn’t do any one-on-one meetings with Pakistani officials. The visit comes a month and a half after he declared that the 'era of uninterrupted dialogue with Pakistan' was over. New Delhi’s position is firm: Until Islamabad deals with terrorist groups on its soil that threaten India, there can be no talks. India has doubled down on this stance since January 2016, when militants attacked an Indian Air Force base days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise visit to Pakistan—the last time an Indian minister traveled to Pakistan solely for bilateral reasons. That Jaishankar visited Pakistan despite these tensions reflects the importance that India attaches to the SCO. New Delhi values its membership in several monoliteral groupings—including the SCO, BRICS, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, among others. They enable India to amplify its support for multipolarity and reflect its strategic autonomy. The SCO is especially important for India because its membership and focus emphasize Central Asia—a region where New Delhi is keen to ramp up ties but faces an inherent constraint with its outreach. India lacks direct land access to Central Asia because Pakistan—itself looking to expand ties there—denies it transit trade rights. This elevates the importance of any opportunity for Indian high-level engagement with the region. In recent years, Modi has convened dialogues with Central Asian leaders to signal India’s commitment to partnership—and New Delhi sent Jaishankar to Islamabad to amplify that message. However, Jaishankar’s visit does show a degree of stabilization in India-Pakistan bilateral ties. The relationship plunged to a new low in 2019 following another terrorist attack in India carried out by Pakistan-sponsored militants, a brief military crisis, and New Delhi’s decision to strip Indian-administered Kashmir of its autonomy. But in 2021, India and Pakistan signed a new truce along their disputed border, easing tensions. CONCLUSION Today, China’s productivity is nearly double that of India. While 45% of Indian workers are still in the highly unproductive agriculture sector, China has graduated even from simple, labor-intensive manufacturing to emerge, for example, as a dominant force in global car markets, especially in electric vehicles. China is also better prepared for future opportunities. Seven Chinese universities are ranked among the world’s top 100, with Tsinghua and Peking among the top 20. Tsinghua is considered the world’s leading university for computer science, while Peking is ranked ninth. Likewise, nine Chinese universities are among the top 50 globally in mathematics. By contrast, no Indian university, including the celebrated Indian Institutes of Technology, is ranked among the world’s top 100. Chinese scientists have made significant strides in boosting the quantity and quality of their research, particularly in fields such as chemistry, engineering, and materials science, and could soon take the lead in artificial intelligence. As the figure shows, Chinese researchers, both in academia and industry, are rapidly generating high-quality patents. Since the mid-1980s, Indian and international observers have predicted that the authoritarian Chinese hare would eventually falter, and the democratic Indian tortoise would win the race. Recent events – China’s harsh zero-COVID restrictions, rising youth unemployment, and the adverse repercussions of the Chinese authorities’ ham-handed efforts to rein in the country’s overgrown real-estate sector and large tech companies – seem to support this view. But while China, with its deep well of human capital and greater gender equality, stands poised at the frontiers of both the old and the new economies, Indian leaders and their international counterparts tout an ahistorical ability to leapfrog over a fragile human foundation with shiny digital and physical infrastructure. China has a plausible path through its current muddle. India, by contrast, risks falling into blind alleys of unfounded optimism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfa6NqmJH2g1YgSnOpXlRK5	2024-11-02T16:41:25-07:00	
PRC Adapts Meta’s Llama For Military And Security AI Applications...	By Sunny Cheung In September, the former deputy director of the Academy of Military Sciences (AMS), Lieutenant General He Lei (何雷), called for the United Nations to establish restrictions on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in warfare (Sina Finance, September 13). This would suggest that Beijing has an interest in mitigating the risks associated with military AI. Instead, the opposite is true. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is currently leveraging AI to enhance its own military capabilities and strategic advantages and is using Western technology to do so. The military and security sectors within the PRC are increasingly focused on integrating advanced AI technologies into operational capabilities. Meta’s open-source model Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) has emerged as a preferred model on which to build out features tailored for military and security applications. In this way, US and US-derived technology is being deployed as a tool to enhance the PRC’s military modernization and domestic innovation efforts, with direct consequences for the United States and its allies and partners. PLA Experts’ Vision for Military AI The PRC’s 2019 National Defense White Paper, titled 'China’s National Defense for the New Era (新时代的中国国防),' notes that modern warfare is shifting toward increasingly informationized (信息化) and intelligentized (智能化) domains, demanding advances in mechanization, informationization, and AI development (Xinhua, July 24, 2019). AI development in the military has accelerated in direct response to the demands of intelligent warfare, which itself has been propelled by recent technological advances. Experts from AMS and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have highlighted several key capabilities that AI systems must achieve to meet the PLA’s evolving military needs. First, large AI models must enable rapid response and decision-making to enhance battlefield situational awareness and support command functions. This includes autonomous mission planning and assisting commanders in making informed decisions under complex conditions. Strengthening the fusion of information from multiple sources is also seen as crucial, using AI to integrate data from satellite feeds, cyber intelligence, and communication intercepts. This is then used to deepen intelligence analysis and support joint operations, as highlighted by the PLA Joint Operation Outline (中国人民解放军联合作战纲要), which entered its trial implementation phase in 2020 (MOD, November 26, 2020). [1] Military AI is also being applied extensively to cognitive and psychological warfare (China Brief, September 6, 2019; September 8, 2023; June 21). Generative AI models can be deployed to produce media content to influence narratives, conduct strategic influence campaigns, and undermine an adversary’s morale, according to AMS experts. [2] Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can also rapidly integrate diverse information sources to enhance military intelligence analysis. With strong language processing capabilities, they can simplify data extraction, support real-time translation, and transform complex data into actionable insights, aiding military personnel in decision-making on the modern battlefield. Experts within the military apparatus, including top defense industry players like the China Electronics Technology Group (CETC; 中国电子科技集团), are currently working on AI to enhance cybersecurity and network threat detection. One paper authored by employees at CETC argues that AI models can play a pivotal role in identifying and countering cyber threats and establishing robust early-warning systems to fortify military communication networks. [3] Another area of focus is predictive maintenance and supply chain management. Here, AI can be used to anticipate equipment failures and streamline supply logistics. This optimization is critical for the PLA’s sustained operational readiness, especially during prolonged engagements. PLA experts are prioritizing the development of smaller, more 'lightweight' AI models for deployment in resource-constrained environments like frontline operations. These models must be robust and capable of performing effectively with limited computational power, making them suitable for edge devices—small computers or sensors that can process data and operate without relying on distant servers. The Aiwu Large Model (艾武大模型) is a good example of this. According to one research paper, Aiwu offers cross-platform compatibility on both manned and unmanned systems, and can execute diverse mission tasks under challenging conditions. [4] PLA experts consider military AI to be a foundational asset that must be highly adaptable, capable of integrating multimodal data and supporting autonomous decision-making in a wide range of tactical and strategic contexts. This approach stems from the understanding that future warfare will demand intelligent systems capable of processing real-time data, making proactive decisions, and synthesizing information from diverse sources. [5] PRC Researchers Adapt Llama to Meet Military Demands The potential that PRC researchers see in Meta’s Llama model lies in the flexibility and efficiency of its foundational model. This makes it useful for adaptation to various military and security systems. [6] A recent iteration, Llama 3.1, was launched in July and was described as having 'capabilities that rival the best closed source models' (Meta, July 23). (Llama 3.2 was released on September 25, and so has not yet been treated in relevant research.) As an open-source model, developers and researchers can modify and innovate on top of it. PRC security researchers have focused on adapting it for multilingual dialogue, high-quality code generation, and complex mathematical problem-solving. [7] They argue that the transformer model—an architecture for deep learning models that powers text-generating models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Meta’s Llama, and Google’s Gemini—enhances performance in tasks such as information summarization, threat analysis, and decision-making support that are crucial for defense and public safety (ACM, December 4, 2017). [8] PRC researchers have also identified several limitations in Llama that they believe should be addressed before it can be optimized for military use. A primary concern is that Llama relies on open-source training data, which is largely general-purpose and lacks specificity for military contexts. [9] This leads to biases and limited domain-specific knowledge, particularly in areas of military strategy and security operations. In addition, the scarcity of comprehensive Chinese-language data restricts Llama’s ability to fully grasp linguistic nuances in Chinese-language communication, including the cultural context of specific utterances. [10] To overcome these challenges, PLA experts have implemented different techniques involving advanced data collection, computational techniques, and algorithmic improvements. These efforts have enabled Llama to adapt to understand Chinese-language military terminology and tactics Researchers Explore Techniques to Adapt Llama PRC researchers have employed a number of strategies to fine-tune Llama for military and security applications. One approach involves constructing domain-specific datasets, which includes gathering military-specific dialogue records, building data corpora from classified documents, integrating real-time operational data, and incorporating direct feedback from military personnel. [11] Other techniques include Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reinforcement learning, multimodal integration, and infrastructure upgrades. LoRA has become a crucial strategy for customizing Llama (MIT, May 1). LoRA enables researchers to build specialized models based on Llama—for instance, by adding additional matrices to existing model layers to adjust the model’s responses in a targeted way, thereby negating the need to retrain the entire model (which could be time-consuming and expensive). This approach allows the model to retain its core abilities while adapting to military-specific terminology, coded signals, and context-sensitive decision-making with minimal resource use. This balance makes LoRA suitable for adapting Llama to meet the demands of military applications. [12] Reinforcement learning involves fine-tuning models by reiterating training runs with tailored feedback to optimize responses. To further optimize Llama, researchers use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which involves presenting the model with examples of high- and low-quality responses, enabling it to learn to prioritize the former. Applied over a period of time, reinforcement learning allows Llama to adjust its responses dynamically and adapt to evolving situations. [13] Researchers have optimized infrastructure through distributed computing and hybrid algorithms to meet Llama’s computational demands. Certain techniques allow large AI models to run efficiently on devices with limited processing power by carefully reducing model size, memory needs, and computational requirements. For example, quantization compresses the model by using fewer bits per parameter, which saves memory without much loss in performance; while the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach activates only select portions of a model based on the specific task, so only relevant parts are engaged during processing, which makes computation faster and less resource-intensive (Researchgate, June). [14] Some experts have applied techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs to better align with human preferences in simulated environments. Specifically, RLHF helps models tailor their outputs to meet user expectations. In simulated military training exercises, this has optimized an LLM’s ability to perform scenario-specific tasks like decision-making and behavioral responses. This process also ensures the model’s alignment with specific communication and behavioral styles within these simulated contexts, enhancing the model’s realism and relevance for military operations. [15] Llama-Based Models Deployed for Predictive Policing and Electronic Warfare Experts from PRC’s security sector see Llama-based models as having huge potential to enhance smart policing (智慧警务). Specifically, these models could improve situational awareness and decision-making by streamlining administrative tasks and providing predictive insights to prioritize police responses. In theory, by extracting important information from reports, generating incident summaries, and classifying events, Llama can enable officers to focus more on handling emergencies in the field. Implementation of these techniques is currently being studied, for instance in Yueqing, Zhejiang Province. The model’s ability to process vast and various data sources, including social media posts, surveillance transcripts, and crime records, makes it an effective tool for proactive and data-driven law enforcement. [16] Experts from the AVIC illustrate the data flow and processing stages involved in training and debugging Llama 2 for military applications. In the military domain, Llama is being studied to explore the potential for LLMs to support electronic warfare and self-defense jamming strategies, including by experts from the Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC; 中国航空工业集团), one of the PRC’s top defense conglomerates. Integrated with reinforcement learning agents (AI models designed to learn how to make decisions by studying their environment and improving their actions to achieve a specific goal), Llama is used to implement a dual-level approach to maximize efficiency. At the strategic level, Llama determines optimal parameters for disrupting enemy radar systems, while reinforcement learning agents execute real-time tactical adjustments to counter adversary maneuvers. One simulation run by the AVIC researchers using Llama 2 as the base LLM demonstrated that this combined approach improved interference strategy reward scores by approximately 25–31 percent. In other words, the new LLM system led the agent to execute more successful jamming strategies and reduced ineffective actions. [17] Illustration from a paper by NORINCO researchers of a learning and optimization loop for training a Llama 2-70B. Experts from a science institute under the US-sanctioned China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO; 中国兵器工业集团有限公司) have been exploring the integration of LLMs, such as Meta’s Llama 2, into their computer-generated forces (CGF) simulations. From their perspective, these models can enhance autonomous decision-making, behavior simulation, and environmental adaptability. Strategically, LLMs process complex environmental data, enabling agents to make optimized, mission-aligned decisions. Tactically, they provide diverse behavioral scripts, allowing agents to execute coordinated actions and respond to real-time battlefield dynamics, including terrain, adversary movements, and situational threats. This dual-layered integration can create realistic simulation environments where agents autonomously adapt to dynamic conditions, thereby potentially improving PLA training performance and military operations. [18] ChatBIT: A Llama-Derived Model for Military Intelligence PLA-affiliated experts have been optimizing Meta’s Llama’s 13B model, which is based on Llama 2, for military and security purposes. This model, which features 13 billion parameters and a training corpus of one trillion tokens, outperforms GPT-3 on various benchmarks (Huggingface, October 28). The model was introduced by Meta researchers in early 2023 in the paper 'Llama: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models' (Arxiv, February 27, 2023). Image from a paper by AMS researchers demonstrating the training process of ChatBIT, which is based on Meta’s Llama. Using Llama-13B as a foundation, researchers from AMS have developed 'ChatBIT,' a model tailored for open-source intelligence (OSINT) and military dialogue tasks. [19] ChatBIT appears to be a powerful model, outperforming Vicuna-13B—another Llama-13B-based model developed at Stanford University that allegedly achieved roughly 90 percent of GPT-4’s performance—on military-relevant benchmarks such as BLEU and ROUGE that assess translation accuracy and summarization quality (LMSYS Org, March 30, 2023; Elastic, December 1, 2023). Comparative evaluations consistently suggest that ChatBIT outperforms models like Vicuna-13B on these metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in accurately interpreting nuanced military contexts and ensuring high-fidelity responses. [20] AMS researchers provide an example of ChatBIT outperforming other models on pertinent tasks. For instance, when asked about the United States Army Research Laboratory, ChatBIT delivered a comprehensive and accurate response detailing the lab’s focus on AI, cybersecurity, and drone technology. Vicuna-13B, the model it was tested against, provided an incorrect response. [21] Similarly, when tasked with explaining 'combat power contribution rate and combat effectiveness correlation'—metrics for evaluating weapons systems—ChatBIT offered an in-depth analysis, whereas Vicuna-13B only gave a superficial explanation. AMS experts argue that ChatBIT’s impressive performance in these tasks demonstrates its readiness for deployment in military Q&A, situational analysis, and operational support tasks. Conclusion Meta initially released Llama as an open-source model to support research and non-commercial use; however, the PLA’s adaptation of Llama to build models such as ChatBIT illustrates the problems of a trust-based approach to releasing technology into the global commons. Although Llama comes with license agreements that expressly forbid using the software for military purposes, these have proven ineffective in preventing the PLA and affiliated researchers from doing exactly that (Huggingface, accessed October 28). In practice, these restrictions act as 'paper tigers'—stipulations that lack enforceability and fall short of holding entities like the PLA accountable. The PRC has adapted Meta’s Llama for military and security purposes that are improving the country’s national defense capabilities. Through advanced techniques like LoRA, reinforcement learning, and multimodal integration, PRC researchers have transformed Llama into a tool to meet the intricate demands of military and public security applications. This work underscores the PRC’s commitment to developing AI systems that are integrated, adaptive, and capable of autonomous operation across diverse applications, from predictive policing to electronic warfare. Open-source LLMs like Llama can accelerate innovation and provide valuable tools across sectors, but they also pose risks if not carefully managed. Without oversight, such technologies can be modified for malicious purposes and used in ways that are contrary to developers’ original intentions. These technologies’ dual potential for both innovation and misuse highlights the importance of balanced oversight to maximize the benefits of open-source AI while mitigating risks associated with strategic misapplication.

Deciphering Turkey’s Africa Policy – Analysis	By Peter Fabricius President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Türkiye may not be quite ‘a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma’ as Winston Churchill described the Soviet Union in 1939 after its incongruous pact with Nazi Germany. But its foreign policy can sometimes be enigmatic. Last week, Türkiye was reportedly invited to become a BRICS member. How, many asked, does a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member join an association dominated by NATO’s only two identified foes, Russia and China? In Africa, Erdoğan also surprised friend and foe alike in 2019 when Türkiye intervened in Libya’s civil war to stop Khalifa Haftar from capturing Tripoli. Recently he has been trying to reconcile two of his closest African allies, Somalia and Ethiopia, who have fallen out over Ethiopia’s recognition of Somaliland’s independence in exchange for access to the sea. That mediation dilemma dates back to 2011. When countries were deserting Somalia because al-Shabaab’s terrorism made it too dangerous, Erdoğan visited the country to show support. He returned in 2016 to open an embassy. Conversely, he endeared himself to Ethiopia by supplying it with drones in 2021, which helped prevent rebel Tigrayan forces from capturing Addis Ababa. So in a sense that makes Türkiye a neutral broker – but the country is also perceived to be closer to Somalia, especially after it signed a new defence pact with Mogadishu in February. Erdogan is the master of surprise, of seizing opportunities. Erdoğan surprised friends and foes when Türkiye intervened in Libya to stop Khalifa Haftar from capturing Tripoli On the surface, his Africa policy looks quite orthodox. As a G20 member, Türkiye evidently feels it necessary to engage the continent as many other G20 powers have – for instance to bolster support in the United Nations. This weekend, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan will chair a Türkiye-Africa Ministerial Review Conference meeting with counterparts from 14 African countries ahead of the fourth Türkiye-Africa summit in 2026. This is part of a major outreach to Africa, which Erdoğan greatly boosted. Writing in 2023, former Turkish ambassador Numan Hazar noted that since 1998, the number of embassies on the continent has mushroomed from 12 to 44, while African embassies in Ankara have increased from 10 in 2008 to 38 today. Since becoming prime minister in 2003 and president in 2014, Erdoğan has visited 31 African countries. Total trade with Africa increased from US$5.4 billion in 2003 to US$40.7 billion in 2022. Türkiye’s overall investment stock in Africa, focusing on infrastructure, education and healthcare, totals US$6 billion. Turkish contractors have built 1 296 projects worth US$82.6 billion. Hazar points out that the late former South African ambassador to Ankara, Tom Wheeler, said Türkiye used its soft power to expand its influence in Africa, yet didn’t attract the negative reactions other countries faced. This could partly be because Türkiye didn’t carry any colonial baggage. This lack of any threat perception would be remarkable, considering that Türkiye has considerably expanded its military presence in Africa. As Ali Bilgic, Professor of International Relations and Middle East Politics at Britain’s Loughborough University, told ISS Today, ‘Turkey has made notable strides in realising its ambition to become a key economic, humanitarian and military power in sub-Saharan Africa. Establishing military bases, such as the one in Somalia, and training local forces have solidified its geopolitical presence.’ He notes that as Islamist terrorists have increasingly targeted West African states such as Niger, Togo, Burkina Faso and Mali, Türkiye has been selling these countries drones. Ankara seeks to engage with all parties, so Türkiye doesn’t have eternal friends or enemies, only partners ‘Turkey’s defence industry has grown significantly, with numerous contracts signed across Africa. For instance, Turkey has supplied Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ethiopia and Libya ... Additionally, Turkey has agreements to provide military training and equipment to nations such as Somalia, further cementing its influence in the region.’ Bilgic sees Ankara’s efforts to mediate the standoff between Ethiopia and Somalia as a ‘diplomatic balancing act motivated by Ankara’s strategic interest in maintaining stability in the Horn of Africa.’ However, the balancing act is becoming difficult as Ethiopia has expressed concerns about Türkiye’s deepening relationship with Somalia, particularly its military support, ‘which it perceives as a potential threat to its own security.’ This has postponed Ankara’s mediation efforts. Bilgic says Türkiye’s more assertive foreign policy has also strained relations with NATO allies and the European Union. He doesn’t find Türkiye’s potential inclusion in BRICS incongruous, despite its NATO membership. This instead ‘reflects Erdoğan’s multifaceted foreign policy approach. This move is not seen as an alternative to NATO or the West but as part of a realist policy where Ankara seeks to engage with all parties. This approach means Turkey does not have eternal friends or enemies, only partners.’ Erdoğan’s ambiguous approach is also evident in how he governs his own country. It’s ostensibly a democracy that holds regular elections. But Freedom House assesses Türkiye to be ‘Not Free’ – saying Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party had become ‘increasingly authoritarian in recent years, consolidating significant power through constitutional changes and by imprisoning opponents and critics.’ Africa has become a terrain of Erdoğan’s struggle against the moderate Islamic Gülen or Hizmet movement The recent death in exile of Fethullah Gülen, spiritual leader of the moderate Islamic Gülen or Hizmet movement, raises another aspect of the ambiguities of Erdoğan’s Türkiye. He and Gülen were once allies but fell out in 2011 when Erdoğan accused the Gülenists of trying to overthrow the government. The Erdoğan government also accused them of instigating the abortive 2016 coup – and branded them a terrorist organisation. Africa has also become a terrain of Erdoğan’s struggle against Hizmet, as the movement runs schools in South Africa, Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Ghana and Egypt, say Hizmet sources. Türkiye has pressured African countries to close Hizmet schools or detain its members, they say, and several have done so. This pressure has provoked tensions with some governments, including South Africa. Hizmet believes one of the motives for Erdoğan’s outreach to Africa, including aid and investment, has been to acquire the leverage to pressure countries to stifle Hizmet. Erdoğan has also been able to counter his regional Middle East rivals on African soil, like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which backed Hafter in Libya. And his increasing military support for Somalia helps block the UAE, which backs Somaliland. Erdoğan’s ostensible reasons for expanding Türkiye’s African footprint are no doubt genuine – trade, investment, humanitarian aid and national and regional stability. But it seems Africa is also a stage for him to pursue his ambition for Türkiye to be a global player.

Asia’s Economies Can Embrace Services To Boost Growth And Product...	The Asia-Pacific region prospered by becoming the source of more than half of global factory output, but another transformation to higher-productivity services has the potential to further support growth. Employment and production typically move from agriculture to manufacturing to services, as part of natural progression that comes with rising income. Today, many Asian countries—including China, Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand—are highly industrialized. If history is a guide, industry’s share of production will shrink as more activity passes to services. Indeed, the growth of services has already drawn about half of the region’s workers into that sector, up from just 22 percent in 1990, as hundreds of millions moved from farms and factories. This shift is likely to accelerate with further expansion of international trade in modern services such as finance, information, and communication technology, as well as business outsourcing (for example, as already done in India and the Philippines). By contrast, traditional services—for example, tourism or distribution services—have lower productivity and contribute less to economic growth. Policymakers should embrace this shift to modern services because they have higher productivity, as we show in an analytical note accompanying our October 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook. Transitioning to a more services-led economy comes with greater economic growth opportunities, provided the right policies are in place. Productivity is an important variable when considering which sectors can best deliver growth in coming years. Manufacturing productivity in Asia is already close to the level of global leaders, so further improvement offers only limited scope to boost productivity and growth. By contrast, services in Asia don’t enjoy the same efficiency advantage, so the region’s economies have more to gain by catching up with countries that have the most efficient services sectors. In addition, in several services sectors like finance and business services, productivity is higher than in manufacturing, which means greater contributions to growth. For example, Asia’s labor productivity in financial services is four times higher than in manufacturing, and it’s twice as high in business services, our new analysis shows. Even so, countries need to have the right conditions in place to benefit from services. Manufacturing benefited from low trade costs and greater global integration, but services sectors are relatively protected in Asia, which can hamper progress. Just like Asia’s higher tariffs on agriculture, which average 12 percent versus 7.5 percent globally, foreign companies that hope to enter the services sector face various restrictions. These include outright bans, approval requirements, local presence, and higher tax rates. Policymakers should also recognize that workers leaving agriculture and manufacturing need the skills to find good jobs in services. With waves of new digital technologies replacing some jobs like clerical support, policies should ensure widespread internet and technology access, and introduce education and training to develop a digitally skilled workforce capable of leveraging artificial intelligence. With growth projected to slow in many Asian countries due to rapid aging, boosting productivity by nurturing productive services is a key to Asia’s future success. —This article is based on an analytical note, 'Asia-Pacific’s Structural Transformation: The Past and Prospects,' included in the October 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook.

Navigating A New America: Harris Or Trump, Europeans Need A Colle...	By Célia Belin Every time America changes president, European leaders work hard at establishing a close personal relationship, only to lament when the pendulum swing of politics strikes again. This year’s oscillation feels particularly unnerving. Challenges to Europe’s security will be daunting if Donald Trump makes it back to the White House. Trump has promised to end the war in Ukraine in '24 hours', while his vice-president pick, JD Vance, has alluded to a 'peace plan' that appears more tailored to Russia’s views than Europe’s. Trump also said that Russia could do 'whatever the hell they want' to delinquent NATO allies, and some in his camp are pushing for reducing US participation in NATO to nuclear deterrence while pulling out all troops. This is a huge contrast to Kamala Harris, for whom the support to NATO is 'ironclad'. She has promised to continue supporting Ukraine and has repeatedly celebrated the importance of America’s alliances. Europeans will come up with somewhat different strategies to engage the new president depending on who wins. If it’s Harris, Europeans will extend good wishes along with aspirational goals. If it’s Trump, Europeans will focus on offering him quick wins and cross their fingers to get in his good graces. In both cases, Europeans are likely to elbow their way into Washington to try and become the president’s bestie and go-to European ally, including at the expense of fellow Europeans. They may engage in transactional bargaining – buying US weapons in exchange for security guarantees or supporting US policy on China in the hope that the United States reciprocates on Russia – and hope for the best. But this is the wrong approach. It dilutes the collective power of Europe, including that of the European Union, and leaves individual member states exposed to pressure from the US. In the absence of a meaningful pushback, Americans will continue to ask Europeans for forgiveness rather than permission, even if the policies of the new US administration run counter to European interests. As I argued in Foreign Affairs with Giovanna de Maio, Europeans need to come up with a collective plan to engage with the US. There are fundamental interests that all EU member states need to protect, far beyond the issue of the security of Europe. Together they need to be willing to defend and promote these interests, including when dealing with their greatest ally. It is high time that the EU drafts a strategy for engaging with the US, one that stands the test of time and presidential variations. This needs to be a group effort – consensus is key. Such a strategy can be drafted by the collective intelligence of EU institutions, but it needs to be supported by the leaders of EU member states and can extend to include close partners such as the United Kingdom as well as Ukraine and other candidate states. Such a strategy needs to tackle areas of vital importance – Russia, China, and the Middle East, but also trade, defence, climate, and technology. Regardless of who wins in November, Europeans will be facing a more self-interested America in the future. Despite vast differences between Harris and Trump, there are pre-existing trends that will affect US foreign policy. On Ukraine, the next administration will continue to be guided by prudence and fear of escalation. The conflict threatens European interests much more than American: as Washington looks for a negotiated solution, it may fail to consider the enormity of the consequences of a bad deal for Europe’s security. The US will also remain obsessed with winning its all-out technology and industrial competition with China and may force measures on Europe that will directly affect its prosperity. In the Middle East, unconditional US support for Israel does not lead to stabilising an increasingly explosive region. And, as the US leads the world in crude oil production, the need to finance the energy transition of the rest of the world is not its greatest focus. America’s priorities are shifting, and they will overlap with the EU’s less and less. Europeans must reckon with this fact and adapt their entire approach to this new, somewhat overwhelming reality. America’s shifting priorities also have direct consequences on the type of responsibility that Europeans must bear in the security realm. EU member states cannot afford to continue to delay the type of defence investments that are needed to pick up a bigger share of the security effort, both in Europe and beyond. It requires an ambitious plan to produce crucial capabilities that are now provided by the US. The EU needs to work on improving its synergy with NATO. And individual member states must continue to work to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, and other neighbours. Taking responsibility for its security while fiercely defending its interests will demonstrate the EU’s maturity and strength. It will allow the bloc to speak with one voice when leaders go to Washington, and to defend core interests in transatlantic forums such as the Trade and Technology Council or EU-US summits. It will also signal Europeans’ readiness to engage with the US, regardless of politics. Down the line, it can only lead to a healthier transatlantic relationship.

Promises And Perils Of The Future Made In Australia Act – Analysi...	By Marina Yue Zhang, Roy Green, and Mark Dodgson Australia’s industrial policy is undergoing a significant transformation with the introduction of the Future Made in Australia Act (FMiA). This policy aims to reposition the country as a key player in global supply chains, particularly in critical minerals, renewable energy and advanced manufacturing. It marks a departure from neoliberalism towards a mission-oriented approach, reflecting broader global trends over the past decade. Historically, industrial policies have been instrumental in supporting economies — such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and more recently China — catch up with the developed world. These nations have successfully targeted specific sectors with state-directed investments in technologies and capabilities, complemented by government-led export strategies. Major industrial nations, including the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, are adopting similar interventionist industrial policies in response to geopolitical competition. The United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) embodies this shift, offering substantial subsidies and investments aimed at reshoring manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly China. The European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act seeks to secure access to essential minerals for the green transition, while the United Kingdom is implementing policies to enhance its industrial competitiveness post-Brexit. These policy shifts reflect a collective aim to mitigate vulnerabilities highlighted by supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. They represent a break from the so-called Washington Consensus, which advocated for economic growth through reduced government intervention and trade liberalisation. Unlike these other industrialised nations, Australia’s FMiA does not incorporate significant tariff increases or protectionist measures. At the heart of the FMiA is an ambition to reduce Australia’s dependence on commodity exports and transition toward high-value-adding industries that are globally competitive and sustainable. The policy emphasises subsidising local manufacturing capabilities, particularly for the green energy transition. But scepticism surrounds the FMiA’s efficacy. Critics warn that while its intentions may be commendable, mission-oriented industrial policies may lead to unintended consequences, especially if they favour specific sectors at the expense of others. Investing in areas where Australia lacks comparative advantage might expose the country to external economic pressures and competition from countries with more cost-effective suppliers. This policy ultimately suggests a discontinuity with Australia’s liberal economic past, particularly the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s that opened up the economy and allowed its comparative advantage in commodities exports to flourish. One significant risk Australia faces is becoming ensnared in a global arms race of industrial subsidies. As the United States and China funnel billions into strategic sectors, smaller economies like Australia may feel pressured to keep pace. This could create a cycle of escalating subsidies that strain public finances, incurring considerable opportunity costs. A key difference between Australia and other developed countries lies in market size. The United States and European Union can sustain ambitious industrial strategies which can thrive on their extensive downstream markets. In contrast, Australia’s limited domestic market makes it heavily reliant on exports. As an upstream supplier of mineral products, Australia faces significant constraints in maintaining its export markets due to its reliance on high-value processing technologies and facilities, predominantly controlled by Chinese interests, before accessing downstream markets, where China controls a substantial share. This unique position in the global value chain limits Australia’s negotiating power and exposes it to geopolitical risks, particularly amid the ongoing rivalry between the United States and China. Aligning more closely with the United States may seem advantageous, but this strategy does not inherently enhance Australia’s competitive edge in mineral processing. US initiatives, such as the IRA, often stipulate that producers cannot exceed a certain level of Chinese equity to qualify for incentives. This underscores the complexities of navigating foreign direct investment in a politically charged environment. Australia’s aspiration to develop downstream processing capabilities is hampered by high labour costs and ongoing reliance on global supply chains. This could further entrench dependency on foreign technologies. Australia’s industrial policy has long promoted research and development through tax rebates and subsidies. During the resource boom, this led to innovation in mining extraction technologies that yield high returns. But Australia remains dependent on imports of heavy machinery and equipment, let alone mineral processing technologies. Compounding this issue, emerging competitors, particularly the BRICS+6 nations, are actively developing their own supply chains, leveraging both their mineral resources and China’s advanced processing capabilities and investments in infrastructure. The FMiA in its current form also risks increasing regional disparities, as resource-rich states and established firms may benefit disproportionately from subsidies, exacerbating inequality across Australia. This could create a scenario where certain regions thrive while others lag behind, particularly areas with fewer natural resources or less-developed firms. Australia must craft a more inclusive and balanced industrial policy that integrates both vertical (sector-specific) and horizontal (economy-wide) programs. The FMiA adopts a vertical approach by targeting sectors critical to national interests, especially in alignment with the interests of Australia’s allies. This focus is particularly important in addressing economic security and environmental considerations that the market may not effectively resolve. But it is essential to implement horizontal programs that foster a conducive business environment across all states and sectors. This includes improving infrastructure, enhancing workforce skills and promoting innovation. Investing in education and training, along with enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics and cloud computing, could help equip the workforce with the necessary skills and empower small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs to benefit from these initiatives. Above all, developing innovative strategic partnerships will be essential for sustainable growth and prosperity. Collaborative efforts with global stakeholders can enhance Australia’s competitiveness and adaptability in a rapidly changing global landscape. Australia must strike a balance between state intervention and market forces, particularly in addressing the energy transition. Relying solely on the government to determine which sectors should be the ‘moonshots’ is risky and may lead to unintended consequences.

Development Prospects Of The BRICS Mechanism’s Attraction For Reg...	By Zhou Chao The new BRICS Summit was held in Kazan, Russia, from October 22 to 24, 2024. This was the first summit since the historic expansion of the BRICS cooperation mechanism the previous year. The first BRIC summit took place in 2009, joined by Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The following year, South Africa participated and officially hence the BRICS group was established. At the Johannesburg summit in 2023, the group expanded again, inviting Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE to join its cooperation mechanism. After this expansion, the BRICS countries accounted for nearly half of the global population, over 30% of global GDP, and one-fifth of global trade, with an economic total, based on purchasing power parity, surpassing that of the G7. The theme of the summit this year was 'Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development And Security'. The main agenda included cooperation on the new industrial revolution, global governance reform, and the implementation of global civilization initiatives. Key topics were the reform of international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, to enhance the voice and representation of developing countries and emerging markets. Additionally, the summit discussed the establishment of a BRICS-led payment system proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin to compete with the Western SWIFT system, as well as the ongoing escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict. The summit concluded with the adoption of the Kazan Declaration, which emphasized strengthening cooperation after the BRICS expansion under three pillars: political security, economic finance, and cultural collaboration. It encouraged the enhancement of the BRICS network of correspondent banks and the implementation of local currency settlements through the non-binding BRICS Cross-Border Payment Initiative (BCBPI). The declaration also agreed to discuss and explore the feasibility of establishing an independent cross-border settlement and custody infrastructure, known as the BRICS Clearing System (BRICS Clear), to complement existing financial market infrastructures, with voluntary participation from all parties. The BRICS cooperation mechanism is currently the most important platform for solidarity and cooperation among emerging market countries and developing nations. It serves as a pillar for promoting a multipolar world characterized by equality and order, as well as inclusive economic globalization. Additionally, it is one of the key platforms through which China projects its influence to emerging markets and Southern countries, which carries significant expectations for China. This year’s BRICS summit was held in Russia, a country that has faced over two years of sanctions and isolation from the West due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Given that this was the first summit after the expansion of the BRICS mechanism, some Chinese commentators have high hopes for the summit, believing it will help further amplify the voice of the Global South, expand cooperation among emerging countries, and enhance their own influence and membership. It is evident that within the BRICS mechanism, both formal members and partner countries are primarily major regional powers with considerable influence. The inclusion of these countries will undoubtedly enhance the global impact of the BRICS mechanism. However, regarding the BRICS mechanism itself, its attractiveness to global regional powers appears to have reached a limit, making the potential for further strengthening quite finite. First, there are deep-seated issues both within the core member countries of the BRICS mechanism, as well as among the members themselves. In the case of Russia, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict has fundamentally revealed the limitations of Russia as a 'great power'. The struggles of the Russian military on the battlefield, along with the bleak prospects for its economy under ongoing sanctions, indicate that Russia's ability to provide regional and global security and economic public goods in the future will be significantly constrained. Moreover, the series of failures in Russia's economic transition following the collapse of the Soviet Union suggests that even if the West were to completely lift economic sanctions against Russia, the overall outlook for its economic development would still not be promising. In the case of China, since the lifting of its COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, the country's socioeconomic growth rate has gradually slowed, with consumer spending weakening and the real estate sector, along with local governments' massive debts, significantly dragging down economic growth. Despite multiple rounds of stimulus from the Chinese government aimed at boosting consumer spending and economic growth, there have been no significant results. Additionally, Western capital is progressively withdrawing from Mainland China and Hong Kong, while the U.S.-led technological and economic pressures on China continue. While China's fundamental economic situation is certainly much better than Russia's, the sustainability of its ability to provide economic public goods to regional powers is also in question. Between BRICS member countries, the profound contradictions between India and China will remain a long-term challenge. Before the BRICS summit, the Indian government clearly stated that it had reached a new border patrol agreement with China, but the specific implementation process will still require time. Moreover, considering India's strategic positioning and geopolitical interests, there remain anti-China geopolitical tensions in regions such as the South Asian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. Coupled with the significant investments made by the West to court India, India's confrontational stance toward China is unlikely to undergo any substantial change due to a thaw in border issues. Additionally, India's attitude toward Russia will continue to be characterized by pure pragmatism. As a result, there is no real cohesion among the core countries of the BRICS mechanism; instead, there are deep-rooted contradictions, making it difficult for this mechanism to effectively attract and integrate other regional powers. Second, the core countries of the BRICS mechanism have not truly outperformed Western countries in mediating regional conflicts. Last year, through China's careful mediation, Iran and Saudi Arabia reached a declaration in Beijing to normalize their relations, marking a significant step toward easing tensions in the Middle East. Following this, Iran promised to pressure the Houthis to cease their armed attacks on Saudi territory. In turn, Saudi Arabia seized the opportunity to improve its relations with Iran and intensified efforts to address the influence of Iran on various countries and armed groups in the region. Saudi Arabia resumed ceasefire negotiations with the Houthis and subsequently normalized relations with Syria, expressing support for Syria's return to the Arab League in 2023. Saudi Arabia also reopened its embassy in Lebanon and renewed contact with Iraq, signing a series of cooperation agreements in the fields of energy, investment, and infrastructure. However, the effects of these efforts quickly proved to be extremely limited. The Houthis began to delay the signing of agreements with Saudi Arabia, and the peace process in Yemen has been frozen for some time. Damascus failed to effectively curb the large amounts of drugs smuggled into the Gulf region, leaving the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Syria largely superficial. Lebanese political elites once again rejected Saudi proposals for systematic reforms and the revival of the state-building process. After the new Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia’ al-Sudani took office, Saudi Arabia perceived him as too close to Iran, resulting in a significant slowdown in cooperation with Iraq. In terms of relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia has expanded its engagement but has invited Iranian representatives to virtually none of the meetings it has organized regarding the Gaza situation since the special summit concluded. Additionally, while Saudi Arabia has sought to reduce hostility between Western nations and Iran, it has also collaborated with the U.S., Jordan, the UK, and France to intercept over 300 drones and ballistic missiles fired by Iran at Israel in retaliation for attacks on its embassy in Syria. Despite some improvement in Saudi-Iranian relations, a deep competitive dynamic persists as both countries strive for dominance in the Middle Eastern world. Neither Saudi Arabia, as a participant in the BRICS mechanism, nor China, as a key member of the BRICS group, has managed to consistently advance the de-escalation of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran or alleviate regional conflicts. In the perception of the Saudi elite, the view that 'the U.S. is unreliable but indispensable to us' has become a basic consensus. Therefore, Saudi Arabia is determined to maintain and even strengthen its security cooperation with the U.S., hoping to enhance its long-term self-defense capabilities through this relationship. Saudi Arabia is not only continuing to bolster its military procurement from the U.S. but is also willing to participate in the normalization process of relations with Israel under U.S. mediation. It can be argued that for many regional powers around the world, the geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China certainly provides these countries with greater 'united front value' and room for maneuver. However, this does not mean that their distances from the major world powers will align uniformly. For many regional powers, Western countries, especially the U.S., with their stronger economic and financial influence, often represent a more ideal partner for cooperation. For instance, countries like Saudi Arabia, a member of the BRICS mechanism, tend to gravitate slightly closer to the U.S. even while pursuing a policy of balanced diplomacy. Moreover, it is important to note that with Iran's accession to BRICS, the organization may no longer be viewed purely as an economic cooperation entity by other regional powers. Instead, it appears to have increasingly taken on an 'anti-U.S.' and 'anti-Western' character. Even in matters of economic cooperation, the concepts of a BRICS payment system and a common currency, heavily promoted by Russia and Brazil, clearly emphasize 'de-dollarization'. In this context, joining BRICS can easily be interpreted by the U.S. and other Western countries as a 'realignment', bringing with it significant political, economic, and security risks. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, both new and old BRICS members have faced economic difficulties in recent years, leading other regional powers to worry about being exploited after joining, which would be entirely contrary to their expectations. All in all, for regional powers, joining BRICS is aimed at enhancing their bargaining power with the West, rather than bearing responsibilities for others. It is noteworthy that recently, major regional powers such as Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan have expressed no desire to become BRICS members, and Argentina too made a similar statement earlier. Final Analysis Conclusion: The BRICS cooperation mechanism is an important platform that China has focused on developing to enhance its international influence and unite Southern countries. Over the past decade, it has played a significant role, and its contributions cannot be overlooked. However, due to a series of changing circumstances, it appears that the BRICS group has reached the peak of its attractiveness to regional powers, making it difficult to achieve substantial breakthroughs going forward. Therefore, for countries like China, a cautious attitude should be adopted regarding its future global influence.

‘Victory Plan’ Or Deadly Delusion? Zelensky’s Perilous Five-Point...	By Carus Michaelangelo It’s finally here: Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky’s 'Victory Plan,' furtively touted for weeks as Zelensky sought, unsuccessfully, to peddle it to world leaders. Until now, all that Zelensky would say in public was that this clandestine plan paradoxically would not require negotiation with Putin, but also provides a way to strengthen Ukraine in order to 'push Putin' to diplomatically end the war. Tone deaf in the extreme, several weeks ago Zelensky brazenly flew on a US Air Force C-17 transport plane into the key battleground state of Pennsylvania to visit a munitions plant before hectoring the United Nations General Assembly on this special plan. Election interference be damned! Blessed with Zelensky’s grand reveal of his vaunted five-point plan to the Ukrainian parliament on October 16, the tragic farce of the 'Victory Plan' sharpens into focus. Still shielding 'three secret' addenda from the general public, Zelensky’s top goal is as unsurprising as it is meretricious: an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. Zelensky hopes that NATO nations will grant Ukraine’s application for admission, which it submitted over two years ago. Ukraine’s Victory plan is little more than a Hail Mary. Why would NATO nations suddenly wish to jump headlong into the fray now, as Ukraine’s already-dim prospects admittedly vanish, which cannot be papered over even by friendly commentators? The patent absurdity of the Victory Plan does not stop there. Zelensky’s other four points involve: (1) unrestricted Western support for unrestricted warfare; (2) 'non-nuclear deterrence' to 'safeguard the country against future' Russian 'aggression'; (3) 'economic growth and cooperation,' which includes further Russian sanctions plus joint investment opportunities; and (4) a 'post-war security architecture,' in which Ukraine’s 'large and experienced military force' can help secure Europe. Zelensky seeks to unleash the Ukrainian military, hitherto shackled by arbitrary US restraints on long-range strikes into Russia. This invitation to nuclear war is bad enough, but he also seeks funds, arms, and intelligence from the West beyond the already-prodigious aid and comfort shuttled off these past two years. Additionally, this plank demands for Ukraine 'additional supplies of long-range capabilities,' asks for the West to take out Russian missiles and drones, and suggests further ground invasions of Russia to create 'buffer zones.' As Russia expands and lowers the bar for using nuclear weapons, Zelensky means to thrash about Russia like an elephant in a Matryoshka shop. Zelensky may feel as though Ukraine has nothing to lose—wrongly, since Russia’s prospect of wiping Ukraine off the map only increases as the war prolongs—but the West has everything to lose. If it stands, President Biden’s justified reticence to authorize long-range strikes into Russia could be the most consequential decision of his presidency. But the media has foamed at the mouth at this cold shoulder—notwithstanding new aid to Ukraine, repeatedly—so do not hold your breath. At first glance, Zelensky’s call for 'economic growth and cooperation' seems almost comical. In these dire straits, marred by death and destruction, what does Ukraine have to offer the West? The devil is in the details. Zelensky’s plan likely seeks to entice lawmakers like US Senator Lindsay Graham, who seek access to Ukraine’s stocks of resources like lithium, a critical mineral used in electric vehicle batteries. Yes, for some supporting Ukraine may be based on as loathsome a reason as securing cronyist exploitation of Ukraine’s natural resources. If you thought the Bush administration would be the last America saw of such contemptuous profiteering, think again. One is tempted to laugh were the situation not so enraging. In his October 16 address, Zelensky noted the grave consequences that would befall the world if we allowed the impression 'that wars of aggression can be profitable,' with new aggressions likely to pop up in 'the Gulf region, the Indo-Pacific region, and Africa.' All those things may well occur, but largely this will be thanks to US meddling, rather than the 'isolationist' phantom. Unfortunately, however, the establishment piper plays only one tune: 'Appeasement! Munich!' Apparently unironically, Zelensky also states that North Korea’s supplying of Russian with munitions and soldiers 'is effectively participation of a second state in the war against Ukraine on Russia’s side.' Surely he realizes that the US and many countries in the West were already belligerents in the war? Though the foolish depths of the Victory Plan seem limitless, Zelensky offers one silver lining. At least, for those who survive the possible nuclear apocalypse unleashed by his pyrrhic Victory Plan. Under his plan, Ukraine’s soldiers can replace US soldiers in select locations in Europe. Sign me up! Avoiding war was once the mark of the great statesmen; making peace, equally so. It will be a difficult peace for Ukraine to make. Admitting defeat is rare—for good reason. Many Ukrainians are coming to their senses, but not the most important Ukrainian. For the sake of Ukraine, and the world, one hopes Zelensky rouses from his war-fevered slumber. Hope springs eternal; but alas, so does vanity. About the author: Michaelangelo Carus lives in Virginia and has a graduate degree in history.

Bank Of Italy Governor Urges ECB To Cut Rates Further	By Alessia Peretti (EurActiv) -- Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta urged the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday to consider further rate cuts, saying the current restrictive monetary policy risks hampering economic growth. Panetta made his call at the World Savings Day event in Milan, sending a clear message to ECB President Christine Lagarde. The ECB’s aggressive monetary tightening following the energy shock has managed to curb inflation swiftly, but 'monetary conditions remain restrictive, requiring further cuts,' he said. Panetta warned that attention should now turn to the sluggish real economy. Without a sustained recovery, he warned, 'we risk pushing inflation well below our 2% target', a situation that would be difficult for monetary policy to address and should be avoided. 'The European economy remains weak, burdened by persistently high real interest rates and the withdrawal of past fiscal stimuli. The Italian economy is feeling the strain,' he said. In highlighting Italy's low growth drivers, Panetta also pointed to limited innovation capacity, underinvestment and a fragmented industrial base focused on traditional sectors - problems exacerbated by high public debt and interest payments. The ECB has enacted three rate cuts of 25 basis points each so far, with the latest reduction announced on 17 October. A strong voice on the ECB board, Panetta has consistently advocated for rate cuts, first raising the issue in his first speech as the bank’s governor in November 2023. ECB rate policies have repeatedly come under fire from Italian officials. Most recently, in September, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Antonio Tajani criticised the ECB's decision to cut interest rates by 0.25%, saying it was 'too timid' and that 'the ECB should do more.' 'I believe the founding treaty should be revised because it limits the ECB's role to controlling inflation, whereas it should also support growth and the real economy,' Tajani said at the time. Italian Business and Made in Italy Minister Adolfo Urso also joined the criticism, describing the cut as 'insufficient' and calling for 'an immediate change of direction.' Responding to the political pressure, Lagarde reiterated that the ECB is 'an independent institution, as stated clearly in the EU Treaty, and we do not respond to political pressures'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3G0w25waxoWd	2024-11-01T16:42:23-07:00	
What William Graham Sumner Would Say About Trump And Vance’s Tari...	By Kody Jensen William Graham Sumner (1840–1910) was a professor, sociologist, clergyman, and advocate of laissez faire, the gold standard, and free trade. His book What Social Classes Owe to Each Other was influential in the thinking of Leonard Read, according to Mary Senholz’s biography of the FEE founder. Whilst Sumner was a supporter of free trade, in more recent times Donald Trump has built his political reputation on being its adversary. How would William Graham Sumner respond to claims made by Trump and his running mate JD Vance about free trade in the recent debates? Let’s go to his writings to find a potential answer. The Great Free Trade Debate DT: 'First of all, I have no sales tax. That’s an incorrect statement. [Trump is responding to Harris characterizing his tariff plan as a sales tax.] We’re doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we’ve done for the world. I took in billions and billions of dollars from China.' Sumner observes that protectionists have always shied away from referring to tariffs as taxes. Consider these comments from his 1888 book Protectionism: the -ism which teaches that waste makes wealth: There are some who say that 'a tariff is not a tax,' or as one of them said before a Congressional Committee: 'We do not like to call it so!' That certainly is the most humorous of all the funny things in the tariff controversy. If a tariff is not a tax, what is it? In what category does it belong? No protectionist has ever yet told. They seem to think of it as a thing by itself, a Power, a Force, a sort of Mumbo Jumbo whose special function it is to produce national prosperity. They do not appear to have analyzed it, or given themselves an account of it, sufficiently to know what kind of a thing it is or how it acts. Any one who says that it is not a tax must suppose that it costs nothing, that it produces an effect without an expenditure of energy. They do seem to think that if Congress will say: 'Let a tax of —— per cent be laid on article A,' and if none is imported, and therefore no tax is paid at the custom house, national industry will be benefited and wealth secured, and that there will be no cost or outgo. If that is so, then the tariff is magic. We have found the philosopher’s stone. Furthermore: A protective tax is one which is laid to act as a bar to importation, in order to keep a foreign commodity out. It does not act protectively unless it does act as a bar, and is not a tax on imports but an obstruction to imports. Hence a protective duty is a wall to inclose the domestic producer and consumer, and to prevent the latter from having access to any other source of supply for his needs, in exchange for his products, than that one which the domestic producer controls. The purpose and plan of the device is to enable the domestic producer to levy on the domestic consumer the taxes which the government has set up as a barrier, but has not collected at the port of entry. Under this device the government says: 'I do not want the revenue, but I will lay the tax so that you, the selected and favored producer, may collect it.' 'I do not need to tax the consumer for myself, but I will hold him for you while you tax him.' DT: 'They aren’t gonna have higher prices; what’s gonna have and who’s gonna have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years' [when asked if consumers can afford higher prices caused by tariffs]. WGS: 'To this it is obvious to reply: what good can they then do toward the end proposed?' If the tariffs do not raise prices, how do they encourage the protected industries? No doubt it would be a neat trick if the President could force foreigners to pay more for US products while not raising prices for US consumers. However, I cannot comprehend how taxes on US imports will achieve this. JDV: 'Think about this. If you’re trying to employ slave laborers in China at $3 a day, you’re going to do that and undercut the wages of American workers unless our country stands up for itself and says you’re not accessing our markets unless you’re paying middle-class Americans a fair wage.' WGS: The protectionist says that he does not want the American laborer to compete with the foreign 'pauper laborer.' He assumes, that if the foreign laborer is a woolen operative, the only American who may have to compete with him is a woolen operative here. His device for saving our operatives from the assumed competition is to tax the American cotton or wheat grower on the cloth he wears, to make up and offset to the woolen operative the disadvantage under which he labors. If then, the case were true as the protectionist states it, and if his remedy were correct, he would, when he had finished his operation, simply have allowed the American woolen operative to escape, by transferring to the American cotton or wheat grower the evil results of competition with 'foreign pauper labor.' Can a tariff raise the general wage level? Sumner comments in this regard: Wages are capital. If I promise to pay wages I must find capital somewhere with which to fulfill my contract. If the tariff makes me pay more than I otherwise would, where does the surplus come from? Disregarding money as only an intermediate term, a man’s wages are his means of subsistence—food, clothing, house rent, fuel, lights, furniture, etc. If the tariff system makes him get more of these for ten hours’ work in a shop than he would get without tariff, where does the 'more' come from? Nothing but labor and capital can produce food, clothing, etc. Either the tax must make these out of nothing, or it can only get them by taking them from those who have made them, that is by subtracting them from the wages of somebody else. Taking all the wages class into account, then the tax cannot possibly increase, but is sure by waste and loss to decrease wages. One point both Trump and Vance raised was that apparently even Joe Biden agreed with protectionist ideas, as he did not remove most of the tariffs imposed by the previous administration. I do not know what answer Sumner could give to this ubiquity of bad economics, other than to glumly shake his head. About the author: Kody Jensen is a millennial who enjoys economics and chess.

Three Additional Points On The NY Times’ Piece On Blah Voters – O...	The New York Times’ lead homepage article Thursday told readers that in spite of a batch of really good economic data, 'voters still feel blah.' There are several points that are worth adding to the discussion in the piece. Prices Are Still High The first point is that the piece starts with an often-repeated complaint that, even though inflation has slowed roughly back to its pre-pandemic pace, prices are still high. This is an absurd complaint in the sense that nothing can be done about prices being high, as every economics reporter knows. Wages have risen by more than 23 percent since the start of the pandemic. Prices cannot return to anything like their pre-pandemic level with the current level of wages. We could have a horrible depression, which could eventually force wages down, but it is unlikely that many of the complaining consumers really want to see 20 percent unemployment. The profit share of income has risen by roughly 2.0 percentage points. The reversal of this increase could allow for some price reductions without wages falling, but it is more likely that we would see a slower pace of price rises even as wage growth continues at its current rate, rather than an actual drop in prices. In short, the complaint that prices are still high is comparable to people complaining that it’s cold in winter or dark at night. People might be bothered by the cold weather or the darkness, but there is nothing that can realistically be done about it. Unfortunately, because the media have repeated the complaint endlessly, they have legitimated it and made it part of the national political debate. This is a serious failing of economic reporting. Most Workers’ Pay Has Kept Pace with Inflation At one point the piece tells readers: 'Wages have climbed faster than prices for many consumers, but that is not true across the board.' That might leave the impression that wage growth in excess of inflation is the exception. In fact, most workers — especially lower paid workers — have seen wage growth that outpaces inflation. Wages for workers in the bottom decile of the wage distribution saw their wages outpace inflation by more than 12.0 percent from the start of the pandemic to the end of 2023. (The gap would be even larger with more recent data.) This is the fastest wage growth for these workers in half a century. China’s Growth is Considerably More Rapid Than Growth in the US At one point the piece notes that consumers are spending at a rapid pace, in spite of saying they think the economy is bad, and the US is doing better than other countries: 'Even if consumers say they feel bad in surveys, they have shown a willingness to keep spending, and US growth is much stronger than what countries like Germany or China are experiencing.' While the US economy has done significantly better since the pandemic than other wealthy countries, its growth actually lags China’s growth. While US GDP growth will probably come in at just under 3.0 percent in 2024, China is likely have growth of close to 5.0 percent. While China remains considerably poorer than the United States on a per person basis, it is not widely recognized that its economy is already considerably larger than ours. This gap is increasing through time.

Government Agents Try To Stir Up Fear Of Russian Election Interfe...	For a third United States presidential election in a row, US agents are out warning of Russian election interference. In the previous two elections the warnings were spurious. Still, the government agents succeeded in raising worry in people’s minds regarding candidate Donald Trump. And they suppressed consideration of information damaging to Trump’s opponents, including through indicating the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop were 'Russian disinformation.' This election, the government agents are at it again. Their latest spurt of relating supposed Russian election interference arrived in a Friday joint statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This joint statement is one among a series of updates concerning what the press release calls 'Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans.' Yeah, whatever, guys. Have you ever read the story about the boy who cried wolf?

How Would Harris And Trump Differ On Asia? – Analysis	By Alex Willemyns As the result of Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election teeters on knife’s edge in a handful of evenly split swing states, the rest of the world is bracing itself for two starkly different potential futures. One prospect is the return of former President Donald Trump’s turbulent 'America First' foreign policy, which last time around downplayed any U.S. obligations as a world leader to prioritize transactional bilateral ties with countries like China, Russia and even North Korea. On the other side of the ledger is the continuation, under Vice President Kamala Harris, of the last four years of President Joe Biden’s comparatively boring – if more predictable – style of alliance building and 'steady' diplomacy in the face of multiple world crises. While foreign policy is unlikely to sway many Americans’ choices at the ballot box – with domestic issues like the economy and the makeup of the Supreme Court outranking foreign policy in the eyes of voters – their choices will have the power to reshape global geopolitics. As one columnist put it, the future of the world 'may depend on what a few thousand Pennsylvania voters think about their grocery bills.' So how would a Harris or Trump administration differ on Asia? US alliances Led by Kurt Campbell, who is currently the U.S. deputy secretary of state, the Biden administration has spent the past four years attempting to 'manage' America’s rivalry with China by focusing on diplomacy with Beijing while building tight-knit alliances against it. That includes the 'AUKUS' pact with Australia and the United Kingdom, the 'Quad' arrangement with Australia, Japan and India and the U.S.-Japanese-South Korean 'trilateral,' even as U.S. diplomats have stopped short of supporting an 'Asian NATO aimed at China.' Harris has so far indicated she would take a similar approach, with Biden’s CIA director, Bill Burns, and one of the president’s top foreign policy 'confidantes,' Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, among the favorites to replace Antony Blinken as U.S. secretary of state. She has even used high-profile speeches to make the point. 'I will stand with our friends, because I know that our alliances keep American people safe and make America stronger and more secure,' Harris said in her 'closing argument' speech on Washington’s National Mall on Tuesday, exactly a week before the Nov. 5 election day. 'World leaders think that Donald Trump is an easy mark,' the vice president added, calling Trump 'easy to manipulate with flattery and favor' and claiming that 'autocrats' like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong 'are rooting for him' to win. Trump, by contrast, has spent less time detailing an orderly approach to foreign policy to instead argue that world leaders respect him more than Biden or Harris and that a personal touch will be what matters. Asked why Chinese President Xi Jinping would not invade Taiwan, for instance, the former president recently told The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board that Xi would be too afraid to carry out any invasion 'because he respects me and he knows I’m f***ing crazy.' Taiwan Harris has repeatedly reaffirmed the 'status quo' approach to Taiwan, a U.S. ally and self-governing democratic island that Beijing has called a 'renegade' province that must one day be 'reunited' with the mainland. That decades-old position holds that China and Taiwan must negotiate their future peacefully – an increasingly unlikely scenario as the years go on – and that neither should attack each other in the meantime. 'Let me restate the point I’ve made many times,' Harris said on Oct. 16, after Chinese military drills near the island. 'I believe in the ‘One China’ policy, and I believe … Taiwan has a right to defend itself.' Trump, meanwhile, has offered contrasting hints about Taiwan. While the former president has indicated he would discourage Xi against plans to invade the island, he has also attacked Taiwan’s leaders. In a three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan on Oct. 25, Trump repeatedly raised the island, at first drawing a link between Taiwan and Ukraine and noting that neither was invaded while he was president. 'It was almost the exact same conversation. I said, ‘Don’t do it,’' Trump said, referring to his conversations with both Xi and Putin. However, in the closing portion of the interview, Trump attacked Taiwan’s so-called 'Silicon Shield,' a term used to refer to the island’s near monopolyon advanced semiconductor-chip production, which has led to an intense U.S. interest in not letting the island be invaded. 'You know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business. Okay? They want us to protect [them] and they want protection. They don’t pay us money for the protection. You know, the mob makes you pay money, right?' he said, advocating for tariffs on all chips being imported into America. The comments were seized upon by Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, who gleefully told reporters it highlighted the untrustworthiness of America’s pledges to defend Taiwan. 'I believe most of our Taiwan compatriots have already made a rational judgment and know very clearly that what the United States pursues is always ‘America First,’' Zhu said at a press conference Wednesday. 'Taiwan at any time may turn from a pawn to a discarded child.' China and tariffs One of the few times Harris and Trump went head-to-head on non-domestic issues during their debate on ABC News on Sept. 10 was in their opening spar over their proposals for tariffs on Chinese imports, due to the likely impacts on the American economy. Trump has proposed tariffs of up to 60% on all imports from China, which Harris said would lead to surging inflation as Chinese exporters pass on the costs, tanking the American economy’s recovery. By contrast, Harris has called for fewer and more targeted tariffs. However, Trump disputed any such analysis about inflation – including from sixteen Nobel Prize winning economists – to instead claim that Chinese exporters would absorb the added costs while paying 'hundreds of billions of dollars' that could be used to cut taxes. 'They’re not going to have higher prices,' Trump said of consumers buying Chinese goods. 'Who’s going to have higher prices is China, and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years.' Harris has voiced support instead for sticking with the Biden administration’s comparatively more targeted tariffs on China, which are focused instead on supporting U.S. industry in competing with China’s low-cost exports of solar panels and electric vehicles. Beijing has repeatedly slammed both the proposals as protectionist and called for the United States to return to policies of free trade. Nevertheless, trade with China may be one of the policy areas where Harris and Trump are aligned the closest in principle. That is because American voters have come to see trade through the lens of 'where we’re positioned geopolitically,' and not through its impacts on the costs of everyday goods, according to Laura Silver, an associate director of global attitudes at pollster Pew Research. 'They don’t necessarily see trade as lowering prices and benefiting them economically,' Silver said at a forum on the election hosted by the East-West Center. 'China, in particular, is seen as a competitor, and so when it comes to trade with China, we are seen as losing.' 'This is a really salient thing in an election time,' she added. North Korea Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, has said that North Korea’s recent deployment of troops to fight alongside Russia in its war in Ukraine could be a defining moment for the next president, with the budding alliance threatening regional and global security. The prospect of Russia in turn supporting North Korea’s nuclear program 'imperils South Korea, Japan and deployed U.S. forces in the region,' Bolton said in an op-ed for The Hill on Wednesday, warning of an anti-U.S. 'axis' forming with China and Iran also involved. Bolton also predicted that Trump might once again seek to befriend Kim while tossing aside U.S. assurances to Seoul and Tokyo. While visiting Seoul as vice president in September 2022, Harris reiterated America’s 'ironclad' support for its alliance with South Korea and Japan against North Korea. On the campaign trail, she has also pointedly vowed not to 'cozy up' to world dictators like Kim. For his part, Trump has done little to defuse the claims from Harris and Bolton that he is a potential target of 'flattery and favor' from dictators like Kim, arguing in support of his personal touch in tense moments. 'I was with Kim Jong Un. I got along great with him,' Trump said on the Joe Rogan podcast, also recalling his 'great relationship' with China’s Xi. 'That’s a good thing. It’s not a bad thing. It’s a great thing.' During the podcast, Trump recalled how he had goaded North Korea’s autocratic leader into believing the U.S. military was ready 'to go to war' with him before parlaying nuclear threats into a friendship. 'He said, ‘I have a red button on my desk.’ I said, ‘I have a red button also, but mine’s bigger than yours and mine works,’' Trump told Rogan. 'I said, ‘Do you ever do anything else? Why don’t you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach. You have beautiful beaches.’' 'If you have a smart – really, the right president, the smart president – you’re not going to have a problem' with North Korea, he said. Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that the main takeaway was that Trump would place a great priority on personal relationships while Harris would likely maintain the Biden administration’s efforts at alliance building. 'That means an emphasis on the value of alliances and partnerships and working closely with them,' Chong told Radio Free Asia. 'Trump has indicated far more skepticism toward alliances and partnerships since his previous term in office, with key exceptions such as Israel.' 'Trump seems largely consistent in his rhetoric,' he said, 'which means a likely reconfiguration of U.S. alliances and partnerships.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3GXalCZp1-m4	2024-11-01T16:37:02-07:00	
Israel’s Attack On Iran Has Left Tehran Offensively And Defensive...	By Kian Sharifi (RFE/RL) -- Iran was quick to downplay the impact of Israel's attack on key military sites on its territory on October 26. But satellite images suggest Israel has degraded Tehran's air-defense and missile-production capabilities, analysts say. Fabian Hinz of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies said Israel had dealt a 'significant blow' to Iran's ability to produce long-range ballistic missiles. Ability To Sustain Long-Range Attacks On October 1, Iran launched its biggest-ever direct attack on Israel, firing nearly 200 ballistic missiles at its archenemy. Dozens of the missiles, aimed mostly at military sites, penetrated Israel's formidable air defenses. Israel's retaliatory strikes on October 26 were aimed at hindering Iran's production of solid-propellant ballistic missiles that were used by Tehran in its assault, the 'weapons that are of most concern to Israel,' Hinz said. Solid-propellant missiles require fewer personnel and little time to prepare for launch compared to liquid-propellant missiles, Hinz explains, making them ideal for launching volleys in quick succession. Israel struck missile-production sites around Tehran, including the Parchin military complex, the Khojir military base, the Shahrud missile site, and a factory in the Shamsabad Industrial Zone. Jeremy Binnie, a Middle East defense specialist at the global intelligence company Janes, says the full extent of the damage caused to the facilities is still unclear. But he adds that Israel likely wanted to prevent Iran from being able to sustain long-range missile exchanges, especially given the numbers it needs to penetrate Israel's formidable air defenses. 'The Israelis probably don't know precisely how many ballistic missiles [Iran] has with the requisite range, but have tried to reduce its ability to replenish is stockpile,' Binnie said. Blinded Offensively And Defensively? Israel's attack was also aimed at weakening Iran's ability to fend off aerial attacks by targeting its radars and Russian-made S-300 air-defense systems. There have been unconfirmed reports quoting U.S. and Israeli officials claiming that three S-300 systems were taken out in the Israeli attack. 'The S-300s are Iran's most capable air-defense capabilities, so targeting them again emphasizes Iran's inability to defend itself and gives the Israeli Air Force more freedom of operation in the future,' Binnie said. Satellite images also showed that at least two radar systems -- one in the western Ilam Province and another in the southwestern Khuzestan Province -- were hit. The radars are an essential part of Iran's early warning system, Hinz told RFE/RL's Radio Farda. Taking them out, he said, would mean Israel had 'degraded Iran's ability to resist any air attack even further, making it more vulnerable.' Fox News quoted a U.S. defense official as saying that the radars also had an offensive purpose, and have been used by Iran to track ballistic missiles after launch to assess their trajectories and course-correct if necessary. Binnie said that 'would be unusual but might explain how [Iran] has achieved a fairly high level of accuracy with its ballistic missiles -- though not good enough to do really significant damage.' Impact On Iranian Retaliation There are growing numbers of reports that Tehran is considering retaliating against Israel as the extent of the damage caused by the October 26 attack becomes clearer. Given that Iran has suffered damage to both its offensive and defensive capabilities, it is unclear if it can launch another large-scale attack on Israel, experts say. Binnie said the United States' deployment to Israel of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), an advanced anti-missile system, will further 'swing the balance in [Israel's] favor.' Media reports citing Israeli sources say that Iran is preparing to launch an aerial attack on Israel using Tehran-backed Shi'ite militant groups in Iraq. That would suggest the Islamic republic hopes its proxies will absorb the brunt of a potential Israeli response.

Sudan Crisis Escalates As Attacks In Al Jazirah Spark Mass Displa...	UN Secretary General António Guterres has strongly condemned escalating attacks by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan’s Al Jazirah state, as new reports reveal over 135,000 civilians were displaced in just 10 days. 'The Secretary General is appalled by the large numbers of civilians being killed, detained and displaced, acts of sexual violence against women and girls, the looting of homes and markets and the burning of farms,' said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric in a statement issued on Friday. The Secretary-General warned that 'such acts may constitute serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. Perpetrators must be held accountable'. Humanitarian crisis intensifies Speaking to journalists at the noon briefing in New York, Mr. Dujarric reported that the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has documented more than 135,000 people displaced from locations across Al Jazirah between 20 and 30 October. 'More than half have fled to Gedaref state, with nearly a third seeking shelter in Kassala state,' he noted. The UN aid coordination office OCHA expressed 'deep concern' about civilians trapped by the ongoing fighting as well as those forced to flee. 'As we have repeatedly said, civilians must be protected whether they move or stay, and they must be able to receive the humanitarian assistance they need,' Mr. Dujarric emphasised. Supporting displaced people In response to the deteriorating humanitarian crisis, UN agencies and humanitarian partners – particularly local organizations and volunteers – are providing emergency assistance to new arrivals, including family tracing, reunification services and mental health support. However, with hunger and disease spreading and half the population now requiring aid, the UN Secretary-General 'demands all parties facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians in need through all necessary routes,' the statement continued. Renewing his call for an immediate ceasefire, Mr. Guterres also announced that his Personal Envoy will 'continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders to de-escalate this conflict and strengthen civilian protection measures.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3M-9T5C7JsAl	2024-11-01T16:33:03-07:00	
Ralph Nader: Weakened By Its Past Cowardliness, The Democratic Pa...	Over the years, the Democratic Party’s blunders, arrogance and dependence on commercial campaign money and corporate-conflicted political/media consultants have put the two-party duopoly races for the Presidency, the Senate and the House next week into razor-thin elections. The polls show Democrats in neck-and-neck races with the worst GOP since its creation in 1854. The GOP is led by a delusionary, daily lying, violence-inciting, bigoted, misogynist, serial election denier, convicted felon, and wannabe dictator, Donald Trump, who can’t process information but has openly boasted that he knows more than everybody. The Party of the Donkey deteriorated years ago and opened the door to unnecessary close cliff-hanger elections. The Dems wrote off nearly half of the country (the red states) to the Republicans. This abandonment included the prairie states (North and South Dakota) and the mountain states that used to have many Democratic Senators. Now they have only three Senators from seven states. The next Democratic party blunder was not to support the National Popular Vote drive to overcome the Electoral College. (See: nationalpopularvote.com). This is the anachronism that cost the Democrats two presidential losses — one in 2000 and one in 2016 — even though the Democratic presidential candidate handily won the national popular vote. Third, the Democratic Party decided to robustly compete with the GOP and dial for the same business campaign cash in return for relenting from progressive policies. Fourth, the Dems lost the gerrymandering drive in 2010 when they were caught napping against a vigorous GOP drive to control key state legislatures like Pennsylvania and get more GOP members in the House of Representatives. What should the Dems do for the people in the next four days? Bernie Sanders is the most popular elected politician in the country. Why? Because Sanders, two-time presidential candidate, wants social safety net policies that are well received by working families where they live, work, and raise their families. He has urged Kamala Harris to authentically campaign to raise the federal minimum wage frozen at $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour for over 25 million workers, raise Social Security benefits, frozen for over 50 years for over 60 million elderly, and raise taxes on the undertaxed wealthy and big corporations (for a hike supported by 85% of the people.) These three measures also appeal to many self-described conservative voters. So, what does Harris do? She does not campaign with the popular Bernie. She advertises heavily and campaigns instead with Liz Cheney who supported the war criminals Dick Cheney and G.W. Bush in their criminal invasion and sociocide of Iraq taking over one million innocent Iraqi lives and leaving that country in ruins. Liz Cheney, an avowed Republican opponent of Trump, is also a confirmed corporatist. Forgetting Sanders and heralding Cheney is not the way to turn out low-wage voters who make up a good portion of the expected 85 million eligible non-voters in next Tuesday’s election. Unable to adjust, the Democratic Party keeps pouring billions of dollars into the same mediocre ads showing Trump to be unfit for office. These repetitive video spots by now have reached diminishing returns, as a vote-getter. Almost everyone has already made up their mind on Trump’s deficiencies. The ads should shift quickly to overcoming an astonishing amnesia by a majority of voters who think they were better off economically under Trump’s term than under Biden’s. They have forgotten Trump’s closing down any efforts to secure full Medicare for All, enact higher minimum wages, and initiate enforcement efforts against corporate crooks squeezing money from the American people. All the while he was early mocking the oncoming Covid-19 pandemic and calling intense climate catastrophes 'a hoax.' His deadly delays regarding Covid led to the preventable loss of some 300,000 American lives and worsened the associated recession. The Democratic Party ads have been largely AWOL on this abysmal record while focusing expensively on Trump personally. Instead of aligning with worker unions and progressive civic groups working to benefit all people, Harris ogles up to big business bosses, thereby jettisoning media and video opportunities to be with pro-party groups with millions of members. Harris has learned little from Hillary Clinton’s disastrous loss to Trump in 2016. She continues to be supportive of the U.S. Empire and, despite more dulcet tones, is aligned with Bibi-Biden’s massive weapons and diplomatic engagement with mega-terrorist Netanyahu’s genocide of the Palestinians and now the Lebanese. She cannot even get herself to propose immediate peace negotiations over the Russian/Ukrainian war bogged down month after month with large casualties on both sides. These stands would separate her a little from Biden which would help identify her as her own person. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, running for the presidency in 1968, declined to break with President Johnson on the Vietnam War. Analysts believe that cost him in the tight race against Richard Nixon because many Democratic voters stayed home. There is still time to highlight Bernie Sanders’ protections for the people. There is still time to recognize the millions of midnight shift workers who do not see a candidate and would welcome recognition by Democratic candidates – local, state, and national. (See: winningamerica.net/midnightcampaigning). There is still time to pledge compliance with six federal laws being violated by unconditional weapons shipments to Israel’s war in Palestine. Backed by majority public opinion, she should strongly DEMAND an immediate ceasefire, entry of U.S. humanitarian aid trucks to the starving, dying innocent people of Gaza, and a cessation of the Palestinian Holocaust by the Israeli regime that has already taken at least 400,000 Palestinian lives, mostly children, women and elderly. If Harris doesn’t advance these policies, she’ll be telling people that she will just be an extension of the Biden presidency. These actions may not be enough to bring out the stay-at-home voters who in the past had voted for the Democratic candidate, but they have a higher probability than just staying the cursed course.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3CFuaWDhOyML	2024-11-01T16:29:46-07:00	
The October Surprise Is Here – And It’s Garbage – OpEd	By Graham J Noble Just in the nick of time, with October done and the 2024 general election less than a week away, America may finally have its much-anticipated October surprise. Who would have thought it would come in the form of a single word: garbage? A comedian at the massive Madison Square Garden (MSG) Trump rally joked about Puerto Rico being a 'floating island of garbage,' and days later, Joe Biden used that same word to describe Donald Trump’s supporters. There are several reasons the two comments are in no way similar and why one is so much worse than the other. And then there’s the spectacle of the White House and its media allies contorting into pretzels, trying to explain away, justify, or bury Biden’s incredibly ill-timed garbage comment. First, some perspective on the MSG routine of Trump supporter and comedian Tony Hinchcliffe is necessary. A few of his alleged jokes were off-color. The comic certainly came off as a man who has a problem with Latinos – but that could be nothing more than a matter of perception. His invitation to appear at the New York rally was probably a bad idea in hindsight. The Garbage Can-Can One specific wisecrack, however, sent the left-wing media into a frenzy. 'I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now,' Hinchcliffe told his audience. 'Yeah, I think it’s called Puerto Rico.' After bipartisan backlash against this joke, he took to social media to criticize people for having no sense of humor. He pointed out that he is fond of Puerto Rico and vacations there. It is very likely that, during a visit to the island, the performer witnessed firsthand a chronic problem Puerto Ricans have been battling for years – an issue that has been covered by the media. The US territory has been struggling with overflowing landfills and, as a result, with garbage strewn about the otherwise beautiful island. It seems clear that the comic was not referring to the people of Puerto Rico as garbage. To suggest otherwise is a stretch. Fast forward a couple of days to someone else clearly describing a certain group of human beings as garbage. During a campaign call to Voto Latino, which describes itself as a 'civic engagement organization focused on educating and empowering a new generation of Latinx voters,' the White House incumbent took his cue from Hinchcliffe’s quip about Puerto Rico. 'Donald Trump has no character,' Biden asserted. 'He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community.' Shortly after, he added: 'And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico ‘a floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something, I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know … or Puerto Rico where I … in my home state of Delaware. They’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.' There really is no alternative way to interpret that last sentence, though the White House communications people have tried to – in entirely unconvincing ways. Elements of the left-wing media are also circling the wagons around the lame-duck commander-in-chief. One news outlet even went so far as to reframe what Biden said. Politico reported, 'Biden, in a Zoom call with the organization Voto Latino, said ‘the only garbage’ was the ‘hatred’ of Donald Trump supporters who said such things about American citizens.' It was a sneaky way of reimagining what Biden said while avoiding quoting him verbatim. It is another in the almost endless list of examples of how far certain media companies will go to cover for Biden and Kamala Harris when they make misleading, dishonest, incomprehensible, or offensive remarks. One CNN panelist, Franklin Leonard, with a straight face, claimed that Biden only sounded as if he were denigrating Trump supporters because the president had a stutter when growing up. The White House attempted to alter Biden’s statement using a strategically placed apostrophe. The official transcript of his remark reads, 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s' – the inference being that Biden was referring directly to Hinchcliffe’s Puerto Rico quip. Everyone is familiar with Biden’s speech patterns, however, and his phraseology. This White House version of what he said just doesn’t fit the way the man speaks. When one also considers the number of times in past speeches that the chief executive has expressed his contempt not only for Trump but also for his supporters, there’s no credible debate about the words that came out of Biden’s mouth and what he meant. While the media continues to spin this as something other than what it appears to be, however, certain elected Democrat senators seem to have taken his comments at face value and are in the process of distancing themselves. Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, John Tester of Montana, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, and Arizona candidate for the US Senate, Ruben Gallego, all expressed to Fox News that they disagreed profoundly with the president’s comments. Donald Trump, on the other hand, wasted no time in taking advantage of Biden’s latest gaffe. At his rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Trump rode around – in uniform – in a MAGA-emblazoned garbage truck. 'I have to start by saying 250 million Americans are not garbage,' Trump then told the audience. 'My supporters are far higher quality than Crooked Joe and Lying Kamala.' The Not-So-Surprising October Surprise So, on the one hand, you have left-wing pundits, politicians, and their media allies getting into a frenzy over a comedian cracking a joke about a geographical area being an island of garbage. On the other, these very same supposedly outraged people are making excuses for someone on their side describing practically half of all Americans as garbage. It appears that, for some, the moral compass is spinning wildly. The next couple of days will reveal whether this was, indeed, the October surprise everyone had been expecting but that no one had on their bingo card. There is one other point to be made about this latest battle over words. The relative positions of power and influence occupied by the speakers of contentious remarks determine how much gravity is added to the words spoken. As Mark Angelides, Liberty Nation’s editor-in-chief, points out: 'It is worth making a delineation. Tony Hinchcliffe is a comedian whose job is to be edgy and make jokes. Jokes are not necessarily reflective of the performer’s opinion – less reflective of the person whose name is on the top ticket [Trump]. Joe Biden, on the other hand, is not only the president of the United States, but he is also Kamala’s boss and, presumably, her most significant surrogate.' Was Biden’s comment about Trump supporters the October surprise, then? In general, one would define this mysterious but widely anticipated phenomenon as an unexpected event significant enough to potentially swing an election decisively in one direction or the other. Biden made the remark just as Harris – his vice president – was about to make her final case to the nation for her own White House bid. By doing so, he overshadowed her address and stole the media spotlight. Any bump Harris might have received post-speech was likely erased. Factor in the number of people who, in both 2016 and 2020, asserted they could not vote for Trump because of his rhetoric, his insults, and his famously mean tweets. Now add to the equation a sitting president effectively suggesting that everyone who votes – or has voted – for the 45th president is garbage. One could certainly argue the badly timed and decidedly ill-conceived remark meets the criteria for an October surprise.

North Korea Pledges Support To Russia ‘Until Victory’ In Ukraine	North Korea’s foreign minister Friday pledged to support Russia 'until it achieves victory' in its war against Ukraine, during a visit to Moscow as some 8,000 North Korean troops are reportedly poised to join Russian troops on the battlefield. Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui held talks with her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. As cameras rolled after their meeting, each praised the new levels that the relationship between the two nations has reached. The North Korean top diplomat accused the United States and South Korea of a military build-up and war provocations, and praised Russia’s efforts to put an end to 'hegemonic practices of the U.S. and the West and to establish a new international order.' She said the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has unwavering faith that Russia will achieve victory and said her country will stand with them until that victory is achieved. Lavrov expressed Russia’s gratitude for its Korean friends and for their 'principled' position regarding 'the events that have now unfolded in Ukraine,' and praised the 'very close contacts' that 'have been established between the military of the two countries.' Neither diplomat made any direct reference to North Korean troops being deployed in the region. Speaking Friday in Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a joint briefing with his South Korean counterpart it is believed at least 10,000 North Korean troops are set to be deployed to the region, with about 8,000 of them already in Russia’s Kursk oblast. At the same news conference, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. expects North Korean troops to enter the war against Ukraine in the coming days. More than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022, U.S. officials said, adding that Russia is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. In an interview with Estonia’s public broadcaster ERR Friday, Estonian Defense Forces intelligence chief Colonel Ants Kiviselg said he thinks North Korean troops are likely to suffer heavy losses, potentially even more than the Russians. He said they are not familiar with or trained for combat in the region’s terrain, climate or geography. Also Friday, the U.S. Defense Department, or DOD, announced an additional $425 million in security assistance for Ukraine. It is the 69th tranche of equipment to be provided from DOD inventories for Ukraine since August of 2021. In a statement, the department said the defense package will provide Ukraine with assets to help the country meet some of its most urgent security needs, including air defense interceptors, munitions for rocket systems and artillery, armored vehicles and anti-tank weapons. The statement said the United States will continue to work together with some 50 allies and partners through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and its associated capability coalitions to meet Ukraine's urgently needed battlefield requirements and defend against Russian aggression. Meanwhile, Kyiv’s military reported Friday that Russia launched 2,023 drone attacks on Ukraine in October, the most since the war began. The report said that the total is nearly 700 higher than the number of attacks launched in September, the month with the previous record for drone attacks. The report said Russia has launched 6,987 since the beginning of 2024. Earlier Friday, Russia's Defense Ministry reported its defenses shot down 83 Ukrainian drones over six regions early on Friday. In a statement posted to its Telegram social media channel, the ministry said, '36 drones were shot down over the Kursk region, 20 over the Bryansk region, 12 over Crimea, eight over the Voronezh region, four over the Oryol region, and three over the Belgorod region.' Separately, Aleksandr Bogomaz, the governor of Bryansk, said one person was wounded when a Ukrainian drone crashed into an apartment building in the city of Bryansk. In the Stavropol region, a drone fell on an oil depot in the city of Svetlograd, regional Governor Vladimir Vladimirov said on Telegram. In Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa, a Russian missile struck a fire station, wounding two firefighters, regional Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air force said its defenses shot down 31 Russian drones and one missile over nine regions — Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Vinnytsya, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Chernihiv and Poltava.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3Eo5ujm5ZI0e	2024-11-01T16:26:14-07:00	
Moscow Struggles To Find Allies For Ukraine War – Analysis	By Luke Coffey The BRICS summit in Kazan last week was intended to signal to the international community — and particularly the West — that Russia remains influential and far from isolated by its war on Ukraine, but the outcomes for Moscow were mixed. The BRICS countries could not come to a unified stance on Ukraine. Their final declaration briefly stated: 'We recall national positions concerning the situation in and around Ukraine,' and 'all states should act consistently with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter in their entirety and interrelation.' This minimal mention of Ukraine, coupled with a general nod to the UN Charter, exposed the divisions within BRICS on this key issue. Ukraine remains Russia’s most pressing national security and foreign policy concern. As both summit host and BRICS president, Russia aimed to forge a unified front on the conflict. But the failure to gain consensus was a major diplomatic setback, emphasizing the challenges Russia faces in reconciling the diverse and often divergent interests within BRICS. Given the varied political landscapes of its member countries, the lack of consensus on Ukraine should not be surprising. BRICS brings together nations with longstanding regional rivalries and conflicting global perspectives. For instance, relations between China and India remain tense over their unresolved border. Iran and the UAE often find themselves on opposite sides of issues in the Gulf, while Egypt and Ethiopia are frequently at odds over regional concerns, particularly the Nile’s water resources. These differences mean that reaching alignment on controversial issues, especially those as complex as Ukraine, is challenging at best. For some BRICS members, such as Russia and China, the group offers a way to establish an alternative to what they view as a G7 and West-dominated global system. They see BRICS as a counterbalance to perceived Western hegemony, providing a space to challenge established norms and build influence. However, other BRICS members view their participation as supplementary to their relationships with the West rather than a replacement. These countries seek balanced engagement on several fronts, prioritizing economic cooperation and stability without necessarily subscribing to an anti-Western stance. This split in purpose and perspective makes it difficult to achieve unified action within BRICS on divisive issues such as Ukraine. This reflects broader international divides on the conflict. Within Europe, attitudes toward the war are mixed, and signs of war fatigue are emerging. In many European states, parties on both the far left and far right are calling for reduced aid to Ukraine. Leaders in Hungary and Slovakia, for example, have publicly questioned the wisdom of continued support, calling instead for territorial concessions to Russia in the interest of a negotiated peace. This lack of unity among NATO members was evident at the alliance’s Washington summit in July, when high hopes for a clear path to membership for Ukraine went unmet. The war in Ukraine is also a significant point of division in the US, where the two leading presidential candidates hold opposing views. Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed a firm stance in support of Ukraine, although she has not indicated that her approach would differ significantly from the policy of the Biden administration. On the other hand, former President Donald Trump has suggested he could negotiate a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, which would probably involve Ukraine ceding territory and agreeing to remain outside NATO and the EU. As each country formulates its own policy, certain foundational truths must remain central. When Ukraine declared independence in 1991, its borders — including Crimea — were internationally recognized, including by Russia. This underscores why Russia has struggled to find support for its war outside a small group of allies such as North Korea, Iran, and Belarus. Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in the 1990s with assurances from Russia and the international community that its borders would be respected. Since then, Ukraine has consistently adhered to its obligations under the UN Charter, making it essential that any resolution to the conflict respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity and aligns with international law. As the situation continues to evolve, shifts in political leadership across the globe could alter the support landscape for Ukraine. The US election will lead to a new administration, and possibly a change in policy on Ukraine. Additionally, several European countries are preparing for elections, and shifting public opinion could usher in governments less inclined to support Ukraine. Meanwhile Russia continues to use platforms such as BRICS to advance its agenda and assert its relevance on the global stage, though the summit highlighted the limitations of this approach. The path forward remains uncertain. The inability of BRICS to agree on Ukraine reflects a broader, fractured global response to the conflict, a reality that Ukraine and its allies must navigate carefully in the months ahead.

Lebanon PM Says Expanded Strikes Suggest Israel Rejects Truce	By Najia Houssari Israel bombarded the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday as caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati accused it of 'stubbornness' in negotiations. Israeli attacks came amid stalled talks by two US envoys in Israel in an attempt to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon. Mikati reaffirmed Lebanon’s continued commitment to UN resolution 1701 and its provisions. Mikati said he believed that Israel’s 'renewed expansion of the scope of its aggression on Lebanese regions, its repeated threats to the population to evacuate entire cities and villages, and its renewed targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut with destructive raids are all indicators that confirm Israel’s rejection of all efforts being made to secure a ceasefire in preparation for the full implementation of UN Resolution 1701.' He said: 'Israeli statements and diplomatic signals that Lebanon received confirm Israel’s stubbornness in rejecting the proposed solutions and insisting on the approach of killing and destruction. 'This places the entire international community before its historical and moral responsibilities to stop this aggression.' Mikati denied the claims of two Reuters sources on Friday, which stated that the US 'had asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to inject momentum into stalled talks on a deal to end hostilities.' His media office said that the Lebanese government’s stance was 'clear on seeking a ceasefire from both sides and the implementation of Resolution 1701.' Mikati’s warning came as the Israeli Air Force carried out 14 raids against neighborhoods in Beirut’s southern suburbs after two weeks of cautious calm in the area. The raids affected Burj Al-Barajneh, Rweis, Haret Hreik, Hadath and the old airport road. Twelve raids targeted Baalbek-Hermel, causing further casualties, including entire families. In Amhazieh alone, 12 people died in a raid, most of whom were children, while a woman was killed and five were injured in a raid in Taraya, west of Baalbek. Three people were killed in Hrabta, while another was killed in Kasarnaba. Before the raids, Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee sent evacuation warnings to residents at about 3.30 a.m., which was followed by heavy shooting by Hezbollah members to alert sleeping residents in the areas targeted. People left their homes in pyjamas, carrying their children along the streets near the old airport road, one of the targeted areas During a week-long period of relative calm, many residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs returned to their homes, which were not affected by previous raids. The raids caused widespread destruction in these areas, which are considered by the Israeli army as Hezbollah’s security square, although the Lebanese consider the area residential. In a statement on Friday, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed concern over 'the impact of the Israeli operations on civilians and infrastructure in Lebanon.' Israeli strikes on the ancient cities of Tyre and Baalbek, home to UNESCO-designated Roman ruins, were endangering Lebanon’s cultural heritage, said UN special coordinator Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert. 'Ancient Phoenician cities steeped in history are in deep peril of being left in ruins,' Hennis-Plasschaert said in a social media post, adding that Lebanon’s cultural heritage 'must not become yet another casualty in this devastating conflict.' Her appeal came as Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said: 'Since last September, Israel has wasted more than one opportunity to reach a ceasefire, implement Resolution 1701, restore calm, and return the displaced to both sides of the border.' He underlined Lebanon’s 'commitment to implementing Resolution 1701 as the only option to achieve regional security and stability.' MP Michel Moussa, a parliamentary Development and Liberation Bloc member, said Berri 'has been informed that ceasefire negotiations have reached an impasse.' Moussa said Israel had shown no intention to negotiate, appearing to await US elections as a 'significant turning point.' During his meeting with US special envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israel 'is determined to confront the threats in the north. Any ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon must guarantee Israel’s security.' He added: 'There is pressure to prematurely achieve a settlement in Lebanon, and reality has proven otherwise. 'I did not set a date for the war’s end, but I set clear goals for victory,' Netanyahu said. 'We respect Resolutions 1701 and 1559, but they are not the main thing.' The Israeli airstrikes, which continued on Friday morning and during the day, targeted a residential apartment in the town of Qmatiyeh in Aley, killing three members of a family living there and wounding five. They also targeted dozens of towns in the south and northern Bekaa after the city of Baalbek turned into a ghost town as a result of renewed Israeli warnings against the return of those who were displaced from it. Israeli attacks on Baalbek-Hermel Governorate and Central Bekaa include 1,035 airstrikes, which have killed 528 and 1,069 injured people. According to a report by the ministerial emergency committee, the toll has risen to 2,822 dead and 12,937 wounded since the first attack by Israel against Lebanon about 14 months. Hezbollah MP Hussein Hajj Hassan estimated that about '60,000 people were displaced from Baalbek and Hermel, and the figure needs to be updated daily.' In a report on its field operations against the Israeli army, Hezbollah said that 'more than 95 soldiers were killed, 900 others wounded, and 42 Merkava tanks were destroyed' since the ground offensive began. 'Three Hermes 450 and two Hermes 900 drones were shot down. Israeli forces are trying not to move or change their positions in the fields, fearing being targeted,' Hezbollah said. The UNIFIL commander, Gen. Aroldo Lazaro, visited Mikati and Berri on Friday to discuss the ongoing military operations against Lebanon and the difficulties and threats UNIFIL faces while carrying out its mission. Mikati emphasized the importance of 'adhering to the role of UNIFIL, recognizing its importance in the south and not compromising its rules of work and the missions it is carrying out in close cooperation with the Lebanese army.' In Israel, sirens sounded in several settlements in the Galilee panhandle, coinciding with an Israeli announcement 'detecting around 10 rockets being launched from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted and others landed in open areas.' Hezbollah announced targeting 'Kiryat Shmona, Hatzor HaGlilit, Kidmat Tzvi, Yesod HaMa’ala and Karmiel,' and a group of soldiers near the Lebanese border town of Khiyam. Also on Friday, a 17th Saudi relief plane, operated by the Saudi aid agency KSRelief, landed at Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut, carrying food, shelter and medical aid, the Saudi Press Agency reported.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3OlP07Co6xSm	2024-11-01T16:22:20-07:00	
Russia’s Ambitious Economic Engagement With Africa Remains Symbol...	With renewed and full-fledged interest to engage in diverse economic sectors across Africa still largely remains full of symbolism and expression of policy interest. Russia considers the existing growth of neo-colonial tendencies as impediments for investment. Rather focusing on its own investment to showcase African leaders and elites within the context of current geopolitical developments, Russian officials are rather criticizing the United States and Europeans for the scramble for resources in Africa. Afrter the first (October 2019) and second (St. Petersburg, July 2023) summits, both Russian and African officials are still at the crossroads over concrete spheres of economic cooperation. The two summit declarations will now be reviewed and revised at the forthcoming first Russia-Africa ministerial conference this early November in Sochi, the southern city in the Russian Federation. Ahead of the conference, Dr. Gideon Shoo, media consultant and business lobbyist based in Kilimanjaro Region in Tanzania, explained in this interview what Russian investors and other participants can expect from the Kremlin, Russian political leaders and corporate business executives from the public and private sectors for subsequent collaboration with Africa. Following are excerpts from the interview: Africa Beyond Aid! What should African leaders do in order to raise mutual cooperation with Russia? Let us look at this question on the reverse side, from the African side. Gideon Shoo: African leaders must strive to understand their counterparts in Russia. They need to understand the political system in Russia, and at least, the economic policies and interests. At the same time, they need to demonstrate what they can do in terms of helping Russia overcome some of the economic hitches as a result of sanctions imposed on her by the United States and the European Union. They should engage in 'a scratch my back I scratch yours' relationship given the fact that Russia is advanced in technology which is badly needed in Africa. Russia has several bilateral agreements, at least, during the past decade, and including from the first and second summits that were largely not implemented in many African countries. In your view, what mechanisms be fixed to deliver on pledges and promises? GS: This is quite an important aspect of Russia-African relationship. Bilateral agreements need to be revised and schedules of implementation be drawn wherever possible. Russia needs to go back to those years when it committed itself to support Africa get out of neo-colonial cobweb by assisting in crucial and important areas such as education, public health and engineering. That was partly done through offering higher and specialized education as one way of development assistance to the continent. But time has practically changed, that Africa needs multifaceted investment in its economic sectors and to undertake critical infrastructure projects as an integral part of securing its economic sovereignty. Of course, priority spheres include energy, oil & gas, infrastructure etc., but what kinds of state support be offered Russian companies and enterprises to operate effectively in Africa? GS: Russian companies need to prove their superiority in the sector mentioned above. The companies should show how African countries are going to benefit. African governments must make it easier for Russian companies to set up and operate in their countries. Russian financial institutions can offer credit support that will allow them to localize their production in Africa's industrial zones, especially southern and eastern African regions that show some stability and have good investment and business incentives. In order to operate more effectively, Russians have to risk by investing, recognize the importance of cooperation on key investment issues and to work closely on the challenges and opportunities on the continent. Of course, Russians have been trying to return there over the past few years, which is a very commendable step forward. There are prospects for greater or broader foreign players. Until potential Russian investors make a decision to pay more high-level attention to Africa, it is difficult to see greater engagement at the economic or business level. In practical sense, it requires to move beyond mere expression of interests, it needs strategic focus and pragmatic approach from both Russians and African governments. According to official figures, Russia-African trade currently stands at $23.8 billion. Could trade preferences help potential African exporters (make it a two-way road) also to explore the Russian market? GS: Russia is, so far, a closed market to many African countries. It is difficult to access the Russian market. There are no direct flights to most African capitals, and it makes Russia not a common destination even to the Vasco da Gamas of Africa. While tropical fruits and vegetables are rotting in Africa, the Russian market is yawning because of sanctions. Why not work out a two-way traffic between Africa and Russia? African countries have to look to new emerging markets for export products, make efforts to negotiate for access to these markets. This can be another aspect of the economic cooperation and great business opportunity for both regions. Talking about Russia's presence in Africa and Africa's presence in Russia. Understandably, much also depends on the interest of African business-people; but what should be done to stimulate or boost potential African exporters' interest in Russia? GS: Visits. Visits. Official Visits. These official visits proliferate, to and fro African capitals and Moscow. But, how can this be achieved if there are no direct affordable flights? Can Africa and Russia establish links through joint ventures including those in aviation? Yes, I think and believe it is possible. Can Africa, especially south of the Sahara be a tourist destination for Russians and vice versa? Yes, it is possible. For instance, tourism can primarily help to broaden cultural horizons, breaking stereotypes and attitudes. Developing tourism is one way to promote business and raise knowledge of diverse culture in Africa. By looking at the rules and regulations, the situation about Russia's presence in Africa and Africa's presence in Russia can be changed. Russia and Africa have to make efforts for raising the level of trade and business in both regions. St. Petersburg and Sochi summits seemingly hold the key to all these questions you have so far discussed above. Can these, among others and in reality, mark a definitive start of a new dawn in the Russia-African relations? GS: In the first place, Russians and Africans have to look at this positively. It will offer participants the opportunity to engage in dialogue, receive up-to-date information on the current trends, challenges and prospects of investment activities as well as networking for business contacts. It is also important that African leaders determine and set their development priorities. Russia's policy is full of skyline symbolism. Interestingly, I think both St. Petersburg and Sochi summits have already been considered as new chapters in Russia-Africa cooperation, but unfortunately not as there remains concrete steps to take in determining where to invest in and what projects worth undertaking in Africa. It all depends on how serious Russian and African leaders together with summit and conference participants see it happen in practical terms. The first step, of course, should be a complete departure away from policy rhetoric, its hard time to act on policy decisions. In any case, the gathering has to offer the expected fruits, leave a long-term and sustainable impact and memories, and indeed, should open the door to Africa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceXvYbl_sl3EyOj3nC9F6r	2024-11-01T16:20:48-07:00
